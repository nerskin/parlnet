Mr OAKESHOTT
 (Lyne) (10:09):  On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I present the committee's report entitled Report 423: Review of Auditor-General's Reports Nos 39 2009-2010 to 15 2010-2011. 


The committee, as prescribed by its act, examines all reports of the Auditor-General and reports the results of the committee's deliberations to the parliament. This report details the findings of the committee's examination of five performance audits selected for further scrutiny from the 26 audit reports presented to the parliament between May and November 2010. These reports cover a range of agencies and identify a number of areas for improvement in administration including the decision-making processes regarding infrastructure projects, the transparency and accessibility of regional grants administration, the failure to achieve value for money in government procurement, and poor governance arrange­ments for key stimulus climate change programs.


Firstly, the committee reviewed the conduct by Infrastructure Australia of the first national infrastructure audit and the development of the infrastructure priority list. We were particularly concerned about the lack of transparency regarding decisions made by Infrastructure Australia. The ANAO found that published methodologies were not followed in determining the priorities list and that Infrastructure Australia did not provide clear advice on the factors influencing key decisions. While we note that Infrastructure Australia is not formally obliged to document the reasons for the council's decision, in the interests of transparency we urge the agency to improve its processes in this area.


Secondly, we were also concerned at the lack of documentation when we examined the administration of the strategic projects component of the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program. In this instance, we would like to register our dissatisfaction with the Department of Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government for its failure to provide clear published assessment criteria for the program. This disregard for basic grants administration practice led to a series of problems and as a result the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government did not receive clear recommendations regarding the eligibility or otherwise of applications from the depart­ment. However, we also note that, under the financial framework requirements, ministers are expected to obtain agency advice on the merits of each proposed grant before making decisions. This suggests that the minister should have taken the initiative to secure such advice. As a consequence of the lack of documentation in this case, there is no way for the parliament or the public to be sure that due process has been followed. While we accept the department's assurance that it has implemented relevant processes and practices to address the concerns of the ANAO, we expect to see the concrete evidence of improved performance in the future.


Thirdly, another long-term concern of this and previous committees is the lack of evidence that value for money is being achieved in Commonwealth procurement. Our review of direct source procurement only served to reinforce these concerns. Again, lack of documentation poses prob­lems by making it difficult to determine if value for money has been achieved. We found that there is a level of confusion over the Commonwealth procurement guidelines. We expect clearer, more concise guidelines as a result of the current review and a greater understanding and application of these guidelines as a consequence of these changes and of our review. We have made a number of recommendations aimed at assisting departments to streamline processes and encourage competency in this area.


Finally, we turned our attention to the green loans and home insulation programs. We recognise that both of these programs have been the subject of a number of reviews and consequently we saw our primary role as identifying the lessons learned from the implementation and delivery of both programs. We were particularly concerned by the inadequacy of governance arrange­ments and the quality of advice provided to ministers. We acknowledge the difficulties caused by tight implementation timeframes, but this does not excuse the lack of executive oversight or the underestimation of key program risks.


The issues identified in this selection of audits provide a number of areas for reflection for Australian Public Service agency executives and responsible ministers. Those areas include the need for higher quality advice by departments; increased documentation to provide transparency and accountability; better grants management; improved culture, capacity and supporting tools to ensure value for money in procurement; and adequate governance mechanisms for critical implementation programs. In the 43rd Parliament, it is important to emphasise the non-partisan con­clusions drawn from a committee involving ALP, Liberal and Independent members of parliament. I sincerely thank each committee member for the parliamentary spirit in which the work has been done. I also thank the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit secretariat for their ongoing diligence and I note their attendance in the chamber—thank you. I commend the report to the House.

Mrs D'ATH
 (Petrie) (10:15):  As Deputy Chair of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I rise to speak in support of the committee's report 423: Review of Auditor-General's reports Nos 39 (2009-10) to 15 (2010-11). The committee is responsible for reviewing all of the reports of the Auditor-General tabled in the parliament. The committee is responsible for reporting the results of the committee's deliberations to the parliament, and this responsibility is prescribed by the Public Accounts and Audit Committee Act 1951. Report 423 is the first report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit of the 43rd Parliament.


In reviewing the Auditor-General's reports tabled between May and November 2010, the committee sought to examine five reports in detail. The audit reports reviewed by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit are Audit report No. 2 of 2010-11: Conduct by Infrastructure Australia of the first national infrastructure audit and development of the infrastructure priority list; Audit report No. 3 of 2010-11: The establishment, implementation and administration of the strategic projects component of the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program; Audit report No. 9 of 2010-11: Green Loans Program; Audit report No. 11 of 2010-11: Direct source procurement; and Audit report No. 12 of 2010-11: Home Insulation Program.


Report 423, before the House today, is the report detailing the findings of the committee's examination of those five performance audits that I have just referred to which were selected by the committee for further scrutiny. As already stated by the member for Lyne, the chair of the committee, these reports cover a range of agencies and identify a number of areas for improvement in administration, including the decision-making processes regarding infra­structure projects, the transparency and accessibility of regional grants admin­istration, the lack of evidence to determine whether value for money is being achieved in government procurement, and poor governance arrangements for key stimulus climate change.


The role of the committee in examining these reports is primarily to ascertain what action has been taken or is being taken by the relevant agencies to address the recom­mendations made by the Australian National Audit Office's reports. The committee heard evidence from the relevant agencies on each of these reports to ascertain whether action is progressing at an acceptable pace and also whether such action is sufficient to address the issues raised within the Auditor-General's reports.


Firstly, the committee reviewed the conduct by Infrastructure Australia of the first national infrastructure audit and the development of the infrastructure priority list. The ANAO report found that there was a lack of transparency in relation to the decisions made by this agency. The com­mittee notes that Infrastructure Australia is not obligated to document the reasons for the council's decisions. However, in the interests of transparency in this area, we believe it should be done. It is acknowledged that work is being undertaken by the agency to improve its processes and that the recommendations of the Auditor-General's report were agreed to by the agency. However, the committee, consistent with the ANAO recommendation, has recommended that, in future, Infrastructure Australia provide clear and consistent advice on the level of funding and necessary conditions it recommends for priority projects.


In relation to the establishment, impl­ementation and administration of the strategic projects component of the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Prog­ram, it is acknowledged both in the ANAO report and in this committee's report that this program was developed in response to the global financial crisis and, as such, the stimulus had time-critical elements to it. Consequently, some of the errors and problems that we have identified and that were reported by the Auditor-General came about because of those time restrictions. Having said that, there was a lack of clear assessment criteria made available to the local governments, and this led to an oversubscription of the program. What is positive in relation to this program and the Department of Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government is that they have indicated that they are making improvements in this area. There have been assurances given and the committee has not made recommendations in relation to this area because of the assurances that were given to the ANAO.


In relation to the green loans and home insulation programs collectively, these programs have ceased but the department have given indications that they are implementing recommendations so that they will be able to deal with this better in the future. I believe more work needs to be done in the area of direct procurement. (Time expired)

Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (10:51):  Every day in Australia, firefighters—including those who are here with us in the gallery today—put their health on the line to serve the community. They put themselves in danger to regularly protect individuals, families, towns and cities from the threat of fire and sometimes pay the ultimate price in doing so. All members of the public have a deep respect for the service that firefighters perform on our behalf, as the immediate risks are very obvious and apparent for all to see. The longer term risks are often not quite so apparent and obvious but they are nonetheless just as dangerous. I hope that this bill will go some small way to remedying those very significant and real risks.


There is no longer any debate about whether firefighting increases the risk of cancer. Numerous studies, predominantly in the US but also in Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, have demonstrated very clear links between cancer and firefighting. The largest of these, the LeMasters study of 2007 in Ohio, was conducted over 15 years and looked at dozens of fire departments and over 110,000 firefighters. Though firefighters are generally recruited from the healthiest and fittest amongst us, studies have shown time and time again that firefighters exposed to many structural fires, rather than just a single fire, have a clear increase in the risk of contracting cancer. For example, firefighters start out being 20 per cent healthier than the average member of the public, but after five years the average firefighter will have twice the risk of contracting leukaemia and, after several years in the job, male firefighters can find themselves up to 10 times more likely to contract testicular cancer. Despite the best protective clothing and advances in technology and protective gear, firefighters in plastics fires will continue to be exposed to high levels of toxic carcinogens absorbed through the skin—and the associated increased risk of contracting cancer will remain the grisly reality.


There are around 70,000 synthetic chemicals in the average home and when they burn they produce a cancer-causing cocktail. No matter how good a firefighter's breathing apparatus is, their uniform must be able to breathe. Many firefighters will tell you of coming back from a fire—sometimes even days after a fire—and finding that the black, thick, cancer-producing smoke has found its way through their gear and into their open pores and into their skin. Other jurisdictions have acknowledged this. The overwhelming majority of states in the United States and Canada have dealt with this issue by introducing legislation to create the same presumption that my bill will create—that the occupation of firefighting is the dominant cause of the contraction of the cancer. In doing so, those states have made it easier for large numbers of firefighters to access workers compensation as a result. The last decade in particular has seen the legislation sweep from state to state in Canada and the experience of firefighters and legislators alike in implementing so-called ‘presumptive legislation’ across the country has been a very positive one.


The bill makes a very simple amendment to the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compens­ation Act 1988. It makes a small addition to part I of the act which, if passed by the parliament, will provide that if a firefighter has been employed for a certain period before being diagnosed with one of seven types of cancer the employment will be taken to have been the dominant cause of the contraction of that cancer unless the contrary is established. The cancers are those which have been identified by the relevant studies as being the highest risk to firefighters—these are most often cancers of those areas which are the filters of the body. The bill identifies seven key cancers which have been shown to have these clear links—brain, bladder, kidney, breast and testicular cancers, as well as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and leukaemia—and leaves open the option of the minister adding to the list by regulation, based inevitably on wider scientific justification of course. These provisions will be restricted to those firefighters who have been actively involved in firefighting duties proper and require firefighters to have served for a minimum number of years before being diagnosed with the relevant primary site cancer. The qualifying periods are different for each cancer and are justified, again, by the best studies available.


I do have another five minutes but I would like, with your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, and with the leave of the House, to now hand over to two other members from different political parties. I think it is a tribute to the lobbying work which has been done by the firefighters, many of whom are here today, that this is being approached in a non-partisan way. It is my hope that this bill proceeds through this place and ultimately through the Senate, with the support of all political parties.

Ms VAMVAKINOU
 (Calwell) (10:56):  by leave—I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Amendment (Fair Protection for Firefighters) Bill 2011 and I am very pleased to join both the member for Melbourne and the member for McMillan in jointly sponsoring the bill. I recently spoke in parliament at greater length about the need to introduce presumptive legislation for Australian firefighters, so today I simply want to reiterate my support for this very important issue and make the point that, while we all very often acknowledge the life-saving work of our firefighters in this place—and we have done it on many occasions—we also need to acknowledge the human cost that their profession bears on their health and wellbeing, as well as the cost to their families.


Presumptive legislation is a legislative instrument which stipulates the health risks directly associated with an occupation by identifying diseases or conditions that have been shown to be hazards associated with that occupation—in this case, the firefighting profession. Presumptive legislation is not without precedents. Presumptive legislation now exists in seven Canadian provinces and some 43 US states. Legislation is also now being considered in Europe. It is therefore time for this parliament to get the ball rolling on this issue and we do so today through the introduction of this private member's bill.


Scientific evidence, through international studies, has shown that there is a visibly higher rate of cancer related illnesses amongst firefighters than amongst the general population. Again, because the member for Melbourne has so compre­hensively referred to the LeMasters study, which forms the basis of the international studies, I will not make any further reference to it. I simply want to make the point that the conditions identified are not an exhaustive list of diseases but rather an evidence based list of those diseases which have been identified to have a direct link with the firefighting profession. The bill identifies the main cancer related illnesses which have disproportionate rates of incidence amongst firefighters when compared with the general population. That is a very important point to make.


This is an important and timely bill relating to a very important profession and I am pleased to be part of a process which brings this issue to the attention of the House. In doing so, I acknowledge the many firefighters who are in the gallery here today, keeping a very close eye on the progress of this bill.

Mr BROADBENT
 (McMillan) (10:59): by leave—I was asked this morning on Gippsland radio why I was cuddling up to Adam Bandt on this issue of fair protection for firefighters. Although Adam is not quite my style—Maria is more my style—my answer was this: this is not about Adam Bandt or Russell Broadbent or Maria Vamvakinou or even Senator Gavin Marshall, who has been very helpful in this regard. It is actually about firefighters, their families and their future. It is not about us; it is not even about the parliament. It is the process of the parliament, which the member for Calwell has just referred to, that is important. 


I commend the member for Melbourne, the member for Calwell and Senator Gavin Marshall for their support for this proposal. While I am doing that I want to commend all the firefighters who have gone before us. Recently we celebrated 100 years of the Firefighters Union in Victoria—a very important occasion. We honour those people who have gone before us and paved the way. This particular matter is about firefighters, their future and what they do for us. This parliament, rising above all other concerns, has to address the issues faced by a very specialised group in our community. If we can come on board with what has happened internationally and we can support these people in their endeavours, it is up to us as a parliament to go through these processes, investigate them and bring this legislation forward for the benefit of firefighters.


I am very proud to associate myself with firefighters right across Australia. Even as a 12-year volunteer firefighter I cannot identify what it is like to face the issues they face every day of their working lives. I wish them all the best and I hope this bill is progressed.

Ms VAMVAKINOU
 (Calwell) (10:56):  by leave—I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Amendment (Fair Protection for Firefighters) Bill 2011 and I am very pleased to join both the member for Melbourne and the member for McMillan in jointly sponsoring the bill. I recently spoke in parliament at greater length about the need to introduce presumptive legislation for Australian firefighters, so today I simply want to reiterate my support for this very important issue and make the point that, while we all very often acknowledge the life-saving work of our firefighters in this place—and we have done it on many occasions—we also need to acknowledge the human cost that their profession bears on their health and wellbeing, as well as the cost to their families.


Presumptive legislation is a legislative instrument which stipulates the health risks directly associated with an occupation by identifying diseases or conditions that have been shown to be hazards associated with that occupation—in this case, the firefighting profession. Presumptive legislation is not without precedents. Presumptive legislation now exists in seven Canadian provinces and some 43 US states. Legislation is also now being considered in Europe. It is therefore time for this parliament to get the ball rolling on this issue and we do so today through the introduction of this private member's bill.


Scientific evidence, through international studies, has shown that there is a visibly higher rate of cancer related illnesses amongst firefighters than amongst the general population. Again, because the member for Melbourne has so compre­hensively referred to the LeMasters study, which forms the basis of the international studies, I will not make any further reference to it. I simply want to make the point that the conditions identified are not an exhaustive list of diseases but rather an evidence based list of those diseases which have been identified to have a direct link with the firefighting profession. The bill identifies the main cancer related illnesses which have disproportionate rates of incidence amongst firefighters when compared with the general population. That is a very important point to make.


This is an important and timely bill relating to a very important profession and I am pleased to be part of a process which brings this issue to the attention of the House. In doing so, I acknowledge the many firefighters who are in the gallery here today, keeping a very close eye on the progress of this bill.

Mr BROADBENT
 (McMillan) (10:59): by leave—I was asked this morning on Gippsland radio why I was cuddling up to Adam Bandt on this issue of fair protection for firefighters. Although Adam is not quite my style—Maria is more my style—my answer was this: this is not about Adam Bandt or Russell Broadbent or Maria Vamvakinou or even Senator Gavin Marshall, who has been very helpful in this regard. It is actually about firefighters, their families and their future. It is not about us; it is not even about the parliament. It is the process of the parliament, which the member for Calwell has just referred to, that is important. 


I commend the member for Melbourne, the member for Calwell and Senator Gavin Marshall for their support for this proposal. While I am doing that I want to commend all the firefighters who have gone before us. Recently we celebrated 100 years of the Firefighters Union in Victoria—a very important occasion. We honour those people who have gone before us and paved the way. This particular matter is about firefighters, their future and what they do for us. This parliament, rising above all other concerns, has to address the issues faced by a very specialised group in our community. If we can come on board with what has happened internationally and we can support these people in their endeavours, it is up to us as a parliament to go through these processes, investigate them and bring this legislation forward for the benefit of firefighters.


I am very proud to associate myself with firefighters right across Australia. Even as a 12-year volunteer firefighter I cannot identify what it is like to face the issues they face every day of their working lives. I wish them all the best and I hope this bill is progressed.


Bill read a first time.

"Pyne, Christopher, MP",LP,2011-07-04,"



Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Manager of Opposition Business) (11:23):  I move:


That this House:


(1) acknowledges the importance of the role that non-government schools play in reflecting the diversity of Australian society and serving a broad range of students, including those from a variety of religions, social backgrounds, regions, and socio-economic circumstances; 


(2) supports the continuation of a funding model into the future that distributes funds according to socio economic need and which recognises that every non-government school student is entitled to a basic level of government funding; 


(3) calls on the Government to continue to support parents in their right to choose a school which they believe best reflects their values and beliefs, by not penalising parents who wish to make private contributions towards their child's education, nor discouraging schools in their efforts to fundraise or encourage private investment; 


(4) notes the many submissions made to the Review of Funding for Schooling by non government sector authorities requesting that changes to school funding arrangements not leave schools or students worse off in real terms; 


(5) acknowledges that any reduction in government funding for non-government schools would need to be addressed by increasing the level of private income required to be raised by the school community (such as school fees), or through a reduction in the quality of the educational provision in affected schools; and 


(6) calls on the Government to make a clear commitment to the continuation of current funding levels to all non-government schools, plus indexation, and for this to be the basic starting point of any new funding model resulting from the Review of Funding for Schooling process. 


The issue of non-government school funding is at the moment like a train coming down a tunnel for parents in non-government schools across Australia. There are 1.2 million students in non-government schools across this country, which means about 2.4 million parents who send their children to non-government schools. All of those parents are, and should be, concerned, the principals of non-government schools are concerned, and all the organisations representing non-government schools should be very concerned about the government's response to what the David Gonski review of non-government school funding hands down by the end of this year. If the government responds badly to that report, if it missteps on non-government school funding, there could be catastrophic impacts on the non-government school sector. If the non-government school sector loses funds, one of two things can occur: either non-government schools will need to push up their school fees—and at a time of major cost-of-living pressures the last thing that families need is an increase in their school fees—or potentially there will be the sacking or removal of many, many teachers in order to meet the shortfall in funds.


The Labor-Greens government has done very little to ameliorate the concerns of the non-government school sector. We in the coalition have been pointing out to the government for months and months the impact of not responding appropriately to non-government school funding reviews such as this one. Let us remember that the coalition are committed to indexing non-government school funding from the Commonwealth based on the current quantum of funds. In the event that the government chooses not to do this, and so far it has failed to commit to it—the minister has in fact said that schools will not get one dollar less than they currently get, which he thinks is a clever, tricky way of convincing schools that they have nothing to be concerned about, but of course the semantics are not lost on the non-government school sector—and it continues to support non-government schools only to the tune of the current quantum of funding then over the next quadrennium of funding $4.2 billion less will be paid to the non-government school sector. That is $4.2 billion across all of the non-government schools in Australia, which would have a massive impact on the resources available to non-government schools. Those schools would have to replace that $4.2 billion either by increasing their school fees dramatically or by cutting teachers.


Conservative estimates suggest that if the schools choose not to put up their school fees, at a time of real cost-of-living pressures, then they will have to sack 56,000 teachers in non-government schools. If they push up their fees to the tune of $4.2 billion then obviously some parents simply will not be able to afford that increase in fees, which will mean schools will lose students. This is such a serious matter—there are many schools that will actually close their doors if the government fails to index their funding based on the current quantum of funds—yet the government continues to obfuscate and to be unclear about what it believes schools in the non-government sector deserve in funding from the Australian taxpayer.


I will give just a couple of examples. In my own electorate of Sturt, Mary MacKillop College, which was founded and is still run by the Sisters of Saint Joseph—and of course Mary MacKillop was the founder of the Sisters of Saint Joseph order—would lose $2 million over four years, in real terms, which equates to $3,985 per student. Mary MacKillop is not a high-fee school. I note for the minister at the table, the Minister for Employment Participation and Childcare, that this school is on the border of our electorates, on Portrush Road between the Adelaide and Sturt electorates. She is deathly silent about the impact of not indexing school fees for non-government school students, yet many of the students in Norwood and across her electorate would be students at Mary MacKillop College. While I am standing up for the students in my electorate by insisting that we have indexation on top of the quantum that is currently paid to non-government schools, the minister at the table, the member for Adelaide, is deathly silent and refuses to commit. But I give her the opportunity: she can speak on this motion if she chooses to and she can commit to funding for non-government schools like Mary MacKillop College. 


There is another example which impacts on both the minister at the table, the member for Adelaide, and myself: Kildare College. Kildare College, in the north of my electorate, is very close to the border between the member for Adelaide's electo­rate and my electorate and it would lose $1.4 million in funding if there were no indexation of non-government school fund­ing over the next four years, which is over $4,000 per student. Kildare College is a low-fee school that caters for many students from low-socioeconomic-status backgrounds in the north-east of Adelaide, yet the govern­ment continues to leave those people swinging in the breeze without a clear indication that their funding will be maintained into the future at current levels plus indexation.


The government's partners in government, the Greens, have a quite radical proposal for non-government school fees. They wish to reduce the funds from the government to 2003 levels. This would completely annih­ilate schools in the non-government school sector across Australia. Yet, because the government, the Labor Party, are in fear of the Greens, they are yet to come out and condemn the Greens for their policy on non-government schools—and they have had every opportunity to do so. The minister, Mr Garrett, has been stone silent about the Greens' policy for non-government school funding. Why don't the government slam the Greens' proposal to reduce funding to 2003 levels, which would decimate the non-government school sector? Yet the government remain silent.


The other aspect to this motion is the support for 'funding maintained' schools. Funding maintained has been a part of the SES funding model since 2001. It has been a part of it from day one. It is as much a part of the current funding of non-government schools as any other part. There are 1,075 schools—out of 2,650—that are funding maintained schools. If those funds were to be withdrawn, nine schools in Sturt would lose over $4 million per annum in funding, being removed from them if funding maintained does not continue. These figures might mean very little to the ideologically driven government of Labor and the Greens but to parents, principals and teachers they mean jobs and they mean more cost-of-living pressure that they cannot face. The vast majority of these households will have mortgages on their homes and the vast majority will be struggling to pay their grocery bills every week. Yet this government continues to leave them hanging in the balance without any clear indication of whether it will support indexation going forward or of whether it will support funding maintained. I commend the motion to the House and look forward to the member for Adelaide finding her courage.

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2011-07-04,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (11:33):  I rise to speak against the motion moved by the member for Sturt. The member for Sturt is continuing a tradition, one that we have seen all too often in this House, of those opposite running a mobile scare campaign. We have seen this strongly in the carbon pricing debate with the Leader of the Opposition trawling the country and coming into this parliament arguing that petrol prices were going to go up under an emissions trading scheme. It is simply not true. The Leader of the Opposition has misled parliament over this issue. We now have the member for Sturt moving a motion on funding for non-government schools which seeks to spread fear and misinformation.


It is important to return to the basic facts. The Gillard government is committed to delivering a quality education to every student in Australia. Those of us on this side of the House believe that the public versus private debate is one that can be put to rest. What is important is focusing on students and student needs, not trying to reopen ideological wars which are done and dusted.


In my electorate there are many non-government schools of which I am extremely proud. I spoke recently at the opening of a new school building as part of Burgmann Anglican College, a low-fee school that serves the area of Gungahlin. At that opening the students expressed a great sense of pride in Bishop Ernest Burgmann, who the school is named after and who carried on a great tradition of social justice. I spoke at that opening of the work that Bishop Burgmann did throughout the community, work which was really critical to building a stronger community in the post-war decades, work that I am glad to say has been carried on by his granddaughters, Margaret Watt and Meredith Burgmann, among others. I am also proud to have visited Holy Spirit Primary School, a non-government school that shares playing fields with Gold Creek public school and whose teachers on duty in the playgrounds have decided, much in the spirit of doing away with unnecessary public-private divides, that children should be encouraged to play sport, that every time there is a sporting team it should not be Gold Creek versus Holy Spirit and that any sporting games that are played at recess or lunch need to have mixed teams involving some Holy Spirit kids and some Gold Creek kids on each side. They are showing how you can break down these artificial public-private divides, much as it would be nice to see those in the House doing the same.


Merici College, in my electorate, is involved in a trades training centre, ensuring that students have the opportunity to begin trades training before they finish their school education. Merici College is working with a group of non-government schools to ensure that students have the chance to get trades training. These are, perhaps, students who would otherwise have left school a few years earlier and now stay on and get that essential trades training. Through these important non-government schools, as through the many government schools in the Fraser electorate, quality education is being delivered day in and day out. I pay tribute to the great principals, teachers and administrative staff who are involved in that effort. Much of their work often goes unthanked but certainly should be recognised here in this House.


As part of the government's commitment to recognising that the divide between government and non-government schools should be broken down whenever possible, we have put in place a low SES national partnership and we have put in place an improving teacher quality national partner­ship. Part of those national partnerships are being delivered through non-government schools. For example, the Charnwood-Dunlop government school in Charnwood receives assistance through the low SES national partnership and the St Thomas Aquinas Primary School in Charnwood receives assistance through the literacy and numeracy national partnership. These partnerships recognise that we need to focus on need and not simply focus on the system that runs the school.


We are a government which has delivered $64 billion worth of investment and reform in Australia's schools. That is almost double what was delivered by those opposite in the last four years of the Howard government. This investment has been delivered, in large part, through a historic nation-building school infrastructure program.


Often, when I visit schools and have the great opportunity to open new school infrastructure, principals and members of the school community say: 'This really is historic, isn't it? It is hard for me to ever have imagined in my working life that we would see a federal government that would have the vision and the foresight to invest in the school infrastructure of the future.' And they speak to me about the impact the new school infrastructure is making on the educational achievements of their schools. There are schools like Amaroo School which is now able to engage in team teaching thanks to newly designed rooms with walls that open up between the classrooms. For example, a teacher who is a superstar in literacy and one who is doing great work in numeracy might be placed in classrooms side-by-side so that they learn from each other in a team teaching environment.


The new school infrastructure allows investment such as in Black Mountain School where, for the first time, a student in a wheelchair who is receiving an award does not have to stay in front of the stage to receive the award, but can go onto the stage and receive the award just like the students who are able to walk onto the stage. It is a simple piece of infrastructure that provides dignity to the school and to the school community.


The member for Sturt has really become increasingly hysterical over the school funding issue. It is another scare campaign and it is a divisive and inflammatory scare campaign. It is not something that, sadly, we should be surprised about from the current opposition which is opposing absolutely everything that is put forward. The member for Sturt is at odds with his former Liberal Party colleague Brendon Nelson who has acknowledged that the system needs reform and that the funding maintenance was a transitional measure put in place a decade ago.


The member for Sturt is, of course, committed to the Gonski review, but is also committed to continuing the current SES funding model. It is a particularly confused approach that the member for Sturt is pursuing. The Gonski review is a once in a generation chance and an opportunity to really think hard about the best school funding model for the future. That is what a responsible government does. We pursue policies aimed at the long game, policies aimed at getting school funding right for all students. The government has provided some certainty in the parameters that sit around this review. We have said that no school will lose a dollar of funding as a result of the review. We said that current funding arrangements for non-government schools will be extended to the end of 2013 and to the end of 2014 for capital funding. The panel has been asked to provide advice on appropriate transitional arrangements to help schools move easily and fairly to any new funding arrangements. As I noted earlier, the Gillard government has made record investments in these schools. These schools have benefited to a large extent through the record investments made under this government.


The Smarter Schools National Partnership is yet another form of investment that has been put in place. In the ACT schools national partnerships for low SES school communities and improving teacher quality have led to more than $500,000 in facilitation funding. On 28 June more than $1.9 million in reward funding was provided to the ACT for its progress in achieving the targets set under the National Partnership on Literacy and Numeracy. I am particularly proud to serve in a government which has invested so much in public and in private schools across the board.


Unfortunately, the coalition has continued its scare campaign. The member for Sturt told the House of Representatives on 3 March of this year that:


It has long been the coalition's policy to maintain the existing SES funding model ...


Yet, he said to the Christian Schools National Policy Forum on 23 May:


This review process is welcome and needed. ...


So, it is very hard to see where the member for Sturt sits on this issue. Of course, we in the Gillard government will continue the long work of reforming and investing in our schools because we know that a great education is great economic policy, great social policy and, of course, great education policy.

"O'Dwyer, Kelly, MP",LP,2011-07-04,"



Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (11:44):  I rise in support of the motion put forward by the member for Sturt, the shadow minister for education, and I would advise the member for Fraser, who I was listening to very carefully before, to read very carefully the motion that is before the House. It appears to me that in his entire speech he did not talk about the funding mentioned in the motion, the risk to independent schools because the government is not prepared to guarantee funding.


When the Prime Minister said that she was going to undertake the Review of Funding for Schooling she said that school funding should be based on 'simplicity, flexibility, stability, equity, value for money, transparency and best practice'. That might all sound fine but, sadly for the parents of Australia and particularly for the parents in my electorate of Higgins, she neglected to include in that list of items what has been a touchstone in education funding since Menzies first provided government funding for non-government schools—that is, the fundamental principle of choice. This side of the House very strongly believes that it is fundamental for parents to have the choice as to where they send their child to school. Parents best understand the needs of their child. They best understand what school will meet their child's academic needs, sporting needs and extracurricular needs. They also best understand the values that they hold dear, the school that they think best reflects those values and the sorts of innovative educational practices that they would like their child to experience.


The mantra from the opposite side of the House has been that government funding should be focused on schools not on students. I think it is important for us to look at the facts. In my home state of Victoria, according to the 2008-09 figures, indep­endent schools received $5,143.25 per student. By contrast, government schools—and this is the combined government funding—received $12,381.53 per student. So, when you look at the funding per student, independent school students in Victoria receive less than half the amount that government school students receive. The majority of funding for independent schools, around 66 per cent, comes from parents and from the school community. It is estimated that in the state of Victoria this saves taxpayers around $1 billion and that when you look at it nationwide it saves just over $3 billion. Yet it is clear from the latest funding review and from the lack of government commitment to maintain funding for schools in real terms—in particular they are completely silent on the issue of index­ation—that Latham's ghost still haunts the policy mantra of the government. In fact, Julia Gillard is haunted by Latham a little bit like Banquo's ghost. 


We are seeing here the revival of the hit list on schools. Of the 42 schools in my electorate of Higgins, 19 are already on that hit list—schools like St Mary's School, St Joseph's Primary School, The Currajong School, Holy Eucharist School, Korowa Anglican Girls School, Lauriston Girls School, Loreto Mandeville Hall, Our Lady of Lourdes School, Our Lady of Victories Primary School, Presentation College, St Anthony's Primary School, St Catherine's School, St Cecilia's Primary School, St Roch's Primary School, Geelong Grammar School Glamorgan, The King David School, Sacre Coeur, De La Salle College and St Kevin's College. Combined, these schools are going to lose $29 million, if they lose the indexation going into 2017. This is going to come at significant cost. Of course these schools will have to either increase fees or cut what they are offering. In some cases schools have told me that they will in fact close their doors.


But this is only the start of the govern­ment's radical agenda. It is very fitting that we should be discussing this motion today because of course the Greens hold the balance of power in the Senate. Lee Rhiannon has had a lot to say on the issue of school funding. We know already that the Greens would like to stop all government funding for independent schools. They have brought motions before the New South Wales parliament in order to be able to achieve that. We are going to see similar motions introduced into the Senate. This government are in coalition with the Greens. They need to stand up for Australian students. They need to guarantee funding; otherwise, education is at risk.

"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,2011-07-04,"



Mr RIPOLL
 (Oxley) (11:49):  It is important to start this debate by saying that Australia has a world-class education system that is providing top outcomes for all children who attend schools in Australia. The principals, the teachers, the staff and parents I meet when I visit schools in Oxley, and in other places as well, are hardworking and dedicated people. I acknowledge that there are issues in the system that need to be fixed, and that is why this government is working hard doing the things that the previous government did not do to address those specific issues.


The motion put by the member for Sturt is nothing more than scaremongering and fear tactics and bears no relationship to the reality of school funding or to the issues that we are dealing with here today. In reality, and as best as is possible, this government is doing the hard work that was not done in the past. The Gillard government is backing its commitment to a great education for all students, not just schools, with record investment in schooling of over $64 billion across four years in government and non-government schools. That is almost double the amount that was invested by the previous government in their last term. We are committed to ending the ideological war regarding school funding that has gone on in this country for almost 50 years—far too long—and that is why we have tasked a panel of eminent Australians, led by Mr David Gonski, to conduct the Review of Funding for Schooling. We have made it clear to the panel that the review needs to be an open and transparent process, with all Australians who care about the future of schooling given a chance to have their say, and that is exactly what is taking place, with thousands of submissions from people and stakeholders right across the country. People do have a view—a strong view. It ought to be about the educational outcomes of individual students.


A thriving and fully-functioning education system needs to include both government and non-government schools. Each of them plays a vital and important role. All schools in Australia play an important role in reflecting the diversity in Australian society. It is we who are breaking down the barriers that have existed for far too long. But every time I hear speeches from the opposite side they want to reintroduce the ideological warfare. They want to reintroduce the discus­sions about private versus public and government versus non-government. We thought that that debate was long gone, buried and dead, and it is not we on the government side who are talking about those issues. We are talking about reform. We are talking about funding. We are talking about changing a system which everybody agrees no longer works—a system that is opaque, that is complex and that muddies the waters in terms of educational outcomes. Yet the opposition want to have it both ways. You hear the member for Sturt in this place saying that he fully supports the review by David Gonski but, at the same time, he does not want it. Those opposite want to keep the old system but, at the same time, they want reform. It is simple: you cannot have it both ways; you cannot walk both sides of the street. It is far too easy for people like the member for Sturt to come into this place when in opposition and basically introduce scaremongering, fear tactics, and a campaign that just opposes, when everybody knows and acknowledges in the education sector that there needs to be significant change. 


We cannot continue with the old system, we cannot continue with the ideological division and we cannot continue with these old tired debates of one school versus another, of a government school versus a non-government school. It ought to be about educational outcomes; it ought to be about individual students; and it ought to be about their needs to make sure that, in the end, their education, a world-class education, is the government's No. 1 priority. That is why this government stands firm on the Gonski review to make sure that we get it right, to make sure that we have a transparent, open process—a process that is simpler, a process that delivers funding to all students and to all schools and that it does so fairly and equitably and for the right reasons.


We have made it clear through this process that we have not as yet made a decision on an outcome, because an outcome cannot be made until we see the recomm­endations of the review. But we have made this clear: no school will lose a single dollar per student as a result of this review. It is important to note that. Government needs to make that commitment so that we can ease the fears that are being placed in the hearts and minds of students, teachers and parents. Current funding arrangements for non-government schools have also been extended to the end of 2013 and for capital funding to the end of 2014. All of this is being done at a time when this government has been at the forefront of delivering what is once-in-a-generation funding to schools and capital investment through the Building the Education Revolution. Halls, schools and buildings are working to help deliver a better educational outcome. (Time expired)

"Wyatt, Ken, MP",LP,2011-07-04,"



Mr WYATT
 (Hasluck) (11:54):  I rise today to support the motion put forward by the member for Sturt. I would suggest that the House acknowledges the importance of all education sectors in the provision of education for children regardless of whether they are in the government or non-govern­ment sector. If we as a nation want to capitalise on and improve the pathways for society and our quality of life then education is a significant element in achieving that. I also want to say that parents choose schools for educational, religious and socioeconomic reasons, and for those choices we should not diminish them but rather allow them that opportunity. Their decision to pay for an element of education should never be diminished by the fact that this Australian government has a responsibility to all.


The funding, whilst guaranteed, does not include the CPI indexing or future arrangements beyond 2013 and 2014. In my electorate of Hasluck, non-government schools such as La Salle College, Lumen Christi College, Mary's Mount Primary School, Matthew Gibney Catholic Primary School, Mazenod College, Sacred Heart Primary School and St Brigid's College all stand to be unfairly prejudiced by the Gillard Labor government. The coalition of course supports a funding model that encourages private investment in non-governments schools and allows them to receive adequate support in real terms from government. Disappointingly, Labor has made no such commitment beyond 2013 when the current funding model is due to expire. For example, La Salle College in Middle Swan, which has a fantastic sporting and Indigenous student program, stands to lose more than $547,000 under Labor's plans. Then there is Mazenod College in Lesmurdie, which faces the loss of over $864,000. And $230,000 would disappear from Mary's Mount Primary School, while St Brigid's College will have more than $1 million slashed from its budget if the Gillard government gets its way.


Recently, I ran the Hasluck Leadership Awards, a non-partisan search for young leaders within our secondary public and private schooling systems. One of the two finalists came from St Brigid's College. Her family are not 'elite' as the Greens and Labor's left would describe them.




Mr Perrett:
  Rubbish!




Mr WYATT:
  This student is the child of hard-working people who have dedicated their resources to seeing their child receive the sort of education they have chosen for her. The member for Moreton would probab­ly have a number of constituents within his electorate who are facing the same problems. So I would hope that he would support funding that is of an equal nature to all students in his electorate. For her parents, that choice lies within the non-government schooling sector.


The Australian government should continue to support the right of parents to choose a school for their children that best reflects their values and beliefs and it should not penalise them for contributing financially to their children's' education. We have always encouraged people to make choices in many areas of life, and this equally applies to education. Imagine the strain that would be placed on the government system if hundreds of thousands of students with diverse talents, needs and requirements descended upon the government school sector if the non-government school sector collapsed in certain areas. The non-government schooling sector is invaluable in this regard. It takes a significant load off the public system.


This motion is not about criticising the government system. I have worked inside the government education sector as a teacher, as a district director and as a director of Aboriginal education, but I have equally worked with Catholic education and other non-government schooling sectors within Western Australia. I see the value of all sectors in providing educational pathways for our students. I believe that we should guarantee levels of funding, including CPI indexing, to enable those systems to continue to expand and provide the educational services that parents choose. Non-government schools by their very nature require significant funds from parents, and this is naturally supported by both sides of parliament. My own two sons went through public sector schooling, and their pathways were no different in choice nor quality of education from those in each of the various sectors.


I fully support the motion on behalf of the strong non-government schooling sector in my community of Hasluck and the hardworking parents who support it. Both need to be protected; both need to be funded. I support the motion. I want us to consider the educational needs of all children within the Australian society. (Time expired)

Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (11:59):  I will be brief. I have a few quick facts. This will be the first time since 1973 that funding arrangements for schools have been reviewed. It is time to have another look. I think, Mr Deputy Speaker, you would have been in about grade 4 back then and things have moved on a bit since then. Obviously we need to have a look at it. The reality is Labor has a proud tradition of investing in schools and those opposite not so much.

Mr OAKESHOTT
 (Lyne) (12:02):  On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Broadband Network, I present the committee's report incorporating a dissenting report entitled An advisory report on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011.


In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.




Mr OAKESHOTT:
  by leave—The issues presented to the committee during the inquiry provide an overview of industry and community views associated with possible enactment of the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011. The inquiry was also a forum for receiving various industry views on the government's fibre in new developments policy which underpins the proposed legislation.


While the committee made a number of additional findings, the main provisions of the bill are supported by the majority of the committee. Where the committee found areas of dispute, these were less about the bill and more about the underlying policy that has led to this bill. I suspect these disputes will be ongoing for some time.


The major findings of the report include: (1) that NBN Co. put in place benchmarked internal customer service protocols in regard to the timeliness of the issuing of statements; (2) that NBN Co. commit to publish its performance on the fibre rollout against specific time frames and that these commitments be subject to regulatory oversight; and (3) that the government investigate the possible impact on risk premiums of regular changes in development regulations and install anticipatory and mitigation measures if required.


In relation to the bill's possible impact on competition in the existing fibre provider market in new developments, the committee acknowledge the views put forward by various industry groups. The industry groups highlighted the potential adverse impact that the government's existing fibre in new developments policy may have for existing smaller fibre providers. Some of these industry groups reported that they have lodged their concerns with the Australian Government Competitive Neutrality Comp­laints Office. Taking into consideration the findings and recommendations of the Australian Government Competitive Neut­rality Complaints Office report, when it is released, the committee believes the government should examine the competition issues put forward by these fibre providers and industry groups in the context of the rollout of the National Broadband Network with a view to rectifying wherever possible any potential adverse impact on competition. 


I do note that there is a dissenting report attached to this report, put forward by the shadow minister and on behalf of coalition members. I welcome that dissenting report. Referring legislation to committees is an important part of the process of flushing out dissent and potentially highlighting any amendments so that better consideration of those amendments can then take place when bills are put before the House. I therefore thank the shadow minister for the work that he has done in preparing that.


On behalf of the committee, I therefore thank those who contributed to this inquiry for taking the time out of their busy schedules to provide submissions or appear in person before the committee. I commend the report to the House.

Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR
 (Gorton—Minister for Privacy and Freedom of Information, Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Justice) (13:14):   I move—


That the amendment be agreed to.


This bill will amend the Customs Act to enable Customs and Border Protection officers to undertake with consent an internal search of a person suspected on reasonable grounds to be internally concealing a suspicious substance, using body scan technology. Currently an internal search of a person can be carried out only by a medical practitioner at a place specified in regul­ations—for example, a hospital or surgery. The bill will allow, with the consent of the detainee, an initial non-medical internal X-ray scan of a person to be carried out by Customs and Border Protection officers using new body scan technology that produces a computer image of a person's internal cavities within a skeletal structure. In considering the bill, the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills was of the view that the principle of appropriately limiting equipment capacity should be included in the primary legislation.


This government amendment creates a requirement in the primary legislation that equipment used for the internal non-medical scan must be configured so that its use is limited to that necessary to produce an indication that a person may be internally concealing a suspicious substance. Where the body scan image supports a suspicion of internal concealment, the existing regime governing an internal search by a medical practitioner will then apply.


I commend the amendment to the House.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2011-07-04,"



Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (13:16):  by leave—As the House would be aware the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) announced the suspension of Tiger Airlines domestic operations in Australia effective from Saturday, 2 July 2011. CASA has not taken this action lightly but formed the view that there was a serious and imminent risk to passengers if the airline’s operations continued. CASA releas­ed a statement on 2 July 2011 outlining the circumstances leading up to this decision following the initial issuing of a show cause notice in March 2011.


Taking Tiger’s response to the show cause notice into account, CASA subsequently imposed a number of conditions on the airline's Air Operator’s Certificate (AOC). Since Tiger was served the show cause notice, CASA has determined further events raise concerns about the airline’s ability to conduct operations safely. This includes several incidents being further investigated by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) and CASA. The suspension of the airline’s AOC lasts for a period of five business days, during which time CASA must apply to the Federal Court for an extension of the suspension if required. If the Federal Court supports a CASA application, the court can continue the suspension for a period of time which will allow CASA to finalise its investigations into its concerns.


It is regrettable that this decision has impacted on the travel plans of many passengers, including those travelling during school holidays. However, the safety of the travelling public must come first. Recognising the disruption to the travel plans of thousands of holiday makers, the government asked the other Australian airlines to step up to assist those affected and to make every effort to help get people home, to continue their travel or to go on their school holidays. I am very pleased to advise the House that there has been an overwhelmingly positive response to the government’s request from the industry. Qantas, Jetstar and Virgin Australia are all assisting passengers affected by the suspension of Tiger services, through the use of extra capacity and the provision of special fares. I spoke personally to both Alan Joyce and John Borghetti on Saturday and I want to thank them, as the respective CEOs of their organisations, for the assistance that they have given to their fellow Australians in the past days. Following a request from the government, I also welcome the Australian Licenced Aircraft Engineers Association decision not to proceed with industrial action this week while Tiger’s operations are suspended.


Given the importance of a bipartisan approach to aviation safety, I rang the shadow minister, the Hon Warren Truss, on Saturday to update him on the CASA decision and have had CASA brief him in person this morning.


In our first term, the government undertook the most exhaustive review of aviation policy settings in Australia’s history. This review, which involved an extensive consultation process with industry, other government agencies and the com­munity, culminated in the release of Australia’s first ever aviation white paper, Flight path to the future, in December 2009. In the aviation white paper the government made it clear that aviation safety would always be our first and overriding priority. We supported this approach with the announcement in the May 2010 budget of an additional $89.9 million in funding for CASA over four years. This additional funding is being used to fund almost 100 new and ongoing staff in key surveillance roles and to invest in the development and maintenance of safety standards and regulatory development. The additional funding is also providing for expanded and ongoing training for CASA staff and will ensure that there are sufficient resources to properly regulate and administer Australia’s airspace, which covers an area of almost 11 per cent of the earth’s surface. This funding represented an unprecedented 30 per cent increase in CASA funding and provided for long-term stability in the authority’s funding base. We also improved governance arrange­ments for CASA with the establishment of an independent board to provide strategic oversight for CASA. The CASA board has recently confirmed that, with the additional funding provided by the government, CASA is now adequately funded to meet the challenges and performance expected of a world-class aviation safety regulator. We also strengthened the independence of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) including the creation of independent commissioners. 


Regulatory reform has been a challenging issue for Australian aviation safety for over a decade. In March 2010 the government established a dedicated regulatory drafting task force involving specialists from CASA and the Office of Legislative Drafting and Publishing. The task force is targeting the completion of the long outstanding mainten­ance, operations and flight crew licensing regulations. The task force has already made substantial progress in completing the maintenance regulations and is currently drafting several of the flight crew regulations specifically referred to in the recent Senate inquiry into pilot training. The government will give careful consideration to the inquiry's recommendations noting that the government has already acted on the safety funding issues outlined in the committee's report. We will do so after consulting with our independent aviation safety advisers. The government has consistently highlighted the importance of investment in safety critical equipment and services by Airservices Australia, Australia's major civil air traffic service provider, in its Statement of Expectations to the Airservices board. In response, Airservices has already comm­enced an almost $1 billion capital expenditure program over the next five years. This investment includes the wider adoption of advanced satellite and ground based surveillance technology, new and upgraded air traffic control towers as well as new rescue and firefighting stations and equipment.


Consistent with the government's Austral­ian Airspace Policy Statement issued in 2010, one of our key policy objectives is to enhance regional air traffic services. Airservices' investment has accordingly included new and enhanced air traffic facilities in growing regional centres like Broome, Karratha and Rockhampton.


Maintaining Australia's internationally regarded high aviation safety standards and performance is about constant vigilance, continuous improvement and investment in safety regulatory oversight, safety infra­structure and safety personnel. Recent events only serve to demonstrate and reaffirm this government's, and our independent safety agencies', joint commitment to providing a safe aviation industry. Australia's aviation safety system is based on sound governance and a resource and regulatory framework which will continue to ensure that safety will always be the first priority.


I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Wide Bay to speak for eight minutes.


Leave granted.




Mr ALBANESE:

"Truss, Warren, MP",Nats,2011-07-04,"



Mr TRUSS
 (Wide Bay—Leader of The Nationals) (13:24):  I thank the minister for reporting to the parliament on this significant event over the weekend, with the grounding of one of Australia's major airlines. When Tiger began, I think it would be fair to say that Australians welcomed what was going to be regarded as a new era of competition. Certainly low-cost travel was taken to another step. The airline has grown solidly. It now has 10 aircraft operating in Australia and a significant network, particularly into some of the tourist destinations around Australia. It is a substantial company in that it has the backing of important Singaporean investors and Singapore Airlines, one of the world's leading airlines, has almost a one-third interest in the company. It is a substantial operation and, therefore, to have its services in Australia grounded in this way is a significant blow to the Australian company, to the Australian tourism industry, to those who depend on Tiger to travel but also to the reputation of the Tiger brand around the world. So it was a significant decision to be made, and I am certain that CASA would never make a decision of this nature lightly. The implications are inevit­able: public confidence is lost in the airline and a lot of work has to be done then to rebuild that confidence if the airline chooses to continue its operation. We all hope that a way can be found through the current difficulties so that it can return to providing services across the nation and do so with a high degree of confidence that it can operate safely and securely.


We have a proud reputation in Australia for the safety of our skies and, in particular, the safety of our major airlines. That is a reputation that we have invested in over decades, and we must make sure that it is retained for the future. We are so dependent in this country on aviation because of the size of the continent and the need for us to travel around regularly—in particular, the advent of fly-in fly-out mining operations et cetera has crowded our skies. So it is important that we have a high degree of confidence that our safety regulatory systems and, indeed, our airlines operate within a culture of safety. To achieve that we have to have well-trained crews and well-trained engineers. We have to have sound regul­ations. Also, we must support the emergency services and other regulatory agencies. But what is most important and what is difficult to regulate from a government's perspective is a culture of safety within each of the operating companies. They have got to think 'safety'. They have got to be aware that this is a priority. It is an important commercial priority, as Tiger is discovering now when its safety has been questioned. You cannot have a strong, viable and secure airline and business unless the public are satisfied that your operations are safe.


People like cheap fares and they want to get to their destinations reliably and on time but what they want most of all is to be as certain as anyone can possibly be about anything in this life that when they board the aircraft it has been properly maintained, it has been properly looked after, the crew are competent and the airline is determined to get them safely to the destination. So it is important that we seek to act wherever necessary to maintain the safety of airlines and assure the flying public of Australia that they are safe.


In this particular instance, as the minister has outlined, issues that had occurred in Tiger airlines had been brought to CASA's attention over quite a period of time, and in September a series of obligations were attached to their air operator's certificate which required the airline to improve its performance. A series of steps were identif­ied, with time frames over quite a long period, for the airline to progressively improve its safety performance. As I underst­and it, the airline had been making progress in that task, although none of the actual target dates had yet expired.  It was a series of extra events, beyond those which actually had triggered the original requirements, that led to the suspension over the weekend. 


CASA are responsible for overseeing aviation safety in Australia. I know, even from my own time as a minister but also by observing over the years, that they take that responsibility very seriously and they do not act precipitously. In fact, this is the first time that something like this has happened to an Australian airline. I know people refer to the Ansett incident, which affected a significant proportion of the Ansett fleet but not all of it. In this instance CASA are concerned about the culture of safety within the organisation, and that is a fundamental issue which, as I mentioned earlier, must be addressed. But it cannot be addressed quickly and easily. You cannot change a culture overnight. That is why the minister is, I think, right to the refer to the fact that it is a big task to try to do this within five days. I hope they can, and it is encouraging to see that senior airline management and senior owners of Tiger have come to Australia from Singapore. They are clearly taking it all seriously. I hope that they can get in the air as quickly as possible. I note that Tiger are still selling tickets for next week. That is a demon­stration that they have got some degree of confidence that they can fulfil the requirements and assure our regulator that they have developed within their organisation the systems that are necessary to guarantee safe operation. 


This has been a major step. It is a significant blow to air travel within Australia. I join the minister in complim­enting the other Australian airlines for their willingness to carry Tiger passengers. It is not quite the Ansett situation, where they would have been genuinely worried that they would not get paid for the passengers that flew; in this case, Tiger has the backing of very substantial interests and there is good reason to believe that they have the financial capability to do whatever they need to operate again. The key thing is to develop the culture. That is not a money thing; that is about having proper processes in place with their management to ensure that safety is always given priority. 


I thank the minister again for his statement. I commend the whole Australian aviation industry for the way in which they are responding to this, including Tiger's willingness to address the issues in a constructive way so that hopefully their business can resume operation as quickly as possible, but most importantly of all so that Australia's valued reputation for having safe skies is preserved and enhanced.

"Billson, Bruce, MP",LP,2011-07-04,"



Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley) (13:33):  I will pick up where I left off on 23 June, where broadly my contribution at that time sought to highlight the deficiencies and flaws in the government's Competition and Consumer Amendment Bill (No. 1), ostensibly designed to deal with the anticompetitive conduct known as price signalling. I detailed the appalling inactivity and indifference of the government to repeated calls from the Australian Competition and Consumer Com­mission, the ACCC, for action and to address the price-signalling gap in Australian competition laws. I also talked about and drew attention to the absence of price-signalling laws in Australia impacting on the actions and decisions of the commission and cited some examples involving petrol retailing and also some observations by the former commission chair, Graeme Samuel, as it related to the banks. 


I also talked about the coalition leadership on this matter, which is hard to contest. It took the coalition to introduce a private member's bill, last November, to tackle anticompetitive price signalling. Notwith­standing the absence of the awesome res­ources of the Commonwealth, the coalition managed to do what the government seemed either unable or unwilling to do. What we then saw was the government react, seemingly motivated by political positioning. It seemed to be struck by the simple fact that there was an acknowledged gap in the competition law over which the government had done nothing. It seemed to then go from this phase of obfuscation to complete overreaction, from inaction to reaction, from the coalition's policy precision and measured intervention to develop an amending law to the government sensing the need to be seen to be doing something. The government seemed to act with its motive being one of political opportunism. There was this ham-fisted panic where, out of the blue, the government decided it should do something, not inspired by sound policy considerations but by the need to be seen to be doing something and to have some media sound bites to offer concerned consumers and a concerned regulator. That is where we got to. 


I was capturing how the government's bill is fundamentally flawed. It has a serious number of substantial deficiencies that are catalogued in the dissenting report of the House of Representatives Standing Com­mittee on Economics, where we examine this bill. Quite remarkably, though, it has been characterised by a leading academic and competition law expert as 'international worst practice on information exchanges between competitors'—hardly a ringing endorsement, hardly a sense that the government has got this right. It does not come as much of a surprise to this side of the House that the government has got this so wrong, largely due to the way it has gone about doing its work. 


The government, as I touched on earlier, reacted to the coalition leadership; it did not work up its own careful policy solution. It then sought to have the coalition's bill examined at great length by the House economics committee and then did a dis­honour and the disservice to the House economics committee, treating it almost as an ornamental stopover on the way from the drafting room and the Treasurer's speech into this parliament. In fact it was quite offensive when you look at the way government members and the government generally have dealt with this process or lack of process as it involved consultation. There were a number of very considered, quite substantial and weighty submissions provided to the House economics committee, outlining with a great degree of care and precision all of the decisions, all of the choices and all of the legislative design options the government has gone with, and why so many of them failed the test of sound economic policy and competent competition law. It is quite telling if you look at the House economics com­mittee report—and some loosely call it the majority report in that it was the casting vote of the Labor chairman that gave it majority report status—to see that it simply says, 'Go on, pass the government's bill.' None of the independent evidence presented to the House economics committee supports such an unequivocal recommendation to simply pass the government's bill. What is quite remark­able, notwithstanding that the position of government members was to simply pass the government's bill, is that the government itself has identified that the bill has some flaws and has brought forward its own amendments to the bill that the majority of members on the House economics committee thought was just right—'She'll be right, mate. Tick it through; send it through.' The government has come up with its own recommendations dealing with financial workouts for companies in difficulty where there is a need to discuss those financial arrangements between a number of credit providers.


This leads me to exactly what the bill is about. The government's bill has two key parts. The first seeks to prohibit private disclosures—known as a 'private disclosure prohibition'—of pricing information to competitors. That is the government state­ment. In the explanatory memorandum, and even in some of the commentary, the government has put forward this per se prohibition on private disclosure. It is there because there is apparently no redeeming quality to any private communication between competitors. That is the argument. Even in the explanatory memorandum, the government seeks to argue that things are so completely and clearly anticompetitive that they surely must be unlawful. That is a pretty bold statement. But what undermines that bold statement is that there are then pages and pages of exceptions. Things are so clear, so categorical and so obviously offensive that this provision seeks to make any kind of private communication between competitors unlawful. But apparently it is not so bad in a number of the circumstances that the government seeks to pick out. In seeking to pick out those exemptions and circum­stances, it belies the very assertion that the government makes that these per se prohibitions are so categorically and comprehensively wrong that they must amount to a per se prohibition in the law. It then goes on to have a second category of prohibition relating to general disclosures. This is about information relating to the price of goods and services, the capacity of a business to acquire or supply goods and services and any aspects of the commercial strategy. 


We want to focus on what is actually in the bill. What those out there would like to focus on is what is not in the bill and, more particularly, why the coalition's bill is not being discussed. In its 20 April bulletin, Mallesons assessed the coalition's bill as superior to the government's bill, yet the government has not seen fit to even bring on the coalition's bill—the very bill that gave rise to the government's getting off its backside in the first place. Quite remarkable! Mallesons said:


While the Coalition's draft Bill would need some revision and modification, it would appear to be the preferable alternative on the basis that it would require demonstration of an anti-competitive purpose and a substantial anti-competitive effect, rather than simply imposing a blanket prohibition on disclosure.


That is what the experts are saying. They did not have a chance to canvass any of those views with the House economics committee because the committee heard absolutely nobody in response to the submissions that were received. The per se prohibitions are the ones that are of particular concern because they seek to make something unlawful simply because it is. That is the argument the government is asserting, even though it undermines that argument, and I will come back to that point. 


On the second area of the more general disclosure prohibition, a concern about the reach of that provision goes well beyond price disclosure and into what is known in a familiar sense by competition lawyers as 'concerted and facilitating practices' in which coordination can be enhanced between competitors to the detriment of the economy and to the detriment of consumers. Rather than go into that model that exists in European law and that has evolved through case law in the United States, the govern­ment thinks it can simply get this right, even though submission after submission draws attention to the concerns about this bill. It is for these reasons that I will be moving an amendment in this place which seeks to put on the record all of the concerns that the coalition has about this bill and to put forward some suggestions about how they might be remedied. In addition to our general amendment, we will be proposing some specific amendments to make the most offensive aspects of this bill a little less offensive and I am hopeful that the government might seriously take on board that constructive effort. 


Bearing in mind that a number of provisions of this bill are a direct lift out of the coalition's bill, I am hopeful that the government might see fit to directly lift some of our remedies to the bill's greatest failings. We will be moving that the House declines to give this bill a second reading and that the House condemns the government for its belated action to address the anti-competitive pricing signalling gap in Australia's competition law. We will note that the bill only arose following the coalition's leader­ship to introduce the Competition and Consumer (Price Signalling) Amendment Bill 2010 as a private member's bill into this House, recognising the assessment of academics and leading competition law practitioners that the coalition's bill is superior to the government's bill and should be brought on for debate in the House. 


We are looking for the parliament to record its concern about the government's failure to undertake proper and meaningful consultation in the preparation of this bill, and to allow the House economics com­mittee to carry out its work to examine the bill and consider public submissions. We then hope the parliament will be honest enough to note the very clear flaws that are in the bill. Our second reading amendment talks about recklessly creating a per se liability for private communications without adequately justifying this approach in terms of economic policy or competition law principle and how the bill ignores that sound competition law should, wherever possible, have an economy-wide application unless clear justification is provided to deviate from this settled approach. 




The DEPUTY SPEAKER

I notice I have got a little while to go, but I would like to move the second reading amendment and hope it will be seconded and supported by at least half a dozen other people. In the few minutes that are left, I will conclude some of the aspects of that amendment. The amendment is also about the sector specific application and the per se prohibition that gives rise to a need for the complex task of identifying all concei­vable business transactions and conduct that may have a legitimate business justification and the exhaustive list that flies from there. It also talks about the risks to the consumer and the economic detriment from failing to adequately differentiate between information sharing that can be pro consumer and pro competitor.

I also talked about and drew attention to the absence of price-signalling laws in Australia impacting on the actions and decisions of the commission and cited some examples involving petrol retailing and also some observations by the former commission chair, Graeme Samuel, as it related to the banks. 


I also talked about the coalition leadership on this matter, which is hard to contest. It took the coalition to introduce a private member's bill, last November, to tackle anticompetitive price signalling. Notwith­standing the absence of the awesome res­ources of the Commonwealth, the coalition managed to do what the government seemed either unable or unwilling to do. What we then saw was the government react, seemingly motivated by political positioning. It seemed to be struck by the simple fact that there was an acknowledged gap in the competition law over which the government had done nothing. It seemed to then go from this phase of obfuscation to complete overreaction, from inaction to reaction, from the coalition's policy precision and measured intervention to develop an amending law to the government sensing the need to be seen to be doing something. The government seemed to act with its motive being one of political opportunism. There was this ham-fisted panic where, out of the blue, the government decided it should do something, not inspired by sound policy considerations but by the need to be seen to be doing something and to have some media sound bites to offer concerned consumers and a concerned regulator. That is where we got to. 


I was capturing how the government's bill is fundamentally flawed. It has a serious number of substantial deficiencies that are catalogued in the dissenting report of the House of Representatives Standing Com­mittee on Economics, where we examine this bill. Quite remarkably, though, it has been characterised by a leading academic and competition law expert as 'international worst practice on information exchanges between competitors'—hardly a ringing endorsement, hardly a sense that the government has got this right. It does not come as much of a surprise to this side of the House that the government has got this so wrong, largely due to the way it has gone about doing its work. 


The government, as I touched on earlier, reacted to the coalition leadership; it did not work up its own careful policy solution. It then sought to have the coalition's bill examined at great length by the House economics committee and then did a dis­honour and the disservice to the House economics committee, treating it almost as an ornamental stopover on the way from the drafting room and the Treasurer's speech into this parliament. In fact it was quite offensive when you look at the way government members and the government generally have dealt with this process or lack of process as it involved consultation. There were a number of very considered, quite substantial and weighty submissions provided to the House economics committee, outlining with a great degree of care and precision all of the decisions, all of the choices and all of the legislative design options the government has gone with, and why so many of them failed the test of sound economic policy and competent competition law. It is quite telling if you look at the House economics com­mittee report—and some loosely call it the majority report in that it was the casting vote of the Labor chairman that gave it majority report status—to see that it simply says, 'Go on, pass the government's bill.' None of the independent evidence presented to the House economics committee supports such an unequivocal recommendation to simply pass the government's bill. What is quite remark­able, notwithstanding that the position of government members was to simply pass the government's bill, is that the government itself has identified that the bill has some flaws and has brought forward its own amendments to the bill that the majority of members on the House economics committee thought was just right—'She'll be right, mate. Tick it through; send it through.' The government has come up with its own recommendations dealing with financial workouts for companies in difficulty where there is a need to discuss those financial arrangements between a number of credit providers.


This leads me to exactly what the bill is about. The government's bill has two key parts. The first seeks to prohibit private disclosures—known as a 'private disclosure prohibition'—of pricing information to competitors. That is the government state­ment. In the explanatory memorandum, and even in some of the commentary, the government has put forward this per se prohibition on private disclosure. It is there because there is apparently no redeeming quality to any private communication between competitors. That is the argument. Even in the explanatory memorandum, the government seeks to argue that things are so completely and clearly anticompetitive that they surely must be unlawful. That is a pretty bold statement. But what undermines that bold statement is that there are then pages and pages of exceptions. Things are so clear, so categorical and so obviously offensive that this provision seeks to make any kind of private communication between competitors unlawful. But apparently it is not so bad in a number of the circumstances that the government seeks to pick out. In seeking to pick out those exemptions and circum­stances, it belies the very assertion that the government makes that these per se prohibitions are so categorically and comprehensively wrong that they must amount to a per se prohibition in the law. It then goes on to have a second category of prohibition relating to general disclosures. This is about information relating to the price of goods and services, the capacity of a business to acquire or supply goods and services and any aspects of the commercial strategy. 


We want to focus on what is actually in the bill. What those out there would like to focus on is what is not in the bill and, more particularly, why the coalition's bill is not being discussed. In its 20 April bulletin, Mallesons assessed the coalition's bill as superior to the government's bill, yet the government has not seen fit to even bring on the coalition's bill—the very bill that gave rise to the government's getting off its backside in the first place. Quite remarkable! Mallesons said:


While the Coalition's draft Bill would need some revision and modification, it would appear to be the preferable alternative on the basis that it would require demonstration of an anti-competitive purpose and a substantial anti-competitive effect, rather than simply imposing a blanket prohibition on disclosure.


That is what the experts are saying. They did not have a chance to canvass any of those views with the House economics committee because the committee heard absolutely nobody in response to the submissions that were received. The per se prohibitions are the ones that are of particular concern because they seek to make something unlawful simply because it is. That is the argument the government is asserting, even though it undermines that argument, and I will come back to that point. 


On the second area of the more general disclosure prohibition, a concern about the reach of that provision goes well beyond price disclosure and into what is known in a familiar sense by competition lawyers as 'concerted and facilitating practices' in which coordination can be enhanced between competitors to the detriment of the economy and to the detriment of consumers. Rather than go into that model that exists in European law and that has evolved through case law in the United States, the govern­ment thinks it can simply get this right, even though submission after submission draws attention to the concerns about this bill. It is for these reasons that I will be moving an amendment in this place which seeks to put on the record all of the concerns that the coalition has about this bill and to put forward some suggestions about how they might be remedied. In addition to our general amendment, we will be proposing some specific amendments to make the most offensive aspects of this bill a little less offensive and I am hopeful that the government might seriously take on board that constructive effort. 


Bearing in mind that a number of provisions of this bill are a direct lift out of the coalition's bill, I am hopeful that the government might see fit to directly lift some of our remedies to the bill's greatest failings. We will be moving that the House declines to give this bill a second reading and that the House condemns the government for its belated action to address the anti-competitive pricing signalling gap in Australia's competition law. We will note that the bill only arose following the coalition's leader­ship to introduce the Competition and Consumer (Price Signalling) Amendment Bill 2010 as a private member's bill into this House, recognising the assessment of academics and leading competition law practitioners that the coalition's bill is superior to the government's bill and should be brought on for debate in the House. 


We are looking for the parliament to record its concern about the government's failure to undertake proper and meaningful consultation in the preparation of this bill, and to allow the House economics com­mittee to carry out its work to examine the bill and consider public submissions. We then hope the parliament will be honest enough to note the very clear flaws that are in the bill. Our second reading amendment talks about recklessly creating a per se liability for private communications without adequately justifying this approach in terms of economic policy or competition law principle and how the bill ignores that sound competition law should, wherever possible, have an economy-wide application unless clear justification is provided to deviate from this settled approach. 




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. Peter Slipper
):  Order! If the member for Dunkley is going to talk about his amendment, he should move the second reading amendment.




Mr BILLSON:
  I was building up to moving it. I notice I have got a little while to go, but I would like to move the second reading amendment and hope it will be seconded and supported by at least half a dozen other people. In the few minutes that are left, I will conclude some of the aspects of that amendment. The amendment is also about the sector specific application and the per se prohibition that gives rise to a need for the complex task of identifying all concei­vable business transactions and conduct that may have a legitimate business justification and the exhaustive list that flies from there. It also talks about the risks to the consumer and the economic detriment from failing to adequately differentiate between information sharing that can be pro consumer and pro competitor. 




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. Peter Slipper
):  Order! The debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 43. The debate may be resumed at a later hour, when the honourable member will have the opportunity of continuing his contribution, and then a seconder to his amendment will be called for.

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (13:45):  I recently received a letter from a young constituent in Ryan regarding her trip to Africa. Her name is Monica Dakin and she plans to travel to South Africa to volunteer with a wildlife conservation and re-education group. Even at the young age of 18, Monica Dakin is already setting an outstanding example for the wider community. Monica plans to use this trip to assist with the conservation of Africa's animals and hopes to re-educate the locals and the Ryan community about the conservation of all animals. As a student of ecology and zoology and a member of the local scouting movement, Monica will have the ideal base from which to share what she learns on her trip. Monica has also already shown great dedication and initiative by putting together many fundraisers to assist in raising the amount of money she needs to finance this trip. She has held sausage sizzles and sold raffle tickets and goes door to door to sell chocolates. Monica is truly an outstanding example not only of her generation but also of the hardworking constituents in the electorate of Ryan which I am so proud to represent.

Mr BRUCE SCOTT
 (Maranoa—Second Deputy Speaker) (13:51):  I rise today to honour a truly inspirational Australian outback hero, a pioneer and trailblazer of the iconic and very historic Birdsville Track. Tom Kruse, as we knew him, was a legendary mailman of the Birdsville Track, but on Thursday last week, 30 June, Tom passed away in Adelaide surrounded by his family. Tom was born on 28 August 1914 in Waterloo, South Australia. He left school at the age of 13 and did various labouring jobs before moving to Yunta to work in a small garage owned by his brother Snow. Tom became a regular face for residents along the Birdsville Track when as a 24-year-old he began the mail run between Marree in South Australia and Birdsville in Queensland, in the outback of my electorate. He made his first trip on 1 January 1936 in 45-degree heat. If anyone has ever experienced the heat of the outback at that time of the year, they will know just how tough it is. The outback then, of course, was very tough. It is a very lonely place at times, but Tom conquered sandhills, dust storms, flies and in wet seasons, like now, floods, swollen rivers and creeks along the track. He made these trips every fortnight. Round trips between Marree and Birdsville normally took seven days, but when the Cooper flooded the trip could take as long as six weeks. Breakdowns were a common occurrence, but Tom was dedicated to getting the mail through. His mail service was a lifeline for so many people living along the track. He brought mail, supplies, fuel and education resources to the otherwise isolated people along the track. (Time expired)

"Turnbull, Malcolm, MP",LP,2011-07-04,"



Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth) (15:27):  Let me say right at the very outset that every member of the coalition is passionately committed to the rollout of the availability of fast broadband to all Australians at affo­rdable prices. The debate about the National Broadband Network, of which this bill is a subset, is not a debate about the end. We agree on the end. We agree that all Austr­alians should have access to the benefits of broadband, of fast broadband and of access to the benefits of a digital economy. Our point of difference with the government lies in the means it is employing to achieve that end. In particular, with the way it is establishing the National Broadband Network.


The National Broadband Network is the largest infrastructure project in our country's history. Yet, despite coming into government in 2007 with a very clear and prominent pledge that no major infrastructure project would be undertaken without a rigorous cost-benefit analysis and with an equally prominent pledge that a specialist agency, Infrastructure Australia, would be set up to conduct those cost-benefit analyses, this government with this—the biggest infrast­ructure project in our history—continues to refuse to undertake any cost-benefit analysis. Again and again it shows itself to be utterly hypocritical on this issue. If the government were serious about rigorous economic analysis and dealing with taxpayers' dollars responsibly it would undertake that cost-benefit analysis and pose this question: what is the fastest and most cost-effective way to deliver fast broadband to all Australians and do so in a way that makes broadband more affordable?


I stress the point of affordability because naturally in this place we focus, quite properly, on the burden on the taxpayer: is the taxpayer getting value for money and could the objective of fast broadband across the nation be delivered at a lower cost to the taxpayer—could the taxpayer get more bang for their buck, in other words? But an equally important issue, and one that I would say is, if anything, of more importance, is whether broadband will be affordable so that those Australians who are not able to afford it today will be able to afford it in the future. The reality is—and we rely on the ABS, the Australian Bureau of Statistics, for this—that the largest group of Australians who do not have access to the internet today are those in households earning $40,000 or less a year. The biggest barrier to internet access is not technology; it is not some issue of network design. Sure, there are issues of network design that impact on the speeds people can achieve. But, in terms of basic access to the internet at any speed, the biggest barrier is income. Too many Australians cannot afford it. That is a fact.



Mr Husic interjecting—




Mr TURNBULL:
  The honourable member opposite shakes his head. He should have another look at the ABS statistics. The reality is that the NBN will not deliver more affordable broadband. If anyone doubts my contention, they do not have to rely on my remarks or indeed on the remarks of the many competitive telcos who make the point that this is going to result in more expensive broadband because it is a big government monopoly, heavily capitalised, which will inevitably not be subject to the price pressures of competition because it will have no competitors; they have only to look at page 105 of the NBN corporate plan and see there the forecast retail prices, which are equal to or indeed higher than many of the plans that are available today.


Of course it stands to reason. We know the factor that has brought down broadband costs over the last five years—by as much as half, according to the OECD, as I recall—has been the growing competition in the telecommunications sector. That competition at the facilities level, at the level of physical access into the premises, is going to be eliminated because the government not only is legislating to constitute the NBN as an effective fixed line monopoly but has paid billions of dollars of taxpayers' money to Telstra and to Optus not to use their HFC networks, their pay television hybrid fibre coaxial networks, to offer broadband or voice in competition with the NBN. Yet we know that those networks are capable of providing broadband services today, are providing broadband services today and are providing in some markets—in Melbourne in particular—broadband services at speeds of 100 megabits per second. When you look at other markets around the world—South Korea is always a good example; the United States is another—you see that HFC cables, pay TV cables, are being used to provide broadband services and in those markets provide the competition with the ADSL services provided over the copper networks owned by the telephone companies—or indeed competition with the fibre networks owned by telcos and other broadband providers, as is the case in Korea, where the fastest growth in broadband penetration has been over the HFC networks belonging to SK Telecom and LG.


This whole NBN scheme is going to be, tragically for the people of Australia, a lose-lose. It is more expensive than it needs to be. The government say we are not right on that score, but if they had the courage of their convictions they would have done the cost-benefit analysis which, if they are right, would demonstrate that this was in fact the most cost-effective way to set up a national broadband network. But, because they are afraid of asking the question, the Australian people can only reasonably assume that they fear what the answer will be and that they know it will be that they are spending tens of billions of dollars more than they need to. On the other side of the coin, we know that this network is going to provide not cheaper and more affordable broadband access but broadband access that is either just as expensive as current services or indeed more expensive, particularly for the higher speeds. This is an important point. I will not delay the House with the material that I published recently about the South Korean market, but it is very instructive to analyse the exper­ience there. Consumers in South Korea, which is arguably the most advanced economy in terms of broadband penetration and use of information technology, are not prepared to pay any significant sort of premium for higher speeds. When you look at the NBN corporate plan you see that a fundamental premise there is that Australians will pay very substantial premiums to go from 12 to 25, 50 and up to 100 megabits per second and higher. When you match that against experience in this market—indeed, Telstra's experience with its HFC cable in Melbourne and in particular the experience in South Korea or the comparable experience in the United States—you see that consumers are not prepared to pay significant premiums or, indeed, any premium in many cases for faster speeds. Why is that? It is because speed in and of itself—that is to say, 50 megabits per second, 100 megabits per second—is of no value to a consumer whatsoever. The value comes from the applications that run on it and that the speed enables to be run on it. If there are applications that can be run on a higher speed that can be run on a lower speed—that is to say, if everything a consumer wants can be run adequately, effectively, satisfactorily at a lower speed and at a lower price—that is the product they will take, and that is exactly what has happened.


This bill is all of a one with the goal of the government in creating this big monopoly, the NBN. It is designed to deal with the situation, the deployment of fibre, into greenfields developments. The coalition does not object to the policy objective of greenfields developments being, wherever possible, rolled out with fibre to the home. There is an incremental cost, as we have acknowledged in the dissenting report of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Broadband Network that was tabled today, but it is not a substantial incremental cost compared to the enormous cost of rolling out fibre to the home in brownfields areas. I should note, however, that much to my surprise when I was visiting South Korea recently I saw that, in some very new and very large residential greenfields develop­ments, fibre had not been cabled into the premises; in fact, the fibre network terminated in the basement and the buildings themselves were cabled with copper. I just offer that to the House and to those listening to this debate today as an example of the Korean experience, which, as I say, is very instructive because they have been further down this track than us.


Nonetheless, assuming we are going to go down this line of installing fibre in greenfields premises, I think ensuring that rollout is efficient and timely has a very important impact on Australia's telecomm­unications environment. The NBN estimates that 1.9 million greenfields premises—that is to say, households in new developments—will have to be connected to the NBN by 2020 and a quarter of a million by June 2013. The government has long argued that the greenfields market for fibre deployment is competitive. Given this competitiveness, even this government recognised that it would be ludicrous to do away with that market entirely and that private operators, it said, should be encouraged to roll out fibre to new developments. In its first policy consultation paper released in May 2009 on greenfields estates, the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy stated: 




The installation of FTTP is taking place in a competitive context, with developers typically contracting out the provision of infrastructure and services in developments. In areas where the FTTP infrastructure provider does not provide retail services, arrangements are increasingly being put in place to ensure partnerships exist with retail providers to deliver services to consumers.



In that paper, the department estimated that, at the time, around 120 greenfields estates were being prepared for fibre deployments, with more than 10 operators reaching an estimated 150,000 homes.


In 2009, Senator Conroy, the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, set up a stakeholder reference group and his department held one-on-one consultations with operators to understand how to implement its greenfields policy. As late as a December 2010, the minister was still telling the industry it would be an integral part of a fibre rollout. The minister said:




It has been a consistent feature of the Government’s policy in new developments that there should be room for competing providers. This continues to be the case.





…
   …
   …





Providers can compete to provide infrastructure in new developments, for example, by offering more tailored solutions to developers or more expeditious delivery.



Sadly, those fine intentions have not been reflected in this bill. In common with every other aspect of this NBN project, it will see an effective market completely scrapped and all of the inherent risks and liabilities involved with rolling out fibre transferred to the taxpayer. The NBN Co. has said that once it has rolled out the optical fibre line it will take up ownership not just of the network but also of the pits and pipes that the developers have installed. Down the track this will take the cost of maintenance off the hands of developers and place it with the taxpayers, but the cost of providing the pits and the pipes lies with the developers. The NBN Co. are offering no upfront cost to developers when installing the optical fibre network. That is important because smaller fibre-to-the-premises developers do not have the luxury of spending taxpayers' money in the hope that 10 years down the track they may actually begin to recoup some of the money that has been invested. As OPENetworks stated in their submission to the joint committee: 



NBN Co is the obvious first choice for Developers because NBN Co is the only provider that can fund the network build costs (that may otherwise have been paid by Developers to OPENETWORKS 
...
) and that funding is then able to be recovered by NBN Co charging RSPs higher
 operational prices.



OPENetworks have argued that this policy is in fact a violation of the competitive neutrality policy for government owned businesses, which holds that they should not exercise unfair advantage by reason of their government ownership over their private sector competitors. An appropriate applic­ation has been made to the Productivity Commission in that regard. What this legislation will do is make greenfields property developments more expensive and slower to bring to market, and stifle competition. The department said before the committee that a developer has the choice. He has to put in the pits and pipes, but he has the choice of going to a private sector fibre company or waiting for the NBN. The reality is that there is no choice because the NBN will provide the fibre for no cost to the developer whereas the developer would obviously have to pay a price to a private fibre company. Each of the representatives of the property sector and the greenfield operators have made the point to us that the business of putting in the pits and pipes and then waiting around for the NBN Co. to turn up is going to place considerable delays and expense on property developments. We have heard many complaints from the property sector about the delays occasioned by this. I am foreshadowing amendments that we will be moving later in this debate which will seek to rectify that particular problem.


The amendment we are going to move—and this has been detailed at some length in the dissenting report—will mean that a property developer, having dug the pits and pipes, can choose to have a private sector fibre provider to lay the fibre as long as it is done in accordance with the specifications, which should be stipulated by the industry, not by NBN. NBN obviously will have a big input into that but it should not be dictated by the NBN for exactly the same reason that, when telecommunications reform began some decades ago, Telstra's ability to set technical standards was taken away and moved to the regulator. The developer can employ this private sector company or what are called greenfield fibre operators. As long as they have installed that fibre in accordance with those specifications, the developer will be entitled to be remunerated by the NBN Co—in other words, it will require NBN Co. to buy that fibre setup from the developer for a tariff which will be set by the minister on a per residence basis, taking into account the relevant factors such as the cost of construction, NBN's costs and so forth.


What is the object of this amendment? This does not undermine in any way the objectives of the NBN. This means that a developer can get on with the job, get the fibre installed and be paid for it without having to wait around for the great big government monopoly to deign in its magnificence and wisdom to get around to this developer's problems. The reality is that a new development which does not have the fibre installed will be at an enormous disadvantage from a marketing point of view to another development that does have that fibre installed. So it is important that developers are able to get on with the job and get the fibre installed. This amendment will enable them to do just that.


We flagged this issue with the various developer's organisations and with the greenfield operators in the course of the joint standing committee inquiry. All of them supported it and welcomed it. We flagged it also with the department. Their response was essentially equivocal. It was not really a responsive answer at all. They did not seem to have a particularly strong view on it either way. The bottom line is that will make it easier for developers to get on with the job. It may well save the NBN Co. cost and expense and, if it encourages NBN Co. to move things along and be more timely in its construction of these networks, then that would be a very good thing as well.


The other amendment that we will move a little later in the course of this debate—and which we flagged in the dissenting report—would enable the private sector cable companies, greenfield operators, to be exempted from the cherry-picking provisions of this act if the fibre network they seek to build meets the following conditions: it is not owned or operated by NBN Co. or Telstra; it is installed in a new development; it is owned and operated by the same entity which builds it; and it delivers retail services only to the persons who reside in the development.


The purpose of this amendment is to enable the private sector greenfield cable operators to stay in business, to be able to put in a network they would then be able to operate as a small private network. They should be exempt from those cherry-picking provisions because of their scale. As we have said in the report, it would effectively maximise the options available to developers and to the greenfield operators. They could contract on the basis that the greenfield operator would build the network and operate it until such time as it was sold to the NBN Co. or they could contract on the basis that the greenfield operator would continue to operate it and there would be no sale to the NBN Co. at all. They would no doubt be under some risk that the NBN Co. might choose to overbuild them but one would hope that, when the rush of blood to the head of NBN Co. settles down a little, they will not be overbuilding brand new fibre optic networks, given the expense of doing so.


This amendment, coupled with the first amendment, will mean that a developer is in the position where he or she can employ the same company—and this is, as TransACT said in the inquiry, clearly the most efficient way to do it—to put in the pits and pipes, put in the cable and then either be paid for that cable by NBN Co. and, in effect, sell it to NBN Co. or for that cable-laying company to operate it as an independent cable network. That gives the developer a range of options. It does not put the developer at a disadvantage and it does not give the developer a disincentive from using the private sector. It means that the greenfields companies can continue in existence and can provide some real competition to the NBN.


I imagine that honourable members opposite will oppose this because they are opposed to competition, but at some point they have to match the rhetoric with the reality of the bill that is before the House. Their rhetoric has been that there is nothing in this bill that impedes competition in the greenfields developments. But a greenfields operator under the scheme in this legislation is at an insuperable disadvantage to the NBN Co. because the NBN Co.'s cable will be laid for free, at no cost to the developer, and the cost presumably will be recovered from charges made to retail service providers over time, whereas if the developer goes to hire somebody else to put in the fibre network they will have to pay them to do so. Naturally the preference bias will be in favour of the NBN Co.


I imagine that many developers would not be too troubled by that. Obviously the owners of the operators of these greenfields cable networks are very threatened by that. Many people in the industry have said that this bill will have the effect of putting them as an industry right out of business. In the absence of these amendments, I fear that that would be the case. Many developers might be quite happy just to let the NBN get on and do the job, but the experience has been of inordinate delays. All of us in this House who have been involved in the development sector or observed people in the development sector or are familiar with the conduct of big government owned monopolies or indeed big private companies know that they take their time. Many developers will be left waiting and waiting for the cable to be laid. The longer they wait, the longer it will be before the development is complete and the longer it will be before they can get it to market. All of them said to us in their evidence that they believe that the private sector can put in the infrastructure at a considerably lower cost than the NBN is likely to. The department turned up their nose at that and said they could not see any evidence for that. It really is not a question of evidence. One way or the other, let the market decide. If the private sector can do a better and cheaper job than NBN then no doubt developers will see that as an opportunity.


The amendments that we are proposing here will give developers real choice. They will ensure that cable is rolled out in greenfields developments in a more timely and efficient fashion. They will ensure that developers are not put in a 'Hobson's choice' situation where they can either wait and wait for the NBN to show up and lay cable at no cost to them or pay somebody else to do it out of their own pocket with no reimbursement to get it done sooner. And they give the greenfields cable operators—TransACT, Opticom and others—the chance to stay in business and to provide some competition. To honourable members opposite whose approval of these amendments we in the committee sought, but to no avail, I say to them once again that if they are serious about competition this is the opportunity to support amendments—which we will move later—which will provide some real competition.


There are many things that are unique about the NBN. The government members may regard this as a compliment. One is that there is no country in the world spending as much on a national broadband network as we are. Our spending, on any measure, is off the charts. There is no other country in the world that is establishing a new government owned monopoly to deliver broadband. Again, that is a world first—and not one that we should be too proud of. But just as importantly and most ominously there is no other country in the world that is seeking to eliminate facilities based competition. Take your pick. Anywhere else in the world governments are very anxious—and this is particularly the case in Korea and the United States—to ensure that there is always real competition among the fixed line services and that they are available to as many households as possible. The amendments I have foresh­adowed will go some way at least in new developments to achieving that. After the amendments are debated later, we will be commending them to the House and trust they will get the support of the House. (Time expired)

"Rowland, Michelle, MP",ALP,2011-07-04,"



Ms ROWLAND
 (Greenway) (15:58):  Firstly, since the member for Wentworth mentioned it, he knows perfectly well that he came to the committee with half-baked amendments full of square brackets saying, 'I will insert something here when I think about what to put in here.' So he should not come in here and make those assertions. Secondly, we waited about 10 minutes for him to give his usual spiel without even talking to the bill. As the member for Lyne said when he introduced the advisory report earlier today, the disagreements in this committee and in this report on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011 actually come down to a question of policy and ideology more than anything else. That is borne out by the fact that we have had to sit here for the last half-hour and listen to the member for Wentworth say the same rhetoric he has said on every single occasion, crying these tears for affordability.


What did they do? What did he do when he was a member of a government which saw Australia going down the gurgler with respect to broadband rankings around the world? Australia became an absolute backwater in terms of internet accessibility and high-speed broadband. It has taken this government to pick up the mantle and actually turn that around. We know why he is saying these things. We know it is in his remit. We know that is his job. The sole purpose of him coming in here today and spending half an hour just bagging out the NBN is that he has been given the remit to destroy the NBN. On this point, I found he actually felt and looked rather uncomfortable on this occasion because he talked about HFC being available. He knows perfectly well that only 30 per cent of the country is covered by it and even then that is only if you are lucky enough to live on the eastern seaboard around metropolitan areas. He knows perfectly well when he mentions the United States that they have had a long history of ubiquitous cable investment. He talks about South Korea and again he knows perfectly well that the reason South Korea has become the internet economic miracle is government intervention and acceptance a decade ago of the need for broadband development. What were we in Australia doing in that time? Absolutely nothing.


The member for Wentworth talks about the value of broadband being in the applications rather than speed. Absolutely true, but the fact is that in order to deliver those applications you need bandwidth. Without bandwidth they are absolutely nothing. The member for Wentworth talks about facilities based competition. That is fine, but we know from not only the analyses that have been done by the ACCC since 1997 but also in the lead up to the NBN being announced that facilities based competition in Australia has failed. Why has it failed? Because Telstra as the incumbent operator was a vertically integrated company controlling both the wholesale and the retail levels, so the market failed.


What happens when markets fail? What do Labor governments do? We step in when the market fails and we rectify that failure. The member for Wentworth talks yet again about Australia going it alone on what it is doing in this area. I remind members that one of the key regulatory principles is that regulations should be specific to the needs of each country. What is the need for Australia right now? The need is to connect a country of vast geography and differing topology and a country which has definite broadband black spots that have not been addressed.


You do not have to take it from me. Take it from the ITU Secretary General of the United Nations, who visited Australia only in April this year and made the following comment:


Australia is a different country. Its geography and spread of the people, the level of telecommunications development and the level (of competition) between the operators—I will not say which one is a giant or not—all of those conditions, you do not find them elsewhere and therefore you do need to have the guts to tackle the problem.


That is exactly what this government is doing. Finally, the member for Wentworth constantly wants to throw around the word 'monopoly'. As everyone knows, the NBN is a wholesale-only network. How will it deliver competition to consumers? It does that by disinfecting the wholesale level so that the vertical integration disease is obscured to the extent that we can regulate the wholesale level and give a level playing field to retail operators with equivalent pricing and terms.


Now that I have dispensed with the member for Wentworth, I turn to the bill itself. This is a critical piece of legislation for the development of the National Broadband Network, particularly for the estimated nearly two million new premises that will be constructed across Australia during the rollout phase. The passage of this bill will provide something vitally important for all stakeholders including industry, consumers, local government and developers. What is that? It is certainty. For homebuyers, there will be certainty that their new dwelling will be fibre ready. For developers, there will be certainty as to their obligations to ensure ducts and lead-in are fibre ready.


I turn to some practical context of the bill. The practicalities of this bill are certainly not lost on me. While I doubt there will be substantial greenfields development in some electorates such as Wentworth and Bradfield in the immediate future, this is not the case in respect of west and north-west Sydney. During my time as a representative on Blacktown City Council and as its Deputy Mayor, I was party to decisions on many new development approvals and subdiv­isions. I am on the record as an advocate for the notion that, just as the local government planning and approvals process takes into account community needs such as parks, sporting amenities and childcare centres, access to advanced communication services must be viewed as an essential service with infrastructure backing that is akin to sewerage and electricity and made a condition of consent.


I have witnessed first hand—and too many of my constituents are living it today—the consequences of underinvestment in advanced communications infrastructure in our new greenfields estates. For many residents in suburbs such as Kellyville Ridge, The Ponds and even Stanhope Gard­ens in Glenwood, their primary reason for contact and advocacy with my office concerns their inability to access what are now regarded as entry level broadband products such as ADSL2+.


Even in older estates in Greenway, which were once greenfields or even brownfields developments, such as specific streets in the well-established suburb of Kings Langley, access to high speed broadband is a challenge. The timing of this particular dev­elopment meant that the Foxtel cable rollout passed by this area. This is not, as the member for Wentworth has attempted to assert on just about every occasion, a consequence of an income barrier. It is amusing enough that this furphy is being peddled by the same person who ran a fantastic dial-up ISP, which he sold in the dotcom boom and made either a cool $60 million or $40 million, according to recent reports—but who is counting? No, this lack of access is the consequence of chronic underinvestment in communications infrast­ructure in greenfields estates. You only need to look at the median house prices in Kings Langley, Kellyville Ridge and The Ponds, which are $545,000, $588,000 and $596,000 respectively, to understand that this is not merely a question of income. When one examines the electoral divisions ranked by the proportion of households with a broadband internet connection, there is not a single regional electorate with a percentage of households with broadband connections above 50 per cent. Indeed, far and away the tyranny of distance when it comes to broadband accessibility is borne out by the fact that nearly every rural and regional electorate lies in the bottom half of the scale. I am yet to receive an answer from anyone on the opposite side of the House explaining to me what they did over all their years in office to improve broadband development and accessibility for households in suburbs such as Mt Druitt, to develop broadband as a tool for social inclusion in disadvantaged regions or even to create a comprehensive policy for greenfields development. As an example of how confused their policy has been on this issue, one only needs to look at the so-called 'real action' plan they took to the last election. On page 4 of that policy it is stated:


The Coalition will conduct an urgent review of whether to mandate that all 'greenfields' connections must be fibre.


That leaves it up in the air whether there should be a fibre mandate, as opposed to copper, in new developments. Yet on page 17 of that same policy it states:


The Coalition believes that new dwellings should have a fibre connection rather than a copper connection.


So even in their own policy, the one they took to the last election, they could not make up their minds on their position. This confusion from those opposite continues in their ill-conceived proposed amendments to this bill, which I will happily deal with in the consideration in detail stage. In the mean­time, I note that page 42 of the dissenting report into the bill, which was tabled earlier today, states:


… the evidence the inquiry received demonstrates that there is a vigorous private market for the construction of fibre infrastructure in new developments.


The dissenting report goes on to say that the bill will end all that. That is simply not true. There is vigorous competition which will remain with the bill in effect. The change will be that the competitors will compete to provide fibre installation to NBN Co. rather than to developers. Instead of developers extracting an economic rent, consumers will not pay for fibre connectivity of itself. They will pay for what they use from a retail service provider providing services using the NBN. The constructors will obtain a normal return. The change is that there is no arbitrage opportunity, which those opposite, who like to say they are champions of competition, should embrace. No arbitrage opportunity and no abnormally high rents—the effect is good for consumers. 


I turn to that part of the bill dealing with the proposed access regime—the proposed part 20A of the Telecommunications Act. I would like to make the point that the proposed regime is based on existing provisions in schedule 1 of the Telecomm­unications Act, none of which are novel. It provides a regime for carriers to secure access to fixed line facilities owned by non-carriers in order to ensure that fibre can be rolled out using these facilities. So it is indeed based on the existing schedule 1 of the Telecommunications Act. Access can be on terms that are commercially agreed or, failing agreement, one can agree on an arbitrator. The default arbitrator will be the ACCC. So, as can be seen, the access regime is completely in line with existing competition provisions under the Telecommunications Act itself.


The outcomes of this bill will be early and less costly access to fibre based broadband for residents of new developments, reduced costs for deploying fibre by ensuring that the ductwork infrastructure is indeed fibre-ready, reduced costs for deployment of fibre through access to non-carrier duct as well and cabling for new premises which ensures they can take advantage of the NBN. All of these things are well understood by consum­ers. They understand that the definitive agreements, signed the other week, between Telstra, Optus and NBN Co., mean that we will be able to fast-track using existing facilities and existing infrastructure in the most efficient way possible. This is well understood in my electorate, where River­stone is the site of the first Sydney metro rollout. The question I continually get there is not, 'Why we are doing this?'—not the question that the member for Wentworth seems to believe consumers keep asking over and over again. They are not asking why; they are asking when. It cannot come soon enough for these areas of west and north-west Sydney, which have suffered from chronic underdevelopment.


I turn now to the issue of NBN Co. operating as the wholesale provider of last resort. There is strong stakeholder support for this. It supports a consistent national approach in the future and, if alternative providers wish to compete with NBN Co., they are welcome to do so. I will finish by talking briefly about some of the proposed amendments. I could not resist the notion put forward by the member for Wentworth about NBN Co. being forced somehow to buy network from other providers. What is actually being proposed here is that a developer will arrange for NBN Co. to purchase that part of the network from the fibre provider. This is highly problematic. It seems to suggest the developer can force NBN Co. to buy another person's asset without their permission. That raises issues about acquisition of property.


I will end on that note, but I also particularly want to draw the House's attention to the significance of 20 July. Everyone should be putting that date in their diaries. On that day, the shadow minister will be addressing a CEDA forum on the topic 'Broadband Vision for Australia: The Opposition's Perspective'. This will be a pretty short speech. If you want to go to it, it is $270 a head, but I am happy to save any member here $270 and 10 minutes of their time by pointing out that we already know what the opposition's policy on broadband is—it is to destroy the NBN. The member for Wentworth has demonstrated that that is his remit and that that is what he will be trying to do. (Time expired)

"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",Nats,2011-07-04,"



Mr HARTSUYKER
 (Cowper) (16:13):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Telecommunications Legislation Amend­ment (Fibre Deployment) Bill. I think there is agreement in this House over the need for high-speed broadband, but the issue is how you get there and how you provide those services in the most efficient and effective way—a way that provides an acceptable return on funds invested, a way that ensures there is excellent competition in the market and a way that delivers services to Australians at a price they can afford. The purpose of this bill is to facilitate the installation of fibre into new developments and housing estates and to ensure that the telecommunication infrastructure placed in new developments meets the technical requirements of NBN Co. 


There are four measures in this bill in total. Firstly, the bill enables the minister to specify new developments in which fixed lines for installation must be optical fibre lines and must comply with technical specifications. The bill calls this rule the optical fibre line requirement and requires NBN Co. to be the installer of last resort, where a developer does not choose a commercial provider. However, it is becoming clear that the terms of this legislation will see NBN Co. becoming the installer of first resort, rather than last.


Secondly, the bill requires that facilities installed in a development must be fibre-ready. This will be called the fibre-ready facility requirement and will ensure that passive infrastructure such as underground ducting and pits and pipes allow the ready deployment of optical fibre cabling. Thirdly, the bill prevents corporations from selling or leasing land or buildings in new develop­ments unless fibre-ready facilities have been installed. Finally, the bill implements a regime for carriers to secure access to fixed-line facilities such as pits and pipes owned by non-carriers to ensure fibre can be rolled out using those facilities. Access to these facilities will be on terms that are negotiated commercially by the respective parties, or determined by an agreed arbiter. The bill creates a mechanism whereby the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission will be the default arbiter where an alternative is not selected by the respective parties.


The coalition believes that the government has taken the same approach with this bill as it has with the entire NBN project. The government's approach is to establish a monopoly at a huge cost to the Australian taxpayer and destroy competition at every opportunity. Through NBN Co., the govern­ment is completely dismantling competition in the wholesale telecommunications ind­ustry—all so that the business case and the potential return of NBN Co. can be propped up. But, like all government monopolies, this approach simply creates a poor allocation of resources and massive cost blowouts for taxpayers. This legislation is being debated within an environment where NBN Co. is already facing these blowouts and delays to the rollout. We have seen the cost of installing the NBN into Tasmanian homes reach $7,500 per premise. On the mainland, NBN Co. suspended its construction tender in April because bids by companies familiar with the industry came in at around $8 billion above NBN Co.'s budget.


Most insulting of all to the Australian taxpayer is the announcement last week that the Gillard government will be paying billions of dollars to Telstra and Optus to transfer their customers from copper and wire infrastructure to the NBN. We have the situation where NBN Co. is paying the two largest wholesale operators billions of dollars all to acquire customers and charge them a higher price for broadband.


Yet, despite these billions of taxpayer dollars being spent, the NBN only has around 728 customers receiving the service for free. It is spending $132 million on the cost of employing around 1,000 NBN Co. staff members, with 51 executives earning over $300,000 a year. Within this context, we have this bill which will destroy the ability of fibre installation companies to compete with NBN Co. for the rights to install fibre in new developments.


The coalition agrees that it is desirable to encourage the installation of fibre in new developments. It has been a farcical situation allowed by this government, where Telstra has been required to install copper into smaller developments of less than 100 premises with the knowledge that the infrastructure will eventually be overbuilt by fibre. What a waste of money it is to overbuild infrastructure—no wonder Telstra has been reluctant to install copper and has left developments at a standstill while the government takes its time rectifying the situation.


The coalition completely welcomes the chance we have to ensure that fibre is installed in all new developments. However, we believe that the private sector has been facilitating the installation of fibre in new developments for many years and that this bill unfairly removes this competition to NBN Co. There is already an active and productive market between competitive greenfield operators, or CGOs, to secure contracts from developers for the purpose of installing fibre. This point was made clear in hearings of the Joint Parliamentary Comm­ittee on the National Broadband Network into this legislation. The industry group Greenfield Fibre Operators of Australia—which consists of seven installers of fibre including OPENetworks, Service Elements, TransACT, Comverge, Broadcast Engin­eering and Pivit—submitted to the comm­ittee:


GFOA companies have been competing with one another, Telstra Velocity, Opticomm, VicUrban, Multinet Broadband and other carriers/operators ... for over ten years. 


... there is already a very healthy competitive market between experienced wholesale network carriers in Greenfields ... that is not acknowledged by Government.


The submission by GFOA also states that competition in the market has produced enormous reductions in the cost of installing fibre. In an environment where NBN Co. are using public funds to create a wholesale fibre network, surely the taxpayer should expect the government to pursue the lowest costs available. However, GFOA state:


Deployment of FTTP networks by GFOA carrier/operators are currently costing $1,500 per lot ... for networks where the functional performance specifications and standards equal or exceed the current functional performance specifications and standards of NBN Co networks that cost more than double the price to build.


In Tasmania during the installation of fibre for premises with pre-existing infrastructure, NBN Co. has spent an average of $7,500 per premise connected. Clearly a competitive market would allow cheaper costs and a better outcome for taxpayers. We hear the government give lip service to competition. According to the minister, this legislation will implement a regime where NBN Co. is the installer of last resort where the developer does not choose a competing installer. However, the bill effectively destroys any competition for two reasons. Firstly, developers can incur the expense of building trenches and fibre-ready facilities and then employ NBN Co. to install the fibre at zero additional cost to the developer. What possible incentive will a developer have to hire a competing fibre installer to roll out fibre when the developer can hire NBN Co. to do the same work at no cost?


The second way the government is ensuring an NBN Co. monopoly in installing fibre is by enforcing standards for a fibre-ready facility in greenfield estates. In practical terms, this means that the pit and duct infrastructure used to facilitate the installation of fibre must meet standards set by the minister and specified by NBN Co. So, we will have a situation where the dominant operator in the market will have the power to set the technical specifications and requirements that its competitors must meet. This was the situation prior to 1989, when the then Labor government transferred Telecom Australia to an independent body and started the process by which telecommunications were recognised in the Trade Practices Act and overseen by the ACCC. The impact of this bill should clearly be prohibited by the ACCC, which the government is effectively turning into a toothless tiger with regards to telecommunications regulation. Rather than implement NBN Co. as the installer of last resort, the provisions of this bill ensure that NBN Co. will be the installer of first resort because developers have absolutely no incentive to consider another installer. This point is felt strongly by existing private installers. For instance, TransACT submitted to the committee that:


... it appears to be the intent of the Government and NBN Co, that it plans and needs NBN Co to be the monopoly provider of FTTP in Greenfields developments;


The impact of the government's policy on new housing developments is that the competitive industry will simply cease to exist. The Greenfield Fibre Operators of Australia made this clear when they told the committee that the bill will simply put them out of business. So here we have a Labor government that claims to support competition and that a monopoly wholesale network is the only way to promote retail broadband competition, but is completely destroying competitive industries while it sets up the NBN Co. monopoly. This approach will have devastating effects not only on niche industries such as fibre installation but also on the entire telecom­munications industry in Australia. As the Victorian government recently said in its submission to the NBN inquiry being undertaken by the House of Representatives:


After over two decades of national economic and financial reform, the NBN proposal in its present form represents a very serious threat to the long-term competition in the telecommunications sector.


The Victorian government went on to say:


The increasingly apparent risk is that the commonwealth could, over time, fully replicate a dysfunctional telecommunications market structure that has hindered investments in the current broadband market. This would be the result if it simply replaces Telstra's market power with an NBN Co infrastructure monopoly with all the attendant inefficiencies and constraints on investment, innovation and future policymaking.


Through this bill, these predictions are already coming true in the market for fibre installation in new developments. We will see competition wiped out and NBN Co. installing fibre at a higher cost per lot than could be achieved by private enterprise, with the taxpayer footing the bill every step of the way.


The coalition will be introducing two amendments to protect competition and ensure that taxpayers benefit from the efficiencies of a competitive marketplace for fibre installations in new developments. We believe that the bill should be amended to remove the disincentive for developers to use private operators to install fibre infrast­ructure. The bill would be amended to enable developers, whose project has an installed fibre network in compliance with the minister's specifications, to have the option to require NBN Co.'s purchase of the network at a reasonable price. A reasonable price would be determined by the minister with consideration of current market prices and costs. The developer will then have an incentive to use private operators because the costs of doing so would be recouped from selling the network to NBN Co. Essentially, developers will face the same costs regardless of whether they employ a private operator or NBN Co. to install the fibre. By protecting competition in this manner, the government would be ensuring competitive pressures keep down the costs of installing fibre in new developments and taxpayers will benefit from getting the best market price for the installation of fibre. This amendment will also impose a cost discipline directly on NBN Co. If NBN Co.'s competitors can build connections at a lower charge than NBN Co., then there would be a cost saving to NBN Co. and to all taxpayers.


The second coalition amendment would see certain fibre networks exempt from the operations of parts 7 and 8 of the Telecommunications Act, which will require that all fibre networks must operate under the same technical standards as the NBN. The amendment will ensure that those networks not owned or operated by NBN Co. or Telstra, and where those networks only delivered retail services to persons residing in the development, would be exempt from these parts of the act. NBN Co. would still retain the option to build its own network in the development if it wished and would have access to the fibre-ready facilities which the developer is required to build, but the network would still be placed under the same access conditions as stipulated for NBN Co. This amendment would ensure that competition continues to exist for private networks in new developments and that developers are given maximum flexibility in choosing services for their future residents.


The warning signs are all there that this project will suffer from low demand, be months or years behind schedule and end up costing taxpayers billions above the $50 billion that they are already projected to be paying. The coalition urge the government to adopt our amendments to ensure that we can salvage at least some competition in the market while NBN Co. continues destroying all competitors in its wake.


Just two weeks ago we saw yet another example of NBN Co. destroying competition with its announcement of the terms of the Telstra agreement, presently valued at some $11 billion, and the announcement of the deal with Optus, proposing to spend $800 million to do nothing more than purchase customers from the network and take out competition. We believe that competition is the cornerstone of delivering lower prices for consumers. Why then are we going to use taxpayers' dollars when the only return on investment for those very taxpayers who are paying out the money to purchase customers is that they will be paying a higher price for their broadband? 


It seems that only Labor could come up with such an interesting business proposal: to charge taxpayers, in the case of Optus, $800 million to purchase customers for no other reason than to charge those very same taxpayers more for their own broadband. We know that cost is a major impediment to many people accessing high-speed broadband, so we should be really focusing on delivering those services at the lowest possible price. Eliminating competition and creating an artificial monopoly are not ways to achieve that goal and are certainly counter to the objectives of good telecommunications policy and are counter to the objectives of the coalition.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2011-07-04,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley) (16:28):  It gives me great pleasure to talk on the Telecommunications Legislation Amend­ment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011 and reflect on some of the work of the Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network. It is a great honour to be on that committee for a number of reasons, only one of which is my deep and abiding interest in broadband. More particularly, at this point in time we are discussing some of the most exciting reforms that are taking place within this industry. 


Over the course of the last two weeks, the deal that the government did between NBN Co., Telstra and Optus was fundamentally a groundbreaking reform which has been pursued for generations: decoupling Telstra from its network and ensuring fundamental competitive reform. This reform had escaped the nation and we managed to achieve it. In its wake, we will ensure that we will not revisit some of the debates about the needless duplication of networks when cable TV was being rolled out in the 1990s. We have singularly sidestepped that through this deal we have set up between NBN Co. and Telstra and Optus, which will ensure a more efficient use of our telecommunications network. It will transform the industry and ensure that we achieve fast and efficient broadband for nearly the entire continent. It is something that others only dream of but we will achieve. We will reshape the industry through this. 


People cannot wait for access to this transformational technology. I have seen the enthusiasm firsthand. I notice one of my colleagues is on the other side of the chamber whom I worked with on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Infrastructure and Communications. We visited various parts of the country and were able to see with our own eyes the excitement in the regions about the prospect of tapping into a new superfast broadband network and what it will do. For example, they will be able to retain young people in regional areas through better access to educational opportunities. Small businesses will have the chance to tap into new markets which up until this point have escaped them in the regions. We have the chance to deliver a service in parts of the country like the area of Sydney I represent where people thought they would never have access to such a system because, frankly, the market did not value investing in a network in the area based on their incomes. I think that is a disgraceful reflection of where we are at, and I will reflect on this stalemate later. I take great exception to some of the quoting of ABS statistics earlier by the member for Wentworth. It was quite misleading and I want to address that as it impacts on the electorate I am proud to represent.


People in the electorate of Chifley are eagerly awaiting the National Broadband Network not just for its speed, not just for what they will be able to download but for what they will be able to do. Just the other day I had the pleasure of visiting the Blacktown Computer Pals group, which is teaching senior Australians how to access computers in a way that they have never had the opportunity to do before. Wendy Lambert and all the volunteers that operate Blacktown Computer Pals do tremendous work in showing senior Australians the opportunities presented by this technology. The other day we were talking about some of the applications that will open as a result of access to the National Broadband Network and one that particularly caught them was the prospect of e-health so they will not be stuck waiting for specialists or GP support. They will get fast and easier access to medical assistance. They will be looked after in their older years. They know some of the applications and they cannot wait for this.


This bill is critical in ensuring that, as we connect up to 6,000 homes a day, the greenfield areas of Australia will be looked after just as efficiently as the brownfield areas. The bill will ensure that there is an optic fibre requirement, a fibre-ready facility requirement, a fibre-ready installation requirement and a facilities access regime. The bill was examined by the Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network. I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate the chair of the committee and the deputy chair—you, Madam Deputy Speaker D'Ath—for the work that ensured that this bill will be considered in a timely way. A lot of the states will depend on this bill going through the House and through the other place to ensure there is a mechanism to connect greenfield estates quickly.  Having worked for an electricity distributor and having been a union official in the telecommunications industry, a lot of what has been considered by this bill is simply—without bursting anyone's balloon—unremarkable. Frankly, a lot of utilities have been working for many years with the developers to rollout networks—electricity, gas or telecommunications—in new estates. The reason I congratulate the chair and the deputy chair is outlined in the chair's forward to the report that was presented today which states:


Where the committee found areas of dispute, these were less about the Bill and more about the underlying policy that has led to this Bill.


We continually have these arguments, as represented in the chamber today, not about the bill itself but about the way we are going about bringing superfast broadband to this country through the NBN Co. and the reforms that we have put to this House. I believe the report put forward some very sensible and considered recommendations, for example advocating that internal customer protocols be put in place within NBN Co. to ensure that the time frame for issuing statements to developers is completed and benchmarked; that NBN Co. commit to specific time frames to publish its performance on fibre rollout—a sensible idea; and that there be an investigation into the possible impact on risk premiums of regular changes in development regulations—again, pretty sensible. 


However, the coalition have sought, as evidenced today by the member for Wentworth, to engage in spurious claims about this bill. For example, they claim that rolling out the NBN will make it more expensive for homes. No-one who has bought new land and is intending to develop a property on that land would for one minute expect that any of the utilities connected to that property would come for free. They would expect to pay for a gas connection, for water and for electricity. They would expect some cost. That cost has been outlined in the explanatory memorandum—and I will come back to what I believe are the spurious costs being claimed in self-interest by industry. The cost outlined in the explanatory memorandum is about $800, which is in line with what would be expected for the other utilities that would have to be connected. 


The opposition claim that the processes to be used by NBN Co. will be slow and bureaucratic. But the report has recom­mended some measures which I hope the government and the NBN will embrace to ensure that we can have a timely rollout. They claim, for example, that developers might have to wait too long. That was raised by the member for Wentworth earlier. Guess what? Sometimes developers do wait. They roll out aspects of the network, undertake the pit and pipe and wait for the utility to come through. As I said earlier, this is unrem­arkable. But the claim that is being put forward is that in some way NBN is doing something that hitherto has not been experienced by the sector. That is simply and patently ridiculous.


The other claim which was made through the course of the hearings was that NBN or the minister should not set standards. To some extent the member for Bradfield and I, despite the fact that we are on different sides of the chamber, actually agree that there is always a danger that monopolies set standards in a way that excludes competition. The preference would always be that the industry would set them. Who in the industry is responsible for setting these standards? The Communications Alliance, the sector itself. Up to this point, the sector has been unable to come up with standards in relation to the rollout of the network. The problem we have is that in arguing the minister should not set the standard the coalition is assuming that the industry will get its act together and effectively asking government to shoulder the risk if the industry is incapable of reaching agreement within itself. Mind you, NBN Co. is a member of the Communications Alliance. If they are unable to come up with a standard then what standard do we operate to? And when the faults start racking up because the performance of the network is not up to scratch, who will be responsible? Ultimately, the government will be, not the industry that was unable to come up with the standards in the first place.


During the course of the hearings, TransACT put forward to us that developers or contractors within the sector who have carriers licences should be enabled to roll out the network to the standards that they roll out to. I asked TransACT, which is a regional telecommunications provider that operates in the ACT, which standard it would operate to: would TransACT let the subcontractor put it in to their own standard or would TransACT require the subcontractor to work to TransACT's standard? The answer from TransACT was simple. It said, 'We want it to our standard.' Yet TransACT argued to the committee that NBN Co. should not be entitled to operate to the standard it sees fit in the absence of the industry standard. It says that TransACT should be entitled to operate to its own standard—something it would not allow for its own network. When we are trying to roll out a uniform network with standards whereby everyone can expect the network to perform in the same way we cannot have what I would argue—with no disrespect to TransACT, I will put it in very crude terms—is a self-interested position when it comes to the network.


The member for Wentworth wants things to be done in a timely way but he has flagged some unbelievable suggestions. For example, an article entitled 'Turnbull tests NBN Co-pays amendment for greenfields', which appeared on the iTnews website, talks about the fact that the member for Wentworth was arguing that NBN Co. basically would have to negotiate with each developer, as they roll out in their own estate, how much they would pay for the assumption of the network. On the one hand he wants the network to be built quickly and says that we should not force delay on developers, yet on the other hand he would force on us a delay in the negotiation process with developers one-on-one.


I also could not believe the claim the Housing Industry Association was making that it might cost up to $5,000 per premise to roll out the NBN on a greenfield site. When we quizzed them on that, they said that they were earlier estimates but then came back later and said, 'We've tested those out and that is what we believe to be the case.' But there was no evidence of what that was supposed to be. Frankly, we need to get the NBN rolling out as quickly as possible to reach the target of 6,000 homes a day.


In the time remaining I will address the spurious claim made by the member for Wentworth that he put amendments to the committee. That is a falsehood. He put forward, for example—and I am willing to table this—an incomplete amendment that had different sections. I will read directly:


Notice must be given to NBN Co. of the requirement … (some time before expected completion of the network? Within some time after completion?)


He put half-baked amendments that were not even complete to the committee dealing with the rollout of one of the most important pieces of infrastructure in the country. He could not even get that done yet suggests that he did. He talks about a cost-benefit analysis and comes back to it. I am going to give you a cost-benefit analysis that was carried out at the 2007 election: people basically looked at the 19 plans you guys could not get through; they liked our plan. The cost-benefit analysis was done in 2010: people did not like what you were putting forward; they liked what we were putting forward. The crossbenchers late last year also had a cost-benefit analysis. They liked our plan; they did not like yours. It is about time you stopped trying to stop the rollout of a network that is critical to the country. (Time expired)

"Fletcher, Paul, MP",LP,2011-07-04,"



Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (16:44):  I am pleased to speak on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011, which is part of the overall policy architecture underlying the National Broadband Network and its specific objective is to ensure that new developments receive a fibre connection rather than a copper connection. In the broad, this is a sensible objective. But typical of the way the Rudd-Gillard government approaches virt­ually every policy issue, including those in the telecommunications sector, they have done an absolutely hopeless job of seeking to implement this objective because they have come up with a mechanism which is heavy handed, intrusive, damaging to competition, bureaucratic and unnecessarily expensive. They have done this through key provisions in this bill, which, amongst other things, specifically mandate that property develop­ers must meet certain requirements to install so-called fibre-ready infrastructure and also give the minister the power to impose technical standards, upsetting the long-established arrangements in the industry in which technical standards are set by agreement through the industry repres­entative body, the Communications Alliance.


In the brief time available to me I want to make three central points. Firstly, it does make sense, if your objective is to improve Australia's broadband infrastructure—an objective shared by all of us on all sides of this House—to focus your policy attention on new developments. The second point I want to make is that the particular method which this government has chosen to focus on this area is unfortunate in terms of its consequences for housing policy because it makes the process of building new housing developments slower and more complex than it otherwise needs to be. Thirdly, I want to make the point that these measures are very bad in terms of their consequences for competition in telecommunications—consi­stent with every other aspect of telecom­munications policy which this government has touched.


Let me turn firstly to the central point that it does make sense to focus on new developments. It is uncontentious between the major political parties and it is uncontentious amongst all who have looked into this issue that the marginal cost of installing a fibre connection over a copper connection is much lower in greenfields sites in new developments than it is in existing homes and buildings. It costs a lot more to go back and retrofit existing homes and buildings, ones which currently have a copper connection, with a fibre connection than the incremental cost of fibre over copper in new developments. It therefore makes sense, as we have been happy to acknowledge in a dissenting report, to encourage the building of fibre connections in new developments. It is a sensible thing to do. Indeed, housing stock in Australia increases by around one per cent each year, so simply by encouraging fibre in new developments you begin to achieve a gradual and steady increase in the percentage of homes which are connected to fibre. Indeed, even Telstra—not known to be a friend of competition—acknowledged, in its submi­ssion to the inquiry conducted by the Joint Select Committee on the National Broadband Network, that there is a growing competitive market for the delivery of fibre networks in new developments. They remarked as follows:


Traditionally as the USO provider we have been deploying copper based infrastructure at the request of developers. More recently a competitive fibre deployment industry had arisen and a number of providers, including Telstra, deployed fibre in many new developments under contract to the developer.


In other words, what we have is the market responding to demand and increasingly installing fibre infrastructure in new developments around Australia without the intervention or assistance of government. The Gillard government would no doubt find this an extraordinary proposition, but the market is, in fact, efficiently responding to demand and fibre is already being built in a material number of new developments around Australia. And what has been the response of the Gillard government? As usual they have rushed in to clamp the dead hand of government upon this nascent market. Their central planning instincts have been spurred by these developments and their policy settings choke off the market response, as I will come to in more detail in a moment.


Let me turn to make the second point I want to make. This bill is a bad idea when it comes to the question of housing policy. We all know that there is a looming housing shortage in Australia, and the last thing that we ought to be doing is imposing new complex bureaucratic requirements upon property developers. Unfortunately, that is precisely what the arrangements mandated by this bill do. They add expense and delay for those wishing to build new housing estates. Notwithstanding the government's rhetoric, in practical terms this bill gives developers a very strong financial disin­centive to deal with operators other than NBN Co. In turn, this leaves developers at the mercy of NBN Co.'s responsiveness and timeliness. NBN Co. will become a bottle­neck through which all property develop­ments must pass before they can be completed and brought to market. I confidently predict that the downstream consequences for Australians wishing to purchase new housing are likely to include increased delay and expense. Let me note the comments of the Housing Industry Assoc­iation when they appeared before the committee's inquiry:


The legislation needs to make it very clear who is responsible for the delivery and that there are certain obligations on the provider to do that in a very timely way, otherwise it will delay development.


The Housing Industry Association went on to say:


It should not take more than a couple of phone calls and a meeting to sort out it being put into the critical path of the development, otherwise those projects will be delayed whilst certain things are waiting for a provider to provide that infrastructure.


Unfortunately, the complex arrangements in this bill do not give the certainty that the Housing Industry Association is seeking. The unfortunate consequence is that there is likely to be a bottleneck as projects queue up to get the tick from the National Broadband Network Co.


Thirdly, let me turn to the most substantive point I want to make, which is that the approach in this bill is a very poor approach when it comes to the question of competition policy in telecommunications. The practical effect of this bill is to minimise competition and choice as to who will build fibre networks in greenfields locations in new developments. As a consequence, this bill represents a missed opportunity to impose effective, competitive and cost discipline on the National Broadband Network Co. If there is one thing we have seen in spades to date, it is that the National Broadband Network Co. certainly requires a healthy dose of competitive pressure. If it were the case that developers had a viable option to use a party other than NBN Co. to build out fibre networks in their develop­ments, then developers would be likely to choose parties other than NBN Co. if those parties were able to build a network for them more cheaply, more quickly and more conveniently. That, in turn, would produce a more efficient outcome if it meant that infrastructure in new developments were built at a lower cost than if all fibre in new developments were installed by NBN Co. under a monopoly. It would also have the incidental and not trivial benefit of getting live and operational fibre networks into new developments as they were being built rather than developers and, in turn, the people who will live in those developments, being forced to wait until a connection can be made at a time of NBN Co.'s convenience. Let me remind you, Madam Deputy Speaker D'Ath, that NBN Co.'s stated build time frame goes out to 2020. They are already months behind their plans.


So, under the model chosen by this government in which all paths run to NBN Co. unfortunately many Australians are going to be waiting a very long time to get a fibre connection, and it is richly ironic that there is already in place a private sector market which is successfully delivering fibre connections in new developments. Yet, this government's policy approach is to specific­ally impede, slow down and put hurdles in the way of the operation of that private market. The consequence is that many Australians moving into new developments will be waiting longer to get fibre connections than they would be if this meddling government had left the matter alone. Despite the empty commitments and despite the vapid rhetoric from the minister for broadband who claimed, 'Developers will be able to source fibre from competing fibre providers if they wish', the economic reality is that he and his government have set up arrangements under which developers are given a very strong financial incentive to deal with NBN Co. and a very strong financial disincentive to deal with anybody else.


According to the explanatory memor­andum, installing the fibre-ready infrastr­ucture, which is mandated by this legislation, costs around $800. There was also evidence provided to the committee that the full cost of installing a fibre connection is $1,500. Put these two numbers together and what you see is that the developer is up for an additional incremental cost of at least $700 per lot if the developer chooses to contract with a competitor to NBN Co. rather than, as the government wants it to do, just leave it and wait until NBN Co. comes along. Unfortun­ately those who will suffer will be Australians moving into new premises who would have expected, had the private sector market continued to operate, to have received a fibre connection. They will now be waiting a very long time in many cases, given the very long period over which NBN Co.'s operations are scheduled to occur.


Fundamentally the regime established by this bill is damaging to competition in the market for the provision of new fibre infrastructure and there are three reasons for that. Firstly, it exposes existing non-NBN operators, who are already in the marketplace providing fibre connections in new developments, to competition from a government funded competitor with enorm­ously deep pockets, which is prepared to install fibre at zero cost to any developer which has incurred the expense of building trenches and other fibre-ready facilities. In effect that makes it impossible for those competitors of NBN to continue to operate competitively with it.


Secondly, this bill is damaging to competition because the standards as to what constitutes a 'fibre-ready facility'—for example, a pit to be built in a new development—will in practical terms be set by the National Broadband Network Co. For example, proposed section 372W of the bill says that a fibre-ready facility is one which amongst other things satisfies such condit­ions as are specified by the minister. It is clear from the statement of expectations issued by the government last year that NBN Co. will be in the driver's seat in determining what the minister specifies because it says:


The Government expects NBN Co to provide guidance on technical specifications as early as possible.


The statement of expectations also says that NBN Co. would consult with the Comm­unications Alliance. But let us be absolutely clear and lay to rest this misleading claim being made by government members today that, in some way, the existing industry process will continue. That is absolutely not the case. Under the existing process the Communications Alliance makes the decisions. Under the new process NBN Co. will make the decisions and the Commun­ications Alliance will be required to rubber stamp them. There is plenty of experience as to the damage to competition that occurs when the dominant player is able to set technical standards. It was for that precise reason that, in 1989, the power to set technical standards was transferred from Telecom Australia to an independent body. This government in this bill, as in so many other ways, is going backwards in a very bad way when it comes to competition.


Thirdly, this bill is very damaging to competition in the market for the provision of fibre because it fundamentally undermines business models used by greenfield fibre operators today. 


This bill needs profound amendment if it is not to seriously damage competition, and I commend to you the amendments that the coalition has moved.

"O'Neill, Deb, MP",ALP,2011-07-04,"



Ms O'NEILL
 (Robertson) (16:59):  I rise to speak in support of the Telecom­munications Legislation Amend­ment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011. In reflecting on the comments of the member for Bradfield, one would think that compet­ition is at the heart of this bill and the sole and only interest he has in the debate. The reality is that we are dealing with a very practical, real-life matter that will impact profoundly on the lives of Australians, and I am very pleased to support the bill put to the House.


This bill puts into legislation an election commitment to make sure that all new developments, subject to exceptions, are fibre friendly. That means that new resid­ential developments will be able to connect to a fibre-to-the-premises network without the need for further work being done to the premises. At its heart, this is an equity issue. The bill applies to developments conducted by corporations, which includes the vast majority of development and construction companies nationally. The bill certainly has application on the Central Coast, the region that I represent, and it has the capacity to significantly enhance employment and life outcomes for people living in new dwellings on the Central Coast.


Given that the National Broadband Net­work is a Commonwealth project des­igned to benefit the national economy, it is very desirable that this legislation be enforced under Commonwealth law. As with many other members of the House, the National Broadband Network has been a priority issue in my electorate and much of my work as a local member in this term of parliament has been to ensure that the potential of the NBN is effectively understood. I have been working very hard with local health, educ­ation and other business sector partners to help to bring about the earliest possible rollout in my electorate.


I have been meeting with key stakeholders on the NBN on a regular basis and have been campaigning for a priority rollout on the Central Coast. Key people driving this initiative in my area include Dave Abrahams, an IT specialist, who has become quite a champion of the NBN, Edgar Adams, a local business advocate and representative, and even Paul Budde, who consults intern­ationally on the NBN. Each of these men and other leaders in our community see that connecting the NBN to all premises, both new and established premises, is a critical part of ensuring that all Australians are able to move forward together as this technology becomes available. The National Broadband Network certainly arouses great interest in my electorate and it is seen by many local business owners and community leaders as a critical means by which to level the playing field between those living in regions such as mine and those living in the cities, represented by the member for Bradfield, and to come to some equitable arrangement in terms of access to the world economy.


The Central Coast is a region with unique challenges. It is a growing area, a place where small business is vital for the health of the local economy and where new develop­ments are coming online. On the Central Coast, small businesses provide services and employment for the people in our region. I am very proud of our local businesses and I am particularly proud of local IT companies that compete nationally and internationally to provide services. Many of these small and medium sized businesses operate from the Central Coast and provide local employment and opportunities for our residents. I certain­ly will support anything in this parliament that enables better participation and more local employment, and I herald the excel­lence of our local staff in engaging in this growing field.


In terms of the personal and business assets that we have on the Central Coast, I believe that the National Broadband Network will help us to develop and extend already successful businesses to further improve their success and, because of that, I support this bill which will enable a more effective rollout of the NBN in the region. In ensuring that development corporations install the carrying infrastructure of the NBN, the general rollout of infrastructure will certainly be more efficient and effective. The bill will also ensure that, after the National Broad­band Network has been rolled out, all new developments fulfil their responsibilities as to future applications of the internet in the delivery of health and education to homes through the installation of fibre-friendly infrastructure.


It is also vital that we are prepared for the reality that new businesses and new business models are yet to be born and that their infancy may be in small businesses, not in boardrooms with desks and those sorts of facilities, but in small home offices or in the new mobile world of local cafes in which entrepreneurs are increasingly doing busin­ess in open-to-view social settings. This is common-sense legislation. It is a move to equity because it will ensure that new residential premises, where new businesses may well be emerging, are able to take complete advantage of the NBN. The bill will also enable the cost of the NBN to be reduced in new residential developments because there will be access to non-carrier ductwork in those developments.


This bill represents an initiative to roll out the National Broadband Network in an efficient and effective way. No-one can deny that rolling out the NBN is a challenge in terms of infrastructure. But nation building infrastructure is always challenging; it is both visionary and practically challenging. It is always a challenge for any government to provide critical new infrastructure. We have only to look back at the challenges faced by governments that undertook commitments to roll out the railways across this great country of ours, the national road network to connect us across all of those miles and the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Opera House. All those critical pieces of infrastructure involved having a vision for the future and a commitment to ensuring that the practical work was undertaken to enable them to come into being.


Infrastructure as comprehensive as the National Broadband Network is certainly ambitious, but it is also very responsible. It is ambitious in that it calls on our generation at this time to invest in the capacities of the next generation and to make the NBN a critically productive part of our economy. It is responsible because we know that, without access to this internationally empowering technology, we would be making a decision to exclude our people from participation in the global digital economy and workplace.


I often hear from, and read reports about, people from the conservative side of politics who assert, with misunderstanding, that this vital piece of infrastructure is not needed. But I am delighted to be part of this government, which has decided to undertake the challenge and commit itself to ensuring that the project is completed. I do hear from the other side of politics that we should not be bothered with this and that it will be a blow to competition. But competition will not support people in homes yet to be built if we do not support this legislation and put it in place to the advantage of new home dwellers. The NBN is certainly not just about upload capacity. It is far more sophisticated than that. It does a lot more than enable fast downloads of movies. It has the capacity to transform our economy and also to have a profound impact on social benefits for our community. In terms of its social impact, one of the critical things that we have seen just in the last couple of days is the capacity for medical appointments to be teleconferenced across large distances. Currently this can happen in established premises but this bill will address the reality of yet-to-be-built premises also having the capacity to delivery health services, and that needs to be considered in the development of this bill.


The national economy as a whole benefits from the economic growth and health of the nation's regional areas. The economic poten­tial of an area such as mine needs to be realised, and this can only be done that if we are able to engage with the global market. Another social benefit of the National Broadband Network is obviously education. In my area we have the benefit of quality public and private schooling. Our children certainly benefit from access to these quality schools. When they return home to their new houses in new developments they need to be able to access the internet. We need to get on with this job in a way that is equitable. University students on the Central Coast are also critically impacted by decisions made in this place about the rollout of the NBN. Currently students can access materials online and correspond with other students online, but they also need to be able to do this from the sites at their homes, in the new developments, and critically that is what this bill is dealing with.


High-speed broadband based on fibre-optic technology will be vital in enabling the development of a great future for Australia. It will provide regional schools with resources; it will provide regional commu­nities with access to health. This is a nation building initiative. It is going to have far-reaching consequences on which this parliament can look back with pride.


This bill enshrines the powers invested in the Australian Communications and Media Authority to develop standards in relation to third-party use of the network. The long-term success of the National Broadband Network is absolutely reliant on the successful interr­elation between owners of the infrastructure and the providers. The powers that have been invested in the ACMA and the ACCC will ensure that there is appropriate regulation and competition in the provision of these services from the National Broadband Network.


I support this bill because it demonstrates the government's commitment to ensuring a vital piece of infrastructure for Australia's future is completed and a success for all Australians. This goes exactly to a comment made by the member for New England: 'You do it once, you do it right and you do it with fibre'. I look forward to the day when the National Broadband Network has been constructed and our economy and society is advancing as a result, be it in new or established housing. I know that day will arrive, and I believe when it does my cons­tituents will benefit enormously. I commend this bill to the House.

"Prentice, Jane, MP",LP,2011-07-04,"



Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (17:10):  No-one disputes the benefits of a national broadband network. The coalition support high-speed broadband but what we do not support is the outdated monopoly telco model being run by the incompetence of NBN Co. The member for Robertson said that this will impact profoundly on the lives of Australians, and indeed it will because for generations we will be paying off the billions of wasted dollars spent on the NBN and the NBN Co.


For far too many years Australian consumers and businesses have suffered from over-priced telecommunications. I look back to over 30 years ago, indeed last cent­ury, when a subcommittee of the Sydney Chamber of Commerce decided they had to do something about the monopoly of Telecom Australia, as it was known then, and from that ATUG was born—the Aust­ralian Telecommunications Users Group. For many years, we saw ATUG and other industry bodies struggle to bring competition into the market, struggle to bring in some competition for products, service and pricing. Finally, just as we were achieving competition, we were handed back a last century model, a last century way of doing business—NBN Co. a monopoly. This is not the way forward and this is not the way other countries around the world are rolling out their telecommunications.


The amendment proposed by the member for Wentworth and the coalition is about greenfields sites. We already have an exam­ple in Townsville, in the seat of Herbert, where a developer is desperate to sign off on his new development but he cannot get anyone to lay the fibre in the conduits, which he has already provided. This is because NBN Co. have told him that it is not ready yet, but when it is ready it will roll over the top of what he has already done. So, once again, we have the bully-boy tactics of some of the people at NBN Co. They are threat­ening very good opportunities in greenfields sites and, furthermore, some of our redeveloped brownfields sites in Brisbane. Some years ago, the local government in South-East Queensland wrote to the federal minister seeking assistance in this area, and of course, as usual, the response was silence and it was deafening—absolutely no resp­onse let alone assistance. The local govern­ment wanted to get on with the job and do it then. But many of those areas will be left until 2020 before they can get competent communication facilities.


When we look at the greenfields sites we see the need for and the benefit from some of the smaller companies providing those facilities. We heard before about some of the innovation that could come from it. A trial was conducted in your area, Madam Deputy Speaker D'Ath, in Virginia in Brisbane. Fibre optic cable was rolled out from Virginia to Chermside at less than a third of the cost projected by NBN Co. We have seen NBN Co. sack the messenger, as in two of its officers, because they came up with a fibre rollout above their projected cost. Yet we had an example, which we offered to them to look at, of where we had done it for less than a third of their projected costs. I support the opportunity of private companies rolling out fibre. I think it will be a benefit. I think we might see some different methods of doing it.


It is very disappointing that NBN Co. have chosen to ignore some of the other models around the world, like Bournemouth, where this rollout has already occurred efficiently and effectively. There are opport­unities there. There are lessons to be learned but NBN Co. have the protection of the Gillard government and are not interested in doing anything cost effectively or efficiently because they do not have to worry about that and because they know the poor taxpayers will have their hands in their pockets to pay for the rollout cost.


There is no doubt that the rollout of NBN will be of benefit, but the problem we have is the way it is being done and the cost. I look at facilities such as a new industrial estate near the airport in Brisbane where we already have high-quality, high-standard fibre throughout the development. Yet NBN Co. have told them that they will roll over the top of it. It will not necessarily be with anything better—possibly with something inferior—but they are so determined to protect the monopoly to keep out other people that they are prepared to roll over and waste money on a product that is already in the ground and already operating.


That is the mentality we are trying to deal with in this bill. That is why the member for Wentworth has proposed some very reason­able amendments to facilitate assistance on some of these greenfield sites and new estates. They are not just in Herbert. They are in the western suburbs of Brisbane. They are areas where, if we were more relaxed about competition, we could benefit already and people could have it before the 2020 date.


The member for Wentworth mentioned South Korea, where fibre goes to the basement of the building. There are other methods as well. He mentioned copper. They have also have satellite and wireless. They do the extra mile waiting for the take-up so they can look at benefits going forward. We do not have to roll out the tens of billions of dollars solution that has been proposed.


It is a bit like giving all the roads to Ford and letting Ford control the model of the cars that go on them. That is the restriction we are putting on our consumers and on the industry. Once again we are consigning Australia back to the last century for communications, for overpricing. Once again we see that the Gillard government is all about grand plans, but always with other people's money. There is opportunity here for private enterprise to be involved but, no, we have to get the NBN Co. privatised, a monopoly that only they control. The only conclusion we can draw from the continual refusal to refer this for a cost-benefit analysis is that there is something more to hide because I cannot understand why you would not benefit from having a cost-benefit analysis, from seeing where we can save money, from seeing where we can partner with private enterprise and providing open access.


The world declared the music industry would fall over when Napster was introd­uced because there would be open access. Anyone could put up whatever they wanted. Yet we have seen it flourish and benefit from open access. I believe an open access, synchronous, ubiquitous NBN would be of benefit to all Australians. We need to work with private enterprise, not against them. We will get a better deal for taxpayers, a better deal for the users of communications and, hopefully, a better deal for Australia. I commend the amendments put forward by the coalition and I really hope for a better outcome.

Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (17:18):  It is a great pleasure to witness the rollout of a historic nation-building infrastructure project like the National Broadband Network. It is a great privilege to be part of the Labor government that has the vision and courage to embark on a major reform and a major project such as this. It is a great privilege to support a major structural reform to Australia's telecommunications industry that simply would not have been brought about had we not embarked upon this project, a reform that is going to benefit consumers for decades to come.


The NBN will enable the Australian econ­omy to grow, to transform and to adapt into the economy of the future, thereby securing our prosperity. The NBN will provide Australia with world-class broadband techn­ology. It will open up a genuine choice of services and drive competitive prices for consumers, whether they live in capital cities or in regional Australia or in rural and remote areas.


In supporting this project and speaking on this Telecommunication Legislation Amend­ment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011, which is an important part of the package of legislation to roll out the NBN, it is an absolute pleasure to stare down the nay-sayers on the other side who have had nothing but carping negativity and criticism on this project from the very get-go. I will go through some of the carping criticism that we have experienced on this project to show where the nay-sayers have been proved wrong even at this very early stage in the delivery of the project.


They know that they are wrong. The shadow minister knows it, the member for Bradfield knows it, and everyone opposite who represents regional Australia in this place knows it because they would have received the phone calls, letters, emails and questions from constituents saying: 'I have heard about this NBN. When is it coming past our suburb? When is it coming into my house?' It is disappointing that the member for Gilmore, which adjoins my electorate of Throsby in the Illawarra and has been chosen as one of the pilot sites, instead of champion­ing this as a local representative, is out there day in, day out bagging it and showing her lack of understanding and support for what it means for the local region. It is not so for all the political representatives in the Kiama and broader South Coast area. There are many political representatives who are great champions of this project. It is a good news story for our region and for the people on the South Coast and in the Illawarra. I simply cannot understand why the nay-sayers spend so much time and energy talking it down.


The NBN will be a boon to electorates in regional areas like the Illawarra and the South Coast because it will quite simply bring economic, social and community infrastructure right into people's homes, thereby connecting them to the markets and to the entertainment not only of the capital cities but also the world. As an MP for a region that adjoins one of the pilot sites, it is a privilege to join with local organisations like Regional Development Australia Illaw­arra and the Kiama Municipal Council in imagining a broadband future for the region. Only recently new funding was announced to help local councils, including the Kiama Municipal Council, take full advantage of the National Broadband Network through the development and upgrade of innovative online service delivery to homes and businesses. Under the Digital Local Govern­ment program, which the minister announced a few weeks ago, the Kiama Municipal Council will receive in excess of $370,000 to develop digital solutions that can then be adapted by other councils and rolled out across the country as the NBN rolls out. I know from my conversations with the mayor, Sandra McCarthy, and other councillors on that council that they are very pleased to be involved in such an exciting and innovative project.


It is also a great privilege to play a small part in the facilitation of this project by speaking on and voting in favour of the legislation that marks each step of the steady progress towards providing fast, efficient and affordable telecommunications services for the Australian population and in particular regions like my own where there are still suburbs where people are unable to receive broadband services because of the way that the exchanges are configured, the lack of broadband capability from the local exchanges, the geography of the region and the build-up of many of the new suburbs and the way they were wired up to telecom­munications services using mainly RIM based technology.


When it comes to matters NBN, I am pleased to speak today in support of this bill, the Telecommunications Legislation Amend­ment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011, which will ensure that no more will we see suburbs built up without having access to fast, reliable broadband services because in the process of building up those suburbs we will be digging the pits and laying the pipes and the cable which will ensure that when people move into those new houses they will have the capacity to switch on broadband services from the very get go. That is perhaps something that some of those who live in electorates where they are not building new suburbs may not understand, but I can tell you that in the electorate of Throsby where we have two new suburbs in West Dapto and Albion Park going in it will make an incredible difference to people who move into those homes to know that they will be wired up from the very beginning. So I welcome it.


The telecommunications fibre deployment bill amends the 1997 act to do a number of things that affect the provision of utility infrastructure in new real estate develop­ments. The bill requires developers that are constitutional corporations to install fibre ready passive infrastructure. It requires this passive infrastructure in the long term footprint of the NBN project to be fibre ready. Penalties will apply if a constitutional corporation sells or leases land or a building situated in a new development unless fibre ready facilities have been installed, thereby creating the requirement that these facilities are there for the new suburbs when they are built.


The bill creates a power that enables the minister to specify new developments in which fixed lines which are installed need to be optical fibre. Finally, this bill enables the Australian Communications and Media Authority to make standards for customer equipment and cabling for use with the NBN and other superfast networks. The outcome of the legislation will be that residents of new developments will have early and less costly access to the NBN network when it is rolled out into these developments.


Those on the other side have identified the issue of cost in relation to this legislation. Nothing could be more costly when building a new suburb than overlooking the opport­unity when the trenches are being dug, the footpaths are being laid and all the other utilities are going into those houses in a new estate and saying, 'We will put electricity, gas and sewerage in there but what we will not do is connect you to the National Broadband Network. We will not be laying fibre optic cable into those suburbs because we have a blind spot when it comes to the National Broadband Network. We will leave it to the market or some other solution to lay cable in those areas.' Nothing could be more wasteful. Nothing could be more costly than saying, 'We will leave it until some other time or not at all.'


You can imagine the outrage of local residents having moved into their beautiful new suburb with new footpaths, new gardens and new grass laid down when all of a sudden it is decided to lay fibre optic cable into the suburb and in comes the trenching gear digging up concrete that has just been laid for footpaths or digging up grass that has just been laid or perhaps laying a new layer of overhead cable through these areas. They will all be scratching their heads and asking, 'Why on earth wasn't this done when the street was laid and the power was put in?' If we left it to the wisdom of those opposite, that is exactly what would be occurring. The propositions within this bill are nothing more than militant common sense. Unfortunately it is militant common sense that is not shared by those on the other side of the chamber.


I will take the opportunity to talk for a moment about the agreement between NBN Co. and Telstra and Optus, because it is good news for telecommunications customers. Definitive agreements have been executed that, together with Telstra's structural separ­ation undertaking, create a framework for Telstra's participation in the NBN. The NBN Co.-Telstra definitive agreements, including an interim access agreement, provide for the re-use of suitable Telstra infrastructure by NBN Co. and for Telstra to progressively structurally separate by decommissioning its copper network and broadband HFC network capability during the NBN fibre rollout and using the NBN to provide fixed line services to customers within the fibre footprint. The definitive agreements translate the financial heads of agreement signed on 20 June 2010 into detailed, legally-binding agreements. The NBN Co. has also negotiated a deal with Optus to migrate its HFC customers to the NBN. So what we have here really puts a huge hole in the argument that was being run by the member for Wentworth and many of those who have rallied to his call. I have to say that the member for Wentworth takes to this argument as a man with not too much enthusiasm. What those opposite have been saying for most of the last nine months is that this NBN is somehow going to be a great big white elephant, that it is going to be a communications service with no customers and that it is something we are overinvesting in because nobody is going to use it. The agreement that has been reached with Telstra and the agreement that is being reached with Optus show what an outrageous untruth that was and how they simply do not understand how this project is going to roll out. 


As a result of these agreements we are going to see the migration of all of the fixed-line customers of Telstra and Optus onto the National Broadband Network. The National Broadband Network will be the backbone. The fibre-optic cable of the National Broadband Network and all those intercon­necting networks will be the telecom­munications network which is delivering fixed-line telecommunications services to those millions of existing Telstra and Optus customers. Far from being a vacant white elephant, from the very get-go as that migration occurs, those fixed-line customers who are currently having their telecom­munications service delivered through the ageing copper network are going to be migrated onto the optical fibre network, the modern NBN, and those services will be delivered. They will be enhanced services. Presumably Optus and Telstra will retain the retail relationship with their customers, but it will be the NBN which is delivering the telecommunications service.


This is good news. It is good news for the customers of Telstra and Optus but it is also good news for the country because it shows that there is a way forward, after in excess of 12 years, when literally nothing was happen­ing in terms of reforming the telecomm­unications regulatory system in this country, reforming the telecommunications market and investing in a fast, reliable, high-speed broadband network. Nothing was happening, particularly in electorates like mine. This legislation, together with the other reforms that have already been introduced, is seeing real reforms being rolled out to real people in real houses in real suburbs. The caravan is moving on and the dogs are barking. We know that there is a need and a hunger for it. 


According to the OECD statistics regard­ing average broadband subscription prices, out of 33 countries Australia is the third most expensive country for very low-speed connections, the 14th most expensive for high-speed connections and the 12th most expensive for very high-speed connections. As a result of this legislation, together with the other package of reforms and the investment that is going on today in laying that cable and connecting those houses, we are reforming not only the technology but the telecommunications market. There will be more players in the market and the net result of this is going to be faster, more reliable, more ubiquitous broadband services for the people of Australia and for my electorate of Throsby, and that has to be a good thing. I commend the bill to the House.

"Tehan, Dan, MP",LP,2011-07-04,"



Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (17:33):  I rise this evening to talk about the Telecom­munications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill, which once again demon­strates this government's ability to take an area of policy, an area of the economy, which is functioning and working well and to potentially turn it into a mess. The greenfields sector for the provision of fibre-optic services was an area which was working relatively well, and now we have a government which, unfortunately, is legisl­ating to make a mess of this area and, it would seem, to entrench monopolistic practice, which I do not think it can be argued is in anyone's interests. 


We have had already a dissenting report from coalition members of the Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network, which examined the bill. Coalition members have called for three amendments for three main reasons, three very valid reasons. Firstly, the regime established by the bill is unnecessarily slow and bureau­cratic for property developers, so rather than speeding things up and creating less red tape this bill is going to have the potential to do the opposite. How we can come into this place and argue that we want to see optic fibre rolled out more slowly in greenfields sites and for there to be greater bureaucracy in the way it is rolled out beggars belief, but that seems to be what the government is proposing here. 


The second reason that coalition members believe that the bill needs to be amended is that, as presently drafted, it  represents a missed opportunity to take advantage of the existence of the competitive greenfields operators to impose effective competitive and cost discipline on NBN Co. It is especially worth highlighting the phrase 'to impose effective competitive and cost discipline on NBN Co.' I think we would all argue that we need to see that when it comes to NBN Co., because if we do not we are going to see the creation of one of the greatest white elephants this country has ever seen. In an area in particular where the market seemed to be working quite well, we now look like we are going to have a bill which will impose more uncompetitiveness and less cost discipline on the behemoth which this government is setting up in this area, NBN Co. The third reason that the coalition members believe the bill should be amended is that the regime established by the bill is damaging to competition in the market for the provision of new fibre infrastructure. So, rather than driving further competition into the sector, it is actually going to do the opposite. They are the three key reasons the coalition has problems with the Telecom­munications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill. I will explain in a little more detail what these problems are and then raise another issue which is directly relevant—the rolling out of broadband to greenfield sites where we will not be able to provide optic fibre. That was being done under the Australian Broadband Guarantee program, which was meant to run for an additional 12 months. Sadly, the govern­ment, although it said on its website that it was to run for another year, has pulled the pin on it. We now have to rely on NBN Co. using satellite to provide services in this area. That has caused sovereign risk damage to those wireless providers that were operating under the Australian Broadband Guarantee—something which we have seen occur all too often with this government. It also means that consumers in areas where we will not see fibre to the premise are going to suffer because they are going to get delayed and inadequate services provided by satellite. I will touch on that in a bit more detail as well.


The NBN estimates that 1.9 million greenfield households will have to be connected to the NBN by 2020 and 250,000 households will have to be connected by June 2013. You would hope that what we get is less red tape and more competition to make sure that this occurs. The NBN has allocated more than $100 million to connect greenfield households. Once again, we do not see any detailed costings or analysis on how the NBN will allocate its money. It is just that we have a figure of more than $100 million to connect greenfield households within the first year of operation. In the first five months of 2011, NBN Co. received more than 1,480 applications from greenfield developers, representing approximately 133,000 premises to be connected across Australia. So there is demand for these premises to be connected. The problem is that the marginal cost of installing fibre in new housing developments is low compared to the benefits. The government's policy paper on greenfields estimated that the cost of rolling out a fibre-to-the-premise conn­ection is approximately $2,500, which is about $1,500 greater than the cost per premise of a broadband capable copper based connection. However, the increased cost will not always be paid upfront by homeowners. Traditionally, it has been split by developers and telecommunication providers who recoup costs through offering superior services. 


Although we on this side support regulation that would ensure fibre to the premise is used in greenfield estates, there are several concerns. Changes to the market structure will ensue from the role of NBN Co. as a provider of last resort. However, NBN Co. has agreed to absorb the cost of rolling out fibre in greenfield sites—costing up to $3,000—which puts them at a competitive advantage to competitors who must come to an arrangement with devel­opers. Again, we have an area of competition where, by setting these rules, we ensure that NBN Co. has the advantage as the behemoth. As the white elephant that it has the potential to become, it will sadly be able to gouge and make sure that where there is competition it will be lessened. 


There is also huge worry—and this is why the design of the bill does seem fraught and lacking—that the lack of consultation with industry will result in an eleventh hour decision that the NBN establishes technical standards that will be too onerous for small providers to meet. In a market where we need to encourage smaller providers, this government is sadly going to create a sit­uation where NBN Co., through onerous regulation, will be able to dominate the market. Part of the rationale that the gov­ernment gave for the NBN is that it would end the dominance of the vertically integrated Telstra. According to the ACMA Communications report 2009-10, Telstra boasts 82 per cent of the fixed line telephone market and 65 per cent of the DSL, which accounts for 82 per cent of fixed line internet connections. 


The opening up of Telstra exchanges have to an extent diminished Telstra's dominance. The number of unbundled services offered by competing ISPs increased by 23 per cent between June 2009 and June 2010. Telstra's share of the market was reduced from 70 per cent to 65 per cent. However, the greenfield market is incredibly competitive. Of the 909,000 cable and fibre connections in Australia, more than 400,000 have been connected by small operators under the greenfield fibre operators of Australia. The government's own policy document on greenfield estates states:


The installation of FTTP is taking place in a competitive context, with developers typically contracting out the provision of infrastructure and services in developments. 


Why then are we again looking to concen­trate commercial power in this market when the government's own documents say that we are seeing good competition here? 


Once again we are seeing a government that seems to want to re-regulate, to create a large player to replace Telstra and, sadly, to impact on the small providers.


On that matter, I want to spend some time looking at what is happening with the Australian broadband guarantee, because we are going to see the same thing happen there as well. We have small competitors operating and providing services through wireless, yet the government is bringing forward the end of the Australian broadband guarantee program by 12 months, creating serious sovereign risk to these wireless providers in country areas. They have now decided that that will be replaced by NBN Co., who have now said that they are going to use satellite. It seems that they are not in a position to roll out the satellite services at the speed with which the wireless providers were under the Australian broadband guar­antee.


There is also no guarantee that an equivalence of service in terms of speed will be provided. It is commonly acknowledged, especially in country areas, that wireless is a far superior technology to satellite and is far more economical from an installation and maintenance perspective. So I would strong­ly urge the government to look again at this issue and urge against using satellite to infill or provide a quick fix for wireless areas whilst the NBN wireless network is built. We should see a continuation of the Australian broadband guarantee program, at least for another 12 months, until NBN Co. and the government can get their act together and we can see wireless once again being provided to those regional and rural areas which will otherwise suffer while this 12-month or potentially two- to three-year gap in satellite provision is filled by NBN Co.


This bill needs a serious examination. It needs to go to the Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network, which can look into all elements of it. Sadly, like many other pieces of policy we have seen from this government, in the end it is going to create more red tape rather than less, especially for smaller operators. It seems it is going to drive less competition into this sector rather than more, and this will occur in an area where competition, in the government's own words, has been working extremely well. It is also a shame that what we are going to see, through red tape and costs, is probably that NBN Co. will in the end be the major provider of services in this area and, sadly, will push competition out of this sector. That will be damaging to telecommunications providers and the industry. I call on the government to really think seriously about going back to the drawing board with this piece of legislation, going back to industry, making sure that they consult properly with industry and making sure that we get a piece of legislation which will actually lessen red tape and continue to see strong competition in an area where it already exists.

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2011-07-04,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (17:48):  I would like to begin by telling a story that comes from one of the many mobile offices that I enjoy running through my electorate of Fraser. I was standing one morning at the Kippax shopping centre and a woman came up to me and said: 'There are two issues I want to talk to you about. The first one is that I am retired, I am now in my 80s and I'm concerned about the local bus network.' So we talked for a while about the local bus network, where the stops were located and how that worked for her. Then she said, 'The second issue that concerns me is superfast broadband.' She said: 'I like to communicate with my daughter using Skype, and the picture is really patchy at the moment. You keep on talking about this superfast broadband thing, but when are we going to get it? When am I going to get a video connection that allows me to connect with my daughter?'


What this brought home to me is that those opposite are just so out of touch when they think that superfast broadband is about tweens playing video games. Superfast broadband is a technology that will funda­mentally transform Australian society, and it will do that wherever you are on the age spectrum. That is why there are pensioners in my electorate, there are working age people and there are students who are enthusiastic about superfast broadband.


We know some of the ways in which superfast broadband is going to begin transforming our lives. We know, for example, that it will allow access to medical specialists. If you live in an area which does not have a particular medical specialist and you want the chance to see a podiatrist, say, then you will have the option through superfast broadband to do an online consult­ation with a specialist. Otherwise, you might have to wait in pain for weeks or months until a specialist comes through your town or you have a chance to travel to a place where they are. But with access to superfast broadband we will be able to use technology to deal with the challenge of distance.


With education, of course, superfast broadband is again a transformative techn­ology. I know from the institution where I used to work, the Australian National University, that we initially experimented with what it would be like to have experts do a video seminar. It turned out that the existing technology just was not snappy enough. It really did not feel like you were in the room with the presenter. We tried it once with my friend John Quiggin, who is at the bleeding edge of technology. John's present­ation was great, but it just did not work for those of us not in the room in the way it would have worked if he had been there. But as the connections get faster, as we get those 100 megabits a second speeds that are promised by some of this technology, we will get to technology where it will feel like you are in the room. That will fundamentally transform the research enterprise. It will change for the better the experience of being in an academic seminar. No longer will we need to rely on seminar speakers being in the same city; we will be able to immediately have a presenter from the best universities, whether they be in Boston or Beijing, brought in by superfast broadband. That will make Australian researchers more prod­uctive.


Superfast broadband will also transform the employment experience. At the moment, it is a challenge if you are a part-timer working in a team. People sometimes say to me that it is okay having one part-time worker in the team, but if you have two or three it is really hard for the team to get together and have a team meeting once a week. But one can easily imagine a situation under superfast broadband in which it is possible for a member of that team to be brought into the conversation, to join the team meeting, maybe for just half an hour in order to be part of the team, and to improve their promotion opportunities at the work­place. It allows the opportunity for part-time workers to be far more integrated into the workforce than they have been before. It offers the potential for people, rather than burning up time and putting out all those CO2 emissions when they fly to a meeting interstate, to use superfast broadband be part of that meeting, to use that new com­munications infrastructure to have quick conversations with people in other states and to make their small, medium or large business even more productive.


I was at a forum in Gungahlin, in the growth heart of my electorate of Fraser. The questions the Gungahlin Community Council asked about NBN Co. were not, 'Why we are having it?' or, as the member for Wannon might have asked, 'Couldn't wireless do the job?' Those questions were not asked. They asked, 'When are we going to get superfast broadband and could we speed up the process?' They are enthusiastic about the opportunities it offers for improving econ­omic growth and the standard of living in Gungahlin. They recognise that we should, as the member for New England once said so pithily: 'Do it once. Do it right. Do it with fibre.' They recognise, as the member for Wannon and many of those opposite do not, that wireless has saturation problems. It is all very well if you are the only person connected to the wireless signal—then the speeds might be alright. But as other people come onto the network, as we get the crowding that happens as more people join the network or the crowding that we get over the day as more people log on at peak times, then the network slows down, becomes congested and ceases to be effective. That is the real challenge of wireless. It is a fundamental technological point. I am always mildly surprised when those opposite seem to be unfamiliar with the simple idea that wireless signals have saturation problems. We on this side of the House are committed to a National Broadband Network which will transform Australia for the better and be a key economic reform which sits alongside the major economic reforms that the government is putting in place.


The bill before the House, the Telecom­munications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011, will require developers that are constitutional corpor­ations to install fibre-ready passive infrast­ructure—infrastructure that makes it possible to quickly install fibre networks. It requires passive infrastructure installed in new developments in the long-term NBN fibre footprint to be fibre ready. This of course is a common-sense reform, one that is important to have in place to ensure that as many Australians as possible are able to get access to the National Broadband Network. The legislation allows carriers to access fibre-ready passive infrastructure owned by non-carriers and provides for the ACCC to have a role as the default arbitrator. The legislation creates a power for the minister to specify, by legislative instrument, developments in which fixed lines must be optical fibre. Giving the minister that power will be important in ensuring that the fibre network works as well for Australians as it can. It will provide for exemptions from the requirem­ents to install fibre-ready facilities for optical fibre lines, it will provide for ACMA to develop technical standards that will cover interoperability, performance standards, and design features for superfast broadband rollout.


This legislation is critical to the government's policy of rolling out the National Broadband Network. It will ensure early and less costly access to fibre based broadband for residents in new develop­ments. New developments, of which I expect to have many in my electorate—Fraser having most of the growth suburbs in the ACT—will experience cheaper superfast broadband. Getting that superfast broadband will be absolutely critical to those new residents feeling that they are part of the fibre network, that they have the benefits of superfast broadband network and that they are part of a community.


I have doorknocked some of the outer suburbs of the Fraser electorate. I know that, sometimes when you are doorknocking a growth suburb, you get a sense of frustration from people. Whether it arises from the bus networks, the road networks or the electricity networks, the sense of frustration of those in growth suburbs is keenly felt. This legislation accepts that that is a real issue and it steps up to the plate. Through this legislation we are saying that residents of new developments should get access to superfast broadband and that they deserve access to superfast broadband, with the e-health, e-education and teleworking benefits that superfast broadband will provide. It will give us reduced costs for the deployment of fibre by access to non-carrier duct work, ensuring that, to the greatest extent possible, we can use existing ducts and pipes rather than having to dig new ducts. There is no point in digging up footpaths that do not need to be dug up. If there are ducts in place, we want to create the opportunities for NBN Co. to use those ducts. Of course, this bill is implementing measures announced almost two years ago. The financial impact is expected to be small and it will be met from NBN implementation funding. In conclusion, I stress that the legislation before the House today is very much of a piece with a set of reforms that the Gillard government is committed to. We are committed to making policy not for the snappy grab on the evening news but for the long game—long-term reform, not simplistic three-word slogans. Those long-term reforms contain things such as compulsory superannuation—superan­nuation that will provide retirement security for millions of Australians, ensuring that Australians have the security of knowing that they can retire in dignity. We are putting in place a set of education reforms that will transform productivity—reforms such as providing school accountability through the MySchool website, rewarding the best teach­ers through performance pay, moving to demand driven university funding, and providing trades training. 


All of these root-and-branch reforms of the education system are about ensuring that in the long run we have an education system that delivers productivity, because we on this side of the House know that long-term growth in living standards comes fundam­entally from long-term growth in productivity. That is why we are so committed to these productivity-enhancing reforms such as superfast broadband and education. 


Climate change is, of course, another area in which we are committed to the long term. We listen to the scientists. We listen to the economists. Of course, when the Leader of the Opposition does not like what he hears from the scientists, he is willing to go out into crowds of sceptics carrying unusual placards. When he does not like what he hears from the economists—and he is, of course, yet to find a single economist who will back his scheme of so-called direct action rather than a market based mechanism and carbon pricing—he says, 'Maybe that reflects on the quality of the Australian economics profession.' My former co-author, Joshua Gans, who won the medal for the best Australian economist under 40 a couple of years ago, put it best on his blog when, in response, he said that, no, that actually reflects on the quality of Australian opposition leaders.


Those opposite are opposed to fundam­ental long-term reform in the area of climate change. They are concerned instead with slogans. We on this side of the House are concerned with the long game, with ensuring that we price carbon and make the steady transition to a low-emissions Australia. We are committed to the highway network of the 21st century—the National Broadband Network—laying down an infrastructure that will be as critical to future generations as the road network and the rail network are to ours, an infrastructure that those opposite will oppose now but, I suspect, will look back upon in their dotage and think: 'How did I do that? How did I find myself on the wrong side of that debate? What was I thinking in saying that Australia should be stuck in the slow lane of the information superhighway?' I commend the bill to the House.

"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2011-07-04,"



Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff) (18:02):  In this debate on the Telecommunications Legisl­ation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011, it is indeed a unique privilege for me to have the opportunity to follow the member for Fraser, for a number of reasons. One is to do with the very first example that the member for Fraser gave of why the 'superfast broadband', to use his words, that the Labor government is rolling out through NBN Co. is going to be such a revolution in this country. He said that it will enable those in remote areas to interact and have a consultation of sorts—a virtual consultation, if you will—with a specialist somewhere else, and that this is going to revolutionise the health industry. Otherwise—and he had to walk a very fine line here—that person could be left waiting for weeks to consult a specialist. I noticed he never referred to the fact that state Labor governments have presided over the at-times abysmal health system in this country, with various public hospitals having extraordinarily long waiting lists. That was conveniently left to one side.


Notwithstanding that, he made the point about this revolution that is coming as a result of superfast NBN broadband. He must not have been here in question time. Where were you, Member for Fraser, in question time? Had he been here listening he would have heard the Minister for Health and Ageing and the Prime Minister wax lyrical about the revolution in health. It was a matter of only a couple of days ago that the Prime Minister was in Darwin and the health minister was in Adelaide and they undertook a consultation between a specialist and a patient, one in Adelaide and one in Darwin. There is no NBN, but this happening now. In fact, the government was crowing about it in question time. There is no need for the expenditure of some $53 billion of taxpayers' funds to build the NBN; it is happening today. What an unfortunate choice the member for Fraser made for his very first example of how the NBN is going to change the way Australians will live.


I am also a little intrigued, following on from the member for Fraser, about the way in which the Labor Party seems to have taken to its beating bosom the notion that the NBN is going to be the greatest thing since sliced bread. We hear it from member after member as they trot out their various speaking points. They have the fever—the new religion—that the NBN is going to be the thing that changes the world. You can almost hear them all saying 'amen' in unison as the various members of the Labor Party stand up. It was fascinating to hear that it is not just fast broadband, high-speed broad­band or a somehow faster form of broadband. What we kept hearing from the member for Fraser, over and over again, were those two words that, almost for dramatic effect, he ran together: 'superfast broadband' he kept saying.


I am intrigued. There was an article only a week or so ago that spoke about the opport­unity there might be for new technologies to allow data transfer speeds of up to one terabit per second. We have the government talking about superfast broadband at 100 megabits per second. I would love to see the member for Fraser come back into the House, if we do have one-terabit data transfer rates, and talk about 'super-super fast-fast' broadband or some such thing. You can almost sense the excitement. I know I was excited listening to it, but I have to say, the Labor Party is like any good spiv with a silk tie. Unfortunately, the Labor Party is filled with salesmen. It is filled with salesmen rather than people who actually know what they are talking about.


We also heard the member for Fraser wax lyrical about saturation problems with wireless technology. A country of 22 million people potentially has saturation problems with wireless technology! I interjected, but I am not sure whether it was picked up by Hansard. I asked, 'What do they do in India and China?' The last time I checked, the populations of those countries were a little bit bigger than ours. And, the last time I checked, those countries had full access to mobile telephony and full access to data transfer. I think even Korea and Japan do, as well. So just maybe the argument that wireless technology cannot deliver these same outcomes is a little bit spurious. The reality is that, like everything from the Labor Party, it is a case of 'Sell the sizzle but not the sausage'. This party is the sausage factory extraordinaire. This Labor Party is just feeding in the rubbish and hoping that what it can sell is the sizzle. It will get up and speak in debates like this about how it is going to provide superfast broadband, about how it is going to help 80-year-old pensioners or about how it is going to be the glorious revolution of the health industry, despite the fact that their own minister and Prime Minister, at lunchtime and in question time today, highlighted that they are already doing the things that the member for Fraser was saying were only going to possible because of NBN Co. Do you know what else is possible? Not only are his examples redundant, not only will the NBN be potentially redundant—




Mr Perrett:
  Potentially redundant!




Mr CIOBO:
  That's right, potentially redundant—but in my own electorate of Moncrieff on the Gold Coast—Australia's innovation city, as we are officially titled—we have Telstra rolling out 4G wireless technology today. I hope the member for Moreton knows what 4G wireless technology is.




Mr Perrett:
  It's better than 3G, is it?




Mr CIOBO:
  I am looking to see if he actually knows what I am talking about, because he is going to speak on this. Telstra is rolling out 4G wireless technology that allows—shock, horror!—100 megabits per second. That is what it is doing now through cellular telephony—100 megabits per second under 4G technology. And do you know what, Mr Deputy Speaker: it is not costing taxpayers a cent. It is not costing taxpayers a single, solitary cent for Telstra to roll out 4G technology with 100 megabits per second.


If you listen to the Labor Party, you might think: 'Look, Steve, you're getting a bit excited for no reason. We are going to have NBN. It is going to change the future of the Gold Coast. It is going to change the future of Australia's most service industry oriented city in the country. It is going to change the future of the sixth largest city in the country.' Unfortunately, the Gold Coast is not even slated for NBN rollout for the next six years. It will be six more years before it even thinks about rolling out fibre across the Gold Coast under NBN Co. This is coming from the Labor Party, which expects the Australian public to take it seriously when it gives us this kind of piffle. That is exactly what it is: a gigantic investment in ego. It all comm­enced with Kevin Rudd, the member for Griffith, when he was the Prime Minister of the country, and it has been continued by the current Prime Minister because it needed to be a matter of policy consistency. Heaven knows the Labor Party needs some policy consistency, and the reason we are now seeing Australian taxpayers being slugged to the tune of $30 billion to $50 billion is so the Labor Party can roll out its revolutionary fibre to the premises, FTTP, NBN. 


When Labor talks about a revolution, there is a revolution all right. It will be the revolution of the children of today who are going to be encumbered with debt as a consequence of this junk policy from the Australian Labor Party. That is not to say the technology is all rubbish, not for one moment. Perhaps the member for Moreton should listen, because he might be able to understand the difference—




Mr Perrett:
  I am about to point out a few.




Mr CIOBO:
  Yes—between policy and technology. The reality is that there are benefits that flow from fibre to the node and, indeed, from fibre to the premises. There are benefits that flow. The coalition's problem is not with the technology per se but with the fact that the Australian Labor Party has effectively taken all of our eggs, when it comes to the technology, and put them in one basket. It has delivered a great big monopoly to NBN Co. At a time when the rest of the world has walked away from government publicly owned monopolies, we are embra­cing it lock, stock and barrel through the Australian Labor Party. You have really got to wonder why it would do it, because in all these highly saturated areas where there is a degree of population density—so every capital city, including centres like mine in the Gold Coast and other major regional towns like Cairns and Townsville—we have the ability for there to be a commercial rollout of this technology, for private providers to be in the space and for this technology to be made available. 


Nowhere is this more apparent than with respect to greenfield sites, which this bill turns to. Nowhere is there a greater example of direct, private investment in greenfield sites than there is through the fact that there is a very large percentage, often in excess of 50 per cent of greenfield sites, that historically has seen the deployment of so-called pits and other fibre technologies through the development of the greenfield site by private operators. This bill actually goes some way towards making sure that that basically does not happen. The reason is that, because of the designation of NBN Co. as a provider of last resort, because NBN Co. will pick up the cost associated with greenfield sites and because NBN Co. will often wear the cost associated with pits, we now have an incentive for developers to simply walk away from these things—although it is legislated—knowing that NBN Co. will be undertaking those activities and doing it at taxpayers' expense.


I have no doubt that NBN Co. will be extraordinarily successful, for lack of a better term, with respect to greenfield sites. This is because any developer with half a brain will know there is no point in their hiring a private operator to undertake these activities or in their undertaking these activities themselves because taxpayers will subsidise the entire deployment of fibre at their greenfield site, thanks to this bill going through the parliament tonight. That is what the Labor Party is going to deliver them. There is little wonder that I and many Australians are deeply cynical about Labor's policy with respect to NBN Co. There is little wonder that we recognise that this is an investment in ego and not an investment in good policy. Good policy would dictate that there should be a level platform that enables the private sector to compete for those markets where it is commercially feasible to do so. Good policy would dictate that where there is not a commercial case to undertake this investment, that is when the government should step in. But that is not what we have from the Labor Party—that is coalition policy, it is not Labor's policy. Labor's policy is to say, 'It doesn't matter whether it's commercial or not. Taxpayers will under­score the entire project.'


For cities like the Gold Coast, where Telstra is already in the process of rolling out wireless technology providing 100 megabits per second, with no cost to taxpayers, and where the Australian Labor Party does not even have a schedule for NBN for six years, the Australian Labor Party says, 'No, you've got it all wrong, Steve. The taxpayers have got it all wrong. The NBN is the way to go because taxpayers will pay for it. It will be in excess of six years but, hey, it will have been worth it.'


I am unashamedly opposed to the complete waste of taxpayers' money that is NBN Co. Where it is not commercial for private providers to undertake that activity, fine—the Labor Party would carry me. But the reality is that in the vast majority of instances, it is commercially feasible, it is already happening, and the highest concentration of private providers in this space—who are about to have their throats slit by the Labor Party because of the passage of this bill—is with respect to the deployment of fibre-ready technologies in greenfield sites.


Labor members opposite, who are now sentencing to an economic death a number of employees with those private providers who used to undertake these activities, should know that that has happened because of the passage of this bill. They should know that that is what they are doing. They are making sure that private providers, who have demonstrated usually at least 50 per cent of the time with greenfields sites that they can undertake the job, will now no longer be in a position where it is economic for developers to engage those private providers and instead to have NBN Co. step in. That is the consequence of Labor Party policy and it is yet another example of how Labor has its policy priorities completely screwed up.


Furthermore, when you listen to the paltry excuses put forward as to why this needs to happen, when you hear the member for Fraser—one of the golden boys of the Labor Party—giving an example, which has been used by the minister today, which has already taken place, and not something that requires NBN Co., when you see the deploy­ment of technology by 100 per cent private money through Telstra on 4G wireless technology, it is little wonder that I and so many others are so deeply cynical about this government's spendathon when it comes to the absolutely reckless manner in which they are about to expend yet another $30 billion to $50 billion of taxpayers funds building a massive new government monopoly. This is not good policy and the Australian people will certainly not be grateful for the Labor Party undertaking this activity.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2011-07-04,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (18:17):  I thank the member for Moncrieff for his contribution. I was in his electorate last night at the National Awards for Excellence in School Music Education at the Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre, which I think is in his electorate. It was quite a wonderful affair, handing out some awards on behalf of the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, Mr Garrett. It is amazing to see how young musicians and music teachers can all link up around the world and take advantage of this emerging technology. I was glad to see that he was accepting of the advances that will come with technology.


The legislation before us, the Telecommunications Legislation (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011, as you well know Deputy Speaker Sidebottom, is all about a common-sense approach to what goes on in new residential developments. I know there have been many new residential develop­ments on the Gold Coast strip, between my electorate and the Gold Coast—I see them when I drive down there. We are making sure that the nation is fibre-ready, that each of these new developments gets it right in terms of the ducts, the pits and the pipe—getting our ducts in a row, I guess—from one development to the next development.


This is a good, common-sense economic policy which is what underpins the entire NBN in the first place. It is all about making sure our future productivity is in an interconnected nation—beyond the major urban centres, beyond the Gold Coast and the glittering lights, and into the regions. While the member for Moncrieff can say, 'Yes, on the Gold Coast we are doing okay; we've got 4G', a good government governs for the entire nation. Obviously, there are some problems whenever you get a few people on the 4G system. It goes slower and the technologies of the future will be hamstrung—that is why we need to have these complementing each other. We need to look beyond the conurbations to the rural and regional areas and look at the opportunities that will come for all of Australia.


This is a practical measure that we have before us. Basically, all we are saying is that if any developers who are constitutional corporations—able to be controlled by the government—are building some infrast­ructure, they make sure it is fibre-ready. It is easier to do the pits and the pipe at the start of the development process rather than retrofitting something to a development, ripping up footpaths and all those sorts of things. These are an inconvenience and part of the burden that comes with an NBN program which is such a visionary scheme. It does make more sense to do it at the onset rather than later on.


This allows the carriers to access the fibre-ready passive infrastructure that is owned by the noncarriers and provides for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to have a role as the default arbiter. It applies to new real estate develop­ments because the fibre will be rolled out across the nation to 93 per cent of premises. It is important that we get it right in these new developments. There has been extensive consultation with the development industry about these reforms. It is not something that has been sprung on them; it has been able to be built into the price. As I said, this keeps the cost as low as possible for the ultimate consumer of the National Broadband Network.


Rather than just saying, 'Let the market rip', which seemed to be the approach by the member for Moncrieff, this is a common-sense approach with the gentle guiding hand of government saying, 'Why don't you do it early on, rather than just wait for the market to decide.' As we all know, with anything it is best to do it upfront rather than retrofitting. Even in a building such as this, which is only 21 or 22 years old, in the last year there have been problems in meeting the technology needs of a modern parliamentarian. Things change quite quickly, so it is best to have the capacity to deal with each new develop­ment—they need to be lined up so that the pipes and pits are ready to enable the NBN to be rolled out. This is a very practical response to rolling out the NBN. 


I saw that the member for Moncrieff was quite overheated. Maybe he was a bit riled because of what we saw two weeks ago, with the NBN Co. representative standing alongside the Telstra and Optus represen­tatives, indicating that this is happening and that this is real. This is the biggest investment in infrastructure since the Snowy Mountains scheme—it is beyond the Snowy Mountains scheme. It is being rolled out now. I understand, Mr Deputy Speaker Sidebottom, that Braddon has benefited greatly from this. The benefits are more than just within the nation. The NBN is able to link the regions, link the cities, link them with the world and create business opportunities overseas.


We have seen a lot of signs and symbols lately. When I open my paper or when I watch the news at night, I see the Leader of the Opposition in a hard hat, stalking a manufacturing business—turning up and spreading his big fear campaign about the carbon tax. That is an important symbol, a visual symbol. It seems to be what the media is interested in. I assume there are people out there now stalking the retailers or manufact­urers of Queanbeyan and looking for an opportunity to say, 'We need the opposition leader to come along like he does in so many of these places.' I think it was the Ford Motor Company factory in Geelong where he turned up. He does not actually go in and talk to the workers; he just turns up, talks to middle management, puts the hard hat on and then off he goes. We get what he sees as the sign and symbol and then off he goes. It does not matter that the opposition's plan is actually to rip $500 million out of the car industry. He does not want to go in and talk about that; he just wants to run with a bit of a fear campaign.


While I am talking about signs and symbols, I note that where the NBN will be very useful is in schools. As a former teacher, I know how much things have moved on. I can remember the internet first coming into the classroom when I was in my last few years of teaching. Now you go to classrooms where the kids in grade 1 and even kids in prep are using computers in a way that is unbelievable. That is why you have to be prepared. Obviously, the NBN will complement our education policy—over $65 billion invested in education. Symbols are important when it comes to education. We have debates in here about education; we had one today. Over the years of the Howard government, we had those wonderful—more than 2,000—flagpoles rolled out throughout Australia. It is important that we give our flags a space; we all know how important a symbol that is. But compare that with the 2,000 libraries that the Labor Party rolled out or with the other investments in school halls, language centres, science laboratories—all those things are obviously much more than just symbols.


I have been following the broadband shenanigans opposite for quite a while. I know it is hard to get it right because the technology changes so quickly, but I think there were about 20 failed experiments. They kept having problems. I think one of the problems was that one of the rollouts was based on the planning assumption that Australia was as flat as the Netherlands, but then someone pointed out that there were some mountains and valleys and a few things like that in the Australian landscape. Even though we are the flattest continent, we do have some hills, especially in places like Brisbane.


I particularly remember when, some 12 or 18 months back, the Leader of the Opposition had an interview with Kerry O'Brien—it might actually have been the last interview he had with Kerry O'Brien—talking about the NBN. What was the Leader of the Opposition's major grasp of what the NBN would be used for? For sending e-mails, I think. I am sure he has moved on a little bit since then and does see the business opportunities, the productivity opportunities and the employment opportunities for rural areas, regional areas and our cities. It would be nice for him to go back to our national broadcaster and engage with people about the NBN. We hear that his instructions to his shadow spokesperson were very simple—to rip up the process, to just say no. It is funny—today I saw the Leader of the Opposition talk about having an $85 million plebiscite because he wants to consult with the people, but he will not talk to our national broadcaster about any topic, it seems.


Anyone who has been in this game long enough knows that the Australian economy faces challenges. We have a high dollar at the moment, so that makes it hard for our manufacturers to compete on the world market. Our labour costs are high compared with those of most of our near neighbours, so it is hard. There are pressures out there; pressures on manufacturing businesses, pressures on lots of sectors of the economy, even labour shortages in certain sectors. However, those opposite are basically suggesting that we go down the low road. Their answer to the question of how to bring those costs down is to attack wages. This is a short-term fix and will not provide any great productivity boost. The smarter way to approach the problem is the high road—to try and boost productivity. Obviously the NBN will provide a massive number of opportunities to boost productivity.


As a Queenslander, as someone from the most decentralised state in Australia, it would be ridiculous for me to stand here and say, 'My electorate is in inner-city Brisbane, so I will be all right. The bush can be forgotten.' That seemed to be basically what the member for Moncrieff was saying—let the market rip, and they will be right. The markets are there in the bigger cities, but obviously a good government looks after the country. I am from country Queensland myself, and apart from the NBN no-one is in any great rush to roll out to the country areas. I can understand why the Leader of the Opposition found it hard to consult with the member for New England and the member for Lyne about the advantages that the NBN would bring to them when he did not have an understanding of it. Anyone with a connec­tion to rural areas would understand the benefits that will flow.


I note that there was a dissenting report to the report presented by the member for Lyne. This dissenting report is 5,096 words—we could have saved a lot of time and effort if the Hon. Malcolm Turnbull had just said no. It would have been as simple as that. That was obviously going to be the tactic—just say no, do not go into any great detail. The dissenting report was basically 5,096 different ways to say no. Thankfully the committee has taken a bit more time to look over the issue and see the advantages and, as we see the NBN rolled out to the 93 per cent of premises that are preparing to take advantage of this massive piece of infras­tructure, I think this dissenting report will be seen in the proper light.


The bill basically contains four key measures in proposed part 20A. It enables the minister to specify new developments or classes of new development in which the fixed lines that are installed must be optical fibre lines. So there is the capacity there to take advantage of the local situation. Also, the bill provides that when fixed line facilities are being installed in a develop­ment, these facilities must be fibre-ready. That is a common-sense approach—do it up front and it is cheaper. It is a case of a stitch in time will save nine, rather than having all the problems that go with retrofitting and ripping up concrete. Third, the bill will have the effect of basically requiring constit­utional corporations to install fibre-ready facilities on or in close proximity to their developments. We do not want to have the rail lines all over again where we have different sizes and they do not match. This is the 21st century and we want to make sure that they all fit together for the benefit of the nation. (Time expired)

"Randall, Don, MP",LP,2011-07-04,"



Mr RANDALL
 (Canning) (18:32):  I am very pleased to speak on the Telecommunications Legislation Amend­ment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011. The NBN is an issue in my electorate and it is an issue around Australia. The electorate believes this is a very ham-fisted, expensive operation to deliver what could have been delivered by the private sector. Now the government is essentially renationalising communications in Australia. We are going back to the days of the PMG. We are almost in the business of renationalising telecomm­unications and phones, et cetera. The government wants to control and own everything that we operate now.


What brought this about? What made the Labor Party decide to spend somewhere between $30 billion and $50 billion? And why do I use such a wide range of figures? Because the government does do not know how much it will end up costing. It was not that long ago that we heard NBN Co., through its pristine-charactered Mr Quigley, say it could not get anyone to build the network, so it pulled the contracts. Nobody wanted to build it for the cost it was thought it could be built for. Of course there are going to blowouts. The people who saw this build as a cash cow are now suddenly running into a bit of heavy weather.


Why are we in the position we are in? Largely because the Labor Party, on taking office, fell out with Telstra. We did not like Sol Trujillo very much—I certainly did not and I said a lot of unkind things about him in this House, which were largely all true—but falling out with somebody does not mean you decide to totally uproot the system you have and then go and borrow a massive amount of money to renationalise telecom­munications in this country. President Obama had the same situation confronting him in the last 12 months and, rather than saying it was all too hard and he would get the government to build it, he allowed the private sector to roll out enhancements to the telecommunications system in the United States with a mix of technologies.


As previous speakers, including the member for Moncrieff, have said, we have put a lot of eggs in one basket. We have gone with fibre to the premises, which used to be called fibre to the node, and this is the most expensive option that could have been chos­en. Our shadow minister, the member for Wentworth, Malcolm Turnbull, knows something about this. He was one of the early entrants into this technology years ago, when he was a cofounder of an internet company, so his credentials in this area are quite good. He describes this as watching a slow-motion train wreck, and that is what is happening—it is a slow-motion train wreck on the roll-out and implementation of this program.


The sad thing is that the future mums and dads of Australia and their children will be paying for this slow-motion train wreck even although it did not need to happen. There could have been a fat controller at the signals to stop this slow-motion train wreck. The controller is not there because both the previous Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, and the current Prime Minister have just given the Minister for Broadband, Comm–unications and the Digital Economy his head and allowed him to run rampant on this issue. I am in one of those curious electorates that causes problems for this particular rollout. I have high-density urban, outer metropolitan, semi-rural, rural, agricultural, hills, beach sides, small towns under 1,000 people—I have the whole gamut. That is why people in my electorate are very concerned about this issue. In fact, they have called public meetings on this and they have called me to meetings in their own houses to say: 'We are very concerned. What is happening to that Telstra line that goes past my house now? Will I still be connected to that or do I have to sign over?' When it first started people were not sure, but we know now that Telstra has received $11 billion in taxpayers' money from NBN Co. to take over its lines. Of course Telstra and its shareholders are happy because it is an absolute cash cow at the moment, but the good old taxpayers of Australia have forked out $11 billion to take over existing infrastructure. Whether it gets used or whether it is overlaid in certain areas, we do not know.


The incredible thing about this is that by having put all their eggs in one basket and given the number of years it will take to rollout, there is a real chance that eventually the technology we are talking about could be redundant by the time it gets to your home. In Piara Waters and Harrisdale in my electorate there is an area that is partly greenfields and partly constructed and Telstra have stopped putting infrastructure into that area. The residents there have asked me, 'I cannot get ready access, so what are you going to do?' With their old copper wire network and RIM technology, Telstra are feeding out a few ports here and there from their exchanges, but they are not committing to any significant build because they are saying to my constituents, 'We're not going to come and build anything new for you because the NBN's coming and we're not going to spend any money on something that is going to be overlaid in the next six, eight or 10 years.' As a result, they say, 'Here's a phone for you.' They give them a second-rate mobile phone to use because of the universal service obligation. It is just a short-term fix. It really is a bizarre situation.


The towns that are further out in my electorate and which have fewer than 1,000 residents will not get part of this. We just heard the member for Moreton give us a figure of 93 per cent. I thought it was a bit higher than that, but I take his figure of 93 per cent. A whole lot of small towns in my electorate, like Jarrahdale, Mundijong, Serpentine and Preston Beach, will not be getting any meaningful telephony or internet connection through the NBN. To me it is really quite wrong and sad for anyone who is in an outer urban area to not get those services, despite this massive spend.


Mandurah in my electorate is an example of how we need to address some of the original problems. It is about an hour from Perth and it is still on timed local calls. We are trying to get Telstra and the regulators to broaden the zone, but the town is still paying for timed local calls in this day and age. We heard from the member for Moncrieff telling us about how on the Gold Coast, Telstra, as a private operator, is currently running out lines that are capable of 100 megabits per second. I have an article here titled, 'Move aside NBN, the future's already here.' It says:


Australia's Academic and Research Network say they're doing what the NBN will do in a decade, today.


So NBN Co. is going to take a decade to get speeds of 100 megabits per second to your house, but here we have AARNET giving the NBN a run for its money because they are going to deliver those speeds now through something quite simple:


… the research network announced yesterday that it successfully boosted the delivery speeds of its existing fibre optic network simply by placing 40GB 'muxponders'—supersized transponders—onto either ends of the cable.


You put these muxponders at either end of the cable and you get these speeds over longer distances. So the technology is going to race ahead of the NBN, despite its cost. I have two cases in my electorate that bear going over again. I have raised these before and they have not been fixed. There is the case of the Carey Baptist College in Forrestfield in my electorate which needed decent speeds for the school. It has outgrown its own site right now and it is going to move onto another greenfield site further down the road, which will have its own issues of internet connection and telephones et cetera. The school has sought my help in getting faster speeds and better connections. I have pointed out that Telstra does not want to help anymore because the NBN is meant to be coming to this region. Interestingly, and I say this in the nicest way because Senator Sterle and I have an arrangement on these matters—we criticise each other and we have broad enough shoulders to handle each other's criticism—in an article on 21 June 2011 it was reported:


Labor Senator Glenn Sterle took a swipe at Canning MHR Don Randall over his claims Carey Baptist College’s broadband and internet problems were due to the National Broadband Network.


Mr Sterle said Mr Randall attempted to lay blame on the NBN despite knowing the problems had existed for more than a decade.


As I pointed out in this article, it was a free kick, Senator Sterle, because when this school was being constructed I was there to try to force Telstra to provide the services to the school. I assure you that if I had not involved myself in this the state office would have said: 'We have no arrangement. In fact, they'll have to pay for the infrastructure costs. This is a non-government school.' So they tried that on for a while and when we decided to put a bit of pressure on them at the national level they eventually came good. So thank you for the free kick, Senator Sterle. Paul Oates, the administrator from the school, pointed out that if I had not been involved, they would not have got it. But they are still struggling because there is this big disconnect: Telstra are not providing anything because, 'The NBN's coming' and the NBN are saying, 'We don't know if we are going to get there.' Even Mandurah, whom Senator Sterle refers to in this article, are saying that it is going to be one of the first places to be rolled out. Most of the infrastructure is in the ground in Mandurah but the speeds are not sufficient. They have already set a few dates when Mandurah will be rolled out and every one of them has been missed. They failed all the rollout dates for the particular location in Mandurah around Halls Head. 


Finally, I point to an article in the local newspaper which is headed 'Phone delay frustrates'. Tilling Timber state manager, Jeremy Coleman, says that for 18 months he has been promised phone and internet. The developer in the industrial estate had put the infrastructure in the ground but they have no service because Telstra was not interested in connecting because, remember, 'The NBN's coming.' Telstra did not want to do it, so what did Tilling Timber have to do? They had to spend $36,000 to install an elaborate substitute to get phone and internet connections. They had to get a wireless link from Armadale's industrial park to the R&I building in Perth to get a connection and then that was rerouted through the office. It is the same with their phones. Other businesses out there decided they would not start building until this was sorted out. It was not until I got away from the state office of Telstra and I wrote to David Thodey, chief executive of Telstra, where I pointed out that there was infrastructure in the ground that I got the response that they would put copper wire in that particular area. Before I came into the chamber, I checked on Tilling Timber in this industrial area and I found that they still do not have their infrastructure and they are still not connected to the Telstra network, and they are waiting for other arrangements to be put in place.


This you beaut, fantastic huge NBN investment that could have been done privately with a mix of technologies like wireless and satellite is now going to have all its eggs in one basket. Instead of economical fibre to the node so that copper can be connected to the home, they have gone for the most expensive model, which could be redundant in years. Dare I say, this is one of the failings of this government: if it is not your money, spend it like the Watsons because it does not matter. That is why this government are in trouble electorally, because people do not believe they can deliver for them. (Time expired)

"Saffin, Janelle, MP",ALP,2011-07-04,"



Ms SAFFIN
 (Page) (18:47):  I rise to speak in strong support of the Telecommunications Legislation Amend­ment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011 and I do so for the following reasons. Firstly, it gives effect to the general policy of establishing a nationally consistent, high-speed broadband network to 93 per cent of premises, including residential and others, to provide download internet speeds of 100 megabits per second, and provide fixed wireless to four per cent of premises and satellite to three per cent of premises, including households, at a speed of at least 12 megabits per second. The national network will similarly be open access and wholesale only. This legislation also speaks to a particular part of the NBN policy framework, fibre in new developments. The January ministerial statement articulated that:


NBN Co. ... would be the wholesale provider of last resort in new developments within or adjacent to its long-term fibre footprint and meet the associated cost of this obligation. 


It is really important that this is legislated as new developments are rolled out to ensure we are not left behind. The Telecom–munications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill amends the Telecom–munications Act and that supports the policy that fibre-to-the-premises infrastructure has to be installed in new developments. The bill also reflects the policy that NBN Co. will be the fibre provider of last resort. It adds a new part to the Telecommunications Act to support the rollout of the NBN. It will apply to all types of new developments, including the broadacre estates, the urban infill and urban renewal projects. It will generally apply to new developments in NBN Co.'s long-term fibre footprint. 


There are other provisions in the bill that give effect to this key objective. It requires developers that are constitutional corpor­ations, and we know that has a particular legal meaning, to install fibre-ready passive infrastructure in developments. That is where the long-term fibre footprint of the NBN is. It provides ministerial authority to determine specifications for fibre-ready passive infrastructure, if required. It will allow carriers to access the passive infrastructure that is owned by non-carriers and also, importantly, it will provide for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to be the default arbitrator. Also, it will enable the minister to specify developments in which fixed lines must be optical fibre and determine specifications for such lines. And it has a number of other provisions in it that give effect to the key objective.


The bill gives effect to a particular part of our policy but it also gives effect to the whole policy on the NBN, so I will make some comments that go to the whole and to the general. I have been very active in my local community as a champion of early NBN rollout on the North Coast. One thing I was able to do was to bring together a large group of people who wanted the NBN first. Everybody wants the NBN; that is understandable. It is an eight-year rollout, so we cannot all be first, but if you were NBN-ready then you stood a good chance of getting one of the early rollouts, and we did that on the North Coast. The place was Coffs Harbour, which I call the 'nerve centre' of the NBN rollout.


I worked with the local university, Southern Cross University, in particular with Professor Peter Croll, who is still at the university working on this, to get a submission ready. I also worked with 14 local councils across the North Coast and with local businesses. We were able to put in a submission which said, 'We are NBN ready,' and it was recognised that we were able to take advantage of the rollout.


The NBN Co. CEO, in announcing the site, said that sites were selected on a range of technical and engineering criteria and that the engagement of local government and the receptiveness of communities to broadband initiatives were factors taken into consid­eration. We had those three key elements present: we had the technical and engineering criteria because of the spine that goes up the east coast, we had the engagement of local government—and it was really strong engagement—and we had receptive communities.


This shows how out of step the opposition are. They come in here and talk about the NBN as though it were something that people in Australia were not receptive to. People are receptive all across Australia. We have communities right across Australia saying: 'We want to be in the early rollout. When is it coming? Is it happening now?' Of course it cannot 'happen now' everywhere. It is happening as fast as possible, but it is a huge undertaking. As we have all said, it is akin to building the Snowy project, not only in its size but in what it means for our development and our future. Surveys in my area have found that local businesses—small businesses in particular—know that they need it to be competitive and to stay on top of things. It is not as if we were introducing something 'out there', which is what you would think in listening to the opposition talk about it. They talk about how people could have wireless, but that is ridiculous. Wireless cannot replace it, and I will come to that now.


In speaking about the general policy—and this goes to the whole debate—I will refer to some of the myths around the NBN. The website nbnmyths.wordpress.com brings this together very nicely under the heading 'The top 10 NBN myths debunked'. The first one is: 'The NBN will cost taxpayers $43 billion. We can't afford it and it's uncosted'. The website says:


False


First, the government investment is capped at $26-27 billion, not 43. The remainder will come from revenue and NBN Co’s private debt.


It then has a whole lot more to say about the claim, that the project was not studied and costed. What was the KPMG-McKinsey implementation study if the project was not studied and costed? It found that the network could be built for $42.8 billion—that was prior to the deal with Telstra—would not have any net cost to the government and would have an estimated net value of $40 billion in 2025, earning a return on invest­ment of six to seven per cent, which is more than enough to repay debt and equity used to build the project. It just makes good sense. The website cites the NBN business case summary, saying it revealed the total cost of the network to be lower than the initial $43 billion estimate. If people just read, all the information and facts are there.


The second myth that is debunked is: 'If it were viable, the private sector would build it'. That is completely false. The private sector have had a long time to build it and they have not done it, because the private sector do not usually initiate and undertake nation-building projects that are of benefit to the whole country, that provide the infrast­ructure for the whole country to take advantage of in health, education, small business, farming and agriculture—in a whole range of areas. The private sector could not and would not afford it. Are parts of the private sector going to join together and say, 'Yes, let's initiate this project worth over $40 billion'? That is a huge investment for any company and well beyond any telco I know of that is operating in Australia. The website says:


The private sector demand a ROI of at least 12%, because they need to earn a profit for their shareholders. The NBN has a projected 6-7% ROI—


which is a good return to cover any debt. The private sector just would not deal with that. It says:


… while this is well below commercial rates, it's quite acceptable for a Government, which is not seeking to earn a profit.


There are a few other myths, such as, 'We'll never need that much speed or data'. That is completely ridiculous. If you have a look at the increase in the speed of internet access in Australia and what we will have, you see the only way we can maintain this is with a fibre based system and a holistic one to start off with. There is another myth: no-one else in the world is installing such a system. That is false and ridiculous. Fibre to the premises or the home is currently being rolled out across Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and China. It is ridiculous to say that it is not happening in other places. The OECD actually recommends that governments build fibre to the premises networks—so the OECD does recommend it. If national governments do not do it, then who will do it? It is one of those responsibilities that we have as a government to provide that infrastructure. South Korea have announced that they are now spending US$26 billion on upgrading their old 100 megabits per second FTTP network to deliver speeds of one gigabyte, the same as the Australian NBN. This is happening even though they already have a 4G wireless network.


One of the other myths is our internet speed is good enough. That is ridiculous. The facts speak for themselves. I do not even have to go through what the technical parts are. We know that is not true. When you have a look at average speeds, you see the dismal position of Australia's internet speeds. Then there is the other one: a wireless network that can be 4G, LTE, WiMax or DSL—ADSL2+/VDSL/HDSL—can provide the same speed for a fraction of the price. That is false. Much is claimed, usually by those with a vested interest—and that means a vested commercial interest or a political interest—to try to tear it down, because we know that is what the opposition do; they are not interested in nation-building projects like this. Much is claimed about the potential of wireless networks, with speeds such as 300 megabits per second being quoted. But this is highly deceptive, because those are peak speeds per tower, not realistically achievable speeds for individuals. If you have the 300 megabits per second tower and you have two users on it, then that speed would be halved to 150 megabits per second. A trial of 4G/LTE in 2009 showed that with just 20 people using any one tower the speed plummeted to just seven megabits per second. We know that distance, topography, buildings and weather also degrade those available speeds. All this information is available and it does not find its way easily into the debate because all you hear from the opposition is, 'No, we're just going to tear this down. We don't care about it.' They had 12 years to do it. Nineteen attempts failed miserably.

"Briggs, Jamie, MP",LP,2011-07-04,"



Mr BRIGGS
 (Mayo) (19:03):  I rise to speak on the NBN bill, the Telecom­munications Legislation Amend–ment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011, which is before the House and which we are debating. I make the point at the beginning that the coalition, as we always have been, is supportive of fast broadband. It is a worthy and important goal. The development of fast broadband, especially the development of accessible fast broadband at cost-effective prices, is a great economic boon for our country. But we continue to make the point that it is not a case of picking winners in this debate but rather one of looking at a mixture of technologies, which is the important way to go into the future. Countries like the United States of America, with its President Obama, have realised that. We see here in Australia a government born out of central planning days, and we have just heard the member for Page walk us through her distrust of the private sector while talking about how the private sector will not build it because there is not enough return in it, although I note that, as I understand it, the standing policy of the Australian Labor Party is still to sell NBN Co. as soon as it is established. So somehow there has been a mistransmission over the talking points given to the member for Page, because her contribution was questioning the ability of the private sector to invest in networks such as this. She says the private sector would not build something like this. Well, they do build these sorts of networks all the time. In fact, they have built a mobile network.



Ms Saffin interjecting—




Mr BRIGGS:
  Member for Page, as you walk around with your mobile phone in your electorate, which is a regional electorate, you get to use your mobile phone and your wireless devices because the private sector built those towers. So it is interesting that the member for Page thinks that the government is all good and everything that is required needs to be built by the government. That is the view of those opposite, but, of course, we have trust in the private sector and we think the private sector provides services at a far more efficient and cost-effective rate than what government ever does.




Mr Stephen Jones:
  Except when it comes to climate change. Then you want to pick winners.




Mr BRIGGS:
  In fact, that is not true at all, Member for Throsby.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr KJ Thomson
):  The member for Throsby will cease interjecting and the member for Mayo will not respond to interjections from the member for Throsby.




Mr BRIGGS:
  He was completely distracting me, Mr Deputy Speaker. You are right to be raising those issues. When it comes to this bill, I think it highlights how much the government has failed when it comes to this issue. It highlights very much how they find a reasonable idea and turn it into a complete shambles. That very much sums up the NBN itself. As I said at the beginning of my remarks, we support fast broadband, but this is spending billions and billions of dollars of taxpayers' money unnecessarily, excessively and imprudently. We have seen the risk this government is exposed to when it spends such large amounts of money. We have the very sad examples of the green loans and the Home Insulation Program and with that program the government were not even able to put roof insulation batts into people's houses without burning the houses down. We have had the school halls program where they managed to spend about double what the private sector could have spent on building them. We have seen recent examples of digital set-top boxes. They have been spending double the amount of money for which Gerry Harvey or another retailer could have provided them. So when this government gets involved in spending large amounts of money, the Australian people shiver with fear—and so they should. That is why we saw today economic figures indicating a lack of confidence by the Australian people in the economy with housing and consumer numbers plummeting. That is driven by a lack of confidence in a government that is not competent. This is another bill which highlights the lack of competence of this government. There are various aspects in this bill which relate directly to my electorate such as the $40 billion spend on a network, which the Auditor-General's report today reflected upon, that Infrastructure Australia has not even seen. Even though they are meant to be looking at the top infrastructure priorities, the NBN has not been referred to Infrastructure Australia and there has not been a cost-benefit analysis done. This bill touches on the deployment of fibre and that will have an impact in my electorate as it will happen in new housing developments.


I think the arguments articulated by the member for Wentworth and the member for Bradfield have been very well made. The dissenting report highlights the problem that the government is creating for itself. It is trying to centralise and take away the benefits of competition when it comes to new developments. The real effect of this will be higher costs for people building homes in new housing estates. I have many new housing estates in my area, particularly in Mount Barker and Strathalbyn. These are already contentious areas, particularly the Mount Barker development which was forced through by the state Labor government without any consultation with the local community. Now we are seeing the federal Labor government create laws which are going to make it more expensive for people to buy houses in these developments. That was a point well made by the member for Wentworth and the member for Bradfield and very well made in the dissenting report into this issue.


The other area I want to touch upon briefly is that, when it comes to the deployment of fibre into electorates like mine, it is not easy to put it underground. I note that the NBN Co. documents, which were released last December, indicated that they wished the government to allow them to override local council regulations to ensure that they could roll out the fibre overhead, or aerial as it is described. This is a major concern in an electorate such as mine. The Adelaide Hills is the most beautiful electorate in the country without doubt. It is quite obviously not appropriate to put the fibre in overhead cables in a bushfire-prone zone over the longer distances. I understand this will be the intention of the NBN Co. This is a concern in my community and people have been raising this issue with me. As I have a semi-regional and regional electorate, the longer distances will mean that when it actually does get to us—for towns over 1,000 if you believe the government's rhetoric—there will be overhead hanging fibre used. I think this is something that the government needs to address very quickly and swiftly.


I am not the only electorate with this sort of environment. I know the member for Bradfield has raised this issue in regard to his inner-city electorate. Of course it is a lot cheaper for NBN Co. to roll out the fibre overhead. No doubt the arrangements with Telstra may have changed that slightly, but I do not think they would have changed it all that much in an electorate like mine.


This is an issue which I will raise in my local community and ask them how they intend to react if the government decides to roll out overhead wires through the Adelaide Hills, particularly through the bushfire-prone areas where most of the overhead power lines have been removed and put underground. If it is the intention of the NBN Co. going forward to do the same thing in my area, it does raise significant questions about how the business model of the NBN Co. has been planned and what the associated costs will be with using either underground or overhead wires.


My electorate is a black spot area where government funding is required to ensure that there is an equality of service. It is a point that we have always made on this side of the House. In outer metro and regional areas, like my electorate and the electorates of the member for Grey and the member for Barker, there is a need for government intervention because the market fails in those areas, and we have said that all along. Quite clearly it does not fail in city areas, and this is where the big mistake of the government spending billions of dollars unnecessarily and imprudently creates a real risk for taxpayers with the waste that we will see through this spending.


We heard the member for Page earlier say that spending $26 or $27 billion is such a Labor Party thing to do. It is a billion dollars between friends, and we only have $106 billion of debt and a $50 billion deficit this year. This is a fundamental issue about the management of our country. If we look around the world today, one of the great challenges is our Western cousins who are in deep financial trouble because they have spent too much money over too many years. We have seen this Labor government use the public purse without any effort to ensure the money is spent properly and without any effort to ensure that their policies benefit the Australian community. Quite clearly in some areas of the country there needs to be spending to ensure that services are kept up to the level which other Australians get access to, but in the city areas this makes no sense at all. This is an overbuild of existing speed which the market will meet and has been meeting. To think that over the next 10 years we are going to spend billions and billions of dollars of Australian taxpayers' money laying out fibre in areas, which the market would have met, is ridiculous.


In addition to that we are seeing questions about how it will be happening in areas such as mine where clearly fibre is not the answer. In hilly areas I suspect that fibre is not the appropriate answer nor in regional areas because there is difficulty in laying it out or indeed whether you can lay it out at all. It will be interesting to see how NBN Co. deals with that issue. I will certainly be raising it in my local community. If the rollout is to occur in my electorate, in what parts of the electorate will it be, how will it be done and how is the NBN Co. planning to do it in the future? It is a concern. The member for Bradfield raised this concern in his electorate. He raised the point that communities do not want overhead cables anymore. Communities have been trying to move away from that, and there are very good safety reasons in my area for that to be the case. So when it comes to the deployment of fibre in the electorate of Mayo, I think there are legitimate questions to be answered by the government about how this rollout is planned.


The opposition see some merit in this bill. However, we have made some very prudent suggestions, which the member for Went­worth outlined earlier, to improve the bill and to reintroduce competition, which is a major concern when it comes to the NBN. The government have turned what was a competitive market, or 30 years of telecommunications policy about creating a competitive market, on its head by creating another government monopoly that will have the same challenges. I note that the member for Lyne last week made the point about government monopolies not having worked in the past and not being likely to work in the future, and I think that was a very good point. Where the government has gone with this policy is a major concern. It is spending far too much on a wrongheaded policy in areas where money does not need to be spent rather than focusing government effort on areas where money should be spent and allowing the market to meet the demand.


Quite obviously, part of the mix here is wireless. That is where people want portability. They want to be able to use their iPads and their phones and other devices around the place. At the same time, there is no doubt that there is a place for fixed lines, and that is where the market will meet that need. For the government to spend $40 billion odd of taxpayers' money—money that we do not have, borrowed money—makes no sense at all at a time when we already have over $100 billion in net debt and when we see around the globe the great problems that are being caused by governments accumulating debt. Those on the other side will say: 'Don't worry about it. We'll be back to surplus in a couple of years. We've got this wafer-thin surplus that is on the books thanks to the commodity boom and thanks to the high prices that other countries are paying for our products.' But we know that the debt this Labor government is accumulating will not be paid off by this government. It will not even attempt to pay it off because it keeps coming up with harebrained schemes on how to waste the money of Australians, such as spending twice the amount it should on school halls and burning down people's houses with its home insulation program.


I support the remarks of the member for Wentworth and the amendments he is proposing. I also put on the record the concern in my community about the prospect of having overhead cables laid out. That is an issue that I suspect, Mr Deputy Speaker, we will be talking about more often in this House in the coming months and years.

"Grierson, Sharon, MP",ALP,2011-07-04,"



Ms GRIERSON
 (Newcastle) (19:17):  I am pleased to stand here this evening to speak in favour of the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill and in support of the continued rollout of the National Broadband Network. Having heard the member for Mayo, I must say that the repetition of incorrect statements on the government's record over and over again cannot go unchallenged. We have a debt level that is the envy of most nations in the world. It defies logic, intelligence and economic scrutiny that the other side continues to make those misstatements and mislead the public. In saying that, I have to say that the National Broadband Network is a major economic and social reform that will benefit the entire nation.


It is always worth restating our reform record, and it is worth restating it here. The federal Labor government has introduced a number of major reforms of which we on this side of the House feel rightly proud. Our first act in government was to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. In 2008, we apologised to the stolen generation. During 2008 and 2009, our responsible financial management avoided the worst of the global financial crisis and kept thousands of Australians in employment. That was verified again in the last couple of weeks by international bodies pointing out the success of Australia's approach to handling the global financial crisis. On 1 January this year, we introduced paid parental leave for the first time in this nation's history. Just two months ago, we introduced a historic $2.2 billion mental health package, an area sorely in need of attention. Within a matter of weeks, we will release full details of our plan to put a price on carbon.


But one of the reforms of which we are most proud, and should be most proud, is the rollout of the National Broadband Network. It is always worth remembering how we changed tack on this when the market failed to tender for it successfully. I heard the member for Mayo quote the Audit Office on this issue. Being privy to some information from the audits, yes, I think some of us do know that it was one of the biggest market failures imaginable. I would say that it was unimaginable, and I cannot say anymore. As I have said in this place before, this initiative will define this government and its vision for our nation. This initiative will change the way we work, connect and deliver important services, the way we develop and best utilise skilled workforces, the way we overcome skilled workforce shortages and the way we deliver important services such as education and health.


We want a nation that will embrace technology to maximise our economic competitiveness, create the jobs of the future and improve the quality of life of all Australians. We want to overcome the historical disadvantage of the tyranny of distance, both between us and our major trading partners and between our urban and regional, remote and rural centres.


The National Broadband Network will deliver affordable high-speed access to all Australians, irrespective of where they work or where they live. It will extend optical fibre to 93 per cent of premises, with speeds of 100 megabits per second—100 times faster than many Australians have access to today. This bill is a critical element in delivering the government's commitment to extend the NBN to all Australian households and, in this case, into new developments. This bill amends the Telecommunications Act 1997 to ensure that fibre-to-the-premises infrast­ructure will be installed in new development areas. When fixed-line facilities are being installed in a new development, part 20A of the bill will require that facilities be designed, manufactured and installed to allow for the ready deployment of optical fibre cabling. I see no resistance to this bill. I see new developments going into my own area, and part of their promotion is that they are fibre ready. It is a wonderful asset to communities and it is a wonderful asset to selling new developments. This bill will literally pave the way for the physical infrastructure to be in place for the rollout of optical fibre. In turn, this bill reflects the government's policy to be the fibre provider of last resort. So, while developers will be free to use other telecommunications providers, NBN Co. will provide fibre where developers do not wish to use another provider or where no other provider is prepared to deliver the service.


The passing of this bill by parliament is just one of a number of significant steps towards making the National Broadband Network a reality for all Australians. Indeed, we have already passed a number of historic milestones. Last year, the National Broad­band Network was switched on in Tasmania for the very first time. In May this year, the Prime Minister launched the National Broadband Network on the Australian mainland. Since then, the NBN Co. has announced its first and second release sites, which include locations in every single state and territory across Australia. Just last month, on 23 June, Prime Minister Gillard and Senator Conroy announced NBN Co.'s historic agreements with both Telstra and Optus. This paves the way for a very secure future for the telecommunications industry in this nation.


I have to mention my very own milestone when it comes to the NBN Co., and one that I am particularly proud of: the Smart Grid, Smart City initiative, a $100 million initiative, that trials better ways of managing the grid, linking renewables into the grid system and managing electricity use in homes et cetera. It came to my attention that the technologies being applied were not necessarily compatible with the Smart Grid, Smart City and the NBN Co. But that does not make sense, and I am very pleased to say that there are now standardised trials being undertaken by the NBN Co. and EnergyAustralia to make sure that those technologies are compatible and that those two programs can work together. If the Smart Grid, Smart City project is successful, the trial will be run out all around the nation and, of course, go international. NBN will be part of that now.


The sum total of these new agreements with Telstra and Optus is that NBN's network of optic fibre will be rolled out to every household and become the backbone of Australia's communications system. This will be a communications system of which Australians will be rightly proud—not the cut-price model proposed by the coalition that will do little to nothing for regional Australia. Instead, the NBN will provide a 21st century communications system for a 21st century Australian economy. The case for the NBN is, to all but those in the chamber opposite, utterly compelling.


It needs to be recalled that Labor's plan for the National Broadband Network stems from a decade of failure by the former coalition government and the market to deliver high-quality internet access to all Australians. The federal Labor government will not mimic the decade of neglect on telecommunications policy under which Australia suffered during the coalition years. As a Canberra Times editorial noted today, Australian internet usage is expected to increase sixfold in the coming five years. In fact, that editorial drew attention to Gungahlin, a very well-known area here, which does not have high-speed broadband. This is a whole, big new development that suffers for many reasons, but Telstra will not put in the fibre. I have an area like that in my electorate called Thornton. It is one of the biggest and fastest growing housing areas in the electorate. Again, because of a combination of factors, fast-speed broadband cannot be delivered there unless fibre is put in. Telstra has not been willing to do that, which is exactly why we are rolling out the NBN Co. proposal.


Our current infrastructure is barely adequate for our present needs, let alone the future requirements of a 21st century economy. Relying on wireless internet might seem to make sense from the comfortable vantage point of Mr Turnbull's electorate on the harbour in eastern Sydney, or Mr Abbott's electorate in Manly, where population densities and demand make sense for private enterprise to invest in decent wireless infrastructure, but that is ludicrous to those of us in regional Australia where there has been a tremendous failure by private enterprise to provide quality internet access and where there is little incentive to provide 3G services. Indeed, many private telecommunications providers already struggle to provide decent mobile phone coverage across the Hunter region, let alone decent 3G coverage.


The paucity of copper based internet services in my electorate, like much of regional Australia, is already very well known. It amazes me that the opposition keep quoting the benefits of wireless and flexibility. We all want access to that and we are all using it, but we all know that it has to be backed up by physical infrastructure, and that is what we are providing. In those areas where we struggle in peak times to access a wireless service because too many people are doing so at the same time, we know that it will only work with the infrastructure in place. That physical infrastructure is now being delivered all around Australia.


I am certain other colleagues in the House would attest that there is overwhelming support in the electorates of Newcastle and the Hunter for the rollout of the National Broadband Network. My office has been bombarded with messages from local residents urging its speedy introduction. To paraphrase the member for Greenway, who spoke earlier in this debate: the question from my constituents has not been should the NBN be rolled out, but when will it be rolled out to us and why can't it be rolled out faster? I often ask that question myself, because the people of Newcastle do understand the enormous social, economic and cultural benefits that the NBN will bring to a regional centre such as theirs.


I wonder whether coalition members have ever gone onto the NBN website. It has the most wonderful promotion of what the service will deliver. I recommend everybody go onto the website. If you cannot imagine it, go onto the website and see what the NBN Co. high-speed broadband will offer the individual and the nation. My electorate do know that the rollout of high-speed, world-class broadband in the Hunter will make us more competitive. It will erode the tyranny of distance with major capital cities. The towering sandstone hills of the Hawkesbury that now divide us from Sydney will be less of a barrier to developing new business and employment opportunities in Newcastle. The NBN will replace the ageing and unreliable copper networks presently available. It is always interesting to speak to people who have worked for the old Telecom or Telstra. Frequently, they cannot even find where that copper wire is now. The maps have long gone. When these people go into the new little towns in the regions, they have to ask or look around to try to find where on earth the copper is. One aspect of the NBN about which I am most excited is its potential to deliver very real dividends for the health of regional Australians. The Hunter New England Area Health Service, for example, which is headquartered in Newcastle, is responsible for health services in locations as far west as Tamworth and Armidale and as far north as Taree. I keep reminding members Messrs Oakeshott and Windsor just how much the people of Newcastle and the infrastructure of Newcastle have propped up their seats and made sure that as regional seats they have not missed out. That has included the delivery of e-health services from the Hunter New England Area Health Service in my electorate.


The universal availability of high-speed broadband will substantially improve the capacity of places like Tamworth, Armidale and Taree to deliver services and advice in these regions. For example, the Hunter New England Area Health Service, supported by the Digital Regions Initiative of the federal Labor government, is already undertaking a three-year program to deliver telehealth services to more than 200 patients in rural and regional communities and the NBN is supporting that initiative. Most importantly, this initiative connects patients directly to health professionals. The program targets chronic disease sufferers and links them in their own homes to monitoring, education and support services. This potential to connect health professionals with patients in their own homes is truly one of the most exciting features of the NBN for regional Australia.


Some members of the Liberal Party do know the benefits of the NBN system. I draw attention to a new state colleague, a Liberal Party state member in Newcastle, who during the election campaign said he supported the early rollout of the NBN, saying that the 'sooner' it was rolled out to Newcastle the 'better'. I strongly encourage the federal opposition to adopt that vision as well for their communities.


In coming years the federal coalition will have a lot of explaining to do. It has been missing in action on some of the biggest reform issues in this nation. It will need to explain to the community why it has injected a historically high level of negativity into Australian public life, it will need to explain to the community why its campaign of outright lies and exaggerations about the impact of a carbon price did not come to pass and it will need to explain to the community why it opposed the National Broadband Network and the enormous benefits it will provide to all Australians. I commend this bill to the House.

Mr HAASE
 (Durack) (19:32):  I rise this evening to address the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011 and subsequent amendments. The NBN and the process of providing high-tech communications to all Australians—and I underline all Australians—has been the focal point of members of this House for some time. It is quite clear to Australians today that we have a solution to providing that service. Less than $10 billion will provide a very capable and adequate service to all Australians. There is that inclusive again—all Australians.


This best estimate $50 billion service is going to provide ultrahigh speed to 93 per cent of Australians. There is no guessing as to where those other seven per cent reside. They are in my own electorate of Durack. The members for Lingiari, Grey and Maranoa also have a few. There is a large part of this continent where fibre to the premises will never be provided. It is those seven per cent that I am concerned about tonight. Presently, we have a proposition akin to taking out a high-cost bank loan to buy a Lamborghini to go into town and pick up the mail each week. It is dumb, and everyone out there who has ever had to balance a budget and provide facilities at the same time for a family knows that it is dumb. You do not go ahead and borrow inordinate volumes of currency and subsequently push up interest rates across the country to invest in something that is simply not necessary. There are other ways to do this job—ways that we have espoused on and on but all to no avail, unfortunately, with this government who seem hell-bent on constructing monuments. The monument to the Prime Minister, the school halls fiasco, is well known. I believe the NBN fiasco will be well known in the future as a monument to the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator Conroy. But, at the end of the day, it is the taxpayers of Australia who will be footing the bill. You cannot justify borrowing the funds that are being talked about by this government with the taxpayer footing the bill in higher interest rates into the future simply because you want to build a monument. 


There are many parts of my electorate where mobile phones are not available. There is no doubt, however, that wireless communications is the preferred commun­ication method in rural and remote Australia. I hazard a guess that it is also a trend that is catching on swiftly in metropolitan Australia. More and more internet users are demanding that their facilities be mobile. People do not want to be tied to a particular point to gain internet access. Apple found that last year when they released their new product. The iPad was sought after by thousands and sell-outs were swift. By comparison, when the NBN was turned on in Armidale, the government was battling to get any real paying customers to the occasion because Australians do not want to pay through the nose for something that has been rammed down their throats, that they have been told is something they have to have and, what is more, that they will pay for whether they like it or not. They do not like it. If we spent a fraction of the difference between $10 billion and $50 billion, $1 billion is $1,000 million. We talk about billions of dollars as though they simply fall off trees. They do not. In this case they are the dollars of hardworking Australians, for which they will be responsible into the future. If we talk about providing a service to all Australians that is adequate and affordable, we talk about spending about $10 billion.


This particular bill is a very specific bill that relates, in the main, to greenfields. Generally speaking, we accept that in the case of greenfields there is a lot to be done. If we have to have the NBN solution of fibre to the premises, that facility will be provided at a much lower cost if it is mandated to be rolled out in greenfield developments. Keep in mind that the best guesstimate is that by 2020 there will be some 1.9 million premises that will be part of greenfield developments. So it is a very substantial market that we are speaking of.


With the size of that market in mind, we in the coalition believe that amendments ought to be made to this legislation so as to provide for greater efficiencies and greater cost economies in the rolling out of services. We know through past history and experience that, wherever a monopoly is involved, costs have a habit of trending upwards unnecessarily. Presently we have well in excess of 1,000 employees in the NBN and something like 600-odd genuine customers. It is not a ratio that commercial Australia would find very sustainable. If you look at that fact today on the basis of this $50 billion expenditure proposition not being costed, with no triple bottom line analysis and no real transparency in the calculation of the price and the manner in which it will be spent, it is pretty unsatisfactory.


I go back to the amendments. Because of the broad scope and the numbers involved into the future, we firmly believe that operators in these greenfield developments ought to be exempt from the cherry-picking laws. We believe in that because there is room for competition here—and compe­tition, as has been experienced in the past, will bring the costs of providing that service down. Further, we wish to have an amendment that will provide for private operators that wish to set up a network in competition to NBN to have the opportunity via this legislation to do so. Furthermore, there was a commitment that those networks be able to sell out to NBN in a negotiated settlement at some point in time in the future. We on this side of the House believe in true competition. True competition is driven by market forces. Supply and demand is the best solution to any trade relationship. In this case, where you have the opportunity for the creation of a monopoly you equally provide the opportunity for inflated prices. Australians are already suffering that in the areas of groceries, fuel and electricity, and this is not the time to add another level of inflated prices through their internet participation.


We on this side of the House are quite resolved as to what should be the outcome for this bill. If the government will reasonably accept these very rational amendments, we will be happy to see the passage of the bill. In the meantime, I reiterate that the interest of Australians is simply to have a reasonable internet service. Those Australians who have almost no access to mobile phones today and no reliable internet service would be served extremely well with a high-tech, up-to-date wireless internet service that would provide for them to access markets. As an aside, I mention that those markets have, in the main, been shut down by the decision of this government in cancelling live beef exports to Indonesia. But I digress. We need in rural and remote Australia to have access to the internet because remote marketing is an important tool today. But we do not need to go into hock to this extent to provide that service. Rural folk are a fairly sensible lot. They do not believe that you spend above your means. They do not believe that you accumulate absolutely non-serviceable debt in order to brag that you have a Rolls Royce service that you will never, ever need. Therefore, the case remains that this is too much money spent without proper cons­ideration. Unless this legislation specifically relating to greenfields is rationally amended to allow some competition to maintain reasonable costs, those hardworking Austr­alians who want to use these services will be worse off.

"D'Ath, Yvette, MP",ALP,2011-07-04,"



Mrs D'ATH
 (Petrie) (19:41):  I rise to speak in support of the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011. This bill was first introduced into the House in March 2011 and was referred to the Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network in May 2011. The committee sought to conduct an inquiry into this bill within a responsible time frame, considering the circumstances of the bill. This bill has been some time in the making. As noted in paragraph 1.1 of the committee's report on this bill, the bill:


… was preceded by a similar bill which was introduced into the Senate in March 2010, but lapsed on the proroguing of the 42nd Parliament. The Fibre Deployment Bill 2010 shared a similar purpose to the Bill under inquiry, that is, to ‘ensure fibre-ready and fibre infrastructure installation in new developments.’ This Bill differs from its predecessor in that the Fibre Deployment Bill 2010 ‘was more dependent on subordinate legislation for activation of the key provisions in the Bill’, while the current Bill includes those key provisions.


The government undertook extensive consultation on this bill now before the House, including releasing discussion papers and draft legislation. The government also considered the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Environment and Communications report on the Telecom­munications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2010. Based on that history, the industry and developers have been seeking certainty for over 12 months. There is no doubt that certainty is important for developers who each and every day are developing new estates and building homes for people across Australia.


It is this imperative for certainty that ensured that the Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network dealt with this matter within the timeframe set, thus allowing this bill to be debated before this House this week. When looking at the history of this bill, at the questions put to the witnesses by the opposition and the submissions put to the committee by various providers, the fact is that the issues raised do not fundamentally go to this bill. They go to the Liberal Party's opposition to the National Broadband Network and the government's policy to deliver a national broadband network.


The main purpose of this bill is to require developers of new estates to put in passive infrastructure like underground pipes into which a fibre provider can later put fibre. It is not concerned with putting an obligation on NBN Co. or anyone else to put in active infrastructure, fibre or, in limited cases, copper lines or wireless. The majority of submissions by the witnesses and the questions by the opposition during the inqu­iry into this bill went to active infrastructure. It was acknowledged by witnesses that the purpose of this bill is to legislate for fibre-ready infrastructure, not active infrastructure.


The committee's report also acknowledged that much of the evidence was outside the scope of the bill. The opposition also concentrated most of its time on issues not relating to this bill, and it continues to do so in this debate. This is predominately because the opposition is more interested in finding ways to oppose the government's policy than being opposed to the practical application of the rollout of fast broadband.


I will come to the Liberal Party's position shortly but, importantly, this bill amends the Telecommunications Act 1997 to support the government's policy that fibre-to-the-premises infrastructure should be installed in new developments. This bill is another step forward to delivering on the Labor govern­ment's commitment to roll out the National Broadband Network. As stated by the minister in his second reading speech on 7 April 2009, the Australian government announced its historic decision to establish a new company, NBN Co. Limited, to build and operate a new superfast national broadband network.


The NBN has an objective of connecting up to 93 per cent of all Australian homes, schools and workplaces with fibre based broadband services and connecting other premises in Australia with next-generation wireless and satellite broadband services. This bill in effect requires developers that are constitutional corporations to install fibre-ready passive infrastructure—that is, pit and pipe. It requires passive infrastructure installed in new developments in the long-term NBN fibre footprint to be fibre ready; it allows carriers to access fibre-ready passive infrastructure that is owned by non carriers, and provides for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to have a role as the default arbitrator.


It creates a power for the minister to specify by legislative instrument develop­ments in which fixed lines must be optical fibre and provides for exemptions from the requirements to install fibre-ready facilities or optical fibre lines. It also provides for the Australian Communications and Media Authority to develop technical standards to cover interoperability, performance stand­ards and design features for superfast broadband rollout on its own initiative or, if directed, by the minister, and makes other technical and administrative amendments. The bill will take effect on the later of the date of royal assent or 1 July 2011, which unfortunately has passed.


I would like to briefly touch on the standards because there has been much debate in relation to standards. Despite evidence from TransACT, OptiComm and Greenfield Fibre Operators of Australia of them being opposed to ministerial authority to set standards and specifications, and comments made that this should be left to the Australian Communications and Media Authority, there appears to be no real enthusiasm to do so.


There does appear to be some double standards, however, when TransACT in evidence stated that it would expect subcontractors to apply TransACT's standar­ds but it would not be acceptable for NBN Co. to expect the same. Firstly, it is important to note that this bill does not set out technical specifications for fibre infrastructure in new developments. What the bill does do is give the minister some powers to make instruments to do so with regard to passive infrastructure and to optical fibre lines in specified developments if necessary.


The Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy stated in its evidence that for fibre infrastructure to serve its purpose, for example to allow the ready deployment of fibre, and operate on an appropriate level in terms of speeds across the many new developments constructed in Australia each year, some degree of standardisation may be required. These provisions provide a reserve power to fast track this standardisation process if required, noting that normal standardisation can sometimes be time consuming and subject to gaming. The department went on to say:


The government's policy in relation to specifications was set out in the 9 December 2010 policy statement. NBN Co. will provide specifications for use where a developer wishes to use NBN Co. The specifications will also be provided to the Communications Alliance with a view to having these specifications endorsed for general use by industry as soon as possible.


This policy was also reflected in the government's statement of expectations for the NBN and NBN Co. It is clear that this bill and the government's policy, as reflected in the statement of expectations, is flexible. It does not impose specifications without consultation. However, it is reasonable if the industry itself does not develop a standard and it is considered appropriate to do so, that the minister has such powers.


The NBN is already being rolled out in Tasmania and we recently saw the start-up on the mainland of Australia. With the rollout of the NBN continuing to expand across the country over coming months and years, it is important that certain areas do not get left behind. Importantly, it is necessary to ensure that unnecessary costs are not incurred due to lack of planning. That is why greenfields sites are being addressed through this bill. It is important, as the NBN goes through our older suburbs and provides fast broadband, that new suburbs being built are not using pits and pipes which would not be suitable for smooth transition to fibre. That is why this bill is being introduced—to ensure our new developments are fibre ready.


I also note the comments from the members for Greenway and Chifley, who have much experience in this area, in particular the comments of the member for Chifley on the unremarkable nature of this bill. It is true that much attention has been paid to this bill and, as I outlined earlier, it has a history going back more than 12 months. However, what is being achieved through this bill is in no way unique. Just as developers ensure the infrastructure for water, electricity and roads in new estates, they will ensure infrastructure for fast broadband.


The Liberal Party has stated this is not their preferred model. It is clear from comments made by the shadow minister for communications and broadband, the member for Wentworth, that the opposition's policy is for a hybrid system of fibre, copper, wireless and satellite, with no particular strategy. It appears that the Liberal Party's policy is that they can provide faster broadband than people have now but not as fast as Labor's NBN policy, not as efficient, not a network which will be Australia wide and which will expand services across health, education, businesses and households, both rural and city. The selling point for the Liberal Party is: 'But it won't cost as much'. Well of course it will not cost as much, because it is not delivering an efficient fast broadband system which would be internationally competitive. It will still see many suburbs struggle to get any connection or work at a speed suitable for basic household use.


If the Australian public were listening to various opposition members in this debate, I think they would go away very confused. The member for Moncrieff was stating that we do not need NBN—that health services over fast broadband are happening now. At the same time, the member for Ryan is saying that there is no doubt that the country will benefit from the rollout of fibre across the country to deliver fast broadband but that, overall, it is bad for the country because it will cost money. The shadow minister is outlining proposed amendments, yet to be tendered, which allegedly seek to provide for competition because the providers do not want to miss out on the opportunities that come from the demand for fast broadband. At the same time, other opposition members are criticising the NBN rollout as a white elephant because apparently no householders are going to take up the option of connecting fast broadband to their premises. So on one hand providers are missing out and, on the other, nobody is going to take up broadband.


Then of course we have the shadow minister continually using South Korea as an alternative example of a country that is rolling out fast broadband but only to the basement. There are many similarities between Australia and South Korea—they are celebrating this year, as is Australia, Australian-Korean diplomatic relationships over the past 50 years. But when we compare the size of the countries and when we compare the living styles—the majority of their population live in high-rise apartments; the majority in Australia live in stand-alone houses—it is clear that the statements being relied on are just incorrect. The arguments are flawed.


In fact, when the shadow minister was asking questions about South Korea of Mr Harris, the Secretary of the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Mr Harris said:


On the Korean issue, we had the Korea-Australia-New Zealand Broadband Summit in Hobart a few weeks ago. I asked the Korean communications commissioner about these issues … I asked the CEO of the Korean Communications Com­mission. He is a senior representative in creating the plans by which the Koreans are doing these investments.


He went on to state:


Korea has a Fibre-To-The-Home Council and is clearly running, in their advice to us, fibre-to-the-home network planning. They are doing fibre to the home. They are just sequencing it as we have done, fibre to the basement, as you have said, we have done some fibre to the node and we are keeping on going and now doing fibre to the home. It has not stopped. Their program continues and their objective is fibre to the home.


By all means we should look at international examples and learn from their experiences, but it is important that we do not get distracted by flawed arguments, such as that from the shadow minister. Although the opposition clearly do not understand the importance of a national fast broadband network and the benefits it can and will bring to many aspects of our economy and people's lives, the Labor Party and this Labor government do understand. That is why this Gillard Labor government is committed to passing this bill, committed to ensuring that fibre-ready infrastructure in our new developments and committed to seeing the rollout of the National Broadband Network. People in my electorate of Petrie understand the importance of such infrastructure. We have many black spots, even though we are metropolitan and outer metropolitan, where people cannot get broadband at all. People in my electorate understand the importance of the National Broadband Network. The Australian people understand the importance of such infrastructure. That is why this government is delivering on its promise to the Australian people and it is for this reason that I commend the bill to the House.

Mr BRUCE SCOTT
 (Maranoa—Second Deputy Speaker) (19:57):  I rise this evening to speak on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011. This bill is designed to ensure that fibre-to-the-premises infrastructure, rather than traditional copper connections, is installed in new broadacre urban infill and urban renewal developments of more than 100 premises. The coalition does support regulations which would ensure that fibre to the premises is used in greenfields estates, but we still have concerns.


Firstly, we have concerns about changes to the market structure. Under the arrange­ments with developers, the NBN Co. will pay for the pits and pipes of new infrastructure, a cost that has traditionally been borne by developers. This will see existing providers become uncompetitive. Secondly, there appears to have been a lack of consultation with the industry and an eleventh-hour decision that the NBN establish technical standards which will be too onerous for small providers to meet. It is very important that we get clarity on this. 


In the electorate of Maranoa, we have the Surat coal basin, with a huge development and growth that we have not seen since almost the early development of that part of Queensland. There are a number of developments going out there—greenfields sites. The developers of these sites have been in touch with me. They have been trying to operate and develop these housing estates, which are very much needed, but they have had this uncertainty hanging over them about who is going to pay for what—whether it is going to be the developer and, if so, whether they are going to be reimbursed, or whether it is going to be Telstra, and whether it has to be copper wire or optic fibre cable. Many of these developers have been frustrated because they could not get an answer out of either—the responsibility was being shifted. Obviously this legislation is long overdue and is supported by the coalition.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Murphy
):  Order! It being 8 pm, the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 34. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. The member for Maranoa will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed.

"Turnbull, Malcolm, MP",LP,2011-07-04,"



Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth) (15:27):  Let me say right at the very outset that every member of the coalition is passionately committed to the rollout of the availability of fast broadband to all Australians at affo­rdable prices. The debate about the National Broadband Network, of which this bill is a subset, is not a debate about the end. We agree on the end. We agree that all Austr­alians should have access to the benefits of broadband, of fast broadband and of access to the benefits of a digital economy. Our point of difference with the government lies in the means it is employing to achieve that end. In particular, with the way it is establishing the National Broadband Network.


The National Broadband Network is the largest infrastructure project in our country's history. Yet, despite coming into government in 2007 with a very clear and prominent pledge that no major infrastructure project would be undertaken without a rigorous cost-benefit analysis and with an equally prominent pledge that a specialist agency, Infrastructure Australia, would be set up to conduct those cost-benefit analyses, this government with this—the biggest infrast­ructure project in our history—continues to refuse to undertake any cost-benefit analysis. Again and again it shows itself to be utterly hypocritical on this issue. If the government were serious about rigorous economic analysis and dealing with taxpayers' dollars responsibly it would undertake that cost-benefit analysis and pose this question: what is the fastest and most cost-effective way to deliver fast broadband to all Australians and do so in a way that makes broadband more affordable?


I stress the point of affordability because naturally in this place we focus, quite properly, on the burden on the taxpayer: is the taxpayer getting value for money and could the objective of fast broadband across the nation be delivered at a lower cost to the taxpayer—could the taxpayer get more bang for their buck, in other words? But an equally important issue, and one that I would say is, if anything, of more importance, is whether broadband will be affordable so that those Australians who are not able to afford it today will be able to afford it in the future. The reality is—and we rely on the ABS, the Australian Bureau of Statistics, for this—that the largest group of Australians who do not have access to the internet today are those in households earning $40,000 or less a year. The biggest barrier to internet access is not technology; it is not some issue of network design. Sure, there are issues of network design that impact on the speeds people can achieve. But, in terms of basic access to the internet at any speed, the biggest barrier is income. Too many Australians cannot afford it. That is a fact.



Mr Husic interjecting—




Mr TURNBULL:
  The honourable member opposite shakes his head. He should have another look at the ABS statistics. The reality is that the NBN will not deliver more affordable broadband. If anyone doubts my contention, they do not have to rely on my remarks or indeed on the remarks of the many competitive telcos who make the point that this is going to result in more expensive broadband because it is a big government monopoly, heavily capitalised, which will inevitably not be subject to the price pressures of competition because it will have no competitors; they have only to look at page 105 of the NBN corporate plan and see there the forecast retail prices, which are equal to or indeed higher than many of the plans that are available today.


Of course it stands to reason. We know the factor that has brought down broadband costs over the last five years—by as much as half, according to the OECD, as I recall—has been the growing competition in the telecommunications sector. That competition at the facilities level, at the level of physical access into the premises, is going to be eliminated because the government not only is legislating to constitute the NBN as an effective fixed line monopoly but has paid billions of dollars of taxpayers' money to Telstra and to Optus not to use their HFC networks, their pay television hybrid fibre coaxial networks, to offer broadband or voice in competition with the NBN. Yet we know that those networks are capable of providing broadband services today, are providing broadband services today and are providing in some markets—in Melbourne in particular—broadband services at speeds of 100 megabits per second. When you look at other markets around the world—South Korea is always a good example; the United States is another—you see that HFC cables, pay TV cables, are being used to provide broadband services and in those markets provide the competition with the ADSL services provided over the copper networks owned by the telephone companies—or indeed competition with the fibre networks owned by telcos and other broadband providers, as is the case in Korea, where the fastest growth in broadband penetration has been over the HFC networks belonging to SK Telecom and LG.


This whole NBN scheme is going to be, tragically for the people of Australia, a lose-lose. It is more expensive than it needs to be. The government say we are not right on that score, but if they had the courage of their convictions they would have done the cost-benefit analysis which, if they are right, would demonstrate that this was in fact the most cost-effective way to set up a national broadband network. But, because they are afraid of asking the question, the Australian people can only reasonably assume that they fear what the answer will be and that they know it will be that they are spending tens of billions of dollars more than they need to. On the other side of the coin, we know that this network is going to provide not cheaper and more affordable broadband access but broadband access that is either just as expensive as current services or indeed more expensive, particularly for the higher speeds. This is an important point. I will not delay the House with the material that I published recently about the South Korean market, but it is very instructive to analyse the exper­ience there. Consumers in South Korea, which is arguably the most advanced economy in terms of broadband penetration and use of information technology, are not prepared to pay any significant sort of premium for higher speeds. When you look at the NBN corporate plan you see that a fundamental premise there is that Australians will pay very substantial premiums to go from 12 to 25, 50 and up to 100 megabits per second and higher. When you match that against experience in this market—indeed, Telstra's experience with its HFC cable in Melbourne and in particular the experience in South Korea or the comparable experience in the United States—you see that consumers are not prepared to pay significant premiums or, indeed, any premium in many cases for faster speeds. Why is that? It is because speed in and of itself—that is to say, 50 megabits per second, 100 megabits per second—is of no value to a consumer whatsoever. The value comes from the applications that run on it and that the speed enables to be run on it. If there are applications that can be run on a higher speed that can be run on a lower speed—that is to say, if everything a consumer wants can be run adequately, effectively, satisfactorily at a lower speed and at a lower price—that is the product they will take, and that is exactly what has happened.


This bill is all of a one with the goal of the government in creating this big monopoly, the NBN. It is designed to deal with the situation, the deployment of fibre, into greenfields developments. The coalition does not object to the policy objective of greenfields developments being, wherever possible, rolled out with fibre to the home. There is an incremental cost, as we have acknowledged in the dissenting report of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Broadband Network that was tabled today, but it is not a substantial incremental cost compared to the enormous cost of rolling out fibre to the home in brownfields areas. I should note, however, that much to my surprise when I was visiting South Korea recently I saw that, in some very new and very large residential greenfields develop­ments, fibre had not been cabled into the premises; in fact, the fibre network terminated in the basement and the buildings themselves were cabled with copper. I just offer that to the House and to those listening to this debate today as an example of the Korean experience, which, as I say, is very instructive because they have been further down this track than us.


Nonetheless, assuming we are going to go down this line of installing fibre in greenfields premises, I think ensuring that rollout is efficient and timely has a very important impact on Australia's telecomm­unications environment. The NBN estimates that 1.9 million greenfields premises—that is to say, households in new developments—will have to be connected to the NBN by 2020 and a quarter of a million by June 2013. The government has long argued that the greenfields market for fibre deployment is competitive. Given this competitiveness, even this government recognised that it would be ludicrous to do away with that market entirely and that private operators, it said, should be encouraged to roll out fibre to new developments. In its first policy consultation paper released in May 2009 on greenfields estates, the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy stated: 




The installation of FTTP is taking place in a competitive context, with developers typically contracting out the provision of infrastructure and services in developments. In areas where the FTTP infrastructure provider does not provide retail services, arrangements are increasingly being put in place to ensure partnerships exist with retail providers to deliver services to consumers.



In that paper, the department estimated that, at the time, around 120 greenfields estates were being prepared for fibre deployments, with more than 10 operators reaching an estimated 150,000 homes.


In 2009, Senator Conroy, the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, set up a stakeholder reference group and his department held one-on-one consultations with operators to understand how to implement its greenfields policy. As late as a December 2010, the minister was still telling the industry it would be an integral part of a fibre rollout. The minister said:




It has been a consistent feature of the Government’s policy in new developments that there should be room for competing providers. This continues to be the case.





…
   …
   …





Providers can compete to provide infrastructure in new developments, for example, by offering more tailored solutions to developers or more expeditious delivery.



Sadly, those fine intentions have not been reflected in this bill. In common with every other aspect of this NBN project, it will see an effective market completely scrapped and all of the inherent risks and liabilities involved with rolling out fibre transferred to the taxpayer. The NBN Co. has said that once it has rolled out the optical fibre line it will take up ownership not just of the network but also of the pits and pipes that the developers have installed. Down the track this will take the cost of maintenance off the hands of developers and place it with the taxpayers, but the cost of providing the pits and the pipes lies with the developers. The NBN Co. are offering no upfront cost to developers when installing the optical fibre network. That is important because smaller fibre-to-the-premises developers do not have the luxury of spending taxpayers' money in the hope that 10 years down the track they may actually begin to recoup some of the money that has been invested. As OPENetworks stated in their submission to the joint committee: 



NBN Co is the obvious first choice for Developers because NBN Co is the only provider that can fund the network build costs (that may otherwise have been paid by Developers to OPENETWORKS 
...
) and that funding is then able to be recovered by NBN Co charging RSPs higher
 operational prices.



OPENetworks have argued that this policy is in fact a violation of the competitive neutrality policy for government owned businesses, which holds that they should not exercise unfair advantage by reason of their government ownership over their private sector competitors. An appropriate applic­ation has been made to the Productivity Commission in that regard. What this legislation will do is make greenfields property developments more expensive and slower to bring to market, and stifle competition. The department said before the committee that a developer has the choice. He has to put in the pits and pipes, but he has the choice of going to a private sector fibre company or waiting for the NBN. The reality is that there is no choice because the NBN will provide the fibre for no cost to the developer whereas the developer would obviously have to pay a price to a private fibre company. Each of the representatives of the property sector and the greenfield operators have made the point to us that the business of putting in the pits and pipes and then waiting around for the NBN Co. to turn up is going to place considerable delays and expense on property developments. We have heard many complaints from the property sector about the delays occasioned by this. I am foreshadowing amendments that we will be moving later in this debate which will seek to rectify that particular problem.


The amendment we are going to move—and this has been detailed at some length in the dissenting report—will mean that a property developer, having dug the pits and pipes, can choose to have a private sector fibre provider to lay the fibre as long as it is done in accordance with the specifications, which should be stipulated by the industry, not by NBN. NBN obviously will have a big input into that but it should not be dictated by the NBN for exactly the same reason that, when telecommunications reform began some decades ago, Telstra's ability to set technical standards was taken away and moved to the regulator. The developer can employ this private sector company or what are called greenfield fibre operators. As long as they have installed that fibre in accordance with those specifications, the developer will be entitled to be remunerated by the NBN Co—in other words, it will require NBN Co. to buy that fibre setup from the developer for a tariff which will be set by the minister on a per residence basis, taking into account the relevant factors such as the cost of construction, NBN's costs and so forth.


What is the object of this amendment? This does not undermine in any way the objectives of the NBN. This means that a developer can get on with the job, get the fibre installed and be paid for it without having to wait around for the great big government monopoly to deign in its magnificence and wisdom to get around to this developer's problems. The reality is that a new development which does not have the fibre installed will be at an enormous disadvantage from a marketing point of view to another development that does have that fibre installed. So it is important that developers are able to get on with the job and get the fibre installed. This amendment will enable them to do just that.


We flagged this issue with the various developer's organisations and with the greenfield operators in the course of the joint standing committee inquiry. All of them supported it and welcomed it. We flagged it also with the department. Their response was essentially equivocal. It was not really a responsive answer at all. They did not seem to have a particularly strong view on it either way. The bottom line is that will make it easier for developers to get on with the job. It may well save the NBN Co. cost and expense and, if it encourages NBN Co. to move things along and be more timely in its construction of these networks, then that would be a very good thing as well.


The other amendment that we will move a little later in the course of this debate—and which we flagged in the dissenting report—would enable the private sector cable companies, greenfield operators, to be exempted from the cherry-picking provisions of this act if the fibre network they seek to build meets the following conditions: it is not owned or operated by NBN Co. or Telstra; it is installed in a new development; it is owned and operated by the same entity which builds it; and it delivers retail services only to the persons who reside in the development.


The purpose of this amendment is to enable the private sector greenfield cable operators to stay in business, to be able to put in a network they would then be able to operate as a small private network. They should be exempt from those cherry-picking provisions because of their scale. As we have said in the report, it would effectively maximise the options available to developers and to the greenfield operators. They could contract on the basis that the greenfield operator would build the network and operate it until such time as it was sold to the NBN Co. or they could contract on the basis that the greenfield operator would continue to operate it and there would be no sale to the NBN Co. at all. They would no doubt be under some risk that the NBN Co. might choose to overbuild them but one would hope that, when the rush of blood to the head of NBN Co. settles down a little, they will not be overbuilding brand new fibre optic networks, given the expense of doing so.


This amendment, coupled with the first amendment, will mean that a developer is in the position where he or she can employ the same company—and this is, as TransACT said in the inquiry, clearly the most efficient way to do it—to put in the pits and pipes, put in the cable and then either be paid for that cable by NBN Co. and, in effect, sell it to NBN Co. or for that cable-laying company to operate it as an independent cable network. That gives the developer a range of options. It does not put the developer at a disadvantage and it does not give the developer a disincentive from using the private sector. It means that the greenfields companies can continue in existence and can provide some real competition to the NBN.


I imagine that honourable members opposite will oppose this because they are opposed to competition, but at some point they have to match the rhetoric with the reality of the bill that is before the House. Their rhetoric has been that there is nothing in this bill that impedes competition in the greenfields developments. But a greenfields operator under the scheme in this legislation is at an insuperable disadvantage to the NBN Co. because the NBN Co.'s cable will be laid for free, at no cost to the developer, and the cost presumably will be recovered from charges made to retail service providers over time, whereas if the developer goes to hire somebody else to put in the fibre network they will have to pay them to do so. Naturally the preference bias will be in favour of the NBN Co.


I imagine that many developers would not be too troubled by that. Obviously the owners of the operators of these greenfields cable networks are very threatened by that. Many people in the industry have said that this bill will have the effect of putting them as an industry right out of business. In the absence of these amendments, I fear that that would be the case. Many developers might be quite happy just to let the NBN get on and do the job, but the experience has been of inordinate delays. All of us in this House who have been involved in the development sector or observed people in the development sector or are familiar with the conduct of big government owned monopolies or indeed big private companies know that they take their time. Many developers will be left waiting and waiting for the cable to be laid. The longer they wait, the longer it will be before the development is complete and the longer it will be before they can get it to market. All of them said to us in their evidence that they believe that the private sector can put in the infrastructure at a considerably lower cost than the NBN is likely to. The department turned up their nose at that and said they could not see any evidence for that. It really is not a question of evidence. One way or the other, let the market decide. If the private sector can do a better and cheaper job than NBN then no doubt developers will see that as an opportunity.


The amendments that we are proposing here will give developers real choice. They will ensure that cable is rolled out in greenfields developments in a more timely and efficient fashion. They will ensure that developers are not put in a 'Hobson's choice' situation where they can either wait and wait for the NBN to show up and lay cable at no cost to them or pay somebody else to do it out of their own pocket with no reimbursement to get it done sooner. And they give the greenfields cable operators—TransACT, Opticom and others—the chance to stay in business and to provide some competition. To honourable members opposite whose approval of these amendments we in the committee sought, but to no avail, I say to them once again that if they are serious about competition this is the opportunity to support amendments—which we will move later—which will provide some real competition.


There are many things that are unique about the NBN. The government members may regard this as a compliment. One is that there is no country in the world spending as much on a national broadband network as we are. Our spending, on any measure, is off the charts. There is no other country in the world that is establishing a new government owned monopoly to deliver broadband. Again, that is a world first—and not one that we should be too proud of. But just as importantly and most ominously there is no other country in the world that is seeking to eliminate facilities based competition. Take your pick. Anywhere else in the world governments are very anxious—and this is particularly the case in Korea and the United States—to ensure that there is always real competition among the fixed line services and that they are available to as many households as possible. The amendments I have foresh­adowed will go some way at least in new developments to achieving that. After the amendments are debated later, we will be commending them to the House and trust they will get the support of the House. (Time expired)

"Rowland, Michelle, MP",ALP,2011-07-04,"



Ms ROWLAND
 (Greenway) (15:58):  Firstly, since the member for Wentworth mentioned it, he knows perfectly well that he came to the committee with half-baked amendments full of square brackets saying, 'I will insert something here when I think about what to put in here.' So he should not come in here and make those assertions. Secondly, we waited about 10 minutes for him to give his usual spiel without even talking to the bill. As the member for Lyne said when he introduced the advisory report earlier today, the disagreements in this committee and in this report on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011 actually come down to a question of policy and ideology more than anything else. That is borne out by the fact that we have had to sit here for the last half-hour and listen to the member for Wentworth say the same rhetoric he has said on every single occasion, crying these tears for affordability.


What did they do? What did he do when he was a member of a government which saw Australia going down the gurgler with respect to broadband rankings around the world? Australia became an absolute backwater in terms of internet accessibility and high-speed broadband. It has taken this government to pick up the mantle and actually turn that around. We know why he is saying these things. We know it is in his remit. We know that is his job. The sole purpose of him coming in here today and spending half an hour just bagging out the NBN is that he has been given the remit to destroy the NBN. On this point, I found he actually felt and looked rather uncomfortable on this occasion because he talked about HFC being available. He knows perfectly well that only 30 per cent of the country is covered by it and even then that is only if you are lucky enough to live on the eastern seaboard around metropolitan areas. He knows perfectly well when he mentions the United States that they have had a long history of ubiquitous cable investment. He talks about South Korea and again he knows perfectly well that the reason South Korea has become the internet economic miracle is government intervention and acceptance a decade ago of the need for broadband development. What were we in Australia doing in that time? Absolutely nothing.


The member for Wentworth talks about the value of broadband being in the applications rather than speed. Absolutely true, but the fact is that in order to deliver those applications you need bandwidth. Without bandwidth they are absolutely nothing. The member for Wentworth talks about facilities based competition. That is fine, but we know from not only the analyses that have been done by the ACCC since 1997 but also in the lead up to the NBN being announced that facilities based competition in Australia has failed. Why has it failed? Because Telstra as the incumbent operator was a vertically integrated company controlling both the wholesale and the retail levels, so the market failed.


What happens when markets fail? What do Labor governments do? We step in when the market fails and we rectify that failure. The member for Wentworth talks yet again about Australia going it alone on what it is doing in this area. I remind members that one of the key regulatory principles is that regulations should be specific to the needs of each country. What is the need for Australia right now? The need is to connect a country of vast geography and differing topology and a country which has definite broadband black spots that have not been addressed.


You do not have to take it from me. Take it from the ITU Secretary General of the United Nations, who visited Australia only in April this year and made the following comment:


Australia is a different country. Its geography and spread of the people, the level of telecommunications development and the level (of competition) between the operators—I will not say which one is a giant or not—all of those conditions, you do not find them elsewhere and therefore you do need to have the guts to tackle the problem.


That is exactly what this government is doing. Finally, the member for Wentworth constantly wants to throw around the word 'monopoly'. As everyone knows, the NBN is a wholesale-only network. How will it deliver competition to consumers? It does that by disinfecting the wholesale level so that the vertical integration disease is obscured to the extent that we can regulate the wholesale level and give a level playing field to retail operators with equivalent pricing and terms.


Now that I have dispensed with the member for Wentworth, I turn to the bill itself. This is a critical piece of legislation for the development of the National Broadband Network, particularly for the estimated nearly two million new premises that will be constructed across Australia during the rollout phase. The passage of this bill will provide something vitally important for all stakeholders including industry, consumers, local government and developers. What is that? It is certainty. For homebuyers, there will be certainty that their new dwelling will be fibre ready. For developers, there will be certainty as to their obligations to ensure ducts and lead-in are fibre ready.


I turn to some practical context of the bill. The practicalities of this bill are certainly not lost on me. While I doubt there will be substantial greenfields development in some electorates such as Wentworth and Bradfield in the immediate future, this is not the case in respect of west and north-west Sydney. During my time as a representative on Blacktown City Council and as its Deputy Mayor, I was party to decisions on many new development approvals and subdiv­isions. I am on the record as an advocate for the notion that, just as the local government planning and approvals process takes into account community needs such as parks, sporting amenities and childcare centres, access to advanced communication services must be viewed as an essential service with infrastructure backing that is akin to sewerage and electricity and made a condition of consent.


I have witnessed first hand—and too many of my constituents are living it today—the consequences of underinvestment in advanced communications infrastructure in our new greenfields estates. For many residents in suburbs such as Kellyville Ridge, The Ponds and even Stanhope Gard­ens in Glenwood, their primary reason for contact and advocacy with my office concerns their inability to access what are now regarded as entry level broadband products such as ADSL2+.


Even in older estates in Greenway, which were once greenfields or even brownfields developments, such as specific streets in the well-established suburb of Kings Langley, access to high speed broadband is a challenge. The timing of this particular dev­elopment meant that the Foxtel cable rollout passed by this area. This is not, as the member for Wentworth has attempted to assert on just about every occasion, a consequence of an income barrier. It is amusing enough that this furphy is being peddled by the same person who ran a fantastic dial-up ISP, which he sold in the dotcom boom and made either a cool $60 million or $40 million, according to recent reports—but who is counting? No, this lack of access is the consequence of chronic underinvestment in communications infrast­ructure in greenfields estates. You only need to look at the median house prices in Kings Langley, Kellyville Ridge and The Ponds, which are $545,000, $588,000 and $596,000 respectively, to understand that this is not merely a question of income. When one examines the electoral divisions ranked by the proportion of households with a broadband internet connection, there is not a single regional electorate with a percentage of households with broadband connections above 50 per cent. Indeed, far and away the tyranny of distance when it comes to broadband accessibility is borne out by the fact that nearly every rural and regional electorate lies in the bottom half of the scale. I am yet to receive an answer from anyone on the opposite side of the House explaining to me what they did over all their years in office to improve broadband development and accessibility for households in suburbs such as Mt Druitt, to develop broadband as a tool for social inclusion in disadvantaged regions or even to create a comprehensive policy for greenfields development. As an example of how confused their policy has been on this issue, one only needs to look at the so-called 'real action' plan they took to the last election. On page 4 of that policy it is stated:


The Coalition will conduct an urgent review of whether to mandate that all 'greenfields' connections must be fibre.


That leaves it up in the air whether there should be a fibre mandate, as opposed to copper, in new developments. Yet on page 17 of that same policy it states:


The Coalition believes that new dwellings should have a fibre connection rather than a copper connection.


So even in their own policy, the one they took to the last election, they could not make up their minds on their position. This confusion from those opposite continues in their ill-conceived proposed amendments to this bill, which I will happily deal with in the consideration in detail stage. In the mean­time, I note that page 42 of the dissenting report into the bill, which was tabled earlier today, states:


… the evidence the inquiry received demonstrates that there is a vigorous private market for the construction of fibre infrastructure in new developments.


The dissenting report goes on to say that the bill will end all that. That is simply not true. There is vigorous competition which will remain with the bill in effect. The change will be that the competitors will compete to provide fibre installation to NBN Co. rather than to developers. Instead of developers extracting an economic rent, consumers will not pay for fibre connectivity of itself. They will pay for what they use from a retail service provider providing services using the NBN. The constructors will obtain a normal return. The change is that there is no arbitrage opportunity, which those opposite, who like to say they are champions of competition, should embrace. No arbitrage opportunity and no abnormally high rents—the effect is good for consumers. 


I turn to that part of the bill dealing with the proposed access regime—the proposed part 20A of the Telecommunications Act. I would like to make the point that the proposed regime is based on existing provisions in schedule 1 of the Telecomm­unications Act, none of which are novel. It provides a regime for carriers to secure access to fixed line facilities owned by non-carriers in order to ensure that fibre can be rolled out using these facilities. So it is indeed based on the existing schedule 1 of the Telecommunications Act. Access can be on terms that are commercially agreed or, failing agreement, one can agree on an arbitrator. The default arbitrator will be the ACCC. So, as can be seen, the access regime is completely in line with existing competition provisions under the Telecommunications Act itself.


The outcomes of this bill will be early and less costly access to fibre based broadband for residents of new developments, reduced costs for deploying fibre by ensuring that the ductwork infrastructure is indeed fibre-ready, reduced costs for deployment of fibre through access to non-carrier duct as well and cabling for new premises which ensures they can take advantage of the NBN. All of these things are well understood by consum­ers. They understand that the definitive agreements, signed the other week, between Telstra, Optus and NBN Co., mean that we will be able to fast-track using existing facilities and existing infrastructure in the most efficient way possible. This is well understood in my electorate, where River­stone is the site of the first Sydney metro rollout. The question I continually get there is not, 'Why we are doing this?'—not the question that the member for Wentworth seems to believe consumers keep asking over and over again. They are not asking why; they are asking when. It cannot come soon enough for these areas of west and north-west Sydney, which have suffered from chronic underdevelopment.


I turn now to the issue of NBN Co. operating as the wholesale provider of last resort. There is strong stakeholder support for this. It supports a consistent national approach in the future and, if alternative providers wish to compete with NBN Co., they are welcome to do so. I will finish by talking briefly about some of the proposed amendments. I could not resist the notion put forward by the member for Wentworth about NBN Co. being forced somehow to buy network from other providers. What is actually being proposed here is that a developer will arrange for NBN Co. to purchase that part of the network from the fibre provider. This is highly problematic. It seems to suggest the developer can force NBN Co. to buy another person's asset without their permission. That raises issues about acquisition of property.


I will end on that note, but I also particularly want to draw the House's attention to the significance of 20 July. Everyone should be putting that date in their diaries. On that day, the shadow minister will be addressing a CEDA forum on the topic 'Broadband Vision for Australia: The Opposition's Perspective'. This will be a pretty short speech. If you want to go to it, it is $270 a head, but I am happy to save any member here $270 and 10 minutes of their time by pointing out that we already know what the opposition's policy on broadband is—it is to destroy the NBN. The member for Wentworth has demonstrated that that is his remit and that that is what he will be trying to do. (Time expired)

"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",Nats,2011-07-04,"



Mr HARTSUYKER
 (Cowper) (16:13):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Telecommunications Legislation Amend­ment (Fibre Deployment) Bill. I think there is agreement in this House over the need for high-speed broadband, but the issue is how you get there and how you provide those services in the most efficient and effective way—a way that provides an acceptable return on funds invested, a way that ensures there is excellent competition in the market and a way that delivers services to Australians at a price they can afford. The purpose of this bill is to facilitate the installation of fibre into new developments and housing estates and to ensure that the telecommunication infrastructure placed in new developments meets the technical requirements of NBN Co. 


There are four measures in this bill in total. Firstly, the bill enables the minister to specify new developments in which fixed lines for installation must be optical fibre lines and must comply with technical specifications. The bill calls this rule the optical fibre line requirement and requires NBN Co. to be the installer of last resort, where a developer does not choose a commercial provider. However, it is becoming clear that the terms of this legislation will see NBN Co. becoming the installer of first resort, rather than last.


Secondly, the bill requires that facilities installed in a development must be fibre-ready. This will be called the fibre-ready facility requirement and will ensure that passive infrastructure such as underground ducting and pits and pipes allow the ready deployment of optical fibre cabling. Thirdly, the bill prevents corporations from selling or leasing land or buildings in new develop­ments unless fibre-ready facilities have been installed. Finally, the bill implements a regime for carriers to secure access to fixed-line facilities such as pits and pipes owned by non-carriers to ensure fibre can be rolled out using those facilities. Access to these facilities will be on terms that are negotiated commercially by the respective parties, or determined by an agreed arbiter. The bill creates a mechanism whereby the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission will be the default arbiter where an alternative is not selected by the respective parties.


The coalition believes that the government has taken the same approach with this bill as it has with the entire NBN project. The government's approach is to establish a monopoly at a huge cost to the Australian taxpayer and destroy competition at every opportunity. Through NBN Co., the govern­ment is completely dismantling competition in the wholesale telecommunications ind­ustry—all so that the business case and the potential return of NBN Co. can be propped up. But, like all government monopolies, this approach simply creates a poor allocation of resources and massive cost blowouts for taxpayers. This legislation is being debated within an environment where NBN Co. is already facing these blowouts and delays to the rollout. We have seen the cost of installing the NBN into Tasmanian homes reach $7,500 per premise. On the mainland, NBN Co. suspended its construction tender in April because bids by companies familiar with the industry came in at around $8 billion above NBN Co.'s budget.


Most insulting of all to the Australian taxpayer is the announcement last week that the Gillard government will be paying billions of dollars to Telstra and Optus to transfer their customers from copper and wire infrastructure to the NBN. We have the situation where NBN Co. is paying the two largest wholesale operators billions of dollars all to acquire customers and charge them a higher price for broadband.


Yet, despite these billions of taxpayer dollars being spent, the NBN only has around 728 customers receiving the service for free. It is spending $132 million on the cost of employing around 1,000 NBN Co. staff members, with 51 executives earning over $300,000 a year. Within this context, we have this bill which will destroy the ability of fibre installation companies to compete with NBN Co. for the rights to install fibre in new developments.


The coalition agrees that it is desirable to encourage the installation of fibre in new developments. It has been a farcical situation allowed by this government, where Telstra has been required to install copper into smaller developments of less than 100 premises with the knowledge that the infrastructure will eventually be overbuilt by fibre. What a waste of money it is to overbuild infrastructure—no wonder Telstra has been reluctant to install copper and has left developments at a standstill while the government takes its time rectifying the situation.


The coalition completely welcomes the chance we have to ensure that fibre is installed in all new developments. However, we believe that the private sector has been facilitating the installation of fibre in new developments for many years and that this bill unfairly removes this competition to NBN Co. There is already an active and productive market between competitive greenfield operators, or CGOs, to secure contracts from developers for the purpose of installing fibre. This point was made clear in hearings of the Joint Parliamentary Comm­ittee on the National Broadband Network into this legislation. The industry group Greenfield Fibre Operators of Australia—which consists of seven installers of fibre including OPENetworks, Service Elements, TransACT, Comverge, Broadcast Engin­eering and Pivit—submitted to the comm­ittee:


GFOA companies have been competing with one another, Telstra Velocity, Opticomm, VicUrban, Multinet Broadband and other carriers/operators ... for over ten years. 


... there is already a very healthy competitive market between experienced wholesale network carriers in Greenfields ... that is not acknowledged by Government.


The submission by GFOA also states that competition in the market has produced enormous reductions in the cost of installing fibre. In an environment where NBN Co. are using public funds to create a wholesale fibre network, surely the taxpayer should expect the government to pursue the lowest costs available. However, GFOA state:


Deployment of FTTP networks by GFOA carrier/operators are currently costing $1,500 per lot ... for networks where the functional performance specifications and standards equal or exceed the current functional performance specifications and standards of NBN Co networks that cost more than double the price to build.


In Tasmania during the installation of fibre for premises with pre-existing infrastructure, NBN Co. has spent an average of $7,500 per premise connected. Clearly a competitive market would allow cheaper costs and a better outcome for taxpayers. We hear the government give lip service to competition. According to the minister, this legislation will implement a regime where NBN Co. is the installer of last resort where the developer does not choose a competing installer. However, the bill effectively destroys any competition for two reasons. Firstly, developers can incur the expense of building trenches and fibre-ready facilities and then employ NBN Co. to install the fibre at zero additional cost to the developer. What possible incentive will a developer have to hire a competing fibre installer to roll out fibre when the developer can hire NBN Co. to do the same work at no cost?


The second way the government is ensuring an NBN Co. monopoly in installing fibre is by enforcing standards for a fibre-ready facility in greenfield estates. In practical terms, this means that the pit and duct infrastructure used to facilitate the installation of fibre must meet standards set by the minister and specified by NBN Co. So, we will have a situation where the dominant operator in the market will have the power to set the technical specifications and requirements that its competitors must meet. This was the situation prior to 1989, when the then Labor government transferred Telecom Australia to an independent body and started the process by which telecommunications were recognised in the Trade Practices Act and overseen by the ACCC. The impact of this bill should clearly be prohibited by the ACCC, which the government is effectively turning into a toothless tiger with regards to telecommunications regulation. Rather than implement NBN Co. as the installer of last resort, the provisions of this bill ensure that NBN Co. will be the installer of first resort because developers have absolutely no incentive to consider another installer. This point is felt strongly by existing private installers. For instance, TransACT submitted to the committee that:


... it appears to be the intent of the Government and NBN Co, that it plans and needs NBN Co to be the monopoly provider of FTTP in Greenfields developments;


The impact of the government's policy on new housing developments is that the competitive industry will simply cease to exist. The Greenfield Fibre Operators of Australia made this clear when they told the committee that the bill will simply put them out of business. So here we have a Labor government that claims to support competition and that a monopoly wholesale network is the only way to promote retail broadband competition, but is completely destroying competitive industries while it sets up the NBN Co. monopoly. This approach will have devastating effects not only on niche industries such as fibre installation but also on the entire telecom­munications industry in Australia. As the Victorian government recently said in its submission to the NBN inquiry being undertaken by the House of Representatives:


After over two decades of national economic and financial reform, the NBN proposal in its present form represents a very serious threat to the long-term competition in the telecommunications sector.


The Victorian government went on to say:


The increasingly apparent risk is that the commonwealth could, over time, fully replicate a dysfunctional telecommunications market structure that has hindered investments in the current broadband market. This would be the result if it simply replaces Telstra's market power with an NBN Co infrastructure monopoly with all the attendant inefficiencies and constraints on investment, innovation and future policymaking.


Through this bill, these predictions are already coming true in the market for fibre installation in new developments. We will see competition wiped out and NBN Co. installing fibre at a higher cost per lot than could be achieved by private enterprise, with the taxpayer footing the bill every step of the way.


The coalition will be introducing two amendments to protect competition and ensure that taxpayers benefit from the efficiencies of a competitive marketplace for fibre installations in new developments. We believe that the bill should be amended to remove the disincentive for developers to use private operators to install fibre infrast­ructure. The bill would be amended to enable developers, whose project has an installed fibre network in compliance with the minister's specifications, to have the option to require NBN Co.'s purchase of the network at a reasonable price. A reasonable price would be determined by the minister with consideration of current market prices and costs. The developer will then have an incentive to use private operators because the costs of doing so would be recouped from selling the network to NBN Co. Essentially, developers will face the same costs regardless of whether they employ a private operator or NBN Co. to install the fibre. By protecting competition in this manner, the government would be ensuring competitive pressures keep down the costs of installing fibre in new developments and taxpayers will benefit from getting the best market price for the installation of fibre. This amendment will also impose a cost discipline directly on NBN Co. If NBN Co.'s competitors can build connections at a lower charge than NBN Co., then there would be a cost saving to NBN Co. and to all taxpayers.


The second coalition amendment would see certain fibre networks exempt from the operations of parts 7 and 8 of the Telecommunications Act, which will require that all fibre networks must operate under the same technical standards as the NBN. The amendment will ensure that those networks not owned or operated by NBN Co. or Telstra, and where those networks only delivered retail services to persons residing in the development, would be exempt from these parts of the act. NBN Co. would still retain the option to build its own network in the development if it wished and would have access to the fibre-ready facilities which the developer is required to build, but the network would still be placed under the same access conditions as stipulated for NBN Co. This amendment would ensure that competition continues to exist for private networks in new developments and that developers are given maximum flexibility in choosing services for their future residents.


The warning signs are all there that this project will suffer from low demand, be months or years behind schedule and end up costing taxpayers billions above the $50 billion that they are already projected to be paying. The coalition urge the government to adopt our amendments to ensure that we can salvage at least some competition in the market while NBN Co. continues destroying all competitors in its wake.


Just two weeks ago we saw yet another example of NBN Co. destroying competition with its announcement of the terms of the Telstra agreement, presently valued at some $11 billion, and the announcement of the deal with Optus, proposing to spend $800 million to do nothing more than purchase customers from the network and take out competition. We believe that competition is the cornerstone of delivering lower prices for consumers. Why then are we going to use taxpayers' dollars when the only return on investment for those very taxpayers who are paying out the money to purchase customers is that they will be paying a higher price for their broadband? 


It seems that only Labor could come up with such an interesting business proposal: to charge taxpayers, in the case of Optus, $800 million to purchase customers for no other reason than to charge those very same taxpayers more for their own broadband. We know that cost is a major impediment to many people accessing high-speed broadband, so we should be really focusing on delivering those services at the lowest possible price. Eliminating competition and creating an artificial monopoly are not ways to achieve that goal and are certainly counter to the objectives of good telecommunications policy and are counter to the objectives of the coalition.

Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley) (16:28):  It gives me great pleasure to talk on the Telecommunications Legislation Amend­ment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011 and reflect on some of the work of the Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network. It is a great honour to be on that committee for a number of reasons, only one of which is my deep and abiding interest in broadband. More particularly, at this point in time we are discussing some of the most exciting reforms that are taking place within this industry. 


Over the course of the last two weeks, the deal that the government did between NBN Co., Telstra and Optus was fundamentally a groundbreaking reform which has been pursued for generations: decoupling Telstra from its network and ensuring fundamental competitive reform. This reform had escaped the nation and we managed to achieve it. In its wake, we will ensure that we will not revisit some of the debates about the needless duplication of networks when cable TV was being rolled out in the 1990s. We have singularly sidestepped that through this deal we have set up between NBN Co. and Telstra and Optus, which will ensure a more efficient use of our telecommunications network. It will transform the industry and ensure that we achieve fast and efficient broadband for nearly the entire continent. It is something that others only dream of but we will achieve. We will reshape the industry through this. 


People cannot wait for access to this transformational technology. I have seen the enthusiasm firsthand. I notice one of my colleagues is on the other side of the chamber whom I worked with on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Infrastructure and Communications. We visited various parts of the country and were able to see with our own eyes the excitement in the regions about the prospect of tapping into a new superfast broadband network and what it will do. For example, they will be able to retain young people in regional areas through better access to educational opportunities. Small businesses will have the chance to tap into new markets which up until this point have escaped them in the regions. We have the chance to deliver a service in parts of the country like the area of Sydney I represent where people thought they would never have access to such a system because, frankly, the market did not value investing in a network in the area based on their incomes. I think that is a disgraceful reflection of where we are at, and I will reflect on this stalemate later. I take great exception to some of the quoting of ABS statistics earlier by the member for Wentworth. It was quite misleading and I want to address that as it impacts on the electorate I am proud to represent.


People in the electorate of Chifley are eagerly awaiting the National Broadband Network not just for its speed, not just for what they will be able to download but for what they will be able to do. Just the other day I had the pleasure of visiting the Blacktown Computer Pals group, which is teaching senior Australians how to access computers in a way that they have never had the opportunity to do before. Wendy Lambert and all the volunteers that operate Blacktown Computer Pals do tremendous work in showing senior Australians the opportunities presented by this technology. The other day we were talking about some of the applications that will open as a result of access to the National Broadband Network and one that particularly caught them was the prospect of e-health so they will not be stuck waiting for specialists or GP support. They will get fast and easier access to medical assistance. They will be looked after in their older years. They know some of the applications and they cannot wait for this.


This bill is critical in ensuring that, as we connect up to 6,000 homes a day, the greenfield areas of Australia will be looked after just as efficiently as the brownfield areas. The bill will ensure that there is an optic fibre requirement, a fibre-ready facility requirement, a fibre-ready installation requirement and a facilities access regime. The bill was examined by the Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network. I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate the chair of the committee and the deputy chair—you, Madam Deputy Speaker D'Ath—for the work that ensured that this bill will be considered in a timely way. A lot of the states will depend on this bill going through the House and through the other place to ensure there is a mechanism to connect greenfield estates quickly.  Having worked for an electricity distributor and having been a union official in the telecommunications industry, a lot of what has been considered by this bill is simply—without bursting anyone's balloon—unremarkable. Frankly, a lot of utilities have been working for many years with the developers to rollout networks—electricity, gas or telecommunications—in new estates. The reason I congratulate the chair and the deputy chair is outlined in the chair's forward to the report that was presented today which states:


Where the committee found areas of dispute, these were less about the Bill and more about the underlying policy that has led to this Bill.


We continually have these arguments, as represented in the chamber today, not about the bill itself but about the way we are going about bringing superfast broadband to this country through the NBN Co. and the reforms that we have put to this House. I believe the report put forward some very sensible and considered recommendations, for example advocating that internal customer protocols be put in place within NBN Co. to ensure that the time frame for issuing statements to developers is completed and benchmarked; that NBN Co. commit to specific time frames to publish its performance on fibre rollout—a sensible idea; and that there be an investigation into the possible impact on risk premiums of regular changes in development regulations—again, pretty sensible. 


However, the coalition have sought, as evidenced today by the member for Wentworth, to engage in spurious claims about this bill. For example, they claim that rolling out the NBN will make it more expensive for homes. No-one who has bought new land and is intending to develop a property on that land would for one minute expect that any of the utilities connected to that property would come for free. They would expect to pay for a gas connection, for water and for electricity. They would expect some cost. That cost has been outlined in the explanatory memorandum—and I will come back to what I believe are the spurious costs being claimed in self-interest by industry. The cost outlined in the explanatory memorandum is about $800, which is in line with what would be expected for the other utilities that would have to be connected. 


The opposition claim that the processes to be used by NBN Co. will be slow and bureaucratic. But the report has recom­mended some measures which I hope the government and the NBN will embrace to ensure that we can have a timely rollout. They claim, for example, that developers might have to wait too long. That was raised by the member for Wentworth earlier. Guess what? Sometimes developers do wait. They roll out aspects of the network, undertake the pit and pipe and wait for the utility to come through. As I said earlier, this is unrem­arkable. But the claim that is being put forward is that in some way NBN is doing something that hitherto has not been experienced by the sector. That is simply and patently ridiculous.


The other claim which was made through the course of the hearings was that NBN or the minister should not set standards. To some extent the member for Bradfield and I, despite the fact that we are on different sides of the chamber, actually agree that there is always a danger that monopolies set standards in a way that excludes competition. The preference would always be that the industry would set them. Who in the industry is responsible for setting these standards? The Communications Alliance, the sector itself. Up to this point, the sector has been unable to come up with standards in relation to the rollout of the network. The problem we have is that in arguing the minister should not set the standard the coalition is assuming that the industry will get its act together and effectively asking government to shoulder the risk if the industry is incapable of reaching agreement within itself. Mind you, NBN Co. is a member of the Communications Alliance. If they are unable to come up with a standard then what standard do we operate to? And when the faults start racking up because the performance of the network is not up to scratch, who will be responsible? Ultimately, the government will be, not the industry that was unable to come up with the standards in the first place.


During the course of the hearings, TransACT put forward to us that developers or contractors within the sector who have carriers licences should be enabled to roll out the network to the standards that they roll out to. I asked TransACT, which is a regional telecommunications provider that operates in the ACT, which standard it would operate to: would TransACT let the subcontractor put it in to their own standard or would TransACT require the subcontractor to work to TransACT's standard? The answer from TransACT was simple. It said, 'We want it to our standard.' Yet TransACT argued to the committee that NBN Co. should not be entitled to operate to the standard it sees fit in the absence of the industry standard. It says that TransACT should be entitled to operate to its own standard—something it would not allow for its own network. When we are trying to roll out a uniform network with standards whereby everyone can expect the network to perform in the same way we cannot have what I would argue—with no disrespect to TransACT, I will put it in very crude terms—is a self-interested position when it comes to the network.


The member for Wentworth wants things to be done in a timely way but he has flagged some unbelievable suggestions. For example, an article entitled 'Turnbull tests NBN Co-pays amendment for greenfields', which appeared on the iTnews website, talks about the fact that the member for Wentworth was arguing that NBN Co. basically would have to negotiate with each developer, as they roll out in their own estate, how much they would pay for the assumption of the network. On the one hand he wants the network to be built quickly and says that we should not force delay on developers, yet on the other hand he would force on us a delay in the negotiation process with developers one-on-one.


I also could not believe the claim the Housing Industry Association was making that it might cost up to $5,000 per premise to roll out the NBN on a greenfield site. When we quizzed them on that, they said that they were earlier estimates but then came back later and said, 'We've tested those out and that is what we believe to be the case.' But there was no evidence of what that was supposed to be. Frankly, we need to get the NBN rolling out as quickly as possible to reach the target of 6,000 homes a day.


In the time remaining I will address the spurious claim made by the member for Wentworth that he put amendments to the committee. That is a falsehood. He put forward, for example—and I am willing to table this—an incomplete amendment that had different sections. I will read directly:


Notice must be given to NBN Co. of the requirement … (some time before expected completion of the network? Within some time after completion?)


He put half-baked amendments that were not even complete to the committee dealing with the rollout of one of the most important pieces of infrastructure in the country. He could not even get that done yet suggests that he did. He talks about a cost-benefit analysis and comes back to it. I am going to give you a cost-benefit analysis that was carried out at the 2007 election: people basically looked at the 19 plans you guys could not get through; they liked our plan. The cost-benefit analysis was done in 2010: people did not like what you were putting forward; they liked what we were putting forward. The crossbenchers late last year also had a cost-benefit analysis. They liked our plan; they did not like yours. It is about time you stopped trying to stop the rollout of a network that is critical to the country. (Time expired)




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mrs D'Ath
):  Is the member seeking to table a document?




Mr HUSIC:
  I seek leave to table the coalition's appendix C, the text of the amendment to the fibre deployment bill that was put forward by the opposition.


Leave granted.

"Fletcher, Paul, MP",LP,2011-07-04,"



Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (16:44):  I am pleased to speak on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011, which is part of the overall policy architecture underlying the National Broadband Network and its specific objective is to ensure that new developments receive a fibre connection rather than a copper connection. In the broad, this is a sensible objective. But typical of the way the Rudd-Gillard government approaches virt­ually every policy issue, including those in the telecommunications sector, they have done an absolutely hopeless job of seeking to implement this objective because they have come up with a mechanism which is heavy handed, intrusive, damaging to competition, bureaucratic and unnecessarily expensive. They have done this through key provisions in this bill, which, amongst other things, specifically mandate that property develop­ers must meet certain requirements to install so-called fibre-ready infrastructure and also give the minister the power to impose technical standards, upsetting the long-established arrangements in the industry in which technical standards are set by agreement through the industry repres­entative body, the Communications Alliance.


In the brief time available to me I want to make three central points. Firstly, it does make sense, if your objective is to improve Australia's broadband infrastructure—an objective shared by all of us on all sides of this House—to focus your policy attention on new developments. The second point I want to make is that the particular method which this government has chosen to focus on this area is unfortunate in terms of its consequences for housing policy because it makes the process of building new housing developments slower and more complex than it otherwise needs to be. Thirdly, I want to make the point that these measures are very bad in terms of their consequences for competition in telecommunications—consi­stent with every other aspect of telecom­munications policy which this government has touched.


Let me turn firstly to the central point that it does make sense to focus on new developments. It is uncontentious between the major political parties and it is uncontentious amongst all who have looked into this issue that the marginal cost of installing a fibre connection over a copper connection is much lower in greenfields sites in new developments than it is in existing homes and buildings. It costs a lot more to go back and retrofit existing homes and buildings, ones which currently have a copper connection, with a fibre connection than the incremental cost of fibre over copper in new developments. It therefore makes sense, as we have been happy to acknowledge in a dissenting report, to encourage the building of fibre connections in new developments. It is a sensible thing to do. Indeed, housing stock in Australia increases by around one per cent each year, so simply by encouraging fibre in new developments you begin to achieve a gradual and steady increase in the percentage of homes which are connected to fibre. Indeed, even Telstra—not known to be a friend of competition—acknowledged, in its submi­ssion to the inquiry conducted by the Joint Select Committee on the National Broadband Network, that there is a growing competitive market for the delivery of fibre networks in new developments. They remarked as follows:


Traditionally as the USO provider we have been deploying copper based infrastructure at the request of developers. More recently a competitive fibre deployment industry had arisen and a number of providers, including Telstra, deployed fibre in many new developments under contract to the developer.


In other words, what we have is the market responding to demand and increasingly installing fibre infrastructure in new developments around Australia without the intervention or assistance of government. The Gillard government would no doubt find this an extraordinary proposition, but the market is, in fact, efficiently responding to demand and fibre is already being built in a material number of new developments around Australia. And what has been the response of the Gillard government? As usual they have rushed in to clamp the dead hand of government upon this nascent market. Their central planning instincts have been spurred by these developments and their policy settings choke off the market response, as I will come to in more detail in a moment.


Let me turn to make the second point I want to make. This bill is a bad idea when it comes to the question of housing policy. We all know that there is a looming housing shortage in Australia, and the last thing that we ought to be doing is imposing new complex bureaucratic requirements upon property developers. Unfortunately, that is precisely what the arrangements mandated by this bill do. They add expense and delay for those wishing to build new housing estates. Notwithstanding the government's rhetoric, in practical terms this bill gives developers a very strong financial disin­centive to deal with operators other than NBN Co. In turn, this leaves developers at the mercy of NBN Co.'s responsiveness and timeliness. NBN Co. will become a bottle­neck through which all property develop­ments must pass before they can be completed and brought to market. I confidently predict that the downstream consequences for Australians wishing to purchase new housing are likely to include increased delay and expense. Let me note the comments of the Housing Industry Assoc­iation when they appeared before the committee's inquiry:


The legislation needs to make it very clear who is responsible for the delivery and that there are certain obligations on the provider to do that in a very timely way, otherwise it will delay development.


The Housing Industry Association went on to say:


It should not take more than a couple of phone calls and a meeting to sort out it being put into the critical path of the development, otherwise those projects will be delayed whilst certain things are waiting for a provider to provide that infrastructure.


Unfortunately, the complex arrangements in this bill do not give the certainty that the Housing Industry Association is seeking. The unfortunate consequence is that there is likely to be a bottleneck as projects queue up to get the tick from the National Broadband Network Co.


Thirdly, let me turn to the most substantive point I want to make, which is that the approach in this bill is a very poor approach when it comes to the question of competition policy in telecommunications. The practical effect of this bill is to minimise competition and choice as to who will build fibre networks in greenfields locations in new developments. As a consequence, this bill represents a missed opportunity to impose effective, competitive and cost discipline on the National Broadband Network Co. If there is one thing we have seen in spades to date, it is that the National Broadband Network Co. certainly requires a healthy dose of competitive pressure. If it were the case that developers had a viable option to use a party other than NBN Co. to build out fibre networks in their develop­ments, then developers would be likely to choose parties other than NBN Co. if those parties were able to build a network for them more cheaply, more quickly and more conveniently. That, in turn, would produce a more efficient outcome if it meant that infrastructure in new developments were built at a lower cost than if all fibre in new developments were installed by NBN Co. under a monopoly. It would also have the incidental and not trivial benefit of getting live and operational fibre networks into new developments as they were being built rather than developers and, in turn, the people who will live in those developments, being forced to wait until a connection can be made at a time of NBN Co.'s convenience. Let me remind you, Madam Deputy Speaker D'Ath, that NBN Co.'s stated build time frame goes out to 2020. They are already months behind their plans.


So, under the model chosen by this government in which all paths run to NBN Co. unfortunately many Australians are going to be waiting a very long time to get a fibre connection, and it is richly ironic that there is already in place a private sector market which is successfully delivering fibre connections in new developments. Yet, this government's policy approach is to specific­ally impede, slow down and put hurdles in the way of the operation of that private market. The consequence is that many Australians moving into new developments will be waiting longer to get fibre connections than they would be if this meddling government had left the matter alone. Despite the empty commitments and despite the vapid rhetoric from the minister for broadband who claimed, 'Developers will be able to source fibre from competing fibre providers if they wish', the economic reality is that he and his government have set up arrangements under which developers are given a very strong financial incentive to deal with NBN Co. and a very strong financial disincentive to deal with anybody else.


According to the explanatory memor­andum, installing the fibre-ready infrastr­ucture, which is mandated by this legislation, costs around $800. There was also evidence provided to the committee that the full cost of installing a fibre connection is $1,500. Put these two numbers together and what you see is that the developer is up for an additional incremental cost of at least $700 per lot if the developer chooses to contract with a competitor to NBN Co. rather than, as the government wants it to do, just leave it and wait until NBN Co. comes along. Unfortun­ately those who will suffer will be Australians moving into new premises who would have expected, had the private sector market continued to operate, to have received a fibre connection. They will now be waiting a very long time in many cases, given the very long period over which NBN Co.'s operations are scheduled to occur.


Fundamentally the regime established by this bill is damaging to competition in the market for the provision of new fibre infrastructure and there are three reasons for that. Firstly, it exposes existing non-NBN operators, who are already in the marketplace providing fibre connections in new developments, to competition from a government funded competitor with enorm­ously deep pockets, which is prepared to install fibre at zero cost to any developer which has incurred the expense of building trenches and other fibre-ready facilities. In effect that makes it impossible for those competitors of NBN to continue to operate competitively with it.


Secondly, this bill is damaging to competition because the standards as to what constitutes a 'fibre-ready facility'—for example, a pit to be built in a new development—will in practical terms be set by the National Broadband Network Co. For example, proposed section 372W of the bill says that a fibre-ready facility is one which amongst other things satisfies such condit­ions as are specified by the minister. It is clear from the statement of expectations issued by the government last year that NBN Co. will be in the driver's seat in determining what the minister specifies because it says:


The Government expects NBN Co to provide guidance on technical specifications as early as possible.


The statement of expectations also says that NBN Co. would consult with the Comm­unications Alliance. But let us be absolutely clear and lay to rest this misleading claim being made by government members today that, in some way, the existing industry process will continue. That is absolutely not the case. Under the existing process the Communications Alliance makes the decisions. Under the new process NBN Co. will make the decisions and the Commun­ications Alliance will be required to rubber stamp them. There is plenty of experience as to the damage to competition that occurs when the dominant player is able to set technical standards. It was for that precise reason that, in 1989, the power to set technical standards was transferred from Telecom Australia to an independent body. This government in this bill, as in so many other ways, is going backwards in a very bad way when it comes to competition.


Thirdly, this bill is very damaging to competition in the market for the provision of fibre because it fundamentally undermines business models used by greenfield fibre operators today. 


This bill needs profound amendment if it is not to seriously damage competition, and I commend to you the amendments that the coalition has moved.

"O'Neill, Deb, MP",ALP,2011-07-04,"



Ms O'NEILL
 (Robertson) (16:59):  I rise to speak in support of the Telecom­munications Legislation Amend­ment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011. In reflecting on the comments of the member for Bradfield, one would think that compet­ition is at the heart of this bill and the sole and only interest he has in the debate. The reality is that we are dealing with a very practical, real-life matter that will impact profoundly on the lives of Australians, and I am very pleased to support the bill put to the House.


This bill puts into legislation an election commitment to make sure that all new developments, subject to exceptions, are fibre friendly. That means that new resid­ential developments will be able to connect to a fibre-to-the-premises network without the need for further work being done to the premises. At its heart, this is an equity issue. The bill applies to developments conducted by corporations, which includes the vast majority of development and construction companies nationally. The bill certainly has application on the Central Coast, the region that I represent, and it has the capacity to significantly enhance employment and life outcomes for people living in new dwellings on the Central Coast.


Given that the National Broadband Net­work is a Commonwealth project des­igned to benefit the national economy, it is very desirable that this legislation be enforced under Commonwealth law. As with many other members of the House, the National Broadband Network has been a priority issue in my electorate and much of my work as a local member in this term of parliament has been to ensure that the potential of the NBN is effectively understood. I have been working very hard with local health, educ­ation and other business sector partners to help to bring about the earliest possible rollout in my electorate.


I have been meeting with key stakeholders on the NBN on a regular basis and have been campaigning for a priority rollout on the Central Coast. Key people driving this initiative in my area include Dave Abrahams, an IT specialist, who has become quite a champion of the NBN, Edgar Adams, a local business advocate and representative, and even Paul Budde, who consults intern­ationally on the NBN. Each of these men and other leaders in our community see that connecting the NBN to all premises, both new and established premises, is a critical part of ensuring that all Australians are able to move forward together as this technology becomes available. The National Broadband Network certainly arouses great interest in my electorate and it is seen by many local business owners and community leaders as a critical means by which to level the playing field between those living in regions such as mine and those living in the cities, represented by the member for Bradfield, and to come to some equitable arrangement in terms of access to the world economy.


The Central Coast is a region with unique challenges. It is a growing area, a place where small business is vital for the health of the local economy and where new develop­ments are coming online. On the Central Coast, small businesses provide services and employment for the people in our region. I am very proud of our local businesses and I am particularly proud of local IT companies that compete nationally and internationally to provide services. Many of these small and medium sized businesses operate from the Central Coast and provide local employment and opportunities for our residents. I certain­ly will support anything in this parliament that enables better participation and more local employment, and I herald the excel­lence of our local staff in engaging in this growing field.


In terms of the personal and business assets that we have on the Central Coast, I believe that the National Broadband Network will help us to develop and extend already successful businesses to further improve their success and, because of that, I support this bill which will enable a more effective rollout of the NBN in the region. In ensuring that development corporations install the carrying infrastructure of the NBN, the general rollout of infrastructure will certainly be more efficient and effective. The bill will also ensure that, after the National Broad­band Network has been rolled out, all new developments fulfil their responsibilities as to future applications of the internet in the delivery of health and education to homes through the installation of fibre-friendly infrastructure.


It is also vital that we are prepared for the reality that new businesses and new business models are yet to be born and that their infancy may be in small businesses, not in boardrooms with desks and those sorts of facilities, but in small home offices or in the new mobile world of local cafes in which entrepreneurs are increasingly doing busin­ess in open-to-view social settings. This is common-sense legislation. It is a move to equity because it will ensure that new residential premises, where new businesses may well be emerging, are able to take complete advantage of the NBN. The bill will also enable the cost of the NBN to be reduced in new residential developments because there will be access to non-carrier ductwork in those developments.


This bill represents an initiative to roll out the National Broadband Network in an efficient and effective way. No-one can deny that rolling out the NBN is a challenge in terms of infrastructure. But nation building infrastructure is always challenging; it is both visionary and practically challenging. It is always a challenge for any government to provide critical new infrastructure. We have only to look back at the challenges faced by governments that undertook commitments to roll out the railways across this great country of ours, the national road network to connect us across all of those miles and the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Opera House. All those critical pieces of infrastructure involved having a vision for the future and a commitment to ensuring that the practical work was undertaken to enable them to come into being.


Infrastructure as comprehensive as the National Broadband Network is certainly ambitious, but it is also very responsible. It is ambitious in that it calls on our generation at this time to invest in the capacities of the next generation and to make the NBN a critically productive part of our economy. It is responsible because we know that, without access to this internationally empowering technology, we would be making a decision to exclude our people from participation in the global digital economy and workplace.


I often hear from, and read reports about, people from the conservative side of politics who assert, with misunderstanding, that this vital piece of infrastructure is not needed. But I am delighted to be part of this government, which has decided to undertake the challenge and commit itself to ensuring that the project is completed. I do hear from the other side of politics that we should not be bothered with this and that it will be a blow to competition. But competition will not support people in homes yet to be built if we do not support this legislation and put it in place to the advantage of new home dwellers. The NBN is certainly not just about upload capacity. It is far more sophisticated than that. It does a lot more than enable fast downloads of movies. It has the capacity to transform our economy and also to have a profound impact on social benefits for our community. In terms of its social impact, one of the critical things that we have seen just in the last couple of days is the capacity for medical appointments to be teleconferenced across large distances. Currently this can happen in established premises but this bill will address the reality of yet-to-be-built premises also having the capacity to delivery health services, and that needs to be considered in the development of this bill.


The national economy as a whole benefits from the economic growth and health of the nation's regional areas. The economic poten­tial of an area such as mine needs to be realised, and this can only be done that if we are able to engage with the global market. Another social benefit of the National Broadband Network is obviously education. In my area we have the benefit of quality public and private schooling. Our children certainly benefit from access to these quality schools. When they return home to their new houses in new developments they need to be able to access the internet. We need to get on with this job in a way that is equitable. University students on the Central Coast are also critically impacted by decisions made in this place about the rollout of the NBN. Currently students can access materials online and correspond with other students online, but they also need to be able to do this from the sites at their homes, in the new developments, and critically that is what this bill is dealing with.


High-speed broadband based on fibre-optic technology will be vital in enabling the development of a great future for Australia. It will provide regional schools with resources; it will provide regional commu­nities with access to health. This is a nation building initiative. It is going to have far-reaching consequences on which this parliament can look back with pride.


This bill enshrines the powers invested in the Australian Communications and Media Authority to develop standards in relation to third-party use of the network. The long-term success of the National Broadband Network is absolutely reliant on the successful interr­elation between owners of the infrastructure and the providers. The powers that have been invested in the ACMA and the ACCC will ensure that there is appropriate regulation and competition in the provision of these services from the National Broadband Network.


I support this bill because it demonstrates the government's commitment to ensuring a vital piece of infrastructure for Australia's future is completed and a success for all Australians. This goes exactly to a comment made by the member for New England: 'You do it once, you do it right and you do it with fibre'. I look forward to the day when the National Broadband Network has been constructed and our economy and society is advancing as a result, be it in new or established housing. I know that day will arrive, and I believe when it does my cons­tituents will benefit enormously. I commend this bill to the House.

"Prentice, Jane, MP",LP,2011-07-04,"



Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (17:10):  No-one disputes the benefits of a national broadband network. The coalition support high-speed broadband but what we do not support is the outdated monopoly telco model being run by the incompetence of NBN Co. The member for Robertson said that this will impact profoundly on the lives of Australians, and indeed it will because for generations we will be paying off the billions of wasted dollars spent on the NBN and the NBN Co.


For far too many years Australian consumers and businesses have suffered from over-priced telecommunications. I look back to over 30 years ago, indeed last cent­ury, when a subcommittee of the Sydney Chamber of Commerce decided they had to do something about the monopoly of Telecom Australia, as it was known then, and from that ATUG was born—the Aust­ralian Telecommunications Users Group. For many years, we saw ATUG and other industry bodies struggle to bring competition into the market, struggle to bring in some competition for products, service and pricing. Finally, just as we were achieving competition, we were handed back a last century model, a last century way of doing business—NBN Co. a monopoly. This is not the way forward and this is not the way other countries around the world are rolling out their telecommunications.


The amendment proposed by the member for Wentworth and the coalition is about greenfields sites. We already have an exam­ple in Townsville, in the seat of Herbert, where a developer is desperate to sign off on his new development but he cannot get anyone to lay the fibre in the conduits, which he has already provided. This is because NBN Co. have told him that it is not ready yet, but when it is ready it will roll over the top of what he has already done. So, once again, we have the bully-boy tactics of some of the people at NBN Co. They are threat­ening very good opportunities in greenfields sites and, furthermore, some of our redeveloped brownfields sites in Brisbane. Some years ago, the local government in South-East Queensland wrote to the federal minister seeking assistance in this area, and of course, as usual, the response was silence and it was deafening—absolutely no resp­onse let alone assistance. The local govern­ment wanted to get on with the job and do it then. But many of those areas will be left until 2020 before they can get competent communication facilities.


When we look at the greenfields sites we see the need for and the benefit from some of the smaller companies providing those facilities. We heard before about some of the innovation that could come from it. A trial was conducted in your area, Madam Deputy Speaker D'Ath, in Virginia in Brisbane. Fibre optic cable was rolled out from Virginia to Chermside at less than a third of the cost projected by NBN Co. We have seen NBN Co. sack the messenger, as in two of its officers, because they came up with a fibre rollout above their projected cost. Yet we had an example, which we offered to them to look at, of where we had done it for less than a third of their projected costs. I support the opportunity of private companies rolling out fibre. I think it will be a benefit. I think we might see some different methods of doing it.


It is very disappointing that NBN Co. have chosen to ignore some of the other models around the world, like Bournemouth, where this rollout has already occurred efficiently and effectively. There are opport­unities there. There are lessons to be learned but NBN Co. have the protection of the Gillard government and are not interested in doing anything cost effectively or efficiently because they do not have to worry about that and because they know the poor taxpayers will have their hands in their pockets to pay for the rollout cost.


There is no doubt that the rollout of NBN will be of benefit, but the problem we have is the way it is being done and the cost. I look at facilities such as a new industrial estate near the airport in Brisbane where we already have high-quality, high-standard fibre throughout the development. Yet NBN Co. have told them that they will roll over the top of it. It will not necessarily be with anything better—possibly with something inferior—but they are so determined to protect the monopoly to keep out other people that they are prepared to roll over and waste money on a product that is already in the ground and already operating.


That is the mentality we are trying to deal with in this bill. That is why the member for Wentworth has proposed some very reason­able amendments to facilitate assistance on some of these greenfield sites and new estates. They are not just in Herbert. They are in the western suburbs of Brisbane. They are areas where, if we were more relaxed about competition, we could benefit already and people could have it before the 2020 date.


The member for Wentworth mentioned South Korea, where fibre goes to the basement of the building. There are other methods as well. He mentioned copper. They have also have satellite and wireless. They do the extra mile waiting for the take-up so they can look at benefits going forward. We do not have to roll out the tens of billions of dollars solution that has been proposed.


It is a bit like giving all the roads to Ford and letting Ford control the model of the cars that go on them. That is the restriction we are putting on our consumers and on the industry. Once again we are consigning Australia back to the last century for communications, for overpricing. Once again we see that the Gillard government is all about grand plans, but always with other people's money. There is opportunity here for private enterprise to be involved but, no, we have to get the NBN Co. privatised, a monopoly that only they control. The only conclusion we can draw from the continual refusal to refer this for a cost-benefit analysis is that there is something more to hide because I cannot understand why you would not benefit from having a cost-benefit analysis, from seeing where we can save money, from seeing where we can partner with private enterprise and providing open access.


The world declared the music industry would fall over when Napster was introd­uced because there would be open access. Anyone could put up whatever they wanted. Yet we have seen it flourish and benefit from open access. I believe an open access, synchronous, ubiquitous NBN would be of benefit to all Australians. We need to work with private enterprise, not against them. We will get a better deal for taxpayers, a better deal for the users of communications and, hopefully, a better deal for Australia. I commend the amendments put forward by the coalition and I really hope for a better outcome.

Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (17:18):  It is a great pleasure to witness the rollout of a historic nation-building infrastructure project like the National Broadband Network. It is a great privilege to be part of the Labor government that has the vision and courage to embark on a major reform and a major project such as this. It is a great privilege to support a major structural reform to Australia's telecommunications industry that simply would not have been brought about had we not embarked upon this project, a reform that is going to benefit consumers for decades to come.


The NBN will enable the Australian econ­omy to grow, to transform and to adapt into the economy of the future, thereby securing our prosperity. The NBN will provide Australia with world-class broadband techn­ology. It will open up a genuine choice of services and drive competitive prices for consumers, whether they live in capital cities or in regional Australia or in rural and remote areas.


In supporting this project and speaking on this Telecommunication Legislation Amend­ment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011, which is an important part of the package of legislation to roll out the NBN, it is an absolute pleasure to stare down the nay-sayers on the other side who have had nothing but carping negativity and criticism on this project from the very get-go. I will go through some of the carping criticism that we have experienced on this project to show where the nay-sayers have been proved wrong even at this very early stage in the delivery of the project.


They know that they are wrong. The shadow minister knows it, the member for Bradfield knows it, and everyone opposite who represents regional Australia in this place knows it because they would have received the phone calls, letters, emails and questions from constituents saying: 'I have heard about this NBN. When is it coming past our suburb? When is it coming into my house?' It is disappointing that the member for Gilmore, which adjoins my electorate of Throsby in the Illawarra and has been chosen as one of the pilot sites, instead of champion­ing this as a local representative, is out there day in, day out bagging it and showing her lack of understanding and support for what it means for the local region. It is not so for all the political representatives in the Kiama and broader South Coast area. There are many political representatives who are great champions of this project. It is a good news story for our region and for the people on the South Coast and in the Illawarra. I simply cannot understand why the nay-sayers spend so much time and energy talking it down.


The NBN will be a boon to electorates in regional areas like the Illawarra and the South Coast because it will quite simply bring economic, social and community infrastructure right into people's homes, thereby connecting them to the markets and to the entertainment not only of the capital cities but also the world. As an MP for a region that adjoins one of the pilot sites, it is a privilege to join with local organisations like Regional Development Australia Illaw­arra and the Kiama Municipal Council in imagining a broadband future for the region. Only recently new funding was announced to help local councils, including the Kiama Municipal Council, take full advantage of the National Broadband Network through the development and upgrade of innovative online service delivery to homes and businesses. Under the Digital Local Govern­ment program, which the minister announced a few weeks ago, the Kiama Municipal Council will receive in excess of $370,000 to develop digital solutions that can then be adapted by other councils and rolled out across the country as the NBN rolls out. I know from my conversations with the mayor, Sandra McCarthy, and other councillors on that council that they are very pleased to be involved in such an exciting and innovative project.


It is also a great privilege to play a small part in the facilitation of this project by speaking on and voting in favour of the legislation that marks each step of the steady progress towards providing fast, efficient and affordable telecommunications services for the Australian population and in particular regions like my own where there are still suburbs where people are unable to receive broadband services because of the way that the exchanges are configured, the lack of broadband capability from the local exchanges, the geography of the region and the build-up of many of the new suburbs and the way they were wired up to telecom­munications services using mainly RIM based technology.


When it comes to matters NBN, I am pleased to speak today in support of this bill, the Telecommunications Legislation Amend­ment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011, which will ensure that no more will we see suburbs built up without having access to fast, reliable broadband services because in the process of building up those suburbs we will be digging the pits and laying the pipes and the cable which will ensure that when people move into those new houses they will have the capacity to switch on broadband services from the very get go. That is perhaps something that some of those who live in electorates where they are not building new suburbs may not understand, but I can tell you that in the electorate of Throsby where we have two new suburbs in West Dapto and Albion Park going in it will make an incredible difference to people who move into those homes to know that they will be wired up from the very beginning. So I welcome it.


The telecommunications fibre deployment bill amends the 1997 act to do a number of things that affect the provision of utility infrastructure in new real estate develop­ments. The bill requires developers that are constitutional corporations to install fibre ready passive infrastructure. It requires this passive infrastructure in the long term footprint of the NBN project to be fibre ready. Penalties will apply if a constitutional corporation sells or leases land or a building situated in a new development unless fibre ready facilities have been installed, thereby creating the requirement that these facilities are there for the new suburbs when they are built.


The bill creates a power that enables the minister to specify new developments in which fixed lines which are installed need to be optical fibre. Finally, this bill enables the Australian Communications and Media Authority to make standards for customer equipment and cabling for use with the NBN and other superfast networks. The outcome of the legislation will be that residents of new developments will have early and less costly access to the NBN network when it is rolled out into these developments.


Those on the other side have identified the issue of cost in relation to this legislation. Nothing could be more costly when building a new suburb than overlooking the opport­unity when the trenches are being dug, the footpaths are being laid and all the other utilities are going into those houses in a new estate and saying, 'We will put electricity, gas and sewerage in there but what we will not do is connect you to the National Broadband Network. We will not be laying fibre optic cable into those suburbs because we have a blind spot when it comes to the National Broadband Network. We will leave it to the market or some other solution to lay cable in those areas.' Nothing could be more wasteful. Nothing could be more costly than saying, 'We will leave it until some other time or not at all.'


You can imagine the outrage of local residents having moved into their beautiful new suburb with new footpaths, new gardens and new grass laid down when all of a sudden it is decided to lay fibre optic cable into the suburb and in comes the trenching gear digging up concrete that has just been laid for footpaths or digging up grass that has just been laid or perhaps laying a new layer of overhead cable through these areas. They will all be scratching their heads and asking, 'Why on earth wasn't this done when the street was laid and the power was put in?' If we left it to the wisdom of those opposite, that is exactly what would be occurring. The propositions within this bill are nothing more than militant common sense. Unfortunately it is militant common sense that is not shared by those on the other side of the chamber.


I will take the opportunity to talk for a moment about the agreement between NBN Co. and Telstra and Optus, because it is good news for telecommunications customers. Definitive agreements have been executed that, together with Telstra's structural separ­ation undertaking, create a framework for Telstra's participation in the NBN. The NBN Co.-Telstra definitive agreements, including an interim access agreement, provide for the re-use of suitable Telstra infrastructure by NBN Co. and for Telstra to progressively structurally separate by decommissioning its copper network and broadband HFC network capability during the NBN fibre rollout and using the NBN to provide fixed line services to customers within the fibre footprint. The definitive agreements translate the financial heads of agreement signed on 20 June 2010 into detailed, legally-binding agreements. The NBN Co. has also negotiated a deal with Optus to migrate its HFC customers to the NBN. So what we have here really puts a huge hole in the argument that was being run by the member for Wentworth and many of those who have rallied to his call. I have to say that the member for Wentworth takes to this argument as a man with not too much enthusiasm. What those opposite have been saying for most of the last nine months is that this NBN is somehow going to be a great big white elephant, that it is going to be a communications service with no customers and that it is something we are overinvesting in because nobody is going to use it. The agreement that has been reached with Telstra and the agreement that is being reached with Optus show what an outrageous untruth that was and how they simply do not understand how this project is going to roll out. 


As a result of these agreements we are going to see the migration of all of the fixed-line customers of Telstra and Optus onto the National Broadband Network. The National Broadband Network will be the backbone. The fibre-optic cable of the National Broadband Network and all those intercon­necting networks will be the telecom­munications network which is delivering fixed-line telecommunications services to those millions of existing Telstra and Optus customers. Far from being a vacant white elephant, from the very get-go as that migration occurs, those fixed-line customers who are currently having their telecom­munications service delivered through the ageing copper network are going to be migrated onto the optical fibre network, the modern NBN, and those services will be delivered. They will be enhanced services. Presumably Optus and Telstra will retain the retail relationship with their customers, but it will be the NBN which is delivering the telecommunications service.


This is good news. It is good news for the customers of Telstra and Optus but it is also good news for the country because it shows that there is a way forward, after in excess of 12 years, when literally nothing was happen­ing in terms of reforming the telecomm­unications regulatory system in this country, reforming the telecommunications market and investing in a fast, reliable, high-speed broadband network. Nothing was happening, particularly in electorates like mine. This legislation, together with the other reforms that have already been introduced, is seeing real reforms being rolled out to real people in real houses in real suburbs. The caravan is moving on and the dogs are barking. We know that there is a need and a hunger for it. 


According to the OECD statistics regard­ing average broadband subscription prices, out of 33 countries Australia is the third most expensive country for very low-speed connections, the 14th most expensive for high-speed connections and the 12th most expensive for very high-speed connections. As a result of this legislation, together with the other package of reforms and the investment that is going on today in laying that cable and connecting those houses, we are reforming not only the technology but the telecommunications market. There will be more players in the market and the net result of this is going to be faster, more reliable, more ubiquitous broadband services for the people of Australia and for my electorate of Throsby, and that has to be a good thing. I commend the bill to the House.

"Tehan, Dan, MP",LP,2011-07-04,"



Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (17:33):  I rise this evening to talk about the Telecom­munications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill, which once again demon­strates this government's ability to take an area of policy, an area of the economy, which is functioning and working well and to potentially turn it into a mess. The greenfields sector for the provision of fibre-optic services was an area which was working relatively well, and now we have a government which, unfortunately, is legisl­ating to make a mess of this area and, it would seem, to entrench monopolistic practice, which I do not think it can be argued is in anyone's interests. 


We have had already a dissenting report from coalition members of the Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network, which examined the bill. Coalition members have called for three amendments for three main reasons, three very valid reasons. Firstly, the regime established by the bill is unnecessarily slow and bureau­cratic for property developers, so rather than speeding things up and creating less red tape this bill is going to have the potential to do the opposite. How we can come into this place and argue that we want to see optic fibre rolled out more slowly in greenfields sites and for there to be greater bureaucracy in the way it is rolled out beggars belief, but that seems to be what the government is proposing here. 


The second reason that coalition members believe that the bill needs to be amended is that, as presently drafted, it  represents a missed opportunity to take advantage of the existence of the competitive greenfields operators to impose effective competitive and cost discipline on NBN Co. It is especially worth highlighting the phrase 'to impose effective competitive and cost discipline on NBN Co.' I think we would all argue that we need to see that when it comes to NBN Co., because if we do not we are going to see the creation of one of the greatest white elephants this country has ever seen. In an area in particular where the market seemed to be working quite well, we now look like we are going to have a bill which will impose more uncompetitiveness and less cost discipline on the behemoth which this government is setting up in this area, NBN Co. The third reason that the coalition members believe the bill should be amended is that the regime established by the bill is damaging to competition in the market for the provision of new fibre infrastructure. So, rather than driving further competition into the sector, it is actually going to do the opposite. They are the three key reasons the coalition has problems with the Telecom­munications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill. I will explain in a little more detail what these problems are and then raise another issue which is directly relevant—the rolling out of broadband to greenfield sites where we will not be able to provide optic fibre. That was being done under the Australian Broadband Guarantee program, which was meant to run for an additional 12 months. Sadly, the govern­ment, although it said on its website that it was to run for another year, has pulled the pin on it. We now have to rely on NBN Co. using satellite to provide services in this area. That has caused sovereign risk damage to those wireless providers that were operating under the Australian Broadband Guarantee—something which we have seen occur all too often with this government. It also means that consumers in areas where we will not see fibre to the premise are going to suffer because they are going to get delayed and inadequate services provided by satellite. I will touch on that in a bit more detail as well.


The NBN estimates that 1.9 million greenfield households will have to be connected to the NBN by 2020 and 250,000 households will have to be connected by June 2013. You would hope that what we get is less red tape and more competition to make sure that this occurs. The NBN has allocated more than $100 million to connect greenfield households. Once again, we do not see any detailed costings or analysis on how the NBN will allocate its money. It is just that we have a figure of more than $100 million to connect greenfield households within the first year of operation. In the first five months of 2011, NBN Co. received more than 1,480 applications from greenfield developers, representing approximately 133,000 premises to be connected across Australia. So there is demand for these premises to be connected. The problem is that the marginal cost of installing fibre in new housing developments is low compared to the benefits. The government's policy paper on greenfields estimated that the cost of rolling out a fibre-to-the-premise conn­ection is approximately $2,500, which is about $1,500 greater than the cost per premise of a broadband capable copper based connection. However, the increased cost will not always be paid upfront by homeowners. Traditionally, it has been split by developers and telecommunication providers who recoup costs through offering superior services. 


Although we on this side support regulation that would ensure fibre to the premise is used in greenfield estates, there are several concerns. Changes to the market structure will ensue from the role of NBN Co. as a provider of last resort. However, NBN Co. has agreed to absorb the cost of rolling out fibre in greenfield sites—costing up to $3,000—which puts them at a competitive advantage to competitors who must come to an arrangement with devel­opers. Again, we have an area of competition where, by setting these rules, we ensure that NBN Co. has the advantage as the behemoth. As the white elephant that it has the potential to become, it will sadly be able to gouge and make sure that where there is competition it will be lessened. 


There is also huge worry—and this is why the design of the bill does seem fraught and lacking—that the lack of consultation with industry will result in an eleventh hour decision that the NBN establishes technical standards that will be too onerous for small providers to meet. In a market where we need to encourage smaller providers, this government is sadly going to create a sit­uation where NBN Co., through onerous regulation, will be able to dominate the market. Part of the rationale that the gov­ernment gave for the NBN is that it would end the dominance of the vertically integrated Telstra. According to the ACMA Communications report 2009-10, Telstra boasts 82 per cent of the fixed line telephone market and 65 per cent of the DSL, which accounts for 82 per cent of fixed line internet connections. 


The opening up of Telstra exchanges have to an extent diminished Telstra's dominance. The number of unbundled services offered by competing ISPs increased by 23 per cent between June 2009 and June 2010. Telstra's share of the market was reduced from 70 per cent to 65 per cent. However, the greenfield market is incredibly competitive. Of the 909,000 cable and fibre connections in Australia, more than 400,000 have been connected by small operators under the greenfield fibre operators of Australia. The government's own policy document on greenfield estates states:


The installation of FTTP is taking place in a competitive context, with developers typically contracting out the provision of infrastructure and services in developments. 


Why then are we again looking to concen­trate commercial power in this market when the government's own documents say that we are seeing good competition here? 


Once again we are seeing a government that seems to want to re-regulate, to create a large player to replace Telstra and, sadly, to impact on the small providers.


On that matter, I want to spend some time looking at what is happening with the Australian broadband guarantee, because we are going to see the same thing happen there as well. We have small competitors operating and providing services through wireless, yet the government is bringing forward the end of the Australian broadband guarantee program by 12 months, creating serious sovereign risk to these wireless providers in country areas. They have now decided that that will be replaced by NBN Co., who have now said that they are going to use satellite. It seems that they are not in a position to roll out the satellite services at the speed with which the wireless providers were under the Australian broadband guar­antee.


There is also no guarantee that an equivalence of service in terms of speed will be provided. It is commonly acknowledged, especially in country areas, that wireless is a far superior technology to satellite and is far more economical from an installation and maintenance perspective. So I would strong­ly urge the government to look again at this issue and urge against using satellite to infill or provide a quick fix for wireless areas whilst the NBN wireless network is built. We should see a continuation of the Australian broadband guarantee program, at least for another 12 months, until NBN Co. and the government can get their act together and we can see wireless once again being provided to those regional and rural areas which will otherwise suffer while this 12-month or potentially two- to three-year gap in satellite provision is filled by NBN Co.


This bill needs a serious examination. It needs to go to the Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network, which can look into all elements of it. Sadly, like many other pieces of policy we have seen from this government, in the end it is going to create more red tape rather than less, especially for smaller operators. It seems it is going to drive less competition into this sector rather than more, and this will occur in an area where competition, in the government's own words, has been working extremely well. It is also a shame that what we are going to see, through red tape and costs, is probably that NBN Co. will in the end be the major provider of services in this area and, sadly, will push competition out of this sector. That will be damaging to telecommunications providers and the industry. I call on the government to really think seriously about going back to the drawing board with this piece of legislation, going back to industry, making sure that they consult properly with industry and making sure that we get a piece of legislation which will actually lessen red tape and continue to see strong competition in an area where it already exists.

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2011-07-04,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (17:48):  I would like to begin by telling a story that comes from one of the many mobile offices that I enjoy running through my electorate of Fraser. I was standing one morning at the Kippax shopping centre and a woman came up to me and said: 'There are two issues I want to talk to you about. The first one is that I am retired, I am now in my 80s and I'm concerned about the local bus network.' So we talked for a while about the local bus network, where the stops were located and how that worked for her. Then she said, 'The second issue that concerns me is superfast broadband.' She said: 'I like to communicate with my daughter using Skype, and the picture is really patchy at the moment. You keep on talking about this superfast broadband thing, but when are we going to get it? When am I going to get a video connection that allows me to connect with my daughter?'


What this brought home to me is that those opposite are just so out of touch when they think that superfast broadband is about tweens playing video games. Superfast broadband is a technology that will funda­mentally transform Australian society, and it will do that wherever you are on the age spectrum. That is why there are pensioners in my electorate, there are working age people and there are students who are enthusiastic about superfast broadband.


We know some of the ways in which superfast broadband is going to begin transforming our lives. We know, for example, that it will allow access to medical specialists. If you live in an area which does not have a particular medical specialist and you want the chance to see a podiatrist, say, then you will have the option through superfast broadband to do an online consult­ation with a specialist. Otherwise, you might have to wait in pain for weeks or months until a specialist comes through your town or you have a chance to travel to a place where they are. But with access to superfast broadband we will be able to use technology to deal with the challenge of distance.


With education, of course, superfast broadband is again a transformative techn­ology. I know from the institution where I used to work, the Australian National University, that we initially experimented with what it would be like to have experts do a video seminar. It turned out that the existing technology just was not snappy enough. It really did not feel like you were in the room with the presenter. We tried it once with my friend John Quiggin, who is at the bleeding edge of technology. John's present­ation was great, but it just did not work for those of us not in the room in the way it would have worked if he had been there. But as the connections get faster, as we get those 100 megabits a second speeds that are promised by some of this technology, we will get to technology where it will feel like you are in the room. That will fundamentally transform the research enterprise. It will change for the better the experience of being in an academic seminar. No longer will we need to rely on seminar speakers being in the same city; we will be able to immediately have a presenter from the best universities, whether they be in Boston or Beijing, brought in by superfast broadband. That will make Australian researchers more prod­uctive.


Superfast broadband will also transform the employment experience. At the moment, it is a challenge if you are a part-timer working in a team. People sometimes say to me that it is okay having one part-time worker in the team, but if you have two or three it is really hard for the team to get together and have a team meeting once a week. But one can easily imagine a situation under superfast broadband in which it is possible for a member of that team to be brought into the conversation, to join the team meeting, maybe for just half an hour in order to be part of the team, and to improve their promotion opportunities at the work­place. It allows the opportunity for part-time workers to be far more integrated into the workforce than they have been before. It offers the potential for people, rather than burning up time and putting out all those CO2 emissions when they fly to a meeting interstate, to use superfast broadband be part of that meeting, to use that new com­munications infrastructure to have quick conversations with people in other states and to make their small, medium or large business even more productive.


I was at a forum in Gungahlin, in the growth heart of my electorate of Fraser. The questions the Gungahlin Community Council asked about NBN Co. were not, 'Why we are having it?' or, as the member for Wannon might have asked, 'Couldn't wireless do the job?' Those questions were not asked. They asked, 'When are we going to get superfast broadband and could we speed up the process?' They are enthusiastic about the opportunities it offers for improving econ­omic growth and the standard of living in Gungahlin. They recognise that we should, as the member for New England once said so pithily: 'Do it once. Do it right. Do it with fibre.' They recognise, as the member for Wannon and many of those opposite do not, that wireless has saturation problems. It is all very well if you are the only person connected to the wireless signal—then the speeds might be alright. But as other people come onto the network, as we get the crowding that happens as more people join the network or the crowding that we get over the day as more people log on at peak times, then the network slows down, becomes congested and ceases to be effective. That is the real challenge of wireless. It is a fundamental technological point. I am always mildly surprised when those opposite seem to be unfamiliar with the simple idea that wireless signals have saturation problems. We on this side of the House are committed to a National Broadband Network which will transform Australia for the better and be a key economic reform which sits alongside the major economic reforms that the government is putting in place.


The bill before the House, the Telecom­munications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011, will require developers that are constitutional corpor­ations to install fibre-ready passive infrast­ructure—infrastructure that makes it possible to quickly install fibre networks. It requires passive infrastructure installed in new developments in the long-term NBN fibre footprint to be fibre ready. This of course is a common-sense reform, one that is important to have in place to ensure that as many Australians as possible are able to get access to the National Broadband Network. The legislation allows carriers to access fibre-ready passive infrastructure owned by non-carriers and provides for the ACCC to have a role as the default arbitrator. The legislation creates a power for the minister to specify, by legislative instrument, developments in which fixed lines must be optical fibre. Giving the minister that power will be important in ensuring that the fibre network works as well for Australians as it can. It will provide for exemptions from the requirem­ents to install fibre-ready facilities for optical fibre lines, it will provide for ACMA to develop technical standards that will cover interoperability, performance standards, and design features for superfast broadband rollout.


This legislation is critical to the government's policy of rolling out the National Broadband Network. It will ensure early and less costly access to fibre based broadband for residents in new develop­ments. New developments, of which I expect to have many in my electorate—Fraser having most of the growth suburbs in the ACT—will experience cheaper superfast broadband. Getting that superfast broadband will be absolutely critical to those new residents feeling that they are part of the fibre network, that they have the benefits of superfast broadband network and that they are part of a community.


I have doorknocked some of the outer suburbs of the Fraser electorate. I know that, sometimes when you are doorknocking a growth suburb, you get a sense of frustration from people. Whether it arises from the bus networks, the road networks or the electricity networks, the sense of frustration of those in growth suburbs is keenly felt. This legislation accepts that that is a real issue and it steps up to the plate. Through this legislation we are saying that residents of new developments should get access to superfast broadband and that they deserve access to superfast broadband, with the e-health, e-education and teleworking benefits that superfast broadband will provide. It will give us reduced costs for the deployment of fibre by access to non-carrier duct work, ensuring that, to the greatest extent possible, we can use existing ducts and pipes rather than having to dig new ducts. There is no point in digging up footpaths that do not need to be dug up. If there are ducts in place, we want to create the opportunities for NBN Co. to use those ducts. Of course, this bill is implementing measures announced almost two years ago. The financial impact is expected to be small and it will be met from NBN implementation funding. In conclusion, I stress that the legislation before the House today is very much of a piece with a set of reforms that the Gillard government is committed to. We are committed to making policy not for the snappy grab on the evening news but for the long game—long-term reform, not simplistic three-word slogans. Those long-term reforms contain things such as compulsory superannuation—superan­nuation that will provide retirement security for millions of Australians, ensuring that Australians have the security of knowing that they can retire in dignity. We are putting in place a set of education reforms that will transform productivity—reforms such as providing school accountability through the MySchool website, rewarding the best teach­ers through performance pay, moving to demand driven university funding, and providing trades training. 


All of these root-and-branch reforms of the education system are about ensuring that in the long run we have an education system that delivers productivity, because we on this side of the House know that long-term growth in living standards comes fundam­entally from long-term growth in productivity. That is why we are so committed to these productivity-enhancing reforms such as superfast broadband and education. 


Climate change is, of course, another area in which we are committed to the long term. We listen to the scientists. We listen to the economists. Of course, when the Leader of the Opposition does not like what he hears from the scientists, he is willing to go out into crowds of sceptics carrying unusual placards. When he does not like what he hears from the economists—and he is, of course, yet to find a single economist who will back his scheme of so-called direct action rather than a market based mechanism and carbon pricing—he says, 'Maybe that reflects on the quality of the Australian economics profession.' My former co-author, Joshua Gans, who won the medal for the best Australian economist under 40 a couple of years ago, put it best on his blog when, in response, he said that, no, that actually reflects on the quality of Australian opposition leaders.


Those opposite are opposed to fundam­ental long-term reform in the area of climate change. They are concerned instead with slogans. We on this side of the House are concerned with the long game, with ensuring that we price carbon and make the steady transition to a low-emissions Australia. We are committed to the highway network of the 21st century—the National Broadband Network—laying down an infrastructure that will be as critical to future generations as the road network and the rail network are to ours, an infrastructure that those opposite will oppose now but, I suspect, will look back upon in their dotage and think: 'How did I do that? How did I find myself on the wrong side of that debate? What was I thinking in saying that Australia should be stuck in the slow lane of the information superhighway?' I commend the bill to the House.

Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff) (18:02):  In this debate on the Telecommunications Legisl­ation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011, it is indeed a unique privilege for me to have the opportunity to follow the member for Fraser, for a number of reasons. One is to do with the very first example that the member for Fraser gave of why the 'superfast broadband', to use his words, that the Labor government is rolling out through NBN Co. is going to be such a revolution in this country. He said that it will enable those in remote areas to interact and have a consultation of sorts—a virtual consultation, if you will—with a specialist somewhere else, and that this is going to revolutionise the health industry. Otherwise—and he had to walk a very fine line here—that person could be left waiting for weeks to consult a specialist. I noticed he never referred to the fact that state Labor governments have presided over the at-times abysmal health system in this country, with various public hospitals having extraordinarily long waiting lists. That was conveniently left to one side.


Notwithstanding that, he made the point about this revolution that is coming as a result of superfast NBN broadband. He must not have been here in question time. Where were you, Member for Fraser, in question time? Had he been here listening he would have heard the Minister for Health and Ageing and the Prime Minister wax lyrical about the revolution in health. It was a matter of only a couple of days ago that the Prime Minister was in Darwin and the health minister was in Adelaide and they undertook a consultation between a specialist and a patient, one in Adelaide and one in Darwin. There is no NBN, but this happening now. In fact, the government was crowing about it in question time. There is no need for the expenditure of some $53 billion of taxpayers' funds to build the NBN; it is happening today. What an unfortunate choice the member for Fraser made for his very first example of how the NBN is going to change the way Australians will live.


I am also a little intrigued, following on from the member for Fraser, about the way in which the Labor Party seems to have taken to its beating bosom the notion that the NBN is going to be the greatest thing since sliced bread. We hear it from member after member as they trot out their various speaking points. They have the fever—the new religion—that the NBN is going to be the thing that changes the world. You can almost hear them all saying 'amen' in unison as the various members of the Labor Party stand up. It was fascinating to hear that it is not just fast broadband, high-speed broad­band or a somehow faster form of broadband. What we kept hearing from the member for Fraser, over and over again, were those two words that, almost for dramatic effect, he ran together: 'superfast broadband' he kept saying.


I am intrigued. There was an article only a week or so ago that spoke about the opport­unity there might be for new technologies to allow data transfer speeds of up to one terabit per second. We have the government talking about superfast broadband at 100 megabits per second. I would love to see the member for Fraser come back into the House, if we do have one-terabit data transfer rates, and talk about 'super-super fast-fast' broadband or some such thing. You can almost sense the excitement. I know I was excited listening to it, but I have to say, the Labor Party is like any good spiv with a silk tie. Unfortunately, the Labor Party is filled with salesmen. It is filled with salesmen rather than people who actually know what they are talking about.


We also heard the member for Fraser wax lyrical about saturation problems with wireless technology. A country of 22 million people potentially has saturation problems with wireless technology! I interjected, but I am not sure whether it was picked up by Hansard. I asked, 'What do they do in India and China?' The last time I checked, the populations of those countries were a little bit bigger than ours. And, the last time I checked, those countries had full access to mobile telephony and full access to data transfer. I think even Korea and Japan do, as well. So just maybe the argument that wireless technology cannot deliver these same outcomes is a little bit spurious. The reality is that, like everything from the Labor Party, it is a case of 'Sell the sizzle but not the sausage'. This party is the sausage factory extraordinaire. This Labor Party is just feeding in the rubbish and hoping that what it can sell is the sizzle. It will get up and speak in debates like this about how it is going to provide superfast broadband, about how it is going to help 80-year-old pensioners or about how it is going to be the glorious revolution of the health industry, despite the fact that their own minister and Prime Minister, at lunchtime and in question time today, highlighted that they are already doing the things that the member for Fraser was saying were only going to possible because of NBN Co. Do you know what else is possible? Not only are his examples redundant, not only will the NBN be potentially redundant—




Mr Perrett:
  Potentially redundant!




Mr CIOBO:
  That's right, potentially redundant—but in my own electorate of Moncrieff on the Gold Coast—Australia's innovation city, as we are officially titled—we have Telstra rolling out 4G wireless technology today. I hope the member for Moreton knows what 4G wireless technology is.




Mr Perrett:
  It's better than 3G, is it?




Mr CIOBO:
  I am looking to see if he actually knows what I am talking about, because he is going to speak on this. Telstra is rolling out 4G wireless technology that allows—shock, horror!—100 megabits per second. That is what it is doing now through cellular telephony—100 megabits per second under 4G technology. And do you know what, Mr Deputy Speaker: it is not costing taxpayers a cent. It is not costing taxpayers a single, solitary cent for Telstra to roll out 4G technology with 100 megabits per second.


If you listen to the Labor Party, you might think: 'Look, Steve, you're getting a bit excited for no reason. We are going to have NBN. It is going to change the future of the Gold Coast. It is going to change the future of Australia's most service industry oriented city in the country. It is going to change the future of the sixth largest city in the country.' Unfortunately, the Gold Coast is not even slated for NBN rollout for the next six years. It will be six more years before it even thinks about rolling out fibre across the Gold Coast under NBN Co. This is coming from the Labor Party, which expects the Australian public to take it seriously when it gives us this kind of piffle. That is exactly what it is: a gigantic investment in ego. It all comm­enced with Kevin Rudd, the member for Griffith, when he was the Prime Minister of the country, and it has been continued by the current Prime Minister because it needed to be a matter of policy consistency. Heaven knows the Labor Party needs some policy consistency, and the reason we are now seeing Australian taxpayers being slugged to the tune of $30 billion to $50 billion is so the Labor Party can roll out its revolutionary fibre to the premises, FTTP, NBN. 


When Labor talks about a revolution, there is a revolution all right. It will be the revolution of the children of today who are going to be encumbered with debt as a consequence of this junk policy from the Australian Labor Party. That is not to say the technology is all rubbish, not for one moment. Perhaps the member for Moreton should listen, because he might be able to understand the difference—




Mr Perrett:
  I am about to point out a few.




Mr CIOBO:
  Yes—between policy and technology. The reality is that there are benefits that flow from fibre to the node and, indeed, from fibre to the premises. There are benefits that flow. The coalition's problem is not with the technology per se but with the fact that the Australian Labor Party has effectively taken all of our eggs, when it comes to the technology, and put them in one basket. It has delivered a great big monopoly to NBN Co. At a time when the rest of the world has walked away from government publicly owned monopolies, we are embra­cing it lock, stock and barrel through the Australian Labor Party. You have really got to wonder why it would do it, because in all these highly saturated areas where there is a degree of population density—so every capital city, including centres like mine in the Gold Coast and other major regional towns like Cairns and Townsville—we have the ability for there to be a commercial rollout of this technology, for private providers to be in the space and for this technology to be made available. 


Nowhere is this more apparent than with respect to greenfield sites, which this bill turns to. Nowhere is there a greater example of direct, private investment in greenfield sites than there is through the fact that there is a very large percentage, often in excess of 50 per cent of greenfield sites, that historically has seen the deployment of so-called pits and other fibre technologies through the development of the greenfield site by private operators. This bill actually goes some way towards making sure that that basically does not happen. The reason is that, because of the designation of NBN Co. as a provider of last resort, because NBN Co. will pick up the cost associated with greenfield sites and because NBN Co. will often wear the cost associated with pits, we now have an incentive for developers to simply walk away from these things—although it is legislated—knowing that NBN Co. will be undertaking those activities and doing it at taxpayers' expense.


I have no doubt that NBN Co. will be extraordinarily successful, for lack of a better term, with respect to greenfield sites. This is because any developer with half a brain will know there is no point in their hiring a private operator to undertake these activities or in their undertaking these activities themselves because taxpayers will subsidise the entire deployment of fibre at their greenfield site, thanks to this bill going through the parliament tonight. That is what the Labor Party is going to deliver them. There is little wonder that I and many Australians are deeply cynical about Labor's policy with respect to NBN Co. There is little wonder that we recognise that this is an investment in ego and not an investment in good policy. Good policy would dictate that there should be a level platform that enables the private sector to compete for those markets where it is commercially feasible to do so. Good policy would dictate that where there is not a commercial case to undertake this investment, that is when the government should step in. But that is not what we have from the Labor Party—that is coalition policy, it is not Labor's policy. Labor's policy is to say, 'It doesn't matter whether it's commercial or not. Taxpayers will under­score the entire project.'


For cities like the Gold Coast, where Telstra is already in the process of rolling out wireless technology providing 100 megabits per second, with no cost to taxpayers, and where the Australian Labor Party does not even have a schedule for NBN for six years, the Australian Labor Party says, 'No, you've got it all wrong, Steve. The taxpayers have got it all wrong. The NBN is the way to go because taxpayers will pay for it. It will be in excess of six years but, hey, it will have been worth it.'


I am unashamedly opposed to the complete waste of taxpayers' money that is NBN Co. Where it is not commercial for private providers to undertake that activity, fine—the Labor Party would carry me. But the reality is that in the vast majority of instances, it is commercially feasible, it is already happening, and the highest concentration of private providers in this space—who are about to have their throats slit by the Labor Party because of the passage of this bill—is with respect to the deployment of fibre-ready technologies in greenfield sites.


Labor members opposite, who are now sentencing to an economic death a number of employees with those private providers who used to undertake these activities, should know that that has happened because of the passage of this bill. They should know that that is what they are doing. They are making sure that private providers, who have demonstrated usually at least 50 per cent of the time with greenfields sites that they can undertake the job, will now no longer be in a position where it is economic for developers to engage those private providers and instead to have NBN Co. step in. That is the consequence of Labor Party policy and it is yet another example of how Labor has its policy priorities completely screwed up.


Furthermore, when you listen to the paltry excuses put forward as to why this needs to happen, when you hear the member for Fraser—one of the golden boys of the Labor Party—giving an example, which has been used by the minister today, which has already taken place, and not something that requires NBN Co., when you see the deploy­ment of technology by 100 per cent private money through Telstra on 4G wireless technology, it is little wonder that I and so many others are so deeply cynical about this government's spendathon when it comes to the absolutely reckless manner in which they are about to expend yet another $30 billion to $50 billion of taxpayers funds building a massive new government monopoly. This is not good policy and the Australian people will certainly not be grateful for the Labor Party undertaking this activity.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2011-07-04,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (18:17):  I thank the member for Moncrieff for his contribution. I was in his electorate last night at the National Awards for Excellence in School Music Education at the Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre, which I think is in his electorate. It was quite a wonderful affair, handing out some awards on behalf of the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, Mr Garrett. It is amazing to see how young musicians and music teachers can all link up around the world and take advantage of this emerging technology. I was glad to see that he was accepting of the advances that will come with technology.


The legislation before us, the Telecommunications Legislation (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011, as you well know Deputy Speaker Sidebottom, is all about a common-sense approach to what goes on in new residential developments. I know there have been many new residential develop­ments on the Gold Coast strip, between my electorate and the Gold Coast—I see them when I drive down there. We are making sure that the nation is fibre-ready, that each of these new developments gets it right in terms of the ducts, the pits and the pipe—getting our ducts in a row, I guess—from one development to the next development.


This is a good, common-sense economic policy which is what underpins the entire NBN in the first place. It is all about making sure our future productivity is in an interconnected nation—beyond the major urban centres, beyond the Gold Coast and the glittering lights, and into the regions. While the member for Moncrieff can say, 'Yes, on the Gold Coast we are doing okay; we've got 4G', a good government governs for the entire nation. Obviously, there are some problems whenever you get a few people on the 4G system. It goes slower and the technologies of the future will be hamstrung—that is why we need to have these complementing each other. We need to look beyond the conurbations to the rural and regional areas and look at the opportunities that will come for all of Australia.


This is a practical measure that we have before us. Basically, all we are saying is that if any developers who are constitutional corporations—able to be controlled by the government—are building some infrast­ructure, they make sure it is fibre-ready. It is easier to do the pits and the pipe at the start of the development process rather than retrofitting something to a development, ripping up footpaths and all those sorts of things. These are an inconvenience and part of the burden that comes with an NBN program which is such a visionary scheme. It does make more sense to do it at the onset rather than later on.


This allows the carriers to access the fibre-ready passive infrastructure that is owned by the noncarriers and provides for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to have a role as the default arbiter. It applies to new real estate develop­ments because the fibre will be rolled out across the nation to 93 per cent of premises. It is important that we get it right in these new developments. There has been extensive consultation with the development industry about these reforms. It is not something that has been sprung on them; it has been able to be built into the price. As I said, this keeps the cost as low as possible for the ultimate consumer of the National Broadband Network.


Rather than just saying, 'Let the market rip', which seemed to be the approach by the member for Moncrieff, this is a common-sense approach with the gentle guiding hand of government saying, 'Why don't you do it early on, rather than just wait for the market to decide.' As we all know, with anything it is best to do it upfront rather than retrofitting. Even in a building such as this, which is only 21 or 22 years old, in the last year there have been problems in meeting the technology needs of a modern parliamentarian. Things change quite quickly, so it is best to have the capacity to deal with each new develop­ment—they need to be lined up so that the pipes and pits are ready to enable the NBN to be rolled out. This is a very practical response to rolling out the NBN. 


I saw that the member for Moncrieff was quite overheated. Maybe he was a bit riled because of what we saw two weeks ago, with the NBN Co. representative standing alongside the Telstra and Optus represen­tatives, indicating that this is happening and that this is real. This is the biggest investment in infrastructure since the Snowy Mountains scheme—it is beyond the Snowy Mountains scheme. It is being rolled out now. I understand, Mr Deputy Speaker Sidebottom, that Braddon has benefited greatly from this. The benefits are more than just within the nation. The NBN is able to link the regions, link the cities, link them with the world and create business opportunities overseas.


We have seen a lot of signs and symbols lately. When I open my paper or when I watch the news at night, I see the Leader of the Opposition in a hard hat, stalking a manufacturing business—turning up and spreading his big fear campaign about the carbon tax. That is an important symbol, a visual symbol. It seems to be what the media is interested in. I assume there are people out there now stalking the retailers or manufact­urers of Queanbeyan and looking for an opportunity to say, 'We need the opposition leader to come along like he does in so many of these places.' I think it was the Ford Motor Company factory in Geelong where he turned up. He does not actually go in and talk to the workers; he just turns up, talks to middle management, puts the hard hat on and then off he goes. We get what he sees as the sign and symbol and then off he goes. It does not matter that the opposition's plan is actually to rip $500 million out of the car industry. He does not want to go in and talk about that; he just wants to run with a bit of a fear campaign.


While I am talking about signs and symbols, I note that where the NBN will be very useful is in schools. As a former teacher, I know how much things have moved on. I can remember the internet first coming into the classroom when I was in my last few years of teaching. Now you go to classrooms where the kids in grade 1 and even kids in prep are using computers in a way that is unbelievable. That is why you have to be prepared. Obviously, the NBN will complement our education policy—over $65 billion invested in education. Symbols are important when it comes to education. We have debates in here about education; we had one today. Over the years of the Howard government, we had those wonderful—more than 2,000—flagpoles rolled out throughout Australia. It is important that we give our flags a space; we all know how important a symbol that is. But compare that with the 2,000 libraries that the Labor Party rolled out or with the other investments in school halls, language centres, science laboratories—all those things are obviously much more than just symbols.


I have been following the broadband shenanigans opposite for quite a while. I know it is hard to get it right because the technology changes so quickly, but I think there were about 20 failed experiments. They kept having problems. I think one of the problems was that one of the rollouts was based on the planning assumption that Australia was as flat as the Netherlands, but then someone pointed out that there were some mountains and valleys and a few things like that in the Australian landscape. Even though we are the flattest continent, we do have some hills, especially in places like Brisbane.


I particularly remember when, some 12 or 18 months back, the Leader of the Opposition had an interview with Kerry O'Brien—it might actually have been the last interview he had with Kerry O'Brien—talking about the NBN. What was the Leader of the Opposition's major grasp of what the NBN would be used for? For sending e-mails, I think. I am sure he has moved on a little bit since then and does see the business opportunities, the productivity opportunities and the employment opportunities for rural areas, regional areas and our cities. It would be nice for him to go back to our national broadcaster and engage with people about the NBN. We hear that his instructions to his shadow spokesperson were very simple—to rip up the process, to just say no. It is funny—today I saw the Leader of the Opposition talk about having an $85 million plebiscite because he wants to consult with the people, but he will not talk to our national broadcaster about any topic, it seems.


Anyone who has been in this game long enough knows that the Australian economy faces challenges. We have a high dollar at the moment, so that makes it hard for our manufacturers to compete on the world market. Our labour costs are high compared with those of most of our near neighbours, so it is hard. There are pressures out there; pressures on manufacturing businesses, pressures on lots of sectors of the economy, even labour shortages in certain sectors. However, those opposite are basically suggesting that we go down the low road. Their answer to the question of how to bring those costs down is to attack wages. This is a short-term fix and will not provide any great productivity boost. The smarter way to approach the problem is the high road—to try and boost productivity. Obviously the NBN will provide a massive number of opportunities to boost productivity.


As a Queenslander, as someone from the most decentralised state in Australia, it would be ridiculous for me to stand here and say, 'My electorate is in inner-city Brisbane, so I will be all right. The bush can be forgotten.' That seemed to be basically what the member for Moncrieff was saying—let the market rip, and they will be right. The markets are there in the bigger cities, but obviously a good government looks after the country. I am from country Queensland myself, and apart from the NBN no-one is in any great rush to roll out to the country areas. I can understand why the Leader of the Opposition found it hard to consult with the member for New England and the member for Lyne about the advantages that the NBN would bring to them when he did not have an understanding of it. Anyone with a connec­tion to rural areas would understand the benefits that will flow.


I note that there was a dissenting report to the report presented by the member for Lyne. This dissenting report is 5,096 words—we could have saved a lot of time and effort if the Hon. Malcolm Turnbull had just said no. It would have been as simple as that. That was obviously going to be the tactic—just say no, do not go into any great detail. The dissenting report was basically 5,096 different ways to say no. Thankfully the committee has taken a bit more time to look over the issue and see the advantages and, as we see the NBN rolled out to the 93 per cent of premises that are preparing to take advantage of this massive piece of infras­tructure, I think this dissenting report will be seen in the proper light.


The bill basically contains four key measures in proposed part 20A. It enables the minister to specify new developments or classes of new development in which the fixed lines that are installed must be optical fibre lines. So there is the capacity there to take advantage of the local situation. Also, the bill provides that when fixed line facilities are being installed in a develop­ment, these facilities must be fibre-ready. That is a common-sense approach—do it up front and it is cheaper. It is a case of a stitch in time will save nine, rather than having all the problems that go with retrofitting and ripping up concrete. Third, the bill will have the effect of basically requiring constit­utional corporations to install fibre-ready facilities on or in close proximity to their developments. We do not want to have the rail lines all over again where we have different sizes and they do not match. This is the 21st century and we want to make sure that they all fit together for the benefit of the nation. (Time expired)

"Randall, Don, MP",LP,2011-07-04,"



Mr RANDALL
 (Canning) (18:32):  I am very pleased to speak on the Telecommunications Legislation Amend­ment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011. The NBN is an issue in my electorate and it is an issue around Australia. The electorate believes this is a very ham-fisted, expensive operation to deliver what could have been delivered by the private sector. Now the government is essentially renationalising communications in Australia. We are going back to the days of the PMG. We are almost in the business of renationalising telecomm­unications and phones, et cetera. The government wants to control and own everything that we operate now.


What brought this about? What made the Labor Party decide to spend somewhere between $30 billion and $50 billion? And why do I use such a wide range of figures? Because the government does do not know how much it will end up costing. It was not that long ago that we heard NBN Co., through its pristine-charactered Mr Quigley, say it could not get anyone to build the network, so it pulled the contracts. Nobody wanted to build it for the cost it was thought it could be built for. Of course there are going to blowouts. The people who saw this build as a cash cow are now suddenly running into a bit of heavy weather.


Why are we in the position we are in? Largely because the Labor Party, on taking office, fell out with Telstra. We did not like Sol Trujillo very much—I certainly did not and I said a lot of unkind things about him in this House, which were largely all true—but falling out with somebody does not mean you decide to totally uproot the system you have and then go and borrow a massive amount of money to renationalise telecom­munications in this country. President Obama had the same situation confronting him in the last 12 months and, rather than saying it was all too hard and he would get the government to build it, he allowed the private sector to roll out enhancements to the telecommunications system in the United States with a mix of technologies.


As previous speakers, including the member for Moncrieff, have said, we have put a lot of eggs in one basket. We have gone with fibre to the premises, which used to be called fibre to the node, and this is the most expensive option that could have been chos­en. Our shadow minister, the member for Wentworth, Malcolm Turnbull, knows something about this. He was one of the early entrants into this technology years ago, when he was a cofounder of an internet company, so his credentials in this area are quite good. He describes this as watching a slow-motion train wreck, and that is what is happening—it is a slow-motion train wreck on the roll-out and implementation of this program.


The sad thing is that the future mums and dads of Australia and their children will be paying for this slow-motion train wreck even although it did not need to happen. There could have been a fat controller at the signals to stop this slow-motion train wreck. The controller is not there because both the previous Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, and the current Prime Minister have just given the Minister for Broadband, Comm–unications and the Digital Economy his head and allowed him to run rampant on this issue. I am in one of those curious electorates that causes problems for this particular rollout. I have high-density urban, outer metropolitan, semi-rural, rural, agricultural, hills, beach sides, small towns under 1,000 people—I have the whole gamut. That is why people in my electorate are very concerned about this issue. In fact, they have called public meetings on this and they have called me to meetings in their own houses to say: 'We are very concerned. What is happening to that Telstra line that goes past my house now? Will I still be connected to that or do I have to sign over?' When it first started people were not sure, but we know now that Telstra has received $11 billion in taxpayers' money from NBN Co. to take over its lines. Of course Telstra and its shareholders are happy because it is an absolute cash cow at the moment, but the good old taxpayers of Australia have forked out $11 billion to take over existing infrastructure. Whether it gets used or whether it is overlaid in certain areas, we do not know.


The incredible thing about this is that by having put all their eggs in one basket and given the number of years it will take to rollout, there is a real chance that eventually the technology we are talking about could be redundant by the time it gets to your home. In Piara Waters and Harrisdale in my electorate there is an area that is partly greenfields and partly constructed and Telstra have stopped putting infrastructure into that area. The residents there have asked me, 'I cannot get ready access, so what are you going to do?' With their old copper wire network and RIM technology, Telstra are feeding out a few ports here and there from their exchanges, but they are not committing to any significant build because they are saying to my constituents, 'We're not going to come and build anything new for you because the NBN's coming and we're not going to spend any money on something that is going to be overlaid in the next six, eight or 10 years.' As a result, they say, 'Here's a phone for you.' They give them a second-rate mobile phone to use because of the universal service obligation. It is just a short-term fix. It really is a bizarre situation.


The towns that are further out in my electorate and which have fewer than 1,000 residents will not get part of this. We just heard the member for Moreton give us a figure of 93 per cent. I thought it was a bit higher than that, but I take his figure of 93 per cent. A whole lot of small towns in my electorate, like Jarrahdale, Mundijong, Serpentine and Preston Beach, will not be getting any meaningful telephony or internet connection through the NBN. To me it is really quite wrong and sad for anyone who is in an outer urban area to not get those services, despite this massive spend.


Mandurah in my electorate is an example of how we need to address some of the original problems. It is about an hour from Perth and it is still on timed local calls. We are trying to get Telstra and the regulators to broaden the zone, but the town is still paying for timed local calls in this day and age. We heard from the member for Moncrieff telling us about how on the Gold Coast, Telstra, as a private operator, is currently running out lines that are capable of 100 megabits per second. I have an article here titled, 'Move aside NBN, the future's already here.' It says:


Australia's Academic and Research Network say they're doing what the NBN will do in a decade, today.


So NBN Co. is going to take a decade to get speeds of 100 megabits per second to your house, but here we have AARNET giving the NBN a run for its money because they are going to deliver those speeds now through something quite simple:


… the research network announced yesterday that it successfully boosted the delivery speeds of its existing fibre optic network simply by placing 40GB 'muxponders'—supersized transponders—onto either ends of the cable.


You put these muxponders at either end of the cable and you get these speeds over longer distances. So the technology is going to race ahead of the NBN, despite its cost. I have two cases in my electorate that bear going over again. I have raised these before and they have not been fixed. There is the case of the Carey Baptist College in Forrestfield in my electorate which needed decent speeds for the school. It has outgrown its own site right now and it is going to move onto another greenfield site further down the road, which will have its own issues of internet connection and telephones et cetera. The school has sought my help in getting faster speeds and better connections. I have pointed out that Telstra does not want to help anymore because the NBN is meant to be coming to this region. Interestingly, and I say this in the nicest way because Senator Sterle and I have an arrangement on these matters—we criticise each other and we have broad enough shoulders to handle each other's criticism—in an article on 21 June 2011 it was reported:


Labor Senator Glenn Sterle took a swipe at Canning MHR Don Randall over his claims Carey Baptist College’s broadband and internet problems were due to the National Broadband Network.


Mr Sterle said Mr Randall attempted to lay blame on the NBN despite knowing the problems had existed for more than a decade.


As I pointed out in this article, it was a free kick, Senator Sterle, because when this school was being constructed I was there to try to force Telstra to provide the services to the school. I assure you that if I had not involved myself in this the state office would have said: 'We have no arrangement. In fact, they'll have to pay for the infrastructure costs. This is a non-government school.' So they tried that on for a while and when we decided to put a bit of pressure on them at the national level they eventually came good. So thank you for the free kick, Senator Sterle. Paul Oates, the administrator from the school, pointed out that if I had not been involved, they would not have got it. But they are still struggling because there is this big disconnect: Telstra are not providing anything because, 'The NBN's coming' and the NBN are saying, 'We don't know if we are going to get there.' Even Mandurah, whom Senator Sterle refers to in this article, are saying that it is going to be one of the first places to be rolled out. Most of the infrastructure is in the ground in Mandurah but the speeds are not sufficient. They have already set a few dates when Mandurah will be rolled out and every one of them has been missed. They failed all the rollout dates for the particular location in Mandurah around Halls Head. 


Finally, I point to an article in the local newspaper which is headed 'Phone delay frustrates'. Tilling Timber state manager, Jeremy Coleman, says that for 18 months he has been promised phone and internet. The developer in the industrial estate had put the infrastructure in the ground but they have no service because Telstra was not interested in connecting because, remember, 'The NBN's coming.' Telstra did not want to do it, so what did Tilling Timber have to do? They had to spend $36,000 to install an elaborate substitute to get phone and internet connections. They had to get a wireless link from Armadale's industrial park to the R&I building in Perth to get a connection and then that was rerouted through the office. It is the same with their phones. Other businesses out there decided they would not start building until this was sorted out. It was not until I got away from the state office of Telstra and I wrote to David Thodey, chief executive of Telstra, where I pointed out that there was infrastructure in the ground that I got the response that they would put copper wire in that particular area. Before I came into the chamber, I checked on Tilling Timber in this industrial area and I found that they still do not have their infrastructure and they are still not connected to the Telstra network, and they are waiting for other arrangements to be put in place.


This you beaut, fantastic huge NBN investment that could have been done privately with a mix of technologies like wireless and satellite is now going to have all its eggs in one basket. Instead of economical fibre to the node so that copper can be connected to the home, they have gone for the most expensive model, which could be redundant in years. Dare I say, this is one of the failings of this government: if it is not your money, spend it like the Watsons because it does not matter. That is why this government are in trouble electorally, because people do not believe they can deliver for them. (Time expired)

"Saffin, Janelle, MP",ALP,2011-07-04,"



Ms SAFFIN
 (Page) (18:47):  I rise to speak in strong support of the Telecommunications Legislation Amend­ment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011 and I do so for the following reasons. Firstly, it gives effect to the general policy of establishing a nationally consistent, high-speed broadband network to 93 per cent of premises, including residential and others, to provide download internet speeds of 100 megabits per second, and provide fixed wireless to four per cent of premises and satellite to three per cent of premises, including households, at a speed of at least 12 megabits per second. The national network will similarly be open access and wholesale only. This legislation also speaks to a particular part of the NBN policy framework, fibre in new developments. The January ministerial statement articulated that:


NBN Co. ... would be the wholesale provider of last resort in new developments within or adjacent to its long-term fibre footprint and meet the associated cost of this obligation. 


It is really important that this is legislated as new developments are rolled out to ensure we are not left behind. The Telecom–munications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill amends the Telecom–munications Act and that supports the policy that fibre-to-the-premises infrastructure has to be installed in new developments. The bill also reflects the policy that NBN Co. will be the fibre provider of last resort. It adds a new part to the Telecommunications Act to support the rollout of the NBN. It will apply to all types of new developments, including the broadacre estates, the urban infill and urban renewal projects. It will generally apply to new developments in NBN Co.'s long-term fibre footprint. 


There are other provisions in the bill that give effect to this key objective. It requires developers that are constitutional corpor­ations, and we know that has a particular legal meaning, to install fibre-ready passive infrastructure in developments. That is where the long-term fibre footprint of the NBN is. It provides ministerial authority to determine specifications for fibre-ready passive infrastructure, if required. It will allow carriers to access the passive infrastructure that is owned by non-carriers and also, importantly, it will provide for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to be the default arbitrator. Also, it will enable the minister to specify developments in which fixed lines must be optical fibre and determine specifications for such lines. And it has a number of other provisions in it that give effect to the key objective.


The bill gives effect to a particular part of our policy but it also gives effect to the whole policy on the NBN, so I will make some comments that go to the whole and to the general. I have been very active in my local community as a champion of early NBN rollout on the North Coast. One thing I was able to do was to bring together a large group of people who wanted the NBN first. Everybody wants the NBN; that is understandable. It is an eight-year rollout, so we cannot all be first, but if you were NBN-ready then you stood a good chance of getting one of the early rollouts, and we did that on the North Coast. The place was Coffs Harbour, which I call the 'nerve centre' of the NBN rollout.


I worked with the local university, Southern Cross University, in particular with Professor Peter Croll, who is still at the university working on this, to get a submission ready. I also worked with 14 local councils across the North Coast and with local businesses. We were able to put in a submission which said, 'We are NBN ready,' and it was recognised that we were able to take advantage of the rollout.


The NBN Co. CEO, in announcing the site, said that sites were selected on a range of technical and engineering criteria and that the engagement of local government and the receptiveness of communities to broadband initiatives were factors taken into consid­eration. We had those three key elements present: we had the technical and engineering criteria because of the spine that goes up the east coast, we had the engagement of local government—and it was really strong engagement—and we had receptive communities.


This shows how out of step the opposition are. They come in here and talk about the NBN as though it were something that people in Australia were not receptive to. People are receptive all across Australia. We have communities right across Australia saying: 'We want to be in the early rollout. When is it coming? Is it happening now?' Of course it cannot 'happen now' everywhere. It is happening as fast as possible, but it is a huge undertaking. As we have all said, it is akin to building the Snowy project, not only in its size but in what it means for our development and our future. Surveys in my area have found that local businesses—small businesses in particular—know that they need it to be competitive and to stay on top of things. It is not as if we were introducing something 'out there', which is what you would think in listening to the opposition talk about it. They talk about how people could have wireless, but that is ridiculous. Wireless cannot replace it, and I will come to that now.


In speaking about the general policy—and this goes to the whole debate—I will refer to some of the myths around the NBN. The website nbnmyths.wordpress.com brings this together very nicely under the heading 'The top 10 NBN myths debunked'. The first one is: 'The NBN will cost taxpayers $43 billion. We can't afford it and it's uncosted'. The website says:


False


First, the government investment is capped at $26-27 billion, not 43. The remainder will come from revenue and NBN Co’s private debt.


It then has a whole lot more to say about the claim, that the project was not studied and costed. What was the KPMG-McKinsey implementation study if the project was not studied and costed? It found that the network could be built for $42.8 billion—that was prior to the deal with Telstra—would not have any net cost to the government and would have an estimated net value of $40 billion in 2025, earning a return on invest­ment of six to seven per cent, which is more than enough to repay debt and equity used to build the project. It just makes good sense. The website cites the NBN business case summary, saying it revealed the total cost of the network to be lower than the initial $43 billion estimate. If people just read, all the information and facts are there.


The second myth that is debunked is: 'If it were viable, the private sector would build it'. That is completely false. The private sector have had a long time to build it and they have not done it, because the private sector do not usually initiate and undertake nation-building projects that are of benefit to the whole country, that provide the infrast­ructure for the whole country to take advantage of in health, education, small business, farming and agriculture—in a whole range of areas. The private sector could not and would not afford it. Are parts of the private sector going to join together and say, 'Yes, let's initiate this project worth over $40 billion'? That is a huge investment for any company and well beyond any telco I know of that is operating in Australia. The website says:


The private sector demand a ROI of at least 12%, because they need to earn a profit for their shareholders. The NBN has a projected 6-7% ROI—


which is a good return to cover any debt. The private sector just would not deal with that. It says:


… while this is well below commercial rates, it's quite acceptable for a Government, which is not seeking to earn a profit.


There are a few other myths, such as, 'We'll never need that much speed or data'. That is completely ridiculous. If you have a look at the increase in the speed of internet access in Australia and what we will have, you see the only way we can maintain this is with a fibre based system and a holistic one to start off with. There is another myth: no-one else in the world is installing such a system. That is false and ridiculous. Fibre to the premises or the home is currently being rolled out across Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and China. It is ridiculous to say that it is not happening in other places. The OECD actually recommends that governments build fibre to the premises networks—so the OECD does recommend it. If national governments do not do it, then who will do it? It is one of those responsibilities that we have as a government to provide that infrastructure. South Korea have announced that they are now spending US$26 billion on upgrading their old 100 megabits per second FTTP network to deliver speeds of one gigabyte, the same as the Australian NBN. This is happening even though they already have a 4G wireless network.


One of the other myths is our internet speed is good enough. That is ridiculous. The facts speak for themselves. I do not even have to go through what the technical parts are. We know that is not true. When you have a look at average speeds, you see the dismal position of Australia's internet speeds. Then there is the other one: a wireless network that can be 4G, LTE, WiMax or DSL—ADSL2+/VDSL/HDSL—can provide the same speed for a fraction of the price. That is false. Much is claimed, usually by those with a vested interest—and that means a vested commercial interest or a political interest—to try to tear it down, because we know that is what the opposition do; they are not interested in nation-building projects like this. Much is claimed about the potential of wireless networks, with speeds such as 300 megabits per second being quoted. But this is highly deceptive, because those are peak speeds per tower, not realistically achievable speeds for individuals. If you have the 300 megabits per second tower and you have two users on it, then that speed would be halved to 150 megabits per second. A trial of 4G/LTE in 2009 showed that with just 20 people using any one tower the speed plummeted to just seven megabits per second. We know that distance, topography, buildings and weather also degrade those available speeds. All this information is available and it does not find its way easily into the debate because all you hear from the opposition is, 'No, we're just going to tear this down. We don't care about it.' They had 12 years to do it. Nineteen attempts failed miserably.

"Briggs, Jamie, MP",LP,2011-07-04,"



Mr BRIGGS
 (Mayo) (19:03):  I rise to speak on the NBN bill, the Telecom­munications Legislation Amend–ment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011, which is before the House and which we are debating. I make the point at the beginning that the coalition, as we always have been, is supportive of fast broadband. It is a worthy and important goal. The development of fast broadband, especially the development of accessible fast broadband at cost-effective prices, is a great economic boon for our country. But we continue to make the point that it is not a case of picking winners in this debate but rather one of looking at a mixture of technologies, which is the important way to go into the future. Countries like the United States of America, with its President Obama, have realised that. We see here in Australia a government born out of central planning days, and we have just heard the member for Page walk us through her distrust of the private sector while talking about how the private sector will not build it because there is not enough return in it, although I note that, as I understand it, the standing policy of the Australian Labor Party is still to sell NBN Co. as soon as it is established. So somehow there has been a mistransmission over the talking points given to the member for Page, because her contribution was questioning the ability of the private sector to invest in networks such as this. She says the private sector would not build something like this. Well, they do build these sorts of networks all the time. In fact, they have built a mobile network.



Ms Saffin interjecting—




Mr BRIGGS:
  Member for Page, as you walk around with your mobile phone in your electorate, which is a regional electorate, you get to use your mobile phone and your wireless devices because the private sector built those towers. So it is interesting that the member for Page thinks that the government is all good and everything that is required needs to be built by the government. That is the view of those opposite, but, of course, we have trust in the private sector and we think the private sector provides services at a far more efficient and cost-effective rate than what government ever does.




Mr Stephen Jones:
  Except when it comes to climate change. Then you want to pick winners.




Mr BRIGGS:
  In fact, that is not true at all, Member for Throsby.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr KJ Thomson
):  The member for Throsby will cease interjecting and the member for Mayo will not respond to interjections from the member for Throsby.




Mr BRIGGS:
  He was completely distracting me, Mr Deputy Speaker. You are right to be raising those issues. When it comes to this bill, I think it highlights how much the government has failed when it comes to this issue. It highlights very much how they find a reasonable idea and turn it into a complete shambles. That very much sums up the NBN itself. As I said at the beginning of my remarks, we support fast broadband, but this is spending billions and billions of dollars of taxpayers' money unnecessarily, excessively and imprudently. We have seen the risk this government is exposed to when it spends such large amounts of money. We have the very sad examples of the green loans and the Home Insulation Program and with that program the government were not even able to put roof insulation batts into people's houses without burning the houses down. We have had the school halls program where they managed to spend about double what the private sector could have spent on building them. We have seen recent examples of digital set-top boxes. They have been spending double the amount of money for which Gerry Harvey or another retailer could have provided them. So when this government gets involved in spending large amounts of money, the Australian people shiver with fear—and so they should. That is why we saw today economic figures indicating a lack of confidence by the Australian people in the economy with housing and consumer numbers plummeting. That is driven by a lack of confidence in a government that is not competent. This is another bill which highlights the lack of competence of this government. There are various aspects in this bill which relate directly to my electorate such as the $40 billion spend on a network, which the Auditor-General's report today reflected upon, that Infrastructure Australia has not even seen. Even though they are meant to be looking at the top infrastructure priorities, the NBN has not been referred to Infrastructure Australia and there has not been a cost-benefit analysis done. This bill touches on the deployment of fibre and that will have an impact in my electorate as it will happen in new housing developments.


I think the arguments articulated by the member for Wentworth and the member for Bradfield have been very well made. The dissenting report highlights the problem that the government is creating for itself. It is trying to centralise and take away the benefits of competition when it comes to new developments. The real effect of this will be higher costs for people building homes in new housing estates. I have many new housing estates in my area, particularly in Mount Barker and Strathalbyn. These are already contentious areas, particularly the Mount Barker development which was forced through by the state Labor government without any consultation with the local community. Now we are seeing the federal Labor government create laws which are going to make it more expensive for people to buy houses in these developments. That was a point well made by the member for Wentworth and the member for Bradfield and very well made in the dissenting report into this issue.


The other area I want to touch upon briefly is that, when it comes to the deployment of fibre into electorates like mine, it is not easy to put it underground. I note that the NBN Co. documents, which were released last December, indicated that they wished the government to allow them to override local council regulations to ensure that they could roll out the fibre overhead, or aerial as it is described. This is a major concern in an electorate such as mine. The Adelaide Hills is the most beautiful electorate in the country without doubt. It is quite obviously not appropriate to put the fibre in overhead cables in a bushfire-prone zone over the longer distances. I understand this will be the intention of the NBN Co. This is a concern in my community and people have been raising this issue with me. As I have a semi-regional and regional electorate, the longer distances will mean that when it actually does get to us—for towns over 1,000 if you believe the government's rhetoric—there will be overhead hanging fibre used. I think this is something that the government needs to address very quickly and swiftly.


I am not the only electorate with this sort of environment. I know the member for Bradfield has raised this issue in regard to his inner-city electorate. Of course it is a lot cheaper for NBN Co. to roll out the fibre overhead. No doubt the arrangements with Telstra may have changed that slightly, but I do not think they would have changed it all that much in an electorate like mine.


This is an issue which I will raise in my local community and ask them how they intend to react if the government decides to roll out overhead wires through the Adelaide Hills, particularly through the bushfire-prone areas where most of the overhead power lines have been removed and put underground. If it is the intention of the NBN Co. going forward to do the same thing in my area, it does raise significant questions about how the business model of the NBN Co. has been planned and what the associated costs will be with using either underground or overhead wires.


My electorate is a black spot area where government funding is required to ensure that there is an equality of service. It is a point that we have always made on this side of the House. In outer metro and regional areas, like my electorate and the electorates of the member for Grey and the member for Barker, there is a need for government intervention because the market fails in those areas, and we have said that all along. Quite clearly it does not fail in city areas, and this is where the big mistake of the government spending billions of dollars unnecessarily and imprudently creates a real risk for taxpayers with the waste that we will see through this spending.


We heard the member for Page earlier say that spending $26 or $27 billion is such a Labor Party thing to do. It is a billion dollars between friends, and we only have $106 billion of debt and a $50 billion deficit this year. This is a fundamental issue about the management of our country. If we look around the world today, one of the great challenges is our Western cousins who are in deep financial trouble because they have spent too much money over too many years. We have seen this Labor government use the public purse without any effort to ensure the money is spent properly and without any effort to ensure that their policies benefit the Australian community. Quite clearly in some areas of the country there needs to be spending to ensure that services are kept up to the level which other Australians get access to, but in the city areas this makes no sense at all. This is an overbuild of existing speed which the market will meet and has been meeting. To think that over the next 10 years we are going to spend billions and billions of dollars of Australian taxpayers' money laying out fibre in areas, which the market would have met, is ridiculous.


In addition to that we are seeing questions about how it will be happening in areas such as mine where clearly fibre is not the answer. In hilly areas I suspect that fibre is not the appropriate answer nor in regional areas because there is difficulty in laying it out or indeed whether you can lay it out at all. It will be interesting to see how NBN Co. deals with that issue. I will certainly be raising it in my local community. If the rollout is to occur in my electorate, in what parts of the electorate will it be, how will it be done and how is the NBN Co. planning to do it in the future? It is a concern. The member for Bradfield raised this concern in his electorate. He raised the point that communities do not want overhead cables anymore. Communities have been trying to move away from that, and there are very good safety reasons in my area for that to be the case. So when it comes to the deployment of fibre in the electorate of Mayo, I think there are legitimate questions to be answered by the government about how this rollout is planned.


The opposition see some merit in this bill. However, we have made some very prudent suggestions, which the member for Went­worth outlined earlier, to improve the bill and to reintroduce competition, which is a major concern when it comes to the NBN. The government have turned what was a competitive market, or 30 years of telecommunications policy about creating a competitive market, on its head by creating another government monopoly that will have the same challenges. I note that the member for Lyne last week made the point about government monopolies not having worked in the past and not being likely to work in the future, and I think that was a very good point. Where the government has gone with this policy is a major concern. It is spending far too much on a wrongheaded policy in areas where money does not need to be spent rather than focusing government effort on areas where money should be spent and allowing the market to meet the demand.


Quite obviously, part of the mix here is wireless. That is where people want portability. They want to be able to use their iPads and their phones and other devices around the place. At the same time, there is no doubt that there is a place for fixed lines, and that is where the market will meet that need. For the government to spend $40 billion odd of taxpayers' money—money that we do not have, borrowed money—makes no sense at all at a time when we already have over $100 billion in net debt and when we see around the globe the great problems that are being caused by governments accumulating debt. Those on the other side will say: 'Don't worry about it. We'll be back to surplus in a couple of years. We've got this wafer-thin surplus that is on the books thanks to the commodity boom and thanks to the high prices that other countries are paying for our products.' But we know that the debt this Labor government is accumulating will not be paid off by this government. It will not even attempt to pay it off because it keeps coming up with harebrained schemes on how to waste the money of Australians, such as spending twice the amount it should on school halls and burning down people's houses with its home insulation program.


I support the remarks of the member for Wentworth and the amendments he is proposing. I also put on the record the concern in my community about the prospect of having overhead cables laid out. That is an issue that I suspect, Mr Deputy Speaker, we will be talking about more often in this House in the coming months and years.

"Grierson, Sharon, MP",ALP,2011-07-04,"



Ms GRIERSON
 (Newcastle) (19:17):  I am pleased to stand here this evening to speak in favour of the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill and in support of the continued rollout of the National Broadband Network. Having heard the member for Mayo, I must say that the repetition of incorrect statements on the government's record over and over again cannot go unchallenged. We have a debt level that is the envy of most nations in the world. It defies logic, intelligence and economic scrutiny that the other side continues to make those misstatements and mislead the public. In saying that, I have to say that the National Broadband Network is a major economic and social reform that will benefit the entire nation.


It is always worth restating our reform record, and it is worth restating it here. The federal Labor government has introduced a number of major reforms of which we on this side of the House feel rightly proud. Our first act in government was to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. In 2008, we apologised to the stolen generation. During 2008 and 2009, our responsible financial management avoided the worst of the global financial crisis and kept thousands of Australians in employment. That was verified again in the last couple of weeks by international bodies pointing out the success of Australia's approach to handling the global financial crisis. On 1 January this year, we introduced paid parental leave for the first time in this nation's history. Just two months ago, we introduced a historic $2.2 billion mental health package, an area sorely in need of attention. Within a matter of weeks, we will release full details of our plan to put a price on carbon.


But one of the reforms of which we are most proud, and should be most proud, is the rollout of the National Broadband Network. It is always worth remembering how we changed tack on this when the market failed to tender for it successfully. I heard the member for Mayo quote the Audit Office on this issue. Being privy to some information from the audits, yes, I think some of us do know that it was one of the biggest market failures imaginable. I would say that it was unimaginable, and I cannot say anymore. As I have said in this place before, this initiative will define this government and its vision for our nation. This initiative will change the way we work, connect and deliver important services, the way we develop and best utilise skilled workforces, the way we overcome skilled workforce shortages and the way we deliver important services such as education and health.


We want a nation that will embrace technology to maximise our economic competitiveness, create the jobs of the future and improve the quality of life of all Australians. We want to overcome the historical disadvantage of the tyranny of distance, both between us and our major trading partners and between our urban and regional, remote and rural centres.


The National Broadband Network will deliver affordable high-speed access to all Australians, irrespective of where they work or where they live. It will extend optical fibre to 93 per cent of premises, with speeds of 100 megabits per second—100 times faster than many Australians have access to today. This bill is a critical element in delivering the government's commitment to extend the NBN to all Australian households and, in this case, into new developments. This bill amends the Telecommunications Act 1997 to ensure that fibre-to-the-premises infrast­ructure will be installed in new development areas. When fixed-line facilities are being installed in a new development, part 20A of the bill will require that facilities be designed, manufactured and installed to allow for the ready deployment of optical fibre cabling. I see no resistance to this bill. I see new developments going into my own area, and part of their promotion is that they are fibre ready. It is a wonderful asset to communities and it is a wonderful asset to selling new developments. This bill will literally pave the way for the physical infrastructure to be in place for the rollout of optical fibre. In turn, this bill reflects the government's policy to be the fibre provider of last resort. So, while developers will be free to use other telecommunications providers, NBN Co. will provide fibre where developers do not wish to use another provider or where no other provider is prepared to deliver the service.


The passing of this bill by parliament is just one of a number of significant steps towards making the National Broadband Network a reality for all Australians. Indeed, we have already passed a number of historic milestones. Last year, the National Broad­band Network was switched on in Tasmania for the very first time. In May this year, the Prime Minister launched the National Broadband Network on the Australian mainland. Since then, the NBN Co. has announced its first and second release sites, which include locations in every single state and territory across Australia. Just last month, on 23 June, Prime Minister Gillard and Senator Conroy announced NBN Co.'s historic agreements with both Telstra and Optus. This paves the way for a very secure future for the telecommunications industry in this nation.


I have to mention my very own milestone when it comes to the NBN Co., and one that I am particularly proud of: the Smart Grid, Smart City initiative, a $100 million initiative, that trials better ways of managing the grid, linking renewables into the grid system and managing electricity use in homes et cetera. It came to my attention that the technologies being applied were not necessarily compatible with the Smart Grid, Smart City and the NBN Co. But that does not make sense, and I am very pleased to say that there are now standardised trials being undertaken by the NBN Co. and EnergyAustralia to make sure that those technologies are compatible and that those two programs can work together. If the Smart Grid, Smart City project is successful, the trial will be run out all around the nation and, of course, go international. NBN will be part of that now.


The sum total of these new agreements with Telstra and Optus is that NBN's network of optic fibre will be rolled out to every household and become the backbone of Australia's communications system. This will be a communications system of which Australians will be rightly proud—not the cut-price model proposed by the coalition that will do little to nothing for regional Australia. Instead, the NBN will provide a 21st century communications system for a 21st century Australian economy. The case for the NBN is, to all but those in the chamber opposite, utterly compelling.


It needs to be recalled that Labor's plan for the National Broadband Network stems from a decade of failure by the former coalition government and the market to deliver high-quality internet access to all Australians. The federal Labor government will not mimic the decade of neglect on telecommunications policy under which Australia suffered during the coalition years. As a Canberra Times editorial noted today, Australian internet usage is expected to increase sixfold in the coming five years. In fact, that editorial drew attention to Gungahlin, a very well-known area here, which does not have high-speed broadband. This is a whole, big new development that suffers for many reasons, but Telstra will not put in the fibre. I have an area like that in my electorate called Thornton. It is one of the biggest and fastest growing housing areas in the electorate. Again, because of a combination of factors, fast-speed broadband cannot be delivered there unless fibre is put in. Telstra has not been willing to do that, which is exactly why we are rolling out the NBN Co. proposal.


Our current infrastructure is barely adequate for our present needs, let alone the future requirements of a 21st century economy. Relying on wireless internet might seem to make sense from the comfortable vantage point of Mr Turnbull's electorate on the harbour in eastern Sydney, or Mr Abbott's electorate in Manly, where population densities and demand make sense for private enterprise to invest in decent wireless infrastructure, but that is ludicrous to those of us in regional Australia where there has been a tremendous failure by private enterprise to provide quality internet access and where there is little incentive to provide 3G services. Indeed, many private telecommunications providers already struggle to provide decent mobile phone coverage across the Hunter region, let alone decent 3G coverage.


The paucity of copper based internet services in my electorate, like much of regional Australia, is already very well known. It amazes me that the opposition keep quoting the benefits of wireless and flexibility. We all want access to that and we are all using it, but we all know that it has to be backed up by physical infrastructure, and that is what we are providing. In those areas where we struggle in peak times to access a wireless service because too many people are doing so at the same time, we know that it will only work with the infrastructure in place. That physical infrastructure is now being delivered all around Australia.


I am certain other colleagues in the House would attest that there is overwhelming support in the electorates of Newcastle and the Hunter for the rollout of the National Broadband Network. My office has been bombarded with messages from local residents urging its speedy introduction. To paraphrase the member for Greenway, who spoke earlier in this debate: the question from my constituents has not been should the NBN be rolled out, but when will it be rolled out to us and why can't it be rolled out faster? I often ask that question myself, because the people of Newcastle do understand the enormous social, economic and cultural benefits that the NBN will bring to a regional centre such as theirs.


I wonder whether coalition members have ever gone onto the NBN website. It has the most wonderful promotion of what the service will deliver. I recommend everybody go onto the website. If you cannot imagine it, go onto the website and see what the NBN Co. high-speed broadband will offer the individual and the nation. My electorate do know that the rollout of high-speed, world-class broadband in the Hunter will make us more competitive. It will erode the tyranny of distance with major capital cities. The towering sandstone hills of the Hawkesbury that now divide us from Sydney will be less of a barrier to developing new business and employment opportunities in Newcastle. The NBN will replace the ageing and unreliable copper networks presently available. It is always interesting to speak to people who have worked for the old Telecom or Telstra. Frequently, they cannot even find where that copper wire is now. The maps have long gone. When these people go into the new little towns in the regions, they have to ask or look around to try to find where on earth the copper is. One aspect of the NBN about which I am most excited is its potential to deliver very real dividends for the health of regional Australians. The Hunter New England Area Health Service, for example, which is headquartered in Newcastle, is responsible for health services in locations as far west as Tamworth and Armidale and as far north as Taree. I keep reminding members Messrs Oakeshott and Windsor just how much the people of Newcastle and the infrastructure of Newcastle have propped up their seats and made sure that as regional seats they have not missed out. That has included the delivery of e-health services from the Hunter New England Area Health Service in my electorate.


The universal availability of high-speed broadband will substantially improve the capacity of places like Tamworth, Armidale and Taree to deliver services and advice in these regions. For example, the Hunter New England Area Health Service, supported by the Digital Regions Initiative of the federal Labor government, is already undertaking a three-year program to deliver telehealth services to more than 200 patients in rural and regional communities and the NBN is supporting that initiative. Most importantly, this initiative connects patients directly to health professionals. The program targets chronic disease sufferers and links them in their own homes to monitoring, education and support services. This potential to connect health professionals with patients in their own homes is truly one of the most exciting features of the NBN for regional Australia.


Some members of the Liberal Party do know the benefits of the NBN system. I draw attention to a new state colleague, a Liberal Party state member in Newcastle, who during the election campaign said he supported the early rollout of the NBN, saying that the 'sooner' it was rolled out to Newcastle the 'better'. I strongly encourage the federal opposition to adopt that vision as well for their communities.


In coming years the federal coalition will have a lot of explaining to do. It has been missing in action on some of the biggest reform issues in this nation. It will need to explain to the community why it has injected a historically high level of negativity into Australian public life, it will need to explain to the community why its campaign of outright lies and exaggerations about the impact of a carbon price did not come to pass and it will need to explain to the community why it opposed the National Broadband Network and the enormous benefits it will provide to all Australians. I commend this bill to the House.

Mr HAASE
 (Durack) (19:32):  I rise this evening to address the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011 and subsequent amendments. The NBN and the process of providing high-tech communications to all Australians—and I underline all Australians—has been the focal point of members of this House for some time. It is quite clear to Australians today that we have a solution to providing that service. Less than $10 billion will provide a very capable and adequate service to all Australians. There is that inclusive again—all Australians.


This best estimate $50 billion service is going to provide ultrahigh speed to 93 per cent of Australians. There is no guessing as to where those other seven per cent reside. They are in my own electorate of Durack. The members for Lingiari, Grey and Maranoa also have a few. There is a large part of this continent where fibre to the premises will never be provided. It is those seven per cent that I am concerned about tonight. Presently, we have a proposition akin to taking out a high-cost bank loan to buy a Lamborghini to go into town and pick up the mail each week. It is dumb, and everyone out there who has ever had to balance a budget and provide facilities at the same time for a family knows that it is dumb. You do not go ahead and borrow inordinate volumes of currency and subsequently push up interest rates across the country to invest in something that is simply not necessary. There are other ways to do this job—ways that we have espoused on and on but all to no avail, unfortunately, with this government who seem hell-bent on constructing monuments. The monument to the Prime Minister, the school halls fiasco, is well known. I believe the NBN fiasco will be well known in the future as a monument to the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator Conroy. But, at the end of the day, it is the taxpayers of Australia who will be footing the bill. You cannot justify borrowing the funds that are being talked about by this government with the taxpayer footing the bill in higher interest rates into the future simply because you want to build a monument. 


There are many parts of my electorate where mobile phones are not available. There is no doubt, however, that wireless communications is the preferred commun­ication method in rural and remote Australia. I hazard a guess that it is also a trend that is catching on swiftly in metropolitan Australia. More and more internet users are demanding that their facilities be mobile. People do not want to be tied to a particular point to gain internet access. Apple found that last year when they released their new product. The iPad was sought after by thousands and sell-outs were swift. By comparison, when the NBN was turned on in Armidale, the government was battling to get any real paying customers to the occasion because Australians do not want to pay through the nose for something that has been rammed down their throats, that they have been told is something they have to have and, what is more, that they will pay for whether they like it or not. They do not like it. If we spent a fraction of the difference between $10 billion and $50 billion, $1 billion is $1,000 million. We talk about billions of dollars as though they simply fall off trees. They do not. In this case they are the dollars of hardworking Australians, for which they will be responsible into the future. If we talk about providing a service to all Australians that is adequate and affordable, we talk about spending about $10 billion.


This particular bill is a very specific bill that relates, in the main, to greenfields. Generally speaking, we accept that in the case of greenfields there is a lot to be done. If we have to have the NBN solution of fibre to the premises, that facility will be provided at a much lower cost if it is mandated to be rolled out in greenfield developments. Keep in mind that the best guesstimate is that by 2020 there will be some 1.9 million premises that will be part of greenfield developments. So it is a very substantial market that we are speaking of.


With the size of that market in mind, we in the coalition believe that amendments ought to be made to this legislation so as to provide for greater efficiencies and greater cost economies in the rolling out of services. We know through past history and experience that, wherever a monopoly is involved, costs have a habit of trending upwards unnecessarily. Presently we have well in excess of 1,000 employees in the NBN and something like 600-odd genuine customers. It is not a ratio that commercial Australia would find very sustainable. If you look at that fact today on the basis of this $50 billion expenditure proposition not being costed, with no triple bottom line analysis and no real transparency in the calculation of the price and the manner in which it will be spent, it is pretty unsatisfactory.


I go back to the amendments. Because of the broad scope and the numbers involved into the future, we firmly believe that operators in these greenfield developments ought to be exempt from the cherry-picking laws. We believe in that because there is room for competition here—and compe­tition, as has been experienced in the past, will bring the costs of providing that service down. Further, we wish to have an amendment that will provide for private operators that wish to set up a network in competition to NBN to have the opportunity via this legislation to do so. Furthermore, there was a commitment that those networks be able to sell out to NBN in a negotiated settlement at some point in time in the future. We on this side of the House believe in true competition. True competition is driven by market forces. Supply and demand is the best solution to any trade relationship. In this case, where you have the opportunity for the creation of a monopoly you equally provide the opportunity for inflated prices. Australians are already suffering that in the areas of groceries, fuel and electricity, and this is not the time to add another level of inflated prices through their internet participation.


We on this side of the House are quite resolved as to what should be the outcome for this bill. If the government will reasonably accept these very rational amendments, we will be happy to see the passage of the bill. In the meantime, I reiterate that the interest of Australians is simply to have a reasonable internet service. Those Australians who have almost no access to mobile phones today and no reliable internet service would be served extremely well with a high-tech, up-to-date wireless internet service that would provide for them to access markets. As an aside, I mention that those markets have, in the main, been shut down by the decision of this government in cancelling live beef exports to Indonesia. But I digress. We need in rural and remote Australia to have access to the internet because remote marketing is an important tool today. But we do not need to go into hock to this extent to provide that service. Rural folk are a fairly sensible lot. They do not believe that you spend above your means. They do not believe that you accumulate absolutely non-serviceable debt in order to brag that you have a Rolls Royce service that you will never, ever need. Therefore, the case remains that this is too much money spent without proper cons­ideration. Unless this legislation specifically relating to greenfields is rationally amended to allow some competition to maintain reasonable costs, those hardworking Austr­alians who want to use these services will be worse off.

"D'Ath, Yvette, MP",ALP,2011-07-04,"



Mrs D'ATH
 (Petrie) (19:41):  I rise to speak in support of the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011. This bill was first introduced into the House in March 2011 and was referred to the Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network in May 2011. The committee sought to conduct an inquiry into this bill within a responsible time frame, considering the circumstances of the bill. This bill has been some time in the making. As noted in paragraph 1.1 of the committee's report on this bill, the bill:


… was preceded by a similar bill which was introduced into the Senate in March 2010, but lapsed on the proroguing of the 42nd Parliament. The Fibre Deployment Bill 2010 shared a similar purpose to the Bill under inquiry, that is, to ‘ensure fibre-ready and fibre infrastructure installation in new developments.’ This Bill differs from its predecessor in that the Fibre Deployment Bill 2010 ‘was more dependent on subordinate legislation for activation of the key provisions in the Bill’, while the current Bill includes those key provisions.


The government undertook extensive consultation on this bill now before the House, including releasing discussion papers and draft legislation. The government also considered the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Environment and Communications report on the Telecom­munications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2010. Based on that history, the industry and developers have been seeking certainty for over 12 months. There is no doubt that certainty is important for developers who each and every day are developing new estates and building homes for people across Australia.


It is this imperative for certainty that ensured that the Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network dealt with this matter within the timeframe set, thus allowing this bill to be debated before this House this week. When looking at the history of this bill, at the questions put to the witnesses by the opposition and the submissions put to the committee by various providers, the fact is that the issues raised do not fundamentally go to this bill. They go to the Liberal Party's opposition to the National Broadband Network and the government's policy to deliver a national broadband network.


The main purpose of this bill is to require developers of new estates to put in passive infrastructure like underground pipes into which a fibre provider can later put fibre. It is not concerned with putting an obligation on NBN Co. or anyone else to put in active infrastructure, fibre or, in limited cases, copper lines or wireless. The majority of submissions by the witnesses and the questions by the opposition during the inqu­iry into this bill went to active infrastructure. It was acknowledged by witnesses that the purpose of this bill is to legislate for fibre-ready infrastructure, not active infrastructure.


The committee's report also acknowledged that much of the evidence was outside the scope of the bill. The opposition also concentrated most of its time on issues not relating to this bill, and it continues to do so in this debate. This is predominately because the opposition is more interested in finding ways to oppose the government's policy than being opposed to the practical application of the rollout of fast broadband.


I will come to the Liberal Party's position shortly but, importantly, this bill amends the Telecommunications Act 1997 to support the government's policy that fibre-to-the-premises infrastructure should be installed in new developments. This bill is another step forward to delivering on the Labor govern­ment's commitment to roll out the National Broadband Network. As stated by the minister in his second reading speech on 7 April 2009, the Australian government announced its historic decision to establish a new company, NBN Co. Limited, to build and operate a new superfast national broadband network.


The NBN has an objective of connecting up to 93 per cent of all Australian homes, schools and workplaces with fibre based broadband services and connecting other premises in Australia with next-generation wireless and satellite broadband services. This bill in effect requires developers that are constitutional corporations to install fibre-ready passive infrastructure—that is, pit and pipe. It requires passive infrastructure installed in new developments in the long-term NBN fibre footprint to be fibre ready; it allows carriers to access fibre-ready passive infrastructure that is owned by non carriers, and provides for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to have a role as the default arbitrator.


It creates a power for the minister to specify by legislative instrument develop­ments in which fixed lines must be optical fibre and provides for exemptions from the requirements to install fibre-ready facilities or optical fibre lines. It also provides for the Australian Communications and Media Authority to develop technical standards to cover interoperability, performance stand­ards and design features for superfast broadband rollout on its own initiative or, if directed, by the minister, and makes other technical and administrative amendments. The bill will take effect on the later of the date of royal assent or 1 July 2011, which unfortunately has passed.


I would like to briefly touch on the standards because there has been much debate in relation to standards. Despite evidence from TransACT, OptiComm and Greenfield Fibre Operators of Australia of them being opposed to ministerial authority to set standards and specifications, and comments made that this should be left to the Australian Communications and Media Authority, there appears to be no real enthusiasm to do so.


There does appear to be some double standards, however, when TransACT in evidence stated that it would expect subcontractors to apply TransACT's standar­ds but it would not be acceptable for NBN Co. to expect the same. Firstly, it is important to note that this bill does not set out technical specifications for fibre infrastructure in new developments. What the bill does do is give the minister some powers to make instruments to do so with regard to passive infrastructure and to optical fibre lines in specified developments if necessary.


The Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy stated in its evidence that for fibre infrastructure to serve its purpose, for example to allow the ready deployment of fibre, and operate on an appropriate level in terms of speeds across the many new developments constructed in Australia each year, some degree of standardisation may be required. These provisions provide a reserve power to fast track this standardisation process if required, noting that normal standardisation can sometimes be time consuming and subject to gaming. The department went on to say:


The government's policy in relation to specifications was set out in the 9 December 2010 policy statement. NBN Co. will provide specifications for use where a developer wishes to use NBN Co. The specifications will also be provided to the Communications Alliance with a view to having these specifications endorsed for general use by industry as soon as possible.


This policy was also reflected in the government's statement of expectations for the NBN and NBN Co. It is clear that this bill and the government's policy, as reflected in the statement of expectations, is flexible. It does not impose specifications without consultation. However, it is reasonable if the industry itself does not develop a standard and it is considered appropriate to do so, that the minister has such powers.


The NBN is already being rolled out in Tasmania and we recently saw the start-up on the mainland of Australia. With the rollout of the NBN continuing to expand across the country over coming months and years, it is important that certain areas do not get left behind. Importantly, it is necessary to ensure that unnecessary costs are not incurred due to lack of planning. That is why greenfields sites are being addressed through this bill. It is important, as the NBN goes through our older suburbs and provides fast broadband, that new suburbs being built are not using pits and pipes which would not be suitable for smooth transition to fibre. That is why this bill is being introduced—to ensure our new developments are fibre ready.


I also note the comments from the members for Greenway and Chifley, who have much experience in this area, in particular the comments of the member for Chifley on the unremarkable nature of this bill. It is true that much attention has been paid to this bill and, as I outlined earlier, it has a history going back more than 12 months. However, what is being achieved through this bill is in no way unique. Just as developers ensure the infrastructure for water, electricity and roads in new estates, they will ensure infrastructure for fast broadband.


The Liberal Party has stated this is not their preferred model. It is clear from comments made by the shadow minister for communications and broadband, the member for Wentworth, that the opposition's policy is for a hybrid system of fibre, copper, wireless and satellite, with no particular strategy. It appears that the Liberal Party's policy is that they can provide faster broadband than people have now but not as fast as Labor's NBN policy, not as efficient, not a network which will be Australia wide and which will expand services across health, education, businesses and households, both rural and city. The selling point for the Liberal Party is: 'But it won't cost as much'. Well of course it will not cost as much, because it is not delivering an efficient fast broadband system which would be internationally competitive. It will still see many suburbs struggle to get any connection or work at a speed suitable for basic household use.


If the Australian public were listening to various opposition members in this debate, I think they would go away very confused. The member for Moncrieff was stating that we do not need NBN—that health services over fast broadband are happening now. At the same time, the member for Ryan is saying that there is no doubt that the country will benefit from the rollout of fibre across the country to deliver fast broadband but that, overall, it is bad for the country because it will cost money. The shadow minister is outlining proposed amendments, yet to be tendered, which allegedly seek to provide for competition because the providers do not want to miss out on the opportunities that come from the demand for fast broadband. At the same time, other opposition members are criticising the NBN rollout as a white elephant because apparently no householders are going to take up the option of connecting fast broadband to their premises. So on one hand providers are missing out and, on the other, nobody is going to take up broadband.


Then of course we have the shadow minister continually using South Korea as an alternative example of a country that is rolling out fast broadband but only to the basement. There are many similarities between Australia and South Korea—they are celebrating this year, as is Australia, Australian-Korean diplomatic relationships over the past 50 years. But when we compare the size of the countries and when we compare the living styles—the majority of their population live in high-rise apartments; the majority in Australia live in stand-alone houses—it is clear that the statements being relied on are just incorrect. The arguments are flawed.


In fact, when the shadow minister was asking questions about South Korea of Mr Harris, the Secretary of the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Mr Harris said:


On the Korean issue, we had the Korea-Australia-New Zealand Broadband Summit in Hobart a few weeks ago. I asked the Korean communications commissioner about these issues … I asked the CEO of the Korean Communications Com­mission. He is a senior representative in creating the plans by which the Koreans are doing these investments.


He went on to state:


Korea has a Fibre-To-The-Home Council and is clearly running, in their advice to us, fibre-to-the-home network planning. They are doing fibre to the home. They are just sequencing it as we have done, fibre to the basement, as you have said, we have done some fibre to the node and we are keeping on going and now doing fibre to the home. It has not stopped. Their program continues and their objective is fibre to the home.


By all means we should look at international examples and learn from their experiences, but it is important that we do not get distracted by flawed arguments, such as that from the shadow minister. Although the opposition clearly do not understand the importance of a national fast broadband network and the benefits it can and will bring to many aspects of our economy and people's lives, the Labor Party and this Labor government do understand. That is why this Gillard Labor government is committed to passing this bill, committed to ensuring that fibre-ready infrastructure in our new developments and committed to seeing the rollout of the National Broadband Network. People in my electorate of Petrie understand the importance of such infrastructure. We have many black spots, even though we are metropolitan and outer metropolitan, where people cannot get broadband at all. People in my electorate understand the importance of the National Broadband Network. The Australian people understand the importance of such infrastructure. That is why this government is delivering on its promise to the Australian people and it is for this reason that I commend the bill to the House.

Mr BRUCE SCOTT
 (Maranoa—Second Deputy Speaker) (19:57):  I rise this evening to speak on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Fibre Deployment) Bill 2011. This bill is designed to ensure that fibre-to-the-premises infrastructure, rather than traditional copper connections, is installed in new broadacre urban infill and urban renewal developments of more than 100 premises. The coalition does support regulations which would ensure that fibre to the premises is used in greenfields estates, but we still have concerns.


Firstly, we have concerns about changes to the market structure. Under the arrange­ments with developers, the NBN Co. will pay for the pits and pipes of new infrastructure, a cost that has traditionally been borne by developers. This will see existing providers become uncompetitive. Secondly, there appears to have been a lack of consultation with the industry and an eleventh-hour decision that the NBN establish technical standards which will be too onerous for small providers to meet. It is very important that we get clarity on this. 


In the electorate of Maranoa, we have the Surat coal basin, with a huge development and growth that we have not seen since almost the early development of that part of Queensland. There are a number of developments going out there—greenfields sites. The developers of these sites have been in touch with me. They have been trying to operate and develop these housing estates, which are very much needed, but they have had this uncertainty hanging over them about who is going to pay for what—whether it is going to be the developer and, if so, whether they are going to be reimbursed, or whether it is going to be Telstra, and whether it has to be copper wire or optic fibre cable. Many of these developers have been frustrated because they could not get an answer out of either—the responsibility was being shifted. Obviously this legislation is long overdue and is supported by the coalition.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(

Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley) (21:30):  I rise to speak in support of the Take A Break occasional care funding program. I took to the steps of the Victorian Parliament House on Thursday during a protest against the federal government's cuts to the Take A Break occasional childcare program. There were concerned parents and families and the dedicated staff and volunteers that make occasional day care work. They were very concerned about the unilateral decision of the Gillard government to abandon its funding of this very important program. While millions are being spent by Canberra on new childcare laws and safety standards, not one cent—not a dime—is going into occasional care. The money is being ripped from the sector and being spent to administer and oversee new standards on long day care, preschool, family day care and out of school hours care.


I was particularly pleased to be able to speak with the state minister, Wendy Lovell, before I went out to talk on the steps of Parliament House. I was encouraged and excited about her assurance that, should the Gillard government change its mind and do the right thing by families who require occasional day care, the state government would follow suit and provide its share of the funding—a really positive message coming out of the Baillieu government. But what do we hear from the federal Labor government? Absolutely nothing. Now you would queue that scratchy sound of crickets in the background that lets you know that abso­lutely nothing is being said by this federal Labor government. Where is Kate Ellis? Does she not understand that this one size fits all logic, this tick a box approach to child care, just does not work for every family? Are those families that require occasional child care the new forgotten families under this Gillard Labor government? They certainly seem to be, and they were not very happy when they were on the steps of Parliament House.


It was particularly interesting to note the petitions that had been signed. The petitions were directed to the Legislative Assembly of the state parliament when they really should have been directed to the House of Representatives in the federal parliament. Kate Ellis must have been delighted, as the minister, that there was very little discussion until I had the opportunity to talk to the assembled crowd about what an appalling, neglectful and unhelpful decision the federal Labor government had made to cut $12 million in occasional care funding.


In addition to the assurances from Wendy Lovell that the state Liberal government would reinstate its funding when the federal Labor government reinstated the $12 million, there was more good news. I was able to share with those who were present that under Tony Abbott the coalition is committed to restoring the $12 million ripped out of occasional child care by federal Labor. There was a really positive response to that and a recognition that the federal coalition was prepared to make its contribution. We are prepared to make a contribution for a whole range of reasons. The provision of affordable, reliable, safe and available childcare facilities will always be a direct responsibility of the federal government. 


We saw under the previous coalition government a recognition that family types and demands on families were quite varied and their needs were at times flexible, at times easy to predict and at other times difficult to respond to because of the complex nature of families and modern life. This is where occasional care comes in. I hope that the federal Labor minister hears the message—the message that there is no one size fits all requirement for child care in our country. If she needs any more reassurance and any more prompting to put back that money that has been ripped out—an action that made so many people unhappy on the steps of the state parliament last week—I would like to share with her some observ­ations from families in my own electorate. This is from one person who wrote to me:


I have been using the Occasional Care Facility at the Mornington Community Contact for 2 years with my eldest child ... This service has provided me with a small break each week of 3-5 hrs which I have found to be invaluable.


This mother goes on to describe that, with the demands of young children, this has allowed some time to recharge her energy and re-engage and be all that she hopes to be as the mother of her children. There is another example involving Mahogany Neighbourhood House in Frankston North. A parent says:


I began using occasional care in July 2010 when I left my position in government employment services to concentrate on my family. 


She goes on to describe not only the important contribution that that break provi­ded for the wellbeing of her family but also the opportunity it gave her to re-engage in employment. The noise was strong and the message was clear on the steps of Parliament House in Victoria last Thursday—Kate Ellis, you need to put this money back. Occasional care matters to people. There is no one size fits all solution. (Time expired)




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. Peter Slipper
):  I was loath to interrupt the member for Dunkley, but I commend to him the provisions of standing order 64, which require him to refer to the Minister for Employment Participation and Childcare and the Leader of the Opposition by their titles and not by their names.

"Irons, Steve, MP",LP,2011-07-04,"



Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (10:30):  It is with great pleasure that I rise today to talk about the celebration of the commencement of the Great Eastern Highway, an important road in my electorate of Swan. The celebration of the commencement took place on Saturday 25 June in Rivervale and I attended the latter part of the proceedings at the invitation of the WA transport minister, Troy Buswell. This was a particularly significant moment for me personally as the upgrade of the Great Eastern Highway was the first issue that I started campaigning on as a Liberal candidate for the seat of Swan back in 2006-07. The stretch of the Great Eastern Highway that goes through my electorate of Swan fulfils a number of important functions. It is the gateway to WA's east, including the important agricultural wheat belt area. It links the city and the airport. It is home to many of the small businesses in my electorate. But, perhaps most importantly, it is used by local residents going about their day-to-day lives.


As you can probably imagine, with all these functions and uses the Great Eastern Highway has become a very congested road. It is currently two lanes over much of the distance between the city and the airport and there are some fairly messy interchanges, which can make a journey up the Great Eastern Highway dangerous. Fortunately, there has always been a fairly wide road reserve and as a Liberal candidate in 2006-07 I campaigned for the widening of the highway. This campaign received plenty of support from the community, including from prominent local figures such as the Mayor of the City of Belmont, Glenys Godfrey.


With that support, I took the case for the upgrade to the then Prime Minister, Mr John Howard. Prime Minister Howard, who was always a great supporter of road improvements, saw merit in the proposed upgrade. It was a great moment for the local community when he visited Perth in person on 27 September 2007 to announce that a re-elected Liberal government would fund the upgrade. Two days later, the member for Griffith—and he is in the chamber, and I congratulate him on making this decision—Mr Kevin Rudd, sensing how popular my local campaign on this issue was, copied Mr Howard's pledge to upgrade the Great Eastern Highway, securing crucial bipartisan support before the 2007 poll. So I thank the member for Griffith for supporting my local campaign. This proved to be important, as Mr Rudd went on to win the election.


However, I knew that there would be a long road ahead. On winning the seat of Swan on 14 December 2007, I made it my No. 1 priority to make sure that the Labor Party delivered on its promise to put $180 million into the Great Eastern Highway upgrade from Kooyong Road to the Tonkin Highway. There was a picture of the member for Griffith and the local Labor member on the Great Eastern Highway for the whole election campaign, Kim Wilkie. The WA government has contributed $45 million. It has been a long road to the commencement of the road works. Over the past few years, we have had to fight every step of the way to get the federal government to come good on its promise. But it is great that the upgrade has started.

Mr ADAMS
 (Lyons) (11:02):  I want to bring the House's attention to the International Year of Forests because I believe that the forestry industry is one of the really great news stories for Australia. We have been through turmoil and fights with this industry, but now I believe the debate is maturing and, with that, a new industry is emerging that can be counted on as one of world's best practice and as being sustainable for centuries to come. Australia has about four per cent of the world's forests on five per cent of the world's land area. It has one of the best managed forestry sectors in the world.


The nation's forests and the products they produce provide significant employment, environmental and recreational benefits to communities across Australia. Australia's forestry and wood manufacturing sector employs nearly 76,000 people, many in regional areas, and generates about $7 billion worth of wood and paper products annually. Across the nation, forests in conservation areas cover 23 million hectares. These reserves provide recreational benefits for communities and contribute to the 12 billion tonnes of carbon stored by Australian forests. Industry and government have been working hard to make sure our forests remain sustainable and viable for the long term.


The Australian government recognises the importance of World Forestry Day and the International Year of Forests and has actively supported both initiatives. This year the Gillard government has released legislation to ban the importation of timber products that have not been legally harvested. This will contribute to global efforts to stop illegal logging, provide for sustainable forest products made in Australia and reduce unfair competition. The Gillard government remains committed to promoting sustainable forestry initiatives and encourages people to celebrate the International Year of Forests.


With just four per cent of the world's forests in Australia, most people would not recognise forest conservation as a daily issue in our wide brown land. But Australia has a variety of forest types. There are seven main groups that cover much of the coastal regions of the country. In order of abundance these are eucalypt, with 11 subtypes; acacia; melaleuca; rainforest; callitris; casuarina; and mangroves. Australia has the world's sixth largest forest area with a total of just over 147 million hectares, or around 21 per cent of the country's total land area. Most of Australia's forests are found in Queensland, with 52.8 million hectares of forest covering almost one-third of the state. Tasmania's forests, both native and plantation, cover 50 per cent of the state.


All our forests are home to unique native wildlife—animals as diverse as the cassowary in the rainforests of North Queensland and the tiny woylie in Western Australia's south-west. They all rely on a healthy forest for survival, whether it be an old-growth forest that has seen no development, harvesting or agricultural clearing or a newly regenerated forest. All forests in Australia play an important part in the natural ecosystem.


Forests throughout Australia can be threatened by both man-made and natural processes. Fire, drought and flood are all natural phenomena and can be both friend and foe to the forests of Australia. Many eucalypt species are adapted to fire, and the river red gums of Victoria's newest state forests are adapted to the flooding waters that can reach halfway up their trunks.


It is important to recognise the role of forest management in the maintenance of our world-class forests. Without some managing authority to deal with fire, drought, flood, human and animal impacts in our forests, as well as disease that in some cases can sweep through an area—just as it can among humans—we would not have such pristine forests as we have today. I salute the foresters and the forest workers, many of whom have worked in forests for generations, who, by their work and their understanding of the forest systems, have allowed us such an outcome as we have today.


The future will be just as important. The forests will play an important part in recycling carbon by storing it in wood and releasing oxygen as a by-product. This has played and will play a very important part in keeping the world's atmosphere in balance and preventing those excesses on either side—warming and cooling.


It is going to be an exciting time as new ideas become reality and researchers find innovative ways to use the timber, the bark, the leaves and the sap of our trees. Most people see wood used in their homes for building structures, for furniture, for ornamental purposes and even for art. But few recognise the importance of wood products for making paper to label all our goods, for packaging and for artists, newspapers, books, posters and prints. There are the medical uses of our trees—eucalypt oil and other tinctures that have been distilled from parts of leaves or the sap. And there has been innovation in the use of timber itself. It is now viable to use the small pieces of timber being milled. Engineered timber with certain types of glue can make beams that are even stronger than steel.


There is also the pure delight of wandering through a forest and enjoying the smell and the feel of the earth as the atmosphere renews itself through the trees. I had the opportunity of taking the House committee to some of my favourite spots in working forests during the hearing in Tasmania last week. We were all hugely impressed by the work that is quietly going on in keeping our Tasmanian forests well looked after. It was awe inspiring. Some of the walks and lookouts would not have been created had there not been a forest manager to ensure access to the forests. Whether they are in a public forest or in a private forest, whether they are on a farmland or on the fringes of urban areas, trees work well with humans if we are not silly about their powers. There are also opportunities for many new products coming from trees into the future, including being able to utilise rotary peeled veneers, being able to glue trees back together after we have peeled them off, to make even stronger products than in the past. This can work very well in regional areas and there are great opportunities for that. Laminated veneer lumber is also becoming a reality throughout the world, especially in New Zealand and now in Australia. Being able to join small pieces of timber together and making it economically viable for that product to reach the standards for the building codes give us a great opportunity by allowing the use of a lot more wood. The future is certainly going to be about less native forest timber being available for processing but more plantation timber. We will need to identify more efficient ways of supplying customers. We will also need to know what people want in wood products in the future and about the changing demands. Consumers are certainly favouring strength and versatility of engineered wood products over traditional sawn timbers. There need to be opportunities to take wood to the biodiesel stage, and the opportunities into the future are growing wonderfully well.


This is a wonderful industry. It employs a lot of great Tasmanians, great Australians, and people throughout the world. It can help alleviate poverty throughout the world, and we do need to make timber products from trees, but there has to be a process that is sustainable to allow us to achieve that. Before this year ends I suggest everybody goes out to their favourite piece of forest, talks to the workers who use it, asks them their stories, hears about their pride in their areas and just thinks about their forests in this International Year of Forests.

"Hunt, Greg, MP",LP,2011-07-04,"



Mr HUNT
 (Flinders) (11:12):  It gives me considerable pleasure to support this motion by the member for Lyons. Whilst I may not agree with all his political choices I do have great respect for his integrity and decency. Having said that, I want to look at the first part of this motion, and that is in relation to the international sustainability and protection of the great rainforests, the threat to those forests and the opportunity for cooperative international action not just to protect these forests but to make a rapid, real reduction in global greenhouse emissions in the shortest possible time and in the largest possible way at the lowest possible cost.


Let me begin with this proposition: on the best advice, of the world's over 40 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide or related gases released each year, almost 20 per cent of that comes from the destruction of rainforests and other forests. This is a huge signature, a huge footprint, an enormous release of greenhouse gases, be it CO2, methane or other emissions which have an impact on the greenhouse process. It is also an extraordinary testimony to significant, widespread destruction of the great forests of the world and in particular the great rainforests of the world. So the task, the duty, the responsibility is to try to create a system which allows for sustainable management of these great rainforests, which protects the magnificent biodiversity and which protects in particular many of the indigenous communities throughout the equatorial regions of the world—whether in Africa, in Asia, in the Pacific or in Latin America—who have suffered and are suffering the loss of their environment as well as their livelihood. The background is that the pressures are real for land, for the growth of crops, for the supply of foodstuffs and in many cases for the supply of energy through sugar cane, which is being used for biodiesel equivalents in Brazil and parts of Latin America. As a consequence of this the rainforests in many parts of the world are being destroyed, degraded and damaged. That in turn is a loss of biodiversity, a loss of community and a release of CO2 or equivalent gases on a grand scale.


At the highest level our goal and our objective as an alternative government of Australia is to see that the world establishes a genuine global rainforest recovery program. In the next five years, we want to see the goal of a 50 per cent reduction in the approximately eight billion tonnes of annual CO2 or equivalent gases released from rainforest destruction. This is a real and achievable goal. It is significant, and nothing would do more at a faster rate on a grander scale to reduce the immediate global footprint than to protect the great forests of the world. That is a desirable, achievable, fundamental goal that can bring both the developed and the developing worlds together at a time when there is scant agreement internationally over the way to deal with this problem.


The specifics we would like to introduce in order to ensure that we build on the work that has been done, whether it is Brazil or Indonesia or other parts of the word, are threefold. First, we believe that the Australian government should co-host, preferably with Indonesia, an international summit on preserving the world's rainforests. In particular, my view and our view is that that summit could be held later this year before the next major United Nations climate summit in South Africa as it could be a way to ensure significant, real and genuine progress and provide the opportunity for something to come out of this summit on international climate change processes. It would be a fundamental step towards protecting the great rainforests and reducing emissions.


Second, the summit's goal would be to spearhead and coordinate efforts to protect and preserve the world's rainforests, from Brazil to PNG, and in particular to create a time frame and a mechanism to protect these forests. There are many forms of incentive payments to protect against destruction, on the basis of abatement, and could provide a way forward. This is the moment to seize the opportunity to protect these great rainforests.


Third, our commitment is very simple. If we can achieve an international agreement, whether it is on the current watch or our watch, if we are fortunate to be given that opportunity, we will work to ensure that there is support in both the developed world and in the developing world for such an agreement. Just look at the examples, whether it is in Costa Rica, or parts of Brazil, or in Indonesia or, in particular, in Mexico, where there have been stewardship agreements between the international community, which has been willing to provide resources, the host government and the local Indigenous community to protect and steward these forests. This is a model for the sort of approach that could take the world forward in terms of rapid reduction of emissions at a low cost of abatement on a large scale. Nothing the world can do will make a bigger, faster reduction in the global CO2 footprint.


Against that background I welcome this motion from the member for Lyons. I particularly note that the international opportunities for protection of the great rainforests are real, but it is the sad case that the work begun under the previous government has barely been taken forward under this government, in part, I fear, because it was an agenda of the Liberal-National coalition to drive forward great rainforest protection. I would offer the hand of friendship to the government and say, 'Please join us in this commitment to protecting the great rainforests.' The member for Lyons's motion is an important step in that direction, and I thank him for his work.


Domestically there is also a parallel here. Domestically our whole approach is based on voluntary and willing participation. That is why we have supported an incentives based scheme rather than a tax based scheme to reduce emissions, which, among other things, provides the opportunity to capture carbon in plantation forests, in soil and in revegetation through mallee and mulga. These are real opportunities for capturing carbon and reducing emissions—doing so at a low cost, on a grand scale, within Australia. 



I simply turn to the work of the CSIRO's Sustainable Agriculture Flagship. The head of that flagship, Dr Michael Battaglia, prepared a very significant paper recently. That paper made it clear that it would be possible to reduce Australia's emissions by 20 per cent per annum over 40 years through the use of green carbon or the capture of carbon in natural ecosystems. That is an enormous opportunity. The CSIRO work of Dr Michael Battaglia, is more aggressive than the figures presented by the coalition in our direct action policy. We were conservative in our estimates. The CSIRO, which is itself a conservative scientific agency, has, however, made much more aggressive projections as to what is achievable with incentive payments. That is good news for Australia and it is good news for the emissions reduction possibilities. I commend the idea of an incentives scheme rather than a tax based scheme and commend the idea of a global rainforest recovery program. (Time expired)

"Sidebottom, Sid, MP",ALP,2011-07-04,"



Mr SIDEBOTTOM
 (Braddon) (11:22):  I stand with my colleague and friend the member for Lyons to recognise that 2011 is the International Year of Forests. Forestry is a fantastic industry that provides the world with renewable products, income and ecological services. The United Nations Forum on Forests reflects international trends in forest management, which increasingly acknowledges that previous policy objectives that were designed to restrict the use of native forest resources were misdirected and have led to perverse social, land use and economic outcomes. There is now an acceptance that sustainable forest management and utilisation policy must encompass all forest types and tenure and that native forests are part of an integrated solution to meeting national, social and economic development needs.


A number of environmental non-government organisations—ENGOs—are adopting a more pragmatic approach to the management and utilisation of native forests. For example, the World Wildlife Fund 'understands the threats facing forest today,' but trying to prohibit the use of forest resources is not a viable solution. The world is rediscovering, fortunately, the benefits of wood and wood products. Our eucalypts, with their high-strength rating, are an ideal source for engineered products. Research in Europe and North America is looking seriously at substituting tilt slab concrete walls with cross-laminated timber slab walls. Laminated timber is lighter and has the benefit of capturing a huge amount of CO2, unlike concrete, which in fact, emits CO2. Furthermore, in earthquake-prone areas, governments are recognising the benefits of timber buildings, including high-rise, which are less prone to collapse than those constructed of steel or concrete. In Europe and Japan eight- to 10-storey buildings are being made from timber. Indeed, in Melbourne, the Grollo family made headlines with its plans to build Australia's first high-rise building from timber.


These are examples of why forests should be recognised in this International Year of Forests. As such, worldwide demand for forest product is forecast to increase and Australia's proximity to the rapidly growing Asian economies provides an opportunity to expand growth and output. To fulfil growing demand, forest processes require expanding resources and long-term security and supply at suitable levels of quantity and quality, supporting investment decisions critical in maintaining competitiveness and developing new processing capacity. As we are currently seeing in my home state of Tasmania, resource security is a major issue for the industry. Forest planning is an intergenerational activity.


Forest operations around the world have gone through dramatic changes over the past 20 years and have adapted and responded positively to change, and my state of Tasmania is no exception. Gone are the days when forestry was considered to be a career for males with a high level of physical fitness and a low level of skills who were content to work in dangerous situations. Many modern jobs involve operating computer controlled forest harvesting and mill processing equipment which requires highly skilled personnel. The 21st-century forest industry is a safe, modern, capital-intensive, state-of-the-art and high-tech industry that continues to provide rewarding career activities.


The industry is not standing still. As well as technology and research, private, native and plantation forest resources are becoming increasingly critical to supply models But managed forests still provide the most cost effective and environmentally sustainable approach to forest management and addressing the challenges associated with issues such as climate change. It is clear that appropriate, supportive and consistent government policies will be required if the full potential of the Australian and, particularly, the Tasmanian forest industry is to be realised and, in doing so, maximise its contribution to local and regional communities.


According to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry in 2008-09, Australian forests produced 25 million cubic metres of logs, which had a forest roadside value of $1.7 billion or an average price of $68 per cubic metre. After processing, the value of this resource averaged $920 per cubic metre, an increase of over 1,320 per cent. The industry is collectively Australia's second-largest manufacturing industry and contributes around 0.7 per cent to Australia's gross domestic product and 5.8 per cent of manufacturing output. The forest industry is a critical regional employer, with 76,800 people directly employed across supply and value chains.

"Tehan, Dan, MP",LP,2011-07-04,"



Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (11:27):  I rise to support this motion but in particular would like to talk about an issue which I think is underutilised and an area where we need to do a lot more policy work and see some serious policy change: family farm forestry. Last week I had the opportunity to visit the Yan Yan Gurt Creek catchment area and the property of Andrew Stewart. There I met with members of the Colac Otway Landcare group. Since 1993, they have set up the Otway Agroforestry Network. It is local farmers and government working with Landcare to look at ways to increase the productivity of farms through the use of agroforestry.


What we are seeing is quite remarkable. The results suggest that family farm forestry can not only make a significant contribution to future timber supply but may also ensure commercial tree growing has local community support, underpins sustainable agriculture production and delivers real environmental benefits. I would like to thank Andrew Stewart for hosting my visit last Monday. I would also like to thank Rowan Reed from Bambra. Rowan is a former professor of forestry at the University of Melbourne and has now set up a farm where he showcases what forestry can do to improve family farming. The results are quite remarkable. I view it as a serious way forward. I have also had the pleasure early late last year of visiting Melville Forest at Andrew and Kim Dufty's house, where I also met with their parents, Margaret and Stuart Dufty. They produce carbon-neutral wool on the property by putting about 10 to 15 per cent of their farm to forestry and to plantations. They also use shelter belts, through the use of which they are able to increase livestock production and also get cropping production up. This is a way forward.


The problem we have at the moment is that we are not providing the incentives for farmers to look at forestry. The only incentive we have at the moment is for large-scale plantations through managed investment schemes. I will take this opportunity to once again call for this type of subsidy to plantation timber to stop. It distorts landscapes; it has turned out to be an absolute Ponzi scheme and has delivered no net result for local communities. We need to look at ways we can empower and provide incentives for our farmers to use their land and agroforestry to not only increase their food production but also increase timber production. There is a smart way we can deal with this issue and it is not through MIS. We have seen farmers have their subsidies reduced. We have seen the wool floor scheme taken away from farmers and the single-desk scheme from the wheat growers. We have seen subsidies removed from the farming sector and it is high time we remove them now from the timber plantation sector so that we can once again see farmers working, without having to compete with forestry, to improve their lands to continue to increase their food production and crop production and go a long way to trying to feed the globe. As we all know the increase in food demand is going to double in the next 30 to 40 years, and if we are smart about how we use forestry and food together we can deal with that problem.

"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2011-07-04,"



Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Government Whip) (11:32):  Mr Deputy Speaker, I note that you saw fit to visit the wonderful Shortland electorate at the weekend. I was sorry that I did not catch up with you. I would like to congratulate the member for Lyons for bringing this very important motion to parliament. I know it is an issue that he is absolutely passionate about. As members of parliament we should all be passionate about the issue of forests and their sustainability, celebrating this International Year of Forests.


Forests are a valuable global resource that act as the lungs of our planet and as such we must do everything in our power to ensure their sustainability. It is very appropriate that this parliament recognises 2011 as the International Year of Forests. The general assembly passed resolution 61/193 to set up this year as International Year of Forests. Part of that resolution called for:


Recognizing that forests and sustainable forest management can contribute significantly to sustainable development, poverty eradication and the achievement of internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals …


It is Millennium Development Goal number 7 that really captures this issue of ensuring environmental sustainability. Target A says sustainable development should be used to reverse loss of environmental resources and, target B, reduction in the loss of biodiversity. I do not think you can just look at one Millennium Development Goal on its own. You need to link it in to the other Millennium Development Goals, such as those on poverty, health, and child and maternal health. All those goals come together, and this is a very important part of them. The overharvesting of forests and the illegal use of forest products cannot be separated from the poverty that exists worldwide. As such, I think it is very important to remember the connection that is being made in this International Year of Forests with Millennium Development Goals.


In Australia, forests and forest issues have always been very important. I am sure that other members have been contacted through widespread email campaigns in recent times about the historic agreement reached in Tasmania between logging industries and environmental groups. I think we should do everything in our power to see that we put in place sustainable forestry plans and that all groups work together. The Gillard government has taken some very positive steps in relation to forests. One of them, which I think links very nicely to the Millennium Development Goals, is the ban on the import of illegal forestry products. Taking away the market for these products ensures—or works towards—preventing those forests from being harvested in an illegal fashion.


There are no forests in the Shortland electorate. It is a coastal electorate, as you, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker Murphy, would know. It is an electorate in which the people are most concerned about ensuring the sustainability of forests, not only in our country but worldwide. There is nothing I find more enjoyable than spending time in a magnificent forest with those majestic trees. It links you into feeling how everything in our environment comes together. I think we should do everything in our power to ensure that forests are protected.


The other issue that has been raised by a number of speakers is the role forests play in the reduction of carbon in our atmosphere. (Time expired)

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2011-07-04,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (11:37):  This year marks the year of the forests. Forests are an integral part of human and animal survival. Through the management and sustainability of forests in the past few years there has been a great rebirth of endangered species. The theme 'Forests for People' celebrates the central role of people in the sustainable management, conservation and sustainable development of the world's forests. The theme revolves around the multiple values of forests and the need for a 360-degree perspective. Forests provide shelter to people and habitat to biodiversity. They are a source of food, medicine and clean water and play a vital role in maintaining a stable global climate and environment. All these elements taken together reinforce the message that forests are vital to the survival and wellbeing of people everywhere. Forests provide welfare for living. They also provide welfare for survival.


Tumbarumba is in my electorate of the Riverina. Its major industry is softwood timber processing at the Hyne and Son timber mill, which is also the town's biggest employer. The Tumbarumba mill has been in operation since the 1970s, during which time it has undergone a number of upgrades to increase capacity and to take advantage of advances in technology. In 2001 Hyne and Son took over from Boral Limited and successfully upgraded in 2003-04 with the latest North American equipment and technology to ultimately process 900,000 cubic metres of radiata sawlogs per annum. Since the revamp, Tumbarumba's timber industry has thrived, with Hyne and Son employing more than 250 people within the Tumbarumba area. Since the rebuild, which cost approximately $120 million, the mill is the largest softwood processing mill in the Southern Hemisphere, and we are very proud of that in the Riverina. Hyne Timber is a privately owned timber-processing organisation where, as I say, more than 250 people are employed in management, administration and a broad range of activities required in the processing of timber—and that is not to mention the indirect jobs of truck drivers and in all sorts of other industries and occupations within the area.


Hyne Timber does a lot for the community of Tumbarumba. As well as being the largest employer, it provides a huge amount of support for the area. In 2004 the Hyne Community Trust Foundation in Tumbarumba was established for the community, and every second year, with the help of Tumbarumba Rotary, Hyne Timber sends a select group from the local year 11 and 12 high school to participate in the Kokoda trek. Hyne Timber is also a major sponsor for community events in and around the area, such as the Tumbafest and the Carcoola childcare art show.


We heard this morning from the shadow minister for climate action, environment and heritage, the member for Flinders, arguing that there is a better way to preserve forests as well as to protect the environment and to have a sustainable future. A global rainforest recovery program is possible, feasible and, under a coalition in government, would be a very real and positive policy. Forestry is not a dirty word. It worries me that a green legacy that we all want and need could go too far, especially with today's change in the Senate, leaving a black mark on sustainable forestry, an ecologically responsible future and the wellbeing of communities.


As New South Wales Premier, Bob Carr purchased Yanga Station near Balranald for $35 million and turned it into national park, promising a tourism bonanza. Mr Carr pressured Premier Nathan Rees to declare Riverina red gum forests as national parks even before the Rees-commissioned Natural Resources Commission report was completed. In an email campaign with activist organisation GetUp!, Mr Carr said more jobs would be created in the new national parks than lost from the timber industry—and we all know that that just has not transpired.


When Yanga Station was bought by the Carr government in 2005 and turned into a national park, communities were promised that the influx of 50,000 extra tourists would more than make up for jobs lost on the station and in the timber industry—and it is a whole load of rot. The same was said by the Rees government when the Riverina red gum forests were declared national parks in 2010. There was community scepticism that enough tourists would ever arrive to offset the closure of the timber industry, which just did not happen. Bob Carr made similar promises when he proclaimed a national park at Coolah, stating that 30,000 tourists a year would visit. Fifteen years later the major change at Coolah is the number of closed businesses.



Six years on from Yanga being turned into a national park and one year on from the Millewa Forest being declared as national park, all the evidence suggests that rural communities have once again been sold down the river with empty promises. (Time expired)

"Pyne, Christopher, MP",LP,2011-07-04,"



Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Manager of Opposition Business) (16:00):  I rise to speak on the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2011, which seeks to amend the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 to extend the existing funding arrangements, including indexation arrangements, for the 2013 calendar year. Initiatives included are the Indigenous Youth Mobility Program and the Sporting Chance Program. A similar bill entitled the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Bill 2010 was debated and passed last year and assented to on 29 June 2010. The bill provided a 12-month extension to program funding in order to align the funding with other school program funding periods.


The Sporting Chance Program and the Indigenous Youth Mobility Program are two initiatives of the previous coalition government that have been continued by the Labor government. Both programs have achieved success in both retaining students in school and increasing their participation and success rates. But Labor have not committed to long-term funding for these initiatives. Instead they have simply provided a 12-month extension in the last two budgets. This extension is described as being necessary to allow for the completion and release of the review of funding for schooling report at the end of 2011. By the government's own admission, the review is focused on the mainstream but there may be some implications for the design and operation of programs that run under the IE(TA) Act.


Longer term funding and therefore future planning for successful programs is now being held hostage to the Labor government's endless reviews. While the coalition have committed to considering the findings of the review of schools funding, chaired by David Gonski, there seems little reason why these programs should be extended for just one year rather than a longer period of time. One of the greatest complaints from service providers who deliver these programs on the ground is about the seemingly endless stop-and-start cycle of the funding commitments made by governments. The coalition understands the uncertainty created by such endless short-term commitments that are subject to review. However, the coalition will support the bill as drafted, as we recognise the value of these programs.


Sporting Chance is designed to use sport and recreation as a vehicle to engage Indigenous young people in their schooling. It consists of two elements: school based sports academies for secondary school students and education and engagement strategies for both primary and secondary school students. Indigenous secondary school students both male and female enrolled in a secondary school, particularly those deemed at risk, are eligible to participate in an academy. 'At risk' is assumed but is not limited to students who have been identified as having low attendance rates at school, literacy and numeracy skills below that of their fellow students or the national benchmarks, increased likelihood of not completing school or other social or behavioural concerns.


These projects utilise sport and recreation as a vehicle to increase the level of engagement of students, to improve their educational outcomes. It is important to note the development of sporting talents and participation in sport are subsidiary outcomes to the greater educational purpose of the program. According to the latest advice from the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations, in 2011 a total of 22 providers are to deliver 68 projects under the Sporting Chance Program. This is intended to benefit 11,000 primary and secondary school students at risk of not completing their schooling. I also note that the Australian Council for Educational Research will undertake an evaluation of the Sporting Chance Program. The evaluation, to be completed by mid-2011, is expected to measure the extent to which the Sporting Chance Program is meeting its objectives. It will be crucial in shaping the future direction of the program.


This bill will also provide funding for the Indigenous Youth Mobility Program to continue. This program supports Indigenous youth who wish to move away from home to gain qualifications that will increase their chance of obtaining employment in their community or elsewhere. It has been mainly targeted at youth between the ages of 16 and 24 from remote areas, but it is also available to other students from larger towns and cities if they relocate to an IYMP host location to take up an apprenticeship, a VET certificate or university course. The objectives of the IYMP are ambitious. The funding supports 324 Indigenous youth and young people at any point in time undertaking an Australian apprenticeship, a vocational education and training course or study at university. This funding goes a long way to give these young students access to safe, supported and culturally appropriate accommodation while they are studying. The key principle of the IYMP is to provide choice for Indigenous young people and their families.


For many Indigenous Australians, especially those in remote communities, life chances can be severely limited by a lack of opportunity, both in education and in employment. This program is vital as it seeks to redress that opportunity gap, at least in part, by providing access to a full range of post-secondary education and training options that smaller communities are simply not able to provide. IYMP also provides mentoring and other practical support to help these young people while they complete their qualifications. IYMP helps build numeracy, literacy, financial literacy and other life skills of young Indigenous people. The program is also helping remote community capacity building by providing opportunities for those communities' young people to train for and return to jobs that have often previously been taken up in Indigenous communities by non-Indigenous people.


While on the subject of initiatives, I would now like to turn to some other issues that seek to lift education attainment and participation for Indigenous students. A recent report produced by the Council of Australian Governments Reform Council on Labor's National Indigenous Reform Agreement with the states and territories demonstrates there has been little improvement in lifting Indigenous children's reading, writing and numeracy skills. This is despite the government's promise that it would halve the gap within a decade shortly after coming into office. Results indicate that despite significant investment under this partnership, there was only a minor improvement between Indigenous and non-Indigenous students at or above the national minimum standard in reading and writing and, to a lesser extent, in numeracy in the early years of schooling. Nationally the gap has increased in year 9 reading, in years 3 and 7 numeracy and in year 9 writing. Equally disappointing is that there has been no improvement in Indigenous students' attendance rates in year 10 in government schools since Labor came into office, despite having promised to halve the gap for Indigenous students in year 12 attainment or equivalent attainment by 2020.


Perhaps what is most concerning is that the government are unable to report on how they are meeting the target to ensure all Indigenous four year olds in remote communities have access to early childhood education within five years, with the report stating:


There is currently no source for nationally comparable data on Indigenous participation in early childhood education. 


Labor are also unable to report progress on their target to halve the gap in employment outcomes between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians within a decade. The report concluded:


No … data are available to measure the employment to population ratio for this target.


For the millions of taxpayers' dollars spent to deliver programs under this agreement, the government, at the very least, should be able to report on whether these programs are delivering. Approximately $723 million worth of measures have been set aside under the national partnership agreement to pursue reforms to improve young people's education attainment and transition from school and contribute towards achieving the COAG targets. Yet, this funding is being spent without adequately monitoring performance.


The recent report on the National Partnership for Indigenous Reform Agreement comes on top of damning COAG reports that were released in April for the $540 million National Partnership Agreement on Literacy and Numeracy. The April report for the National Partnership Agreement on Literacy and Numeracy found that assessing progress in lifting literacy and numeracy across Australia was difficult because the states and territories set their own benchmarks. This means that because there are so many differences in the numbers and types of schools involved, the report concluded that the transparency of reporting at a national level is questionable. The report urgently recommended that Labor improve clarity and transparency in reporting arrangements of the initiative. If the government cannot adequately measure and track progress under their national partnership agreements, it begs the question: how do they think they can get away with making grand statements they are transforming education if the evidence or data is not available to support these claims? Under Labor's national partnership agreement for the Building the Education Revolution program for government schools, they also failed to monitor the performance by the states and territories, and it was found that billions of dollars had been wasted under inefficient procurement arrangements. There is little hope of Labor delivering on its commitment to improve literacy and numeracy unless drastic changes are made to adequately monitor its investment. Sadly, Labor abolished the former coalition government's program to improve literacy and numeracy, which was to provide a $700 voucher for tutoring to help students who were not meeting minimum benchmarks. This policy was found to be 97 per cent effective in lifting student performance. Improving Indigenous participation and attainment in education and assisting students who are struggling to meet literacy and numeracy benchmarks is simply too important for funding to be handed over to the states and territories without ensuring that a system is put in place to monitor the return on this investment.


The computers-in-schools program, another initiative being delivered under the National Partnership Agreement with the states and territories, is also in strife. More than 3½ years, or seven school semesters, after Kevin Rudd made his election commitment that all these computers would be connected to fast 100-megabitts-per-second fibre, not a single computer has been connected by the government to 100-megabits-per-second fibre. As at 31 March 2011, only 434,000 computers had been delivered out of the 788,000 new computers needed to achieve the promised one-for-one ratio of computers per student. That is only 55 per cent of the computers needed to reach the goal of every secondary school student in years 9 to 12 having a computer, and it took the government three years to get there. Now the government claims that in nine months it will deliver the remaining 45 per cent of the computers. Having delivered 55 per cent in three years, it now claims it will deliver the remaining 45 per cent in nine months. It will need to more than double the current rollout in order to meet the deadline of 31 December 2011—and I think we all know that is a chimerical claim on the government's part.


I read an article by Noel Pearson last month in the Australian in which he agreed that the computers-in-schools program has been poorly implemented. He was writing about the success of the student education trust scheme operated by the Cairns based welfare reform organisation that he works with at Cape York Partnerships. Special trust accounts operate in welfare reform communities on Cape York Peninsula. Payments into these accounts are made by families on a voluntary basis and set aside specifically for education. A trustee oversees the accounts, and there is a process for families to use their saved funds to pay for computers, books, uniforms, excursions and other education expenses. He made the following observation:


Kevin Rudd's ""toolbox of the future"" program has been beset with problems. The opposition highlighted controversies about whether parents were going to be levied by schools to pay for maintenance and whether students could take computers home.


He went on:


This program was poorly conceived. The goal of comprehensive computer access for high school students was right, but it should have been done on a matching subsidy basis. Families should have been required to put in some of their money and be responsible for maintenance costs. They could then own the computer and the kids could take them home. Income-earning families could have been subsidised through a rebate and welfare families could have been assisted through SET-style facilities.


SET-style facilities could form the basis for solutions to school uniforms and other costs that another federal program is aimed at. Instead, all these programs have been conceived on the basis of a 100 per cent handout.


Noel has made the very valid point regarding computers in schools—one that the opposition has been making for such a long time—that when a program suffers from continuing cost blow-outs and is underperforming, one has to ask the question of whether there is a better way to meet the policy objectives.


I would also like to touch on another matter that has been brought to my attention as I continue to undertake my consultations with the various parts of the education sector. It is a program called MULTILIT, designed by Professor Kevin Wheldall at Macquarie University and delivered by the Exodus Foundation's Reverend Bill Crews. I met with the Exodus Foundation to talk about this program. It is used in tutorial centres for disadvantaged students at risk of dropping out of school. It is a direct, systematic teaching of the sounds of the English language and, importantly, has been a tremendous success wherever it has been used, particularly in Indigenous communities. It opened in 2009 for fewer than 200 struggling Indigenous students and has received partial funding under some of Labor's national partnerships in some states. A recent article in the Herald Sun reported on some of the results under this program in Darwin. The article included references to a report from the Exodus Foundation that tracked the progress of six Indigenous children at the Holy Spirit Catholic primary school, one of four Exodus centres in Darwin, in the 2008 to 2010 NAPLAN tests. To quote from the Herald Sun article:


In writing, for instance, in the 2008 NAPLAN test the group started in Year 3 right on the NT mean (or average) of 338, a full 70 points below the national mean. Then the NT and Exodus progress lines diverged as the Exodus children gobbled up the phonics program in 2009 and learned to read.


By Year 5 they had literally closed the gap, reaching the Australian average for their age group. It was the same story with reading.


Yet Multilit is struggling to attract extra funding to grow. The Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, the member for Kingsford Smith, has said that, due to budget constraints, there is no funding to expand the initiative. One of my primary concerns with the national partnership agreements is that programs that have the potential to be delivered and rolled out at a national level are constrained by the varying commitments made at the state level. There is no room for successful programs such as Multilit to flourish and grow. I am fortunate to be visiting the Cape York Peninsula in October this year, where Multilit also operates, and I am hoping that I get to see firsthand how this program works and how the results are yielded.


There is much more that I could speak about today on the topic of Indigenous education. Both sides of this House, I know, genuinely recognise the need to improve education outcomes and opportunities for young Indigenous people. The challenge is to do all that can be done to improve the current education reforms and the benefits that come from them. When a program such as Multilit has proven itself to be able to educate Indigenous young Australians to flourish and grow in national literacy and numeracy, it is a program that should be supported by government rather than starved of funds. I am certainly looking forward to hearing what David Gonski suggests in this area when his review of school funding is handed to the government. I hope that he will recognise, as the opposition has, the importance of programs like Multilit and the ability of local communities like those in Cape York and the programs run by the Exodus Foundation to actually address the real needs of Indigenous children on the ground, rather than assuming that all children will fit into a one-size-fits-all approach. With that, I commend the bill to the House.

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2011</title>,BILLS,24,1
"Neumann, Shayne, MP",ALP,2011-07-04,"



Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (16:17):  I speak in support of the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2011. Nothing defines the difference between the coalition and Labor more than their approaches to education. We have doubled the funding for education in this four-year period, while those opposite failed in this regard for so long. We have Closing the Gap targets in relation to Indigenous education, and we have an aspiration that, by 2018, another 100,000 Indigenous young people and older people will be in employment. We know that Treasury says that in the next two years we will need another 500,000 jobs in the Australian economy to keep our economy strong, to sustain the growth, to keep the employment going and to make sure our prosperity into the future matches what has happened in the past. Those opposite did not just disinvest in health, neglect infrastructure and fail in health and hospital outcomes but they also failed so much in terms of education and Indigenous issues. It was not just that they did not say sorry; they did not put the money towards Indigenous targets and programs. The commitment that we have is to close the gap, not just in jobs and health but in education as well. 


We are delivering real and measurable outcomes in this regard. We have supported 168 Indigenous businesses or community projects Australia wide and achieved over 43,000 job or training placements for Indigenous Australians. We have a commitment under our Indigenous Employment Program of $650 million to support businesses and community projects to make sure Indigenous job seekers get work. The precursor to getting a job is a good education, so it is absolutely vital that we do this. I have seen this locally in my electorate and I have seen it across my home state of Queensland. We are supporting Indigenous students from remote areas to access places in very high-performing schools such as Ipswich Grammar School and Ipswich Girls Grammar School. I have spoken to a number of the Indigenous students from places in Far North Queensland who are boarding at the grammar schools, where they are getting the best quality education possible in very high-performing schools. In particular, we are providing $20 million to the Australian Indigenous Education Fund, run by a private group of business people who want to make a difference in the lives of young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. By the way, they are committed to matching the government's contribution by raising another $20 million through business. Over the next 10 years this fund, of $40 million, will send 2,000 talented, young Indigenous students to very high-performing secondary schools, many of them in the Blair electorate—great schools such as Ipswich Grammar School and Ipswich Girls Grammar School.


The legislation that is before the chamber today amends the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act to extend the current quadrennium to incorporate the 2013 calendar year. It is about amending the appropriation of that legislation to formalise previous decisions the government has made, including, as I said, an election commitment to increase support for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students from remote communities to access schools both in my electorate and across the country.


This amending legislation will provide certainty until the government has had the opportunity to look at, consider and act upon the finding, due in 2011, by Professor Gonski, of the review of funding for schooling. We want to determine the funding. Hopefully, we will make some significant changes, because everyone who works in the sector knows that the SES model has not delivered the most just and fair outcome possible. Recently, I was in Ipswich speaking to some members from the Independent Education Union. They know that in private schools in my electorate the best outcomes have not been achieved. Recently, I was speaking to a number of public school teachers in my electorate—who were attending a Queensland Teachers Union conference there—from schools such as Minden State School, Ipswich Special School and Ipswich West Special School to find out what they thought. The legislation before us is about extending the funding until such time as the decision of the Gonski review is handed down and we can then act upon it.


I cannot let the member for Sturt get by without saying something about what he said in relation to some of their funding. There is a huge difference between us and them in terms of education. I accept that there is a bipartisan commitment to the targets with respect to closing the gap—halving the gap in reading, writing and numeracy achievements for Indigenous children within a decade and halving the gap for Indigenous students in year 12 attainment, or equivalent attainment, by 2020. I accept that those opposite have said that they want to agree to this. How we get there is another story. Those opposite do not think we are doing the right thing in that regard. We are backing up our commitment to closing the gap by not just putting initiatives or programs in place but also actually backing up with real money, real dollars. Yet those opposite seem to whinge, carry on and carp at education programs that we have brought in, when they know very well from visiting schools in their electorate that they are happy.


The member for Sturt waxed on about our computers in schools program, saying, 'You've only delivered 434,000 computers in local schools.' Go to schools like Bundamba State Secondary College, which has a very high number of Indigenous students and tell the students and the school administration that the computers in schools program is not successful and not good for their school. Go and tell them that. Go to Bremer State High School, which has a very high component of Indigenous students. Currently, that school has about 1,500 students. Next year, there will be 1,600 students.  Go and tell them that that program is not appropriate and it is not good for their education outcome. 


The other side went to an election last year proposing to abolish the computers in schools program and the trade training centres. All the time they claim that they are going to achieve good outcomes for education should they get on the treasury bench, but they are always critical of what we are doing. In this budget and in previous budgets and through this legislation here, we are benefiting not just non-Indigenous students but Indigenous students through things such as trade training centres. The Ipswich Trade Training Centre has both the Ipswich Girls Grammar School and the Ipswich Grammar School, where those Indigenous students are boarding under the programs covered by the legislation here. They attend the Ipswich Trade Training Centre, located at St Edmund's College, a Catholic school. There is a partnership of three schools. The Indigenous students boarding at those schools enjoy the benefit of the Ipswich Trade Training Centre.


And we have another one coming to my electorate: the Ipswich region trade training centre. It is going to be located at the Ipswich State High School, another school with a very high number of Indigenous students. Again they will benefit, not just from the BER program we put in for the Japanese immersion centre we have already located at that school but from the trade training centre. About 40 per cent of the kids who go to Ipswich State High School end up with trades. There are so many Indigenous students at that school. You only have to go to the assembly to realise that. But those opposite continue to oppose these initiatives, all of which would help not just non-Indigenous students but Indigenous students in my electorate.


And then we get to the BER funding—the multipurpose halls and libraries, all of which help non-Indigenous students and Indigenous students. The Ipswich-Logan corridor in South-East Queensland—I represent most of Ipswich—has a very high number of Indigenous students in its schools and Indigenous people in the local community, the jobs and the businesses across the area. Kambu Medical Centre, in my area, has a huge number of patients. It is a great Indigenous medical centre, well funded by the federal and state governments. I was there just last week talking about it.


It is not just in health and not just in jobs but in education that we are benefiting Indigenous students. The initiatives here are very important because the legislation talks about school programs, early childhood programs, vocational education programs and tertiary programs. The background to this legislation in terms of the programs is extremely important. The member for Sturt was talking about a number of programs which are important, and I think it is worth mentioning them as well. They are really important programs under this legislation. Being funded are things like the Indigenous education consultative bodies and the Indigenous Youth Leadership Program, which funds scholarships, boarding, tuition, leadership development and other educational costs for selected secondary and tertiary students aged to 25 attending participating schools—such as Ipswich Girls Grammar School and Ipswich Grammar School—and universities. Most of those young people in Ipswich come, as I said, from Far North Queensland. The Indigenous Youth Mobility Program assists young people with accommodation and other support to facilitate their take-up of apprenticeships, VET or university in 16 major centres nationally. You can see the benefit of those sorts of programs in South-East Queensland, with great TAFE institutions like the Bremer Institute of TAFE, located in the western corridor from Brisbane through to Ipswich as well. The objective of the Sporting Chance Program is to encourage improved educational outcomes for Indigenous students, boys and girls, using sport and recreation. That is so important.


Just a couple of weeks ago, we handed down the report Doing time—time for doing: Indigenous youth in the criminal justice system in the House of Representatives. As chair of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs I know we saw the value as we went around the countryside. There were 110 submissions and about 18 public hearings, including a roundtable at Redfern. We saw the benefit of Indigenous sporting programs. We saw the benefit of schools connecting to local Indigenous communities. We saw the benefit of mentors. We saw the benefit of real recognition of Aboriginal communities, the importance of cultural awareness and the importance of Indigenous language.


Programs such as these on the ground can make a difference in the lives of young people, making sure that they stay at school, do not engage in truancy and get an education. Getting an education is not just important to break the intergenerational cycle of poverty, violence, domestic abuse and incarceration but important for financial security as well. This legislation is really important because it is—




Mr Wyatt:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, under standing order 66A, I want to acknowledge the comments that the member is making. Can I ask him what the educational attainment levels are, what the outcomes are and what the employment opportunities are, given what he has been expanding upon?




Mr NEUMANN:
  No, I do not have to take the question.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms Vamvakinou
):

Correct.




Mr NEUMANN:
  Why doesn't he put that on notice if he is happy to do so. If I am making a speech—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Thank you. The member for Blair will continue.




Mr NEUMANN:
  If the member wants to put that question to the minister, he may do so—or ask a more important, relevant and sensible question than he asked in question time today. As to this particular legislation, I think it is important to note that what we have said in relation to the Gonski review, and what we have said to Indigenous students and to the private school community and the public school community, is that we in this government believe strongly that the arguments in relation to private versus public education are well and truly gone. We believe that parents have the right to send their children to whatever school they want and that kids have the right to go to a good public school as well. The public school system is the backbone of education. That is why so many students go to a state school, as we call them in Queensland, at primary school level, often then going on to schools such as St Edmund's College or Ipswich Grammar School or Ipswich Girls' Grammar School for seniors. But it is really important to make sure that we fund the system appropriately and well.


I have said before that this legislation gets us through to looking at the review and deciding how we are going to take funding in the future. But, as I have also said before, the previous government put in about $32.9 billion over the previous four years of their government. That was their commitment. That sounds like a lot of money, but we made a greater commitment to education: we put in $64.9 billion in funding for government and non-government schools over 2009 to 2012.


That is very important. There are also the national partnerships which assist not just Indigenous but also non-Indigenous students. We can see that. I was recently at Leichardt State School, a school in what we used to call a working-class area in my electorate, rebuilt through the State Schools of Tomorrow program and the state government's work in that school, and rebuilt, through the BER funding, with a new multipurpose hall and new library—a national partnership school which has made a huge difference. If you go there you will see that the connectivity between the local Indigenous community and the school is very strong—really strong. Lee Gerchow, the principal, is doing a fantastic job. And that is the difference that good funding for Indigenous students and non-Indigenous students can make in an area where there is a high Indigenous population. You can see that. We have seen the NAPLAN results. We have seen the improvements in attendance at that school. We have seen the improvements in literacy and numeracy. I support this legislation because it will make a big difference in the lives of the schools in my community. (Time expired)

"Andrews, Kevin, MP",LP,2011-07-04,"



Mr ANDREWS
 (Menzies) (16:32):  I also rise to speak on the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2011. At the outset, may I comment on the question asked by my friend the member for Hasluck because it goes to the core of the issue, and that is: what are the educational outcomes that are being achieved by Indigenous children? That is a question which should be answered. It is at the core, as I said, of this and other legislation and programs. When millions and millions of dollars are spent on programs but they are not raising the educational outcomes for Indigenous children then questions should be raised about the programs upon which that money is being spent. That is not because there is any sense that it is inappropriate to spend the money; of course it is appropriate to spend money. But one must also ask whether or not the outcomes are being achieved, because, if they are not, then maybe there are other ways of spending money that will achieve the outcomes.


This bill amends the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 to extend the existing funding arrangements, including indexation arrangements for the 2013 calendar year. Initiatives included are the Indigenous Youth Mobility Program and the Sporting Chance Program. After passing through the parliament, a similar bill, entitled Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2010, received assent on 29 June 2010. That bill provided a 12-month extension to program funding in order to align the funding with other school program funding periods.


Sporting Chance and the Indigenous Youth Mobility Program are two initiatives of the previous coalition government that have been continued by the Rudd-Gillard Labor government. Both programs have achieved success in retaining students at schools as well as increasing their participation and success rates. The Gillard Labor government have not committed to long-term funding for these initiatives. Instead, they have simply provided a 12-month extension in the last two budgets.


The Sporting Chance Program commenced in 2007 under the then coalition government with the objective of encouraging positive educational outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. In 2011, a total of 22 providers delivered 68 projects under the Sporting Chance Program for up to 11,000 primary and secondary school students at risk of not completing their schooling. The use of sport as a key engagement tool in assisting in the educational development of young Indigenous people has been successful. The Indigenous Youth Mobility Program helps young Indigenous people move away from their home to gain the skills one needs to get a job, whether it is in their community or somewhere else. Youth Indigenous people aged 16 to 24 from remote areas can relocate to a program host location to undertake post-secondary education and training options. Training options include Australian apprenticeships, vocational education and training, and higher education options that lead to qualifications in nursing, teaching, business administration and accounting, to name but a few possibilities.


This extension is described as being necessary to allow for the completion and release of the review of funding for schooling report due sometime in 2011. By the government's own admission, the review is focused on the mainstream but there may be some implications for the design and operation of these programs. Longer term funding, and therefore future planning, for successful programs is now being held hostage to the Gillard Labor government's endless reviews. This is yet another example of the Rudd-Gillard government's approach to policy and law-making: indecision, ineptness, reviews and, of course, short-term fixes. Labor has failed to pay due attention to what is an important issue and failed to provide any long-term commitment to programs that are improving school attendance and completion rates.


The coalition supports this bill. It builds on the good work done by the coalition in introducing programs, but there is a stark difference, I am afraid, between the coalition and the government. We make decisions; we take action. This Labor government is crippled by indecision and inaction.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2011-07-04,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (16:36):  I rise today to speak in support of the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2011. In doing so, I am reminded of some comments I made at a recent event for Mabo Day. In honouring the life of Eddie Mabo, I stated that this country had come a long way in achieving a true reconciliation between Indigenous and white Australia.


It was a proud day for me as a citizen of this country to watch the former Prime Minister make a historic apology to Australia's Indigenous peoples. However, an apology alone is not enough. While important in acknowledging past wrongdoings and hurt, an apology cannot fix today's problems. If we are to achieve a true reconciliation, we must bridge the gap in health, education, jobs and opportunities that exists between Indigenous Australians and non-Indigenous Australians. In the 21st century we should not accept that Aboriginal children have lower life expectancies than their non-Aboriginal peers. We should not accept that they do not have the same outcomes in education. We should not accept that they do not have the same meaningful opportunities for work. Most importantly, we should not accept that it is beyond the people in this place to fix this problem, to ensure that there is no difference between opportunities for all of Australia's children. We have to work hard as a nation to bridge the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. We have to work hard to deliver the same opportunities to all Australians regardless of their background. I believe that to do otherwise would be a serious failure of government, a serious failure of parliament and a serious failure of each member of this House.


For this reason, I am very pleased to be able to speak this afternoon on this bill and on what this government is doing to support Indigenous education. I have said many times in this House that education through all levels of life is a silver bullet to solving poverty, improving health outcomes and increasing employment and productivity. I am very pleased to be in this place and to be part of a government that has education at its core—to be part of a government that understands the great transformative power of education to build confidence, to create opportunities and to deliver happiness and hope to so many Australians, not least of which are Indigenous Australians. Given that the government have an education reform agenda, it should come as no surprise to any member of this House that our approach to closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous includes comprehensive policies designed to support the education of young Indigenous people. This bill provides a raft of programs to encourage and enhance the educational outcomes of students. In my electorate there are a number of programs that are helping Indigenous families and students get the education that is their right as Australians. The federal government has provided as part of the Parent and Community Engagement Program almost $360,000 for the Northside Community Service's Tuck-In education program that encourages parents to play an active role in their child's learning. It also strengthens the community's capacity to involve themselves in the school community.


Similarly, over $70,000 was provided to the Tuggeranong Child and Family Centre for its Our Mob Tuggeranong project that builds the knowledge of Indigenous parents, grandparents, family members and carers so they can engage with confidence and effectiveness with their school communities. There is also half a million dollars for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community literacy project. The project aims to improve the literacy skills of at-risk Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students in years 6 to 9.


Finally, 68 of 72 Canberra schools are members of the Dare to Lead program, a $13.6 million program that provides principals and other school leaders with local school situation strategies that promote awareness and provide the drive to address educational outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. Through professional development and cultural awareness activities, workshops and seminars, principals and school leadership teams are able to enhance their understanding of the educational needs of these students and to promote reconciliation in all schools.


These are four local Canberra projects but they exemplify what this act is doing nationwide. In highlighting these examples, I want to pay tribute to the teachers and the schools, to the doctors and nurses, to the community groups and to the Indigenous community themselves who are responsible for the ongoing success of these programs. While it is our responsibility in this House to provide the leadership and funding that allows these successful programs to continue, we should not forget that it is these individuals who are responsible for delivering the success of these programs on the ground day in, day out. It is these dedicated individuals and organisations that are making the changes that must be made person by person, family by family, community by community.


In my electorate, I have seen firsthand the work of dedicated teachers at Richardson Primary School and their commitment to Indigenous education. I have seen the fantastic work of the Winnunga aboriginal health service down in Narrabundah and its dedicated staff who provide a raft of initiatives and programs for people in dental health, diabetes health, infant welfare health, maternal health—a range of programs there; just a phenomenal organisation. It is through the work of these individuals passionate about the cause and committed to the very end that the gap will be bridged, and we must do what we can to support their efforts.


In this light, the amendment before this House today extends the funding for the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 to incorporate the 2013 calendar year to line up with the Schools Assistance Act 2008, also recently extended, and timing of the review of funding for schooling. It will appropriate $159 million for 2013 to continue to fund those programs I have mentioned. The government does this to give sufficient time to consider any recommendations from the review of education funding while also ensuring that adequate and appropriate consultation is given to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and organisations. This is appropriate as nowhere is there a greater need to improve education than for our Indigenous communities.


I acknowledge that much has been achieved and there have been real successes in this area; nevertheless there is much more that still needs to be done. This will require an ongoing commitment from government across Australia, and I believe that this government has that commitment. This is a government that has the drive and the will to see this through to make policies that close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. In my own life a good education changed what was possible for me, and I believe the same is very much true for ensuring what is possible for Indigenous Australians: it is the great enabler. In speaking on another bill in this place, I said that I would always stand up here in support of those bills that seek to enhance the access and outcomes of education for all Australians. I do so again today and I commend this bill to the House.

"Randall, Don, MP",LP,2011-07-04,"



Mr RANDALL
 (Canning) (16:44):  I am pleased to speak on the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2011. This bill seeks to amend the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000. The bill seeks to extend the funding arrangements, including indexation arrangements, for the 2013 calendar year for non-Abstudy payments. Non-Abstudy payments include funding for a number of Indigenous school programs, including the Indigenous Youth Mobility Program and the Sporting Chance Program, which I want to talk about mostly because I am sure everyone else has covered every other aspect.


I support his bill but I have a number of concerns. The current bill seeks to extend the current funding arrangements only for another 12 months out, for the 2013 calendar year. The Labor government has failed to provide funding security for this education sector and instead has simply provided for 12-month extensions in the last two budgets. Extensions are no good. Ongoing funding in the forward estimates is what is really needed. The government claims that a short-term, 12-month commitment is necessary because of the Review of Funding for Schooling report, which is due some time later this year. The binding up of legislation through inquiry after inquiry and review after review is just typical of this current Labor government, which cannot make effective and timely decisions. This is seen in everything they do.


Thankfully the Labor government was wise enough to continue two important programs originally initiated by the coalition government. They are the Sporting Chance and Indigenous Youth Mobility programs. I could say much about these and talk about the fact that the Indigenous education programs are something that all governments commit to, and some eventually get somewhere towards their commitments.


The program I mainly want to talk about, Sporting Chance, has been a most successful program for Indigenous boys. The program was originally begun by Gerard Neesham of the Clontarf Football Academy. For those who are not aware, I will give a brief history. Clontarf is a former Christian Brothers school on banks of the river in Perth. It fell on hard times and then, in 2000, with a group of just 25 boys Gerard Neesham went there with a number of other school teachers who had decided to do something for Indigenous boys. For those who do not know Gerard Neesham, he was a very good AFL player who played for the Sydney Swans, amongst others. He also played football for Graylands Teachers College, where I knew him. He and I played together on that side. I think he made me look good! Eventually Gerard was the inaugural coach for the Fremantle Dockers. So his football pedigree is unbelievable. His whole family, the Neeshams, the Regans and the Millers are legendary in that area.


For Gerard to begin this, post his Dockers coaching, was something quite admirable. That is when I reconnected with him, after teachers college. With the support of the federal and state governments and the private sector the group of 25 boys grew into 400 boys in six academies. I first met Gerard out there under the ATSIC days when Philip Ruddock went out there to help him get money he was owed by ATSIC—$30,000, which was not much at the time. He then came to Canberra with Ross Kelly, the chairman of the Clontarf Foundation and put a case to the then education minister and, interestingly, his staff member Alan Tudge, who is now the member for Aston, came up with $100,000, which was just fantastic. Gerard then got bogged and came back with Ross Kelly again and asked for $1 million to continue his program. Gerard got this, on behalf of the foundation, through Dr Nelson.


I said to Gerard at the time, 'Be careful whatever you do. Once you start rolling out away from one academy you will lose control of the levers. You need to be hands-on yourself.' I was wrong because Gerard was able to roll out a number of academies in Western Australia by using ex-AFL footballers and people in the AFL and football industry who were very good at what they did. So, his selection of personnel has been the secret to his ability to run academies. The other part of his successful template is that he attaches himself to existing schools. For example, I went to the Broome High School when he launched a program there. I was representing Julie Bishop at the time, the federal minister. State members of parliament also attended, as well as Michael Chaney from the NAB and a representative of Goldman Sachs, who were there to help with private sector funding. This model does not rely on one bucket of money; it relies on money from three sources: federal money, state money and corporate money. This means that it is not dependent on one or the other and that means that should one decide to not deliver then the program would not be left stranded.


Gerard was invited by Clare Martin, the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory at the time, to go into the Northern Territory. Some of the Aboriginal communities there, as we know, had become very dysfunctional. But what Aboriginal boys in particular do know about is AFL football. As Gerard tells me, you can ask any boy anywhere in Australia whether they know who the full forward for St Kilda is or who plays centre for Carlton and they can tell you. They wear their footy jumpers with pride in the heat and in the cold in the outback. AFL is a currency among Indigenous kids.


Why is this template so successful? Because it gets them to school with the hook of playing football. Some of them have gone on to be AFL footballers. There are quite a number who are currently playing AFL who came through the Clontarf academy. But the reality is that very few of them end up in the AFL. They end up playing football, but they go to school. That is the secret of the whole program: they go to school. When they get to school, their health improves. Their dysfunctional behaviour improves. Gerard quotes the figure of how much it costs to keeps a boy at Clontarf against the figure of how much it costs to keep him incarcerated. It is light years away. A program like this sees boys not only improve their health and their behaviour but also get into jobs. Clontarf delivers them not only to year 12 but also into employment and the workforce after year 12.


At the moment, over 80 per cent of Clontarf year 12 students are placed in employment or training within six months of completing school. Of the 160 boys who completed year 12 last year, 75 are currently in employment or further training. This goes on. The fact is that this program is highly effective because it gets the boys to school and gets them into a pattern. They stop sleeping in. They get out of their dysfunctional environment, because they are among peers. And this is where Gerard is also successful: he brings in Aboriginal mentors, particularly from the footballing fraternity, and these kids look up to them. They want to be at school.


Clontarf has a very ambitious program. Dare I say that this transcends both sides. This is not a Liberal Party thing or a Labor Party thing; this is a bipartisan arrangement. I mentioned Julie Bishop and Brendan Nelson. But when the government changed in 2011, Kevin Rudd, in an article from Thursday 11 December 2008—and Kevin loved a photo and next to the article there he is with the Clontarf boys in Perth—promised $10 million. And that was delivered. The state government under Alan Carpenter delivered his moneys, $4 million. The corporate world continues, through BHP and others, with their support.


The only thing that I will say to the members opposite is that the money that comes through the federal government and other governments is always a bit slow, because it is handed out piecemeal. There needs to be an ongoing commitment to the funding of these programs into the future, because their outcomes are so successful.


There have been other instances in which Indigenous people post their football life decide to start up some sort of program for Aboriginal kids. It seldom works. They get themselves a car and an office—in other words, a job—and there is no widespread effect; it is a one-man band. Eventually, once the money has gone, the program goes. This is a program for the future. This is a program, dare I say, is in the business of saving a generation of Aboriginal boys. We almost lost a generation of Aboriginal young men through alcoholism and dysfunction, mainly because, as most people know, they became dependent on welfare and the Centrelink model. This is getting them back into real jobs, getting them away from alcohol, getting them away from dysfunctional behaviour and showing them that there is another way. This does not just apply to football—and I will get onto that in a moment for my learned friend from New South Wales, and demonstrate that this model can be rolled out there. In Western Australia there are 21 academies with 1,335 participants. At one stage, three out of every four boys in year 12 were in the Aboriginal academies doing year 12. It was something that was unheard of—17-year-old Aboriginal boys doing year 12. In the Northern Territory there are currently 15 academies with 1,015 boys. In Victoria there are five academies with 190 boys. There is nothing in Queensland and nothing in South Australia.


The federal government currently contributes one-third of the Clontarf Foundation's operating costs—that is, $5.7 million per annum or $2,244 per participant. There is a way forward, and they want the federal government to continue its commitment. In the 2014-15 forward years they would like to have 28 academies in Western Australia with over 2,000 boys; 19 academies in the Northern Territory, with 1,490 boys; and five academies in Victoria with 550 boys—because there is a low Indigenous population in Victoria.


We know that New South Wales does not have AFL but the template works for football, and a well-known rugby enthusiast and champion, Smiley Johnson, is involved in this program and he is going to be part of the template in New South Wales to roll out this program for rugby for Indigenous boys. They are looking to have 44 of these academies and to include 2,820 boys. There is the same thing with rugby in Queensland. Big news: we have got the State of Origin coming up this Wednesday night and we know how big it is. They are looking to have 30 academies with 1,740 boys. In South Australia they are looking to have eight academies with 400 boys.


So we want to go from 2,500 boys in this current financial year to more than 9,000 boys. To make this happen, the federal government has to commit to an increment of $4 million a year so that they can continue building these academies on a sound footing. If the $4 million is not committed over and above current funding per annum, they cannot do this, because it ratchets up the other help from the state governments. They are obliged to come in with complementary funds, as is the private sector.


This is an outstanding opportunity for us to do something meaningful and real through the sporting champions funding for Indigenous boys. Dare I say it will work for Indigenous girls, with netball and other sports. But, as Gerard says to me, where the boys are the girls will be—and, if you go out to Clontarf, you see that the girls are at school, because the boys are at school. That is how it works.


I would advise those who want to criticise and say, 'This is a private arrangement,' et cetera, that this is audited and all the salaries are benchmarked on tertiary pay scales for principals, teachers et cetera. I implore this House to continue the support for this marvellous program for now and into the future. We know that there are lots of reasons that Aboriginal men go so well in the AFL. They seem to be particularly adept at it. It is a bit like the young men from the Balkans—the Jakoviches et cetera. They seem to have the physical shape to play football. Aboriginal kids from the Tiwi Islands through to Tasmania are really good footballers. The fact that about 2½ per cent of the population are Indigenous and yet more than six per cent of the AFL population are Indigenous says something about the ability of Aboriginal people in this sport. I commend this bill to the House and I implore the government to continue its meaningful and ongoing funding, because the program and the template work.

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2011-07-04,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (16:59):  The 13th of February 2008 was a historic day for Australia. On that day, for the first time, an Australian Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, officially apologised to the stolen generations. This was a historic moment for Australia—a moment when we acknowledged the tragedies of the past and looked with a fresh eye to the future, a future in which there is no gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians in life expectancy, educational achievement or economic opportunity.


When the Labor government took office in 2007, we inherited an appalling legacy of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander inequalities. In the areas of housing, poverty and health, large gaps persisted under the Howard government. We know that Indigenous Australians have a substantially shorter life expectancy. When a young Indigenous baby is born, he or she can expect to live a decade or two fewer than a non-Indigenous baby. It should be simply unacceptable to all of us in this place. It is something that must change—something that will be changed.


Another main issue is improving the educational levels of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. Improving education is fundamental to improving welfare and improving living standards. This government has set out to close the gaps in Indigenous disadvantage. We have set out to close the life expectancy gaps, to close the child mortality gaps, to close the gaps in employment opportunities and to close the gaps in access to early childhood education and educational attainment.


Horace Mann, the early 19th century US congressman and education reformer, whose personal political persuasions were actually more closely akin to those of members opposite, once stated: 


Education … beyond all other devices of human origin, is a great equalizer of conditions of men—the balance wheel of the social machinery.


This Labor government shares those sentiments, regardless of the political alignment of their initial spokesperson. The importance of education extends well beyond partisan politics.


Education's place in helping to overcome inequality and disadvantage was reinforced for me when I visited Cape York last year and earlier this year, travelling with the House Standing Committee on Economics. Our task was to consider Indigenous economic development, so I used the chance to ask some of the witnesses about the local schools. It was an issue that had come up when we were chatting outside during the coffee break but which did not seem to be getting air time inside the room. Phyllis Yunkaporta, a witness appearing before the committee, told me:


The education system, as I knew it before, has been of low standard. The curriculum in the past, as it is in all cape Aboriginal communities, has been of very low standard. By the time our children go out to mainstream schools they are hardly there—a child in grade 8 still has the understanding of a child in grade 1. Speaking for Aurukun, I was one of the persons who were invited to the States last October; I went to New York and Los Angeles visiting African-American schools. What we have brought back to Aurukun is a new kind of teaching method and we are having that implemented in the school. Of course it took time. At the beginning it pretty much had been, in my words, chaos before that. Since having this new program come in, if you come to the classrooms in Aurukun the kids are fully focused. This new method of teaching has got them going. The teacher is full-on with the tasks given and you cannot believe it when you enter those classrooms—it is as if some of those kids are play-acting. They are not; they are just full-on, focused. I guess in time we have to have expectations for our children to be educated in a way where they have to balance both worlds—the Western world and the traditional way. Of course we want them to hang onto the traditional way because that is where they are going to be identifying themselves for the future. And with them having to venture out into mainstream, we want them to compete. It is a competitive world out there. We want our black little kids to start taking on the world. That is the aim of all this.


No words could be closer to the truth. In work that I did as a professor of economics at ANU with Xiaodong Gong, which was published in Education Economics, we looked at the educational attainment gap in Australian schools. We found that when Indigenous children first enter school they are about a year of educational achievement behind their non-Indigenous peers. We also found that by the time Indigenous children have got to the end of primary school the gap has widened—it is then about two years of educational attainment. Our view is that, perversely, that is something to be optimistic about, because there is something going on in the school system—a system which I think government policies are far more amenable to fixing than would have been the case had we discovered that, for example, the gap was already there when the children first entered school. So that work gives me optimism; it gives me a sense that we can do something about closing the gaps between the performance of Indigenous and non-Indigenous children.


But those gaps, make no mistake, are substantial. In 2006, 58 per cent of Indigenous children were rated by their teachers as having low academic performance. In contrast, only 19 per cent of non-Indigenous students were rated as having low academic performance. Of those who started year 11, only 22 per cent of Indigenous students went on to complete the year 12 certificate, compared to 62 per cent of non-Indigenous students. These figures provide some sense of the magnitude of the task faced by this Labor government in addressing the gross inequality in educational attainment in Australia.


Since 2008, the Gillard government has invested over $51 million in Indigenous literacy and numeracy projects. Over 20,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students in over 670 schools across the nation have benefited directly from this assistance. Over the 2009-12 period this government has invested $56.4 million nationally to expand literacy and numeracy programs for Indigenous students. We have provided professional support to assist teachers to develop personalised learning plans for their students. We now have 200 additional teachers in the Northern Territory. The $2½ billion Smarter Schools National Partnerships, which holds Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education as a key focus, has been introduced to target disadvantage and to contribute to improving literacy and numeracy outcomes. We have also approved more than $25 million for 17 projects, over 2011-12, to continue these efforts.


We have seen the early results of such initiatives. The share of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders obtaining year 10 and year 12 certificates has gradually grown, as has the number of Indigenous students undertaking university education and achieving bachelor degrees. It is important that we continue to track these measures and hold our higher education institutions to account to ensure that the educational outcome that we want—boosting bachelor graduation—is actually achieved. It is my view that we should ask universities to publish as much data as they can not only on the number of Indigenous students who are accepted into the institutions but also on the persistence of those students through the system; the ability of our universities to hold on to Indigenous university students at the same rate as they hold on to non-Indigenous university students. Improving the standard of education among Indigenous communities is at the heart of this government's endeavours to affect broad social and cultural change and break the cycle of disadvantage that plagues these communities.


There are three initiatives that I am particularly proud of in my electorate of Fraser—Learning Journeys, the Indigenous Youth Leadership Program and the Indigenous Youth Mobility Program. Learning Journeys, which is administered by the Northside Community Service, is a $359,000 program which started in May 2010 and is expected to finish at the end of June 2012. It focuses on the development and implementation of creative and innovative approaches to improving educational outcomes for young Indigenous people as well as on improving parental engagement in schools and with education providers and on the engagement of parents with children's education at home. The project focuses on motivating and encouraging adults within families to play an active role in their children's learning journey. This is the kind of active role that we know is so important to educational success. It aims to strengthen the capacity of communities to become active in the school community and to feel respected and empowered to comment on and contribute to the development of schools. It has been a little over 12 months since the program's commencement but already we can point towards a number of outcomes: 82 per cent of parents involved have reported a greater engagement with the local schools; 76 per cent of parents have reported increased presence in the local school community; and 58 per cent of parents say they attended extracurricular events at their school. 


The Indigenous Youth Leadership Program likewise is helping to close the gap in Indigenous education disadvantage through support for disadvantaged Indigenous students, mostly from remote and regional areas. There are now six tertiary education students studying in my electorate of Fraser with the support of an Indigenous Youth Leadership Program scholarship. I would like to pay tribute to those students and wish them all the best in their continued studies.


Thirdly, the Indigenous Youth Mobility Program supports young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students aged 16 to 24. This program is administered in the ACT by Auswide Projects, which was originally assisting around 16 participants and due to an increase in demand has now increased its number of places to 24 participants within the ACT.


It is absolutely imperative to the welfare and the quality of life of Indigenous communities that we maintain these efforts. The Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Bill will ensure the government's good work to date will continue. The current Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act provides funding over the 2009-12 period and this bill will extend the current quadrennium to incorporate the 2013 calendar, bringing it into line with the recently extended Schools Assistance Act. This will coincide with the timing of the review of funding for schooling, allowing the government to consider the findings of that report and determine the future structure of funding run under that program.


By re-aligning the legislation to reflect the Schools Assistance Act, we can make sure that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education programs are afforded the attention they deserve. It allows us to engage in close consultation with Indigenous communities and create a cooperative and inclusive learning environment. Such a learning environment has been brought home to me in my own electorate of Fraser, which includes the Jervis Bay Territory. In May I visited Jervis Bay Primary, a school for the children of Defence Force personnel serving at HMAS Creswell and the children of the Wreck Bay Indigenous community. The school has the lowest ICSEA score of any school in my electorate but, when you do a like-schools comparison—as is possible under the government's terrific MySchool website—you actually see that on a like-schools basis Jervis Bay Primary is one of the top performing schools in the ACT system on pretty much every measure you look at.


Jervis Bay Primary is also one of the most beautiful schools in the electorate of Fraser. The oval looks out across the kangaroos to the Pacific Ocean. You get a real sense that this natural environment is part of what builds a strong sense of community in the local school. There are only 84 students, 63 per cent of whom are Indigenous, but everyone seems to know everyone else. As I walked through the K-2 room with two women from the P&C, I heard behind me one of the boys say, 'What are you doing here, Mum?'


I would like to pay tribute to the principal, Bob Pastor, who coordinated a Learning 4 Life meeting, a really valuable initiative which brings together representatives from the local school community as well as Vincentia High School, the main school into which Jervis Bay Primary feeds, the University of Wollongong, Noah's Ark, Booderee National Park, and local preschools and childcare centres. The group promotes the value of education to Indigenous parents and students, with involvement right through the education spectrum from early childhood right up to TAFE and university. It is that lifelong learning philosophy that pervades the bill that is before us today.


The existing range of programs funded under the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act are aimed at improving educational outcomes for Indigenous people, taking a well-rounded approach to improving education outcomes and life opportunities for Indigenous students. The programs are designed to build strong relationships between Indigenous communities—children, parents and teachers—and the government to ensure that specific needs are met with targeted and effective attention. Such programs include the Sporting Chance Program, the Indigenous Youth Leadership Program, the Indigenous Youth Mobility Program, and the Parental and Community Engagement Program. These programs that are delivered under the act are complementary to mainstream schooling activities. The extension of funding for such programs until the end of 2013 will ensure providers, as well as the Indigenous communities, have certainty of continued program operation. I would like to use this opportunity to commend the bill to the House and extend my praise to all those who have worked in its drafting. (Time expired)

"Wyatt, Ken, MP",LP,2011-07-04,"



Mr WYATT
 (Hasluck) (17:14):  I rise today to support the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2011, which extends the funding arrangements for the 2013 calendar year. I do so on the basis of my experience within a raft of key areas—not only my personal experiences over the last 59 years but also my experience of involvement with the Commonwealth Schools Commission when it was in existence, and the structures that sat underneath it; of the National Aboriginal Education Committee; of the period of the AESIP or Aboriginal Education Strategic Initiatives Program, which became IESIP when 'Aboriginal' was changed to 'Indigenous'; and of two MCEETYA taskforces.


'Education is the great engine of personal development. It is through education that the daughter of a peasant can become a doctor, that the son of a mineworker can become the head of a mine, and that the child of a farm worker can become the president of a great nation.' That is a set of words that have always been dear to me because Nelson Mandela goes to the crux of the importance of education in all its facets. The programs that are there to support and make a difference are absolutely critical. So this bill is important.


I also want to commend both the member for Canberra and the member for Fraser—the member for Fraser in particular, for having gone out and sat with people and listened to their views and heard their opinions. That is an important element if we are going to change things. Our destiny is shaped by the choices we make and the decisions each of us enact in our professional, personal and social pathways. What is critical to bringing about success is our individual preparedness to challenge and overcome barriers and to deal with the setbacks to our dreams and aspirations. That is often underpinned by good education. A well-grounded education is fundamental to success, although many have transcended this through personal drive—and all of us have experiences of people who did not finish school but who became highly successful and for whom every interaction with another individual provides an avenue to acquire knowledge, information and experiences that enhance their repertoire of skills.


The preliminaries to the National Indigenous Reform Agreement Intergovernmental Agreement on Federal Financial Relations articulate the challenge for all Australian governments:


Despite the concerted efforts of successive Commonwealth, State and Territory governments to address Indigenous disadvantage, there have been only modest improvements in outcomes in some areas such as education and health, with other areas either remaining static or worsening. Even in those areas where there have been improvements, the outcomes for Indigenous Australians remain far short of the outcomes for non-Indigenous Australians.


In December 2007, the Council of Australian Governments, or COAG, agreed to the National Indigenous Reform Agreement partnership between all levels of government. It included a number of other elements in terms of NPAs that went to education, employment, early years and health, but particularly education. It also provided links to those national agreements and national partnership agreements across COAG, which include elements targeted at closing the gap in Indigenous affairs, and particularly targeted at Indigenous disadvantage. The National Indigenous Reform Agreement is the basis of this reform, and the bill, in promulgating funding for another 12 months, is important in achieving closure of those gaps. COAG recognises that individuals and communities should have the opportunity to benefit from the mainstream economy through real jobs, business opportunities, economic independence and wealth creation. Ultimately, Indigenous economic development is about providing Indigenous people with the same opportunities as non-Indigenous Australians. They will not achieve this universally, but education is the cornerstone of change and a prerequisite for employment within our contemporary society for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians.


I was invited to write the foreword to the Western Australian Aboriginal Child Health Survey Volume 3: the Educational Experiences of Aboriginal Children and Young People, which was officially launched on 24 March 2006. I will cite from what I wrote. Of the numerous research projects into Aboriginal education there is none so profound as the Western Australian Aboriginal Child Health Survey, Improving the educational experiences of Aboriginal children and young people. It provided confronting evidence that the benefits of education remain poorly realised by the vast majority of Western Australian Aboriginal children, and you could translate that across all jurisdictional regions of this country. The more fundamental issue is the failure over the past 35 years by education providers to improve the educational outcomes of the vast majority of Aboriginal students. It is important to accept the reality that failure over the past 30 years to improve educational outcomes of the vast majority of Aboriginal school children has affected three generations of Aboriginal children and young people who are highly likely to have limited access to lifelong learning, employment and economic opportunities.


There has been tacit acceptance of the nonachievement of educational standards by Aboriginal children and young people, and the resultant acceptance of this lack of educational success has had a cumulative effect—hence my question to the member for Blair. It is fine talking about programs, initiatives and funding, but what of the educational attainments at the end of 12 years of schooling? What of the outcomes after tertiary level education, be they through the vocational education training sector or through the universities? If our results show that the proportion has not increased on a comparative basis to Australian society in mainstream youth and young people going through, then we have a challenge that we still have to address, and we certainly need to look at those targeted outcomes.


It is based on the belief that Aboriginal children and young people will never reach their full potential and if they fall behind society then welfare will protect them. Their low level of educational success is accepted as a normative expectation. This has to change. If we are to change the outcomes, if we are to close gaps and if we are to take the advice that the women gave the member for Fraser, and others that I have been involved with, then we have to raise the bar. We have to say that programs are fine—funding does not solve the problems that become inherent when you fail within systems, because the outcomes that any society seeks will not be attained. Certainly, there is resentment at the level of funding that is channelled into welfare and supporting people who become passive recipients of programs and services. I would want them to be responsive. I would want them to be shaping the direction for the future. I would want them to be, as you described, part of the process, and where people are part of the process, things change. It has become acceptable for Aboriginal children and young people to work at their level unless it becomes problematic or the sociopolitical structures are pressured to bring about change. There is a moral obligation to redress the needs of Aboriginal children and young people to be successful and to achieve the level of educational attainment that builds social and human capital to be achievers in the Australian and global community.


The act as it stands has provided numerous opportunities over a period of time but I think the accountability that I wish we could emulate in what we are seeking in the new structures for the health reform agenda and the accountability of states and territories that go to some critical elements of health reform should be equally applied with passion within this arena. Otherwise, we are inconsistent in the way we address the gap that exists, because the problem with the lack of education and the lack of attainment is that we then see the cyclic pattern of people with generations of family members who have never been employed because their education attainment does not make them competitive within the society in which they move, live, work and play. We have to change that.


There is bilateral agreement. Those societies which continue to invest in the education, training and employment of their people have prospered and enjoy a high standard of living and access to resources , health and human and social capital, which builds upon individual and societal successes. All Australian governments acknowledge that investing in education and training is essential for Australia's economic and social prosperity. It is also about positioning Australia to meet the new challenges and opportunities, as I have said previously, in international markets in a world without economic borders, the emerging new knowledge based society, with the pressures for change, global and international competitiveness, access to information and technology and new and emerging global clients, which we often refer to in this House in terms of other legislation. 


Australia will require a flexible, well-educated, well-trained, high-performing workforce to achieve and sustain these reforms. This will pose problems for the majority of Aboriginal children and young people, who continue to perform poorly in their education because they will not access the opportunities which will flow for well-educated Australians. Although I agree that we have had successes and we are seeing some good outcomes, they are not uniform—and we are seeing people succeed, even against the barriers, including barriers of racism in instances. But they have not given up, nor have they surrendered their will to achieve and to contribute. 


There is growing demand for an educated, more highly trained and more technically skilled workforce. However, most Aboriginal workers are at the lower, shrinking end of the employment market and are becoming part of the growing underclass. The question that arises for Aboriginal children and people is: why are they excluded from the advantages of being an integral part of a vision in which Australia's global competitiveness and future depends upon all Australians having the necessary education, training and learning ability and that is dependent upon the application of knowledge to support innovation, stimulate business development and improve workforce productivity to live productive and fulfilling lives? 


It is important for Aboriginal children and young people to acquire the same proficient standard Australian English, as well as to be taught to recognise the way in which language is used, contextualised, understood and applied in a global and knowledge based society, in order to participate in Australia's economy. The task of developing appropriate resources and teaching Aboriginal students to become proficient in standard Australian English should be achievable. Over a period of 12 years, a student should be able to learn English, when it is considered in this context. English has 26 letters and only 44 sounds. It has an approximate total of 550,000 words, and 2,000 words make up 90 per cent of most speech. Four hundred words make up to 65 per cent of most writing, and there are only 70 main spelling combinations. Graduation from the final year of secondary schooling provides measures of success, including the completion of school entry, to university and higher education, access to TAFE, apprenticeships, traineeships, employment and an income. Aboriginal children and young people who do not achieve secondary education and who do not acquire the basic skills of literacy and numeracy are unlikely to be competitive in the labour market, and that goes for any student who fails at schooling. They will subsequently be vulnerable to structural change within the labour market government reform and therefore will be reliant on government income support. Seriously, if you do not achieve year 10 graduation then you are doomed eternally to welfare dependency, unless there are interventions that break that dependency.


One thing is that we have got to stop focusing on programs, which is the reason I asked the member for Blair the question about understanding what the educational outcomes are. We have to stop focusing purely on money. The question that we as members all need to ask and know the answer to with a degree of certainty within our electorates is: what is the educational attainment not only of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children but of any child who experiences socioeconomic challenges and difficulty? I think it is beholden upon us to know what the gaps are within our electorates so that we can address them and advocate for and champion those who need the champions of this House. It is only through the processes of strong bilateral commitment that we will see the changes that are absolutely necessary for any child who requires a level of support and intervention, in particular in this bill. 


I commend this bill to the parliament.

"O'Neill, Deb, MP",ALP,2011-07-04,"



Ms O'NEILL
 (Robertson) (17:29):  As I commence speaking in support of the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2011, I am proud to follow the member for Hasluck and the member for Fraser—the member for Hasluck because of his particular authentic voice in this debate as the first Indigenous member of the House of Representatives and the member for Fraser because of his obvious passion for and commitment to education. In these times when politics and politicians are maligned nearly as much as climate scientists and economists, I think it is important for people who might be listening to this debate to understand that the work of the House involves people working across boundaries in the interests of the nation. That is the kind of work that I came here to do as the member for Robertson, and that is why I am very, very proud to be speaking today to this bill, which is firmly and squarely targeted at changing life outcomes for the most underprivileged and most isolated people in this great nation of Australia, our Indigenous people.


This bill itself demonstrates that the Gillard government are deeply committed to governing with a clear and dedicated focus on closing the gap that we have to simply accept exists between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples in terms of not just living standards but every possible measure of life outcome: health, wellbeing, educational status and opportunity. Of all the tools at our disposal to achieve these equitable goals, education, in my view, is the most powerful one—and there is much research to support this. The adequate provision of education has been proven over and over, time and time again, as the greatest equaliser of opportunity available to a society. The Gillard government is absolutely committed to closing the gap in Indigenous education disadvantage. In my view, it is essential that it remain our most important objective.


Of all the national issues, this one, perhaps more than others, has a very particular local face in a range of different settings across the nation. I will always—and as I speak here today I want to particularly—value and appreciate the local Indigenous community in my electorate. The Central Coast is an area that has been proudly inhabited by the Darkinjung-Guringai people. I will always feel privileged to be the representative in this parliament of the land in which the Aboriginal elders of my region continue to hold their custodianship with such care. The coast certainly has a proud Indigenous history, and members of the Indigenous community have always sought to maintain and strengthen their cultural heritage, but the reality on the Central Coast is similar to the reality around the rest of the nation: our Indigenous kids are underrepresented in terms of health and wellbeing, they are underrepresented in the successful completion of schooling, they are underrepresented in our universities and they are underrepresented in their opportunities to be full, successful and participating members of our society with all the choices that are afforded to children who are born to non-Indigenous parents.


The purpose of this amendment bill is to extend funding amounting to $133.5 million for non-Abstudy payments for the calendar year 2013. Additionally, this bill will reduce by $157.7 million in net terms the appropriations allocated for non-Abstudy payments to fund previously agreed government policy and initiatives. While decision making that shifts money in economically responsible ways is necessarily a difficult task for all governments, we in this government understand that we must remember, in the allocation of funding, that it must go to where it is most needed and can have a powerful and positive impact on our communities. The changes to funding arrangements reflected here reflect changed arrangements which were implemented under reforms to federal financial relations.


It is always important to consider that not only is it important to provide welfare to Indigenous communities but its provision must be enabling for the communities. It must be efficient, it must be effective and it must be—as the member for Hasluck so clearly outlined—directed at real, practical outcomes. 'It's not about the money,' he said. 'It's about what we actually make happen, what we make possible, what we envision and what we deliver for Indigenous communities with Indigenous communities.' The new arrangements reflected in this bill provide greater autonomy for states and territories to tailor their own policies to suit local circumstances. This is a very important part of the bill—that the face of need in each community is different and that that needs to be taken into consideration at the state level as well as at the totally local level. The circumstances faced by Indigenous Australians vary phenomenally throughout this Commonwealth. It is appropriate, then, that policies in relation to education should also vary. Reform to the Commonwealth-state relations in Indigenous education policy has been immensely beneficial in the development of a policy aimed at closing the gap. An example is the approximately $80 million transferred to the Northern Territory national partnership agreement. This COAG agreement is aimed at closing the gap, and a significant part of the agreement is the National Partnership Agreement for Indigenous Early Childhood Development. When it comes to changing outcomes for Indigenous children, we must constantly acknowledge the power of investing in early education.


We talk about expectations—and I want to say a little more about that later. Expectation about what is possible for every child is at the heart of a teacher's role, but teachers do not do this alone; it is parents and the community in toto. It is often said it is not just the family that raises a child—it is not just the mother and father—it is the village. Early childhood exposure to great quality education changes expectations for everyone. It changes expectations for the children themselves when they begin to see other ways of doing, other ways of being, other ways of knowing, other ways of listening and other ways of speaking. In a clearly and carefully dedicated formal education setting that is combined with the sound advice of policy and research in early childhood, we begin early on the journey that might have positive outcomes for future generations of Indigenous Australians.


The National Partnership Agreement for Indigenous Early Childhood Development commits $564.6 million—that is a large amount of money—over six years. It is currently funding 36 children and family centres. I have not had the opportunity yet to visit one of those, but I certainly hope that I will have the opportunity, because the people working there are doing some of the most important work in our community. They are the people who will build these potential futures. This COAG agreement is designed to meet the specific needs pertaining to particular states and territories, who will develop and implement their own plans in consultation with their local communities.


The bill also reflects the government's election commitment to increase support for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students from remote Indigenous communities attending non-government and non-remote boarding schools. This initiative is really about making it possible for individuals who have different needs to receive different responses. There is no one Aboriginal culture; there are multiple Aboriginal cultures. There is no universal student; there are multiple individuals, Indigenous and non-Indigenous, who need particular responses. The uniqueness of the human person is a challenge for all educators. This bill does many of the structural things that allow teachers to actually begin to do that kind of dedicated work.


Sadly, not every Indigenous Australian child will have access to the program, but significant numbers will. This really does have the potential to change lives. As a former teacher, I am very well aware, having spent 25 years in classrooms, that education transforms lives. I am passionate about education because I have seen it. I have seen kids arrive with low expectations and I have seen them at the end of 13 years of schooling, having been well engaged, being able to do wonderful things and fulfil their dreams. Sadly, some children have never had those possibilities offered to them. I see Australians who represent great resources, to themselves, to their families, to their local communities, to their nation and, indeed, potentially to the world, who, by the time they have left school, do not have the skills or the belief in themselves that they need to advance and really become the best people that they can be. Education is a rich field in which to work and a great education is a holistic experience. It empowers students intellectually, socially and, just as importantly, emotionally and culturally. This program of supporting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders from remote areas to attend non-government schools has the potential to provide that empowering experience. But such programs must always be mindful of the challenges faced when moving from one cultural setting into another cultural setting. There is a lot of research about students from disadvantaged social backgrounds having two language practices, trying to identify in a tertiary setting and using a particular discourse capacity in that context and then also having to go back to their own families and talk, live, work and speak in different ways. This is not a small thing that we are asking. That is why it needs to be offered to particular kids who look like they are able to take up that opportunity and why it needs to match their particular needs.


Every Indigenous student who finishes secondary education and gains a tertiary qualification is benefiting their community. They are benefiting their local community, the Aboriginal community and the Australian community. The more successful we are at promoting education in remote Indigenous communities, the more able we are to improve the life outcomes of those individuals and their communities and to close the gap, which really is a shame and a blight on our national history at this point in time.


As a member of this parliament and this Australian community in 2011, I often hear the general public's frustration at the Commonwealth-state blame game. Indeed, I understand that in our federal system Commonwealth and state governments inevitably dispute. However, Indigenous affairs is an area of policy where we must not fail. We must not allow this gap to be maintained. It is for this reason that I am heartened by the fact that there is a defined COAG agreement, aimed at closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.


Commitment to cooperative targets is also demonstrated by the newly updated Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Action Plan 2010-2014. This action plan commits the Australian government to 55 clear actions concerning the educational outcomes of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and young people. These 55 actions are linked to six priority domains, which are reflective of an outcomes based holistic approach to education: school readiness; engagement and connection; attendance; literacy and numeracy; leadership, quality teaching and workforce development; and pathways to real postschool options.


These six areas are critical and foremost and, under this agreement, each state was able to tailor how they approach those policy objectives in their own context. One approach I found particularly encouraging was the New South Wales strategy of developing a personalised learning plan for all Aboriginal students, in conjunction with students, parents and/or caregivers and teachers, including Aboriginal school personnel. In particular, it was focused on students' wellbeing in spiritual, cultural and personal domains. If we do not attend to those realities, then students will not be likely to engage in the intellectual domain.


This approach demonstrates the ideal that each student is a unique individual, with different strengths and weaknesses and a different personality that needs different responses. We must never forget that this legislation and the COAG agreement are being discussed here in this place today because, in 1967, again, very belatedly, the Australian people voted to enable the Commonwealth to legislate for Indigenous Australians. It is our responsibility in this federal place to have high expectations of ourselves and of the Indigenous community to be able to achieve these goals. It is therefore imperative that the Commonwealth use every power that we have at our disposal to assist in improving the educational outcomes of Indigenous students.


It remains a concern to me that, in 2010, only 64 per cent of year 9 Indigenous students achieved at or above the minimum standard in reading, compared to 92 per cent of non-Indigenous students. Twenty-four per cent of Indigenous students in remote areas achieved the national minimum reading standards. That is just not good enough.


Despite the challenges that face us, the Australian Labor Party and this government understand the importance of education and its enabling capacity. As a member of the House, I certainly have a vision for an Australia where Indigenous Australians have equity in outcomes and, on the basis of that, I commend this bill to the House. (Time expired)

"Jones, Ewen, MP",LP,2011-07-04,"



Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (17:44):  I rise to speak on the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2011 and give it my qualified support. In fact, a lot of my thoughts will be exactly the same as those of the member for Robertson. My wife is in fact an early childhood teacher. One thing that I would like to see in the future is equalised funding going to primary schools and, in particular, to early childhood centres, because that is where the battle is won or lost. If we can get these kids into a classroom, get them to know their alphabet and learn the outcome based education, then we will all be a lot better off.


As I said, a lot of the things I will be covering here will be covered with exactly the same feeling as that of the member for Robertson; I will just come at it from a different direction. The good part of this bill is that it extends the current funding arrangements, including indexation arrangements, for the 2013 calendar year. The funding covers programs such as the Indigenous Youth Mobility Program, helping Indigenous youth move away from home to gain skills for employment. In the city of Townsville a number of people are prepared to assist with this. We have a fantastic TAFE, Tec-NQ and we also have Shalom Christian College. St Pats, run by the Sisters of Mercy, is a great school. It has an incredible population of Torres Strait Islander and Palm Islander girls, who come across there to complete their education all the way through, from grade 8 to grade 12. 


The bill also covers funding for the Sporting Chance Program, which uses sport and recreation activities as a means of increasing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander engagement in school. Both these programs were implemented by the coalition and, to the government's credit, both these good programs have been continued. Both have been successful in increasing student participation and retention rates. This so-called necessary extension of funding is because we have to allow time for the report, which is due sometime this year, following the review of funding for schools.  The government has acknowledged that this review may have implications for the programs run under the IETA Act. I would urge the government not to touch the programs that are working to get kids into schools.


This is where I start to have problems with this legislation and, by extension, all the legislation relating to Aboriginal and Islander affairs. For a start we have these good programs, using sport and recreation, which actually get the kids into school. When we get them there, we sit them down and either they participate in the NAPLAN or we make them prepare for NAPLAN. Too many schools these days are wasting time just preparing for tests and going through tests to get them ready. So we say to the kids from the missions: 'Come in, go to school.' We use sport, music, dance and art to get them in there and, as soon as we do, we throw that out of the window and they no longer participate and we wonder why they do not go back to school. 


I agree with the member for Robertson: we as a community have to look at and decide what success is. Is the fact that they can actually speak English by the time they finish school a success? In some cases, it should be. But how do we qualify that and how do we ensure that they are getting the right funding? Those are the questions that we have to ask.


I recognise that this is a big issue. But, for the life of me, and the First Australians of my electorate, we cannot see where all the money is going. For all its good intentions, this place must see the frustration. For all its well-thought-out plans, bills and amendments we are still seeing a complete lack of clear results in our communities. Our Aboriginal and Islander school children remain the most troubled group. They are the most likely to be truant. They are the most likely to finish their education early. They are more likely not to possess the basic literacy skills required to achieve anything above menial labour. They are more likely to die young and they are more likely to suffer substance abuse. I have been a member of this House for less than a year, and yet I feel a great frustration when it comes to the provision of services for our First Australians. In my maiden speech, I pointed to people and organisations who were trying to make a difference. They are making a difference in the community by targeting specific groups, specific programs and specific native groups of people to get things done.


I continue to talk about, for want of a better term, federalising the industry of Aboriginal and Islander affairs, and the member for Robertson addressed that matter as well. I am not a federalist by nature. But, for the life of me, when I speak to the mayor of Palm Island, the mayor of Yarrabah or to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander elders in my community they do not know where the money is going. It goes from federal to state, to local and there is a trickle that comes out the bottom. They are raising concerns with me as to where the money is going. Are there too many consultants? Are the state governments robbing us blind? Is the federal government through the Public Service not getting the funds through? Those are the questions that just do not seem to be heard, because it all leads to money not getting to the pointy end—and that is what we need. Too often we see people falling through the gaps. We now have more people in care than during the stolen generation. When you think about how much money we have thrown at the issue, you have to pause and ask, 'To what end?'


I was at the Cleveland Youth Detention Centre recently. They have instigated a program where the boys in the centre are exposed to normal businesspeople who mentor them in life. They do not judge the boys nor do they care what they have done. The people who participate are there to see if there is anything that they can offer, anything in their own lives which they have done which could give these boys a chance they so desperately need. These people are not qualified as social workers; they are qualified as people who have jobs and who have life experience. They spend time with the boys. There are some of the Cowboys players that are so welcome in that place but, more often than not, they are just businesspeople going in and spending time with them.


When you go into Cleveland Youth you see the existence of foetal alcohol syndrome and abuse they have suffered are rife in the inmates in the centre. The blame for that lies across the whole region and the whole community. But the mentors do not let them make excuses. They tell them that sometimes bad things happen; some things are beyond their control; and sometimes you just have to suck it up and have a go. That is the mentors' basic message: have a red hot go, be prepared to fail and fall over but have a go.


It is with this in mind that I suggest that we change the way we do things. The current way is simply not good enough. If it was a business venture, you would have cut its head off long ago—too much money and very little return. I was on Palm Island last week and I sat down with Mayor Alf Lacey and acting council CEO Jeff Brown. Alf's mantra is: 'Do not talk to me about welfare. We are over it. What we want to talk about is economic opportunity to be masters of our own destiny.' To that end, Palm Island council are working as a council and as a community to try to lift the island's profile in Townsville for its economic opportunities.


You only have to come over the hill to see what they are doing with weed eradication, the way the town square has been spruced up with paint and the way the council chambers have been cleaned up. What a pretty place it is and is going to be. There is cyclone damage across the foreshore roads where you still have power poles basically in the sand. It is a long road to travel, but they are heading in the right direction.


We need to look at opportunities for our first Australians but we cannot have some bureaucrat or politician in Canberra telling them what that opportunity is and the money will be that and they will be doing this and they will be getting paid that. We need these communities to stand up and tell us what they want to do. We need to help out as a silent partner with business plans and paperwork. Let the residents have a go. Let them drive their own future. We need to micro manage each of these. We need to see what can be done and fund it directly. We need our ministers to do more. We need our directors-general to do that. We need our public servants to change the basic way they are dealing with this part of Australia's life.


For too long we have been giving money over and patting them on the back and sending them on their way. This has to stop. If there is an Aboriginal or Islander person who wants to change and wants to step up, we should be handling their case as a single unit. We need to set out goals and manage their future along with them until they have made it. We also have to acknowledge that this is not for everyone. The more we look at this issue, the deeper it gets; the deeper it gets, the less we do; and the less we do, the more money it costs us. 


This is not a swipe at the government, but I do believe that spreading the portfolio of Aboriginal and Islander affairs across so many portfolios and having it as a small part of mega large departments does not seem to be the answer. I do not question the commitment of Minister Snowdon or Minister Macklin, but it is too easy for staff of the department and for even the ministers to say that it is the duty of another portfolio and another department and wipe their hands. That goes across the state as well.


We need to change our focus. We need to be outcomes focused and not budget focused. We need to have as the focus of each member of the Public Service that we want to educate our Aboriginal and Islander children, teenagers and adults. Those who want to work for it will be rewarded with the gift of literacy and better health and jobs and futures. We have to do this one person at a time. This year's theme for NAIDOC Week is 'The next step is ours'. Let us be right there with those who want to take that step and give them the assistance they require. No-one wants any more than that. They are not asking for any more than that. If I am to be accused of being simplistic, then so be it. My idea may not work. But what has?

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2011</title>,BILLS,24,1
"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2011-07-04,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (17:55):  I welcome the opportunity to speak to the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill. Can I begin by acknowledging that we are celebrating NAIDOC Week this week, between 3 and 10 July—a week that has been recognised by Indigenous people in this country for almost 70 years. It started off with William Cooper back in the 1930s, when he formed the Australian Aborigines League, and at the time there was even a call for Indigenous people to b e represented in this place. What was originally considered to be a day of mourning has now become a week of celebration for Indigenous people across the country, and I certainly wish them well in the celebrations of this week because I know that, right across the country, in many, many communities, there are individual events taking place. 


The purpose of this bill is to extend funding for existing programs under the Indigenous education targeted assistance for a further year and to reallocate some funds to other programs and initiatives. The Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2011 aligns funding so that the review of funding for schooling, due to report in 2011, can be considered and any changes implemented with adequate planning and consultation. In 2007 the Council of Australian Governments agreed to six targets for closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, including in relation to educational achievement. Some of those targets were to halve the gap in reading, writing and numeracy achievements for Indigenous children within a decade, and to halve the gap for Indigenous students in year 12 attainment rates by the year 2020. These targets were formalised in the National Indigenous Reform Agreement (Closing the Gap) agreed by COAG in October 2008. The bill aims to extend the funding for the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 to incorporate the 2013 calendar year to line up with the Schools Assistance Act 2008, and timing of the review of funding for schooling. This extension, if passed, will appropriate an approximate total of $150 million under the act for 2013.


Nowhere is the need for improving education greater than in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. I think that everyone in this House would agree that, if we are ever to overcome disadvantage for any group within our community, then we should begin with improving the education standards. I think it is universally agreed across the world that that is the single thing that makes so much difference to the lives of people. Certainly here in Australia, where we know that Indigenous people are more disadvantaged than the rest of the people in this nation, then starting with a good education outcome is an important priority for the government, and it should be for the nation.


Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education focused programs run under the act are critical to the future of Indigenous Australia. Initiatives in funding for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are already underway and there are a range of commitments that this government has already made with respect to reducing Indigenous disadvantage. I want to go through what some of those are. The sum of $56.5 million has been allocated nationally to expand literacy and numeracy programs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students and to provide professional support to assist teachers to develop personalised learning plans for students over the period 2009 to 2012. The government is honouring its 2007 election commitment of $21.9 million to support students from remote communities attending non-remote boarding schools. The government has also allocated $28.9 million for three new boarding facilities in the Northern Territory to support Indigenous kids to achieve a year 12 certificate; $23 million has been allocated for a quality teaching package to upskill and retain the education workforce in Northern Territory schools; $22.7 million has been allocated for on-site accelerated literacy and numeracy support for teaching staff in the Northern Territory; $107.8 million over four years for an additional 200 teachers in the Northern Territory has also been allocated; $35.4 million has been set aside for the school nutrition program for remote schools in the Northern Territory; $9.1 million of funding was announced in the 2009 budget to support creches; $8.9 million was allocated under the Building the Education Revolution for additional classrooms for remote communities, as was $2.5 billion of Smarter Schools National Partnerships funding which targets disadvantage and contributes to improving literacy and numeracy outcomes, with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education a key of that focus.


All of those amounts highlight an additional important point—that is, if we are going to address Indigenous disadvantage and lift education standards of Indigenous people across the country, then we need to target funding to specific needs because the reality is that across Australia different communities do have different needs. If we do not recognise that then we will find that, all too often, money that has been allocated in fact does not target the people who need it the most. So by breaking it down into those specific allocations that I have just run through, it means the government well understands what the priorities ought to be and where the focus ought to be of that funding. 


When I look at the programs covered in the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 it is evident that many programs are aimed at engagement as well as education. The programs delivered under the act are complementary to mainstream schooling and employ a range of diverse programs designed to improve educational outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The Sporting Chance Program combines school-based sports academies with education engagement strategies that provide a range of sport, recreation and education activities for primary and secondary school students. Other programs include the Indigenous Youth Mobility Program, supplementary recurrent assistance for both non-government vocational education and training and early childhood, as well as Abstudy and mixed mode Away From Base assistance. 


If we are going to engage more children in our education sector, we need to begin by also engaging the parents. The act is also about community involvement, as is evidenced by the Parental and Community Engagement Program. The importance of community engagement should never be understated. Historically, low Indigenous engagement in the education system as well as poor education and employment outcomes mean that Indigenous students are less likely to have parental assistance in their studies than non-Indigenous students. The reality has several flow-on effects. Low parental and family education has: firstly, negatively affected Indigenous experiences of and attitudes towards the education system; secondly, reduced the capacity of Indigenous parents and families to engage effectively with the education system; thirdly, reduced parental involvement in school based activities and decision making; and, fourthly, limited the capacity of Indigenous parents and families to support their children in education and employment. The Parental and Community Engagement Program aims to reverse this situation. The government will continue to work at building and strengthening partnerships between families and schools supported by government funding and unflagging determination. In my electorate of Makin, there is an example of the Parental and Community Engagement strategy in place at the North Ingle school at Ingle Farm. The program, which is being run by Centacare Catholic Family Services, has been allocated $23,650 of funding for the family wellbeing project. The project started in January 2010 and is expected to finish on 30 December this year. Centrecare is conducting workshops to empower parents and caregivers of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students who attend the North Ingle School to engage with school staff and support their children at the school. It is a good example of what can be done at the local level when you understand what the needs are.


The Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 also aims to empower young Indigenous people through the Indigenous Youth Leadership Program. The role Indigenous mentors and role models play in the community is an important one. This program also has the potential to underline the importance of culture, community development and governance in the school environment. The Aboriginal And Torres Strait Islander Education Action Plan was developed by the Ministerial Council for Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs and launched on 9 June 2011. The action plan includes targeting approximately 900 focus schools and outlines 55 actions at national, systemic and local levels across the following six key areas: readiness for school; engagement and connections; attendance; literacy and numeracy; leadership; quality teaching and workforce development; and pathways to real post-school options.


In last year's budget $15.4 million over four years was prioritised to deliver on the government's commitments under the action plan. We have also approved more than $25 million for projects over 2011 and 2012 to expand intensive literacy and numeracy approaches for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. Indeed, since 2008 the government has invested $51.5 million in Indigenous literacy and numeracy projects. Over 20,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students in over 670 schools across Australia will benefit from this assistance.


In my home state of South Australia $1 million was provided to Catholic schools for their intensive literacy and numeracy program for Indigenous students and their whole-school planning for targeted personalised learning, with the dual focus on school intervention and literacy and numeracy. Government schools in South Australia will receive a further $1 million for the Unlocking the Future program, which is focused on literacy and teacher capacity. All schools in South Australia—that is, government, Catholic and independent schools—will receive over $3 million to deliver a national program known as Make It Count. This program is focused on improving literacy and teacher capacity.


I close by talking about a local project in the northern and north-eastern suburbs of Adelaide which was undertaken as a partnership between the federal government, the state government of South Australia, Woolworths and two training organisations: Trainme and Globally Make a Difference. It was put together by the Mining, Energy and Engineering Academy of South Australia. This is a program whereby Indigenous people of all ages are selected from the community. Woolworths, as one of key partners, guarantees them a job if they undergo a training program, which in turn gives them a Certificate I or Certificate II in Retail Operations. The program has been an incredible success. Roughly 100 people were originally listed for the program. To date, 91 of those people have commenced the program, 72 have graduated, 42 are currently working with Woolworths and 22 are doing further training. I think those figures are remarkable—remarkable because these were people of all ages who in many cases had never worked before. They were people who had found an incredible number of barriers along the way to getting them into the workforce. But providing them with an opportunity of training and, in turn, the guarantee of a job at the end of that training made a world of difference. 


What also made a world of difference was that the two training organisations—and, in particular, Mark Siaosi from Trainme and Melinda Cates from Globally Make a Difference—really understood the people they were working with. They understood them well enough to understand how they should best tailor the training programs that they were providing. They worked with the trainees from start to finish to ensure that they not only completed their training but also participated in the employment experience that was provided by Woolworths along the way. It shows that, when you understand how to run a program and you can guarantee people a job at the end of it, you will get outcomes. I particularly commend Mike Batycki from Woolworths, who is the state manager in South Australia, for overseeing this program and making it available. I have now attended two graduations of the program—this year and last year. I was indeed impressed to see the people coming through the program having graduated and to see the excitement on their faces to think that they had actually achieved something and they had a job waiting for them at the end of the program. That is another good example of where sometimes, if you want results, you have to tailor make the whole program. The federal government has provided $1.2 million of funding as part of its Indigenous Employment Program to fund the program, and it is working. To those people involved—Alan Tidswell, from the Mining Energy and Engineering Academy; Mark Siaosi;Melinda Cates; and Michael Batycki—I say thank you and well done.

"Laming, Andrew, MP",LP,2011-07-04,"



Mr LAMING
 (Bowman) (18:10):  In considering the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2011, the question that comes before anyone who debates this issue on either side of this chamber is the No. 1 concern of school attendance. While we as politicians can continue to mouth the promises of small programs, small financial transfers and small gains in attendance in restricted areas and small cohorts in different parts of Australia, the only thing that will measure our time in public life will be whether we have turned education for Indigenous Australians in remote and rural Australia around so that attendance is something equivalent to what we see in the mainstream. It is great to focus on closing the gap, but today I want to look through the prism of the national quality framework and see what we have achieved since it was first raised back on 3 July 2008, to see some progress in Indigenous outcomes in both early childhood and later education. Secondly, I will look at the human rights issues around school attendance and compare them to worldwide concerns. Thirdly, I will look at the social and, fourthly, the economic implications of school attendance.


When we listen to our words today decades from now, the question will be not, 'Could we fill our 20 minutes with examples of what a government is doing?' but, 'Were we actually achieving any change whatsoever?' There are scarce few examples in this country of successful achievement in getting Aboriginal kids to school. I can start with a list of reasons, but our job is not to continue to expand on the list of reasons. We have one single role in this place, and that is to turn our words—our good words on both sides of the chamber—into reality, particularly in remote and rural Australia. So, while I have seen very, very alarming statistics that talk about only 24 per cent of Indigenous Australians even having a high school in their community and 40 per cent of Indigenous Australians completing year 12 but only 10 per cent of Indigenous Australians actually graduating from year 12, let us remember that it is magnified enormously the more remote or rural the area is. So, in areas like the Warlpiri communities around the Tanami of Yuendumu and Lajamanu, we have seen massive falls in school attendance at the same time as we were attempting the Northern Territory emergency intervention. It was not through any fault of the intervention. The intervention made it clear: send your child to school or face the impact of quarantining. The great problem is that quarantining was extended to absolutely everyone, and here we are, three to four years later, with an almost anthropological fascination with the intervention—watching, looking, talking about it and measuring it—but school attendance has not changed. No, school attendance flatlined for three years after we brought this intervention in. We got an initial 20 per cent jump, and it has sat there at 60 per cent ever since.


My great concern in those prescribed communities is that 40 to 45 per cent of Indigenous children simply do not go to school. I will say it again, and it will be remembered decades from now: it is Australia's greatest human rights violation that Indigenous Australians do not go to school. There is no greater tragedy for this nation. We know that levels of maternal education predict the futures of kids. We know that should be our No. 1 priority after child safety. But we are getting nowhere.


As I said, through the prism of the national quality framework, we talked about it in July 2008. We then talked about it again in October 2008. Then, Indigenous Australians can be delighted to know that on 2 July 2009 we accepted a revised version of the previous year's document—so there went one year. And now I move forward to 2011, and I say to Indigenous Australians, what have we delivered to you in the form of Children and Family Centres? This conversation started years ago. The kids who were most vulnerable in grade 1 are now most of the way through primary school, and what can I report to you? I can report that we had a press release in May saying that they were looking at setting up, in temporary premises, in the middle of this year, an arrangement for Doomadgee, Mareeba, Mount Isa, Ipswich, Mornington Island and Cairns. What about the other 16 remote Queensland communities? Nothing. It is one thing to run around and look for pilot schemes and roll things out in selected communities, but ultimately we need to remember we have two concurrent objectives here. One is the quality numerator—that is, how well we teach the kids. But no matter how good the quality is, if the denominator of school attendance is not there then quality means nothing. The great challenge is that we will have a rollcall and report that an Indigenous child has turned up at school but they are not there at lunchtime. They are gone by lunch, and they are not there on the other days when we are not counting the roll.


I now move to the second issue, the social issues in remote Australia. We put way too much pressure on bureaucrats and, in particular, on principals to be policing and pushing Indigenous liaison workers out to pick kids up from school in buses and cars. And for too long we have hung off the excuses of not having  a pair of shoes or food in your tummy as an excuse not to go to school. But it is the other way round; the kids must be at school. There is no corner of this nation where there is not a law that clearly and explicitly points out that very fact. We are failing to apply ordinary laws that apply to the rest of Australia in remote Indigenous Australia. We are effectively creating a racial divide: a two-tiered system where the very rules that apply in most of Australia are exempted in Central Australia. And all most people would ask for is that the rules are applied.


As I said in my second point, from a social perspective I can appreciate there are damaged and incapacitated people in every community. There may well be more in some than others. So it is beholden upon us to identify those people and help their children because that is a child protection issue and that is No. 1. We know from the Bath report that there are 800-plus reports of completely uninvestigated child welfare issues. That is a failure, and without that being fixed we cannot even talk about education.


I have a fair bit of respect for teachers who say we need more resourcing, that we need better skilled teachers in remote areas and that we need to keep them there longer. They are all very important issues of continuity and quality of education. But, as I have said before, the denominator here is attendance. If kids cannot turn up then their parents need to bring them. And if kids will not stay at school because the minute the parents leave the children leave, then we have an issue where we must ask our parents to stay at school. We may well have to rethink education models and admit that, as was traditionally the case in Indigenous Australia, education was a multigenerational process. It is quite possible that caregivers need to remain at school and be accommodated in school grounds. I just ask the question: are we prepared to reconsider the way we deliver a Western education to promote attendance? I will have any discussion in any community about parts of the syllabus which Indigenous Australians do not support or have concerns about, but ultimately this is a discussion we should have had decades ago.


Fred Hollows identified this in the seventies. He found out a century too late for Indigenous Australia that education fundamentally had to be a buy-in process from the very families who send their kids to school. I can understand that it looks like there are no jobs at the end of the tunnel, but that is an argument for another day because No. 1 has to be school attendance, and that comes only through parental acceptance of its importance. When I visit Indigenous communities parents do tell me just that, but they will also tell me: 'Whether I send my kids to school or not, I'm quarantined. So there's no great incentive if I've improved my efforts in sending a kid to school. I don't see many carrots for sending my kid to school in a direct and real time. And ultimately if I thumb my nose at the system and I say, ""Well, you've quarantined me and there's nothing more you can do,"" the reality is it is quite right, there is very little that the system can do.' So at some point we need to say that kids not attending school is just as serious as a range of other child welfare issues, and we need to be able to talk to aunties and extended families about ways of getting those kids to school.


There is a very easy way to reduce the number of kids that are in this situation—that is, to engage a community and ensure there is buy-in. There is nothing worse than going to a remote community where they say: 'We don't have much to do with that mob. We don't know the teachers very well; they come and go. We certainly don't have confidence that they're teaching the right things.' Then there is a driver for engagement with the community, and I would like to see more flexible state education systems start that conversation.


When Marion Scrymgour, as the NT education minister, moved English to a position of pre-eminence and then the intervention backed it up with mandatory four hours of English education at the start of the day, I can see what they were trying to do. But we have thrown out the entire cultural underpinnings of bilingual education for Indigenous Australians. Every other part of Australia teaches languages other than English as an alternative for kids, but we have lost that in many parts of Indigenous Australia that develop fabulous bilingual curricula. We need to bring that back, in no way threatening English because you need to learn English to be able to learn in English, so English must be a core part of education. But to remove the right of a community to have cultural and traditional elements in their curriculum is inviting disaster and disengagement. What we cannot afford is to lose these wonderful young kids at the ages of 10 or 12 when they go through subincision and other traditional processes and we lose them to education until they have gone through their final ceremony. In that period between 12 and 16 we have our greatest challenge in retaining kids, particularly in remote Australia, within our schools. The answer to that is simple: the answer to that is to talk about extended families and to talk to the senior caregiver—who is not always the mother. We need to talk to aunties and elders and ask them what we have to do for the children in your care in terms of keeping them at school. Once we have had that discussion in a community about what is valued in a curriculum it becomes far more powerful.


I have the sense that we are caught somewhere either side of this debate. Centrelink can approach an individual for not sending a child to school, and then at a community level we are trying to negotiate with elders. But in the middle there we need to remember that the strongest remaining part of Indigenous culture is the family group. Perhaps we have to talk to parents and say that part of the parenting payment is being a parent and part of being a parent is sending your kid to school. If they are not sending them to school, I would genuinely ask the question as to whether they are fulfilling their obligations in a modern society to your children.


Noel Pearson said in his Quarterly essay that we need to start thinking about Indigenous Australia not as being doubly disadvantaged but as being able to walk in both worlds and having the best of both. It is completely possible that Indigenous Australia, if it thinks about where it wants to be a decade or a generation or more from now, will say: 'We can retain our connection to land but we do not have to live there 100 per cent of the time. We can go and live where there is work. We can orbit from our communities and have the best of mainstream culture while having our connection to spirituality and the land.' Perhaps that is where we are heading. But it is time for Indigenous Australia to have that debate with itself, because that is a uniquely Aboriginal discussion to be had. I know that if that was to occur then education would be a fundamental part of it.


From our point of view, in the mainstream we need to recognise the important role that mothers, aunties and grandmothers play in education. I cannot see why in remote Indigenous Australia mums and aunties cannot be more than just teacher aides; they can be fundamental parts of an auxiliary volunteer education arm in a school. They could come along and do what auxiliaries do in hospitals, which is support your own education system. We have seen at Batchelor college the important role that elders can play through staying in residential colleges. That should apply in every community in which there is a school. The last thing that we can afford is to set up creches, preschools and kindergartens where Aboriginal families are encouraged to hand the kids over the fence and walk away. That works if you have to go to work, but leaving Indigenous parents completely separated from the education system that is over that fence is not the future.


We may have to be novel; we may have to try new things. But there is one thing that we should never back away from here: we must achieve the same school attendance results that we achieve in the mainstream in remote Australia. That can only start by allowing education departments flexibility, supporting the principals and not making them the policeman at the same time and having Centrelink work very closely on early identification of kids who do not go to school.


In the end, I appreciate that not all parents have the capacity to ensure that their kids go to school every day. But that is a child welfare issue as much as it is an education one. We need to take those children and talk to the extended family—the aunties—about getting them to school. As I have said before, we need to get them engaged with extended family.


Once we achieve that, the final part is the economic implications of school attendance. Everywhere you go, you will see worldwide that an extra year of formal education can do incredible things to a family's earnings over a life. So our priority must be to keep Indigenous kids at school—and particularly when they hit grade 7, because we know that from grade 7 to grade 9 when there is no high school to go to we have a huge drop out of kids.


Those figures that tell us that only one in four Aboriginal kids who stay to grade 12 actually graduate from grade 12 present us with another challenge, and that is whether we should be shifting large numbers of remote and rural Indigenous Australians onto welfare through Newstart. Is it right that large numbers of kids in areas where employment levels are down below 25 per cent should be shifted straight on to welfare payments? My argument is that that mitigates against exactly what we are trying to do, which is engagement through workforce participation. What we know is that all of the antisocial elements—such as alcohol or drug abuse—will always be higher where workforce participation is lower. It simply stands to reason. There are certain social problems that can only be addressed by engaging a greater proportion of people in the workforce. So as long as those figures roll along at around 25 per cent, I argue we can never ever start to get any form of improvement in social issues such as drugs, petrol and alcohol. It starts at school: once you keep kids at school, you give them a chance to transition to meaningful work, training or orbiting. We can do that in the time we have here in public life. But it will take the enforcement of laws that exist in this country now, throughout central, remote and rural Indigenous Australia.

"Slipper, Peter, MP",Ind.,2011-07-04,"



Mr SLIPPER
 (Fisher—Deputy Speaker) (18:25):  At the outset, I am indebted to my friend the honourable member for Dawson for reminding me that private members business commences once again at 6.30, so my contribution will necessarily be brief tonight.


It is important, as a compassionate society, and as a society that seeks equality for all of its citizens, that we do whatever we can to improve educational outcomes for all Australians, including those Australians who are Indigenous. As a nation, we do not have a lot to be proud of with respect to Indigenous affairs. Governments on both sides, historically, have sought to solve the problem through throwing money at the problem, rather than focusing on practical outcomes and practical solutions to very substantial problems. The former Howard government had a much better policy than prior governments and it sought to achieve practical reconciliation and sought to improve outcomes. As chairman of the then House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, I was appalled to discover that Indigenous males live approximately 20 years less than non-Indigenous males. When one looks at Indigenous health, we see that so much more has to be achieved. Similarly with respect to education.


That is why I am very pleased to be able to support the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2011, although with some reservations. This bill is a positive bill. It builds on the initiatives of the former Howard Liberal-National government. It essentially seeks to extend the funding for two Howard government programs. It is unfortunate though that the Labor Party has constantly indulged in reviews. Simply giving a one-year extension in funding for the second year in a row does not permit long-term planning and does not build on the very positive outcomes which these programs have successfully achieved in the years since they were implemented.


The Indigenous Youth Mobility Program along with the Sporting Chance Program endeavour to assist Indigenous young people. The Indigenous Youth Mobility Program helps young Indigenous people move away from home to gain the skills they need to get a job in their community or elsewhere. The Sporting Chance Program is an Australia government initiative that started operations in schools in 2007, with the objective of encouraging positive educational outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students.


It really is important to make sure that Indigenous Australians have appropriate educational opportunities, because as we all know the key to success in life is a good education. If someone is able to read, write and count, then the employment prognosis is infinitely better. It really is important also to recognise that many in the Indigenous community have not enjoyed the opportunities of others in the wider Australian community and that governments must therefore focus on doing whatever they can to build positive futures for Indigenous people. The way to a positive future for Indigenous people is by building up the prospects of children and future generations of Indigenous people. It is important they are given the support they need to receive a good education and receive the guidance they require to make them move into a rewarding career where they can become well-rounded and contributing members of the community generally, and become positive role models for other Indigenous Australians. It is probable that the challenges and difficulties faced by the Indigenous community may be addressed and their harshness reduced if the current generation of young people are able to build their abilities and educational opportunities in the future.


Debate adjourned.

"Pyne, Christopher, MP",LP,2011-07-04,"



Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Manager of Opposition Business) (16:00):  I rise to speak on the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2011, which seeks to amend the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 to extend the existing funding arrangements, including indexation arrangements, for the 2013 calendar year. Initiatives included are the Indigenous Youth Mobility Program and the Sporting Chance Program. A similar bill entitled the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Bill 2010 was debated and passed last year and assented to on 29 June 2010. The bill provided a 12-month extension to program funding in order to align the funding with other school program funding periods.


The Sporting Chance Program and the Indigenous Youth Mobility Program are two initiatives of the previous coalition government that have been continued by the Labor government. Both programs have achieved success in both retaining students in school and increasing their participation and success rates. But Labor have not committed to long-term funding for these initiatives. Instead they have simply provided a 12-month extension in the last two budgets. This extension is described as being necessary to allow for the completion and release of the review of funding for schooling report at the end of 2011. By the government's own admission, the review is focused on the mainstream but there may be some implications for the design and operation of programs that run under the IE(TA) Act.


Longer term funding and therefore future planning for successful programs is now being held hostage to the Labor government's endless reviews. While the coalition have committed to considering the findings of the review of schools funding, chaired by David Gonski, there seems little reason why these programs should be extended for just one year rather than a longer period of time. One of the greatest complaints from service providers who deliver these programs on the ground is about the seemingly endless stop-and-start cycle of the funding commitments made by governments. The coalition understands the uncertainty created by such endless short-term commitments that are subject to review. However, the coalition will support the bill as drafted, as we recognise the value of these programs.


Sporting Chance is designed to use sport and recreation as a vehicle to engage Indigenous young people in their schooling. It consists of two elements: school based sports academies for secondary school students and education and engagement strategies for both primary and secondary school students. Indigenous secondary school students both male and female enrolled in a secondary school, particularly those deemed at risk, are eligible to participate in an academy. 'At risk' is assumed but is not limited to students who have been identified as having low attendance rates at school, literacy and numeracy skills below that of their fellow students or the national benchmarks, increased likelihood of not completing school or other social or behavioural concerns.


These projects utilise sport and recreation as a vehicle to increase the level of engagement of students, to improve their educational outcomes. It is important to note the development of sporting talents and participation in sport are subsidiary outcomes to the greater educational purpose of the program. According to the latest advice from the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations, in 2011 a total of 22 providers are to deliver 68 projects under the Sporting Chance Program. This is intended to benefit 11,000 primary and secondary school students at risk of not completing their schooling. I also note that the Australian Council for Educational Research will undertake an evaluation of the Sporting Chance Program. The evaluation, to be completed by mid-2011, is expected to measure the extent to which the Sporting Chance Program is meeting its objectives. It will be crucial in shaping the future direction of the program.


This bill will also provide funding for the Indigenous Youth Mobility Program to continue. This program supports Indigenous youth who wish to move away from home to gain qualifications that will increase their chance of obtaining employment in their community or elsewhere. It has been mainly targeted at youth between the ages of 16 and 24 from remote areas, but it is also available to other students from larger towns and cities if they relocate to an IYMP host location to take up an apprenticeship, a VET certificate or university course. The objectives of the IYMP are ambitious. The funding supports 324 Indigenous youth and young people at any point in time undertaking an Australian apprenticeship, a vocational education and training course or study at university. This funding goes a long way to give these young students access to safe, supported and culturally appropriate accommodation while they are studying. The key principle of the IYMP is to provide choice for Indigenous young people and their families.


For many Indigenous Australians, especially those in remote communities, life chances can be severely limited by a lack of opportunity, both in education and in employment. This program is vital as it seeks to redress that opportunity gap, at least in part, by providing access to a full range of post-secondary education and training options that smaller communities are simply not able to provide. IYMP also provides mentoring and other practical support to help these young people while they complete their qualifications. IYMP helps build numeracy, literacy, financial literacy and other life skills of young Indigenous people. The program is also helping remote community capacity building by providing opportunities for those communities' young people to train for and return to jobs that have often previously been taken up in Indigenous communities by non-Indigenous people.


While on the subject of initiatives, I would now like to turn to some other issues that seek to lift education attainment and participation for Indigenous students. A recent report produced by the Council of Australian Governments Reform Council on Labor's National Indigenous Reform Agreement with the states and territories demonstrates there has been little improvement in lifting Indigenous children's reading, writing and numeracy skills. This is despite the government's promise that it would halve the gap within a decade shortly after coming into office. Results indicate that despite significant investment under this partnership, there was only a minor improvement between Indigenous and non-Indigenous students at or above the national minimum standard in reading and writing and, to a lesser extent, in numeracy in the early years of schooling. Nationally the gap has increased in year 9 reading, in years 3 and 7 numeracy and in year 9 writing. Equally disappointing is that there has been no improvement in Indigenous students' attendance rates in year 10 in government schools since Labor came into office, despite having promised to halve the gap for Indigenous students in year 12 attainment or equivalent attainment by 2020.


Perhaps what is most concerning is that the government are unable to report on how they are meeting the target to ensure all Indigenous four year olds in remote communities have access to early childhood education within five years, with the report stating:


There is currently no source for nationally comparable data on Indigenous participation in early childhood education. 


Labor are also unable to report progress on their target to halve the gap in employment outcomes between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians within a decade. The report concluded:


No … data are available to measure the employment to population ratio for this target.


For the millions of taxpayers' dollars spent to deliver programs under this agreement, the government, at the very least, should be able to report on whether these programs are delivering. Approximately $723 million worth of measures have been set aside under the national partnership agreement to pursue reforms to improve young people's education attainment and transition from school and contribute towards achieving the COAG targets. Yet, this funding is being spent without adequately monitoring performance.


The recent report on the National Partnership for Indigenous Reform Agreement comes on top of damning COAG reports that were released in April for the $540 million National Partnership Agreement on Literacy and Numeracy. The April report for the National Partnership Agreement on Literacy and Numeracy found that assessing progress in lifting literacy and numeracy across Australia was difficult because the states and territories set their own benchmarks. This means that because there are so many differences in the numbers and types of schools involved, the report concluded that the transparency of reporting at a national level is questionable. The report urgently recommended that Labor improve clarity and transparency in reporting arrangements of the initiative. If the government cannot adequately measure and track progress under their national partnership agreements, it begs the question: how do they think they can get away with making grand statements they are transforming education if the evidence or data is not available to support these claims? Under Labor's national partnership agreement for the Building the Education Revolution program for government schools, they also failed to monitor the performance by the states and territories, and it was found that billions of dollars had been wasted under inefficient procurement arrangements. There is little hope of Labor delivering on its commitment to improve literacy and numeracy unless drastic changes are made to adequately monitor its investment. Sadly, Labor abolished the former coalition government's program to improve literacy and numeracy, which was to provide a $700 voucher for tutoring to help students who were not meeting minimum benchmarks. This policy was found to be 97 per cent effective in lifting student performance. Improving Indigenous participation and attainment in education and assisting students who are struggling to meet literacy and numeracy benchmarks is simply too important for funding to be handed over to the states and territories without ensuring that a system is put in place to monitor the return on this investment.


The computers-in-schools program, another initiative being delivered under the National Partnership Agreement with the states and territories, is also in strife. More than 3½ years, or seven school semesters, after Kevin Rudd made his election commitment that all these computers would be connected to fast 100-megabitts-per-second fibre, not a single computer has been connected by the government to 100-megabits-per-second fibre. As at 31 March 2011, only 434,000 computers had been delivered out of the 788,000 new computers needed to achieve the promised one-for-one ratio of computers per student. That is only 55 per cent of the computers needed to reach the goal of every secondary school student in years 9 to 12 having a computer, and it took the government three years to get there. Now the government claims that in nine months it will deliver the remaining 45 per cent of the computers. Having delivered 55 per cent in three years, it now claims it will deliver the remaining 45 per cent in nine months. It will need to more than double the current rollout in order to meet the deadline of 31 December 2011—and I think we all know that is a chimerical claim on the government's part.


I read an article by Noel Pearson last month in the Australian in which he agreed that the computers-in-schools program has been poorly implemented. He was writing about the success of the student education trust scheme operated by the Cairns based welfare reform organisation that he works with at Cape York Partnerships. Special trust accounts operate in welfare reform communities on Cape York Peninsula. Payments into these accounts are made by families on a voluntary basis and set aside specifically for education. A trustee oversees the accounts, and there is a process for families to use their saved funds to pay for computers, books, uniforms, excursions and other education expenses. He made the following observation:


Kevin Rudd's ""toolbox of the future"" program has been beset with problems. The opposition highlighted controversies about whether parents were going to be levied by schools to pay for maintenance and whether students could take computers home.


He went on:


This program was poorly conceived. The goal of comprehensive computer access for high school students was right, but it should have been done on a matching subsidy basis. Families should have been required to put in some of their money and be responsible for maintenance costs. They could then own the computer and the kids could take them home. Income-earning families could have been subsidised through a rebate and welfare families could have been assisted through SET-style facilities.


SET-style facilities could form the basis for solutions to school uniforms and other costs that another federal program is aimed at. Instead, all these programs have been conceived on the basis of a 100 per cent handout.


Noel has made the very valid point regarding computers in schools—one that the opposition has been making for such a long time—that when a program suffers from continuing cost blow-outs and is underperforming, one has to ask the question of whether there is a better way to meet the policy objectives.


I would also like to touch on another matter that has been brought to my attention as I continue to undertake my consultations with the various parts of the education sector. It is a program called MULTILIT, designed by Professor Kevin Wheldall at Macquarie University and delivered by the Exodus Foundation's Reverend Bill Crews. I met with the Exodus Foundation to talk about this program. It is used in tutorial centres for disadvantaged students at risk of dropping out of school. It is a direct, systematic teaching of the sounds of the English language and, importantly, has been a tremendous success wherever it has been used, particularly in Indigenous communities. It opened in 2009 for fewer than 200 struggling Indigenous students and has received partial funding under some of Labor's national partnerships in some states. A recent article in the Herald Sun reported on some of the results under this program in Darwin. The article included references to a report from the Exodus Foundation that tracked the progress of six Indigenous children at the Holy Spirit Catholic primary school, one of four Exodus centres in Darwin, in the 2008 to 2010 NAPLAN tests. To quote from the Herald Sun article:


In writing, for instance, in the 2008 NAPLAN test the group started in Year 3 right on the NT mean (or average) of 338, a full 70 points below the national mean. Then the NT and Exodus progress lines diverged as the Exodus children gobbled up the phonics program in 2009 and learned to read.


By Year 5 they had literally closed the gap, reaching the Australian average for their age group. It was the same story with reading.


Yet Multilit is struggling to attract extra funding to grow. The Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, the member for Kingsford Smith, has said that, due to budget constraints, there is no funding to expand the initiative. One of my primary concerns with the national partnership agreements is that programs that have the potential to be delivered and rolled out at a national level are constrained by the varying commitments made at the state level. There is no room for successful programs such as Multilit to flourish and grow. I am fortunate to be visiting the Cape York Peninsula in October this year, where Multilit also operates, and I am hoping that I get to see firsthand how this program works and how the results are yielded.


There is much more that I could speak about today on the topic of Indigenous education. Both sides of this House, I know, genuinely recognise the need to improve education outcomes and opportunities for young Indigenous people. The challenge is to do all that can be done to improve the current education reforms and the benefits that come from them. When a program such as Multilit has proven itself to be able to educate Indigenous young Australians to flourish and grow in national literacy and numeracy, it is a program that should be supported by government rather than starved of funds. I am certainly looking forward to hearing what David Gonski suggests in this area when his review of school funding is handed to the government. I hope that he will recognise, as the opposition has, the importance of programs like Multilit and the ability of local communities like those in Cape York and the programs run by the Exodus Foundation to actually address the real needs of Indigenous children on the ground, rather than assuming that all children will fit into a one-size-fits-all approach. With that, I commend the bill to the House.

"Neumann, Shayne, MP",ALP,2011-07-04,"



Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (16:17):  I speak in support of the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2011. Nothing defines the difference between the coalition and Labor more than their approaches to education. We have doubled the funding for education in this four-year period, while those opposite failed in this regard for so long. We have Closing the Gap targets in relation to Indigenous education, and we have an aspiration that, by 2018, another 100,000 Indigenous young people and older people will be in employment. We know that Treasury says that in the next two years we will need another 500,000 jobs in the Australian economy to keep our economy strong, to sustain the growth, to keep the employment going and to make sure our prosperity into the future matches what has happened in the past. Those opposite did not just disinvest in health, neglect infrastructure and fail in health and hospital outcomes but they also failed so much in terms of education and Indigenous issues. It was not just that they did not say sorry; they did not put the money towards Indigenous targets and programs. The commitment that we have is to close the gap, not just in jobs and health but in education as well. 


We are delivering real and measurable outcomes in this regard. We have supported 168 Indigenous businesses or community projects Australia wide and achieved over 43,000 job or training placements for Indigenous Australians. We have a commitment under our Indigenous Employment Program of $650 million to support businesses and community projects to make sure Indigenous job seekers get work. The precursor to getting a job is a good education, so it is absolutely vital that we do this. I have seen this locally in my electorate and I have seen it across my home state of Queensland. We are supporting Indigenous students from remote areas to access places in very high-performing schools such as Ipswich Grammar School and Ipswich Girls Grammar School. I have spoken to a number of the Indigenous students from places in Far North Queensland who are boarding at the grammar schools, where they are getting the best quality education possible in very high-performing schools. In particular, we are providing $20 million to the Australian Indigenous Education Fund, run by a private group of business people who want to make a difference in the lives of young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. By the way, they are committed to matching the government's contribution by raising another $20 million through business. Over the next 10 years this fund, of $40 million, will send 2,000 talented, young Indigenous students to very high-performing secondary schools, many of them in the Blair electorate—great schools such as Ipswich Grammar School and Ipswich Girls Grammar School.


The legislation that is before the chamber today amends the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act to extend the current quadrennium to incorporate the 2013 calendar year. It is about amending the appropriation of that legislation to formalise previous decisions the government has made, including, as I said, an election commitment to increase support for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students from remote communities to access schools both in my electorate and across the country.


This amending legislation will provide certainty until the government has had the opportunity to look at, consider and act upon the finding, due in 2011, by Professor Gonski, of the review of funding for schooling. We want to determine the funding. Hopefully, we will make some significant changes, because everyone who works in the sector knows that the SES model has not delivered the most just and fair outcome possible. Recently, I was in Ipswich speaking to some members from the Independent Education Union. They know that in private schools in my electorate the best outcomes have not been achieved. Recently, I was speaking to a number of public school teachers in my electorate—who were attending a Queensland Teachers Union conference there—from schools such as Minden State School, Ipswich Special School and Ipswich West Special School to find out what they thought. The legislation before us is about extending the funding until such time as the decision of the Gonski review is handed down and we can then act upon it.


I cannot let the member for Sturt get by without saying something about what he said in relation to some of their funding. There is a huge difference between us and them in terms of education. I accept that there is a bipartisan commitment to the targets with respect to closing the gap—halving the gap in reading, writing and numeracy achievements for Indigenous children within a decade and halving the gap for Indigenous students in year 12 attainment, or equivalent attainment, by 2020. I accept that those opposite have said that they want to agree to this. How we get there is another story. Those opposite do not think we are doing the right thing in that regard. We are backing up our commitment to closing the gap by not just putting initiatives or programs in place but also actually backing up with real money, real dollars. Yet those opposite seem to whinge, carry on and carp at education programs that we have brought in, when they know very well from visiting schools in their electorate that they are happy.


The member for Sturt waxed on about our computers in schools program, saying, 'You've only delivered 434,000 computers in local schools.' Go to schools like Bundamba State Secondary College, which has a very high number of Indigenous students and tell the students and the school administration that the computers in schools program is not successful and not good for their school. Go and tell them that. Go to Bremer State High School, which has a very high component of Indigenous students. Currently, that school has about 1,500 students. Next year, there will be 1,600 students.  Go and tell them that that program is not appropriate and it is not good for their education outcome. 


The other side went to an election last year proposing to abolish the computers in schools program and the trade training centres. All the time they claim that they are going to achieve good outcomes for education should they get on the treasury bench, but they are always critical of what we are doing. In this budget and in previous budgets and through this legislation here, we are benefiting not just non-Indigenous students but Indigenous students through things such as trade training centres. The Ipswich Trade Training Centre has both the Ipswich Girls Grammar School and the Ipswich Grammar School, where those Indigenous students are boarding under the programs covered by the legislation here. They attend the Ipswich Trade Training Centre, located at St Edmund's College, a Catholic school. There is a partnership of three schools. The Indigenous students boarding at those schools enjoy the benefit of the Ipswich Trade Training Centre.


And we have another one coming to my electorate: the Ipswich region trade training centre. It is going to be located at the Ipswich State High School, another school with a very high number of Indigenous students. Again they will benefit, not just from the BER program we put in for the Japanese immersion centre we have already located at that school but from the trade training centre. About 40 per cent of the kids who go to Ipswich State High School end up with trades. There are so many Indigenous students at that school. You only have to go to the assembly to realise that. But those opposite continue to oppose these initiatives, all of which would help not just non-Indigenous students but Indigenous students in my electorate.


And then we get to the BER funding—the multipurpose halls and libraries, all of which help non-Indigenous students and Indigenous students. The Ipswich-Logan corridor in South-East Queensland—I represent most of Ipswich—has a very high number of Indigenous students in its schools and Indigenous people in the local community, the jobs and the businesses across the area. Kambu Medical Centre, in my area, has a huge number of patients. It is a great Indigenous medical centre, well funded by the federal and state governments. I was there just last week talking about it.


It is not just in health and not just in jobs but in education that we are benefiting Indigenous students. The initiatives here are very important because the legislation talks about school programs, early childhood programs, vocational education programs and tertiary programs. The background to this legislation in terms of the programs is extremely important. The member for Sturt was talking about a number of programs which are important, and I think it is worth mentioning them as well. They are really important programs under this legislation. Being funded are things like the Indigenous education consultative bodies and the Indigenous Youth Leadership Program, which funds scholarships, boarding, tuition, leadership development and other educational costs for selected secondary and tertiary students aged to 25 attending participating schools—such as Ipswich Girls Grammar School and Ipswich Grammar School—and universities. Most of those young people in Ipswich come, as I said, from Far North Queensland. The Indigenous Youth Mobility Program assists young people with accommodation and other support to facilitate their take-up of apprenticeships, VET or university in 16 major centres nationally. You can see the benefit of those sorts of programs in South-East Queensland, with great TAFE institutions like the Bremer Institute of TAFE, located in the western corridor from Brisbane through to Ipswich as well. The objective of the Sporting Chance Program is to encourage improved educational outcomes for Indigenous students, boys and girls, using sport and recreation. That is so important.


Just a couple of weeks ago, we handed down the report Doing time—time for doing: Indigenous youth in the criminal justice system in the House of Representatives. As chair of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs I know we saw the value as we went around the countryside. There were 110 submissions and about 18 public hearings, including a roundtable at Redfern. We saw the benefit of Indigenous sporting programs. We saw the benefit of schools connecting to local Indigenous communities. We saw the benefit of mentors. We saw the benefit of real recognition of Aboriginal communities, the importance of cultural awareness and the importance of Indigenous language.


Programs such as these on the ground can make a difference in the lives of young people, making sure that they stay at school, do not engage in truancy and get an education. Getting an education is not just important to break the intergenerational cycle of poverty, violence, domestic abuse and incarceration but important for financial security as well. This legislation is really important because it is—




Mr Wyatt:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, under standing order 66A, I want to acknowledge the comments that the member is making. Can I ask him what the educational attainment levels are, what the outcomes are and what the employment opportunities are, given what he has been expanding upon?




Mr NEUMANN:
  No, I do not have to take the question.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms Vamvakinou
):

Correct.




Mr NEUMANN:
  Why doesn't he put that on notice if he is happy to do so. If I am making a speech—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Thank you. The member for Blair will continue.




Mr NEUMANN:
  If the member wants to put that question to the minister, he may do so—or ask a more important, relevant and sensible question than he asked in question time today. As to this particular legislation, I think it is important to note that what we have said in relation to the Gonski review, and what we have said to Indigenous students and to the private school community and the public school community, is that we in this government believe strongly that the arguments in relation to private versus public education are well and truly gone. We believe that parents have the right to send their children to whatever school they want and that kids have the right to go to a good public school as well. The public school system is the backbone of education. That is why so many students go to a state school, as we call them in Queensland, at primary school level, often then going on to schools such as St Edmund's College or Ipswich Grammar School or Ipswich Girls' Grammar School for seniors. But it is really important to make sure that we fund the system appropriately and well.


I have said before that this legislation gets us through to looking at the review and deciding how we are going to take funding in the future. But, as I have also said before, the previous government put in about $32.9 billion over the previous four years of their government. That was their commitment. That sounds like a lot of money, but we made a greater commitment to education: we put in $64.9 billion in funding for government and non-government schools over 2009 to 2012.


That is very important. There are also the national partnerships which assist not just Indigenous but also non-Indigenous students. We can see that. I was recently at Leichardt State School, a school in what we used to call a working-class area in my electorate, rebuilt through the State Schools of Tomorrow program and the state government's work in that school, and rebuilt, through the BER funding, with a new multipurpose hall and new library—a national partnership school which has made a huge difference. If you go there you will see that the connectivity between the local Indigenous community and the school is very strong—really strong. Lee Gerchow, the principal, is doing a fantastic job. And that is the difference that good funding for Indigenous students and non-Indigenous students can make in an area where there is a high Indigenous population. You can see that. We have seen the NAPLAN results. We have seen the improvements in attendance at that school. We have seen the improvements in literacy and numeracy. I support this legislation because it will make a big difference in the lives of the schools in my community. (Time expired)

"Andrews, Kevin, MP",LP,2011-07-04,"



Mr ANDREWS
 (Menzies) (16:32):  I also rise to speak on the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2011. At the outset, may I comment on the question asked by my friend the member for Hasluck because it goes to the core of the issue, and that is: what are the educational outcomes that are being achieved by Indigenous children? That is a question which should be answered. It is at the core, as I said, of this and other legislation and programs. When millions and millions of dollars are spent on programs but they are not raising the educational outcomes for Indigenous children then questions should be raised about the programs upon which that money is being spent. That is not because there is any sense that it is inappropriate to spend the money; of course it is appropriate to spend money. But one must also ask whether or not the outcomes are being achieved, because, if they are not, then maybe there are other ways of spending money that will achieve the outcomes.


This bill amends the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 to extend the existing funding arrangements, including indexation arrangements for the 2013 calendar year. Initiatives included are the Indigenous Youth Mobility Program and the Sporting Chance Program. After passing through the parliament, a similar bill, entitled Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2010, received assent on 29 June 2010. That bill provided a 12-month extension to program funding in order to align the funding with other school program funding periods.


Sporting Chance and the Indigenous Youth Mobility Program are two initiatives of the previous coalition government that have been continued by the Rudd-Gillard Labor government. Both programs have achieved success in retaining students at schools as well as increasing their participation and success rates. The Gillard Labor government have not committed to long-term funding for these initiatives. Instead, they have simply provided a 12-month extension in the last two budgets.


The Sporting Chance Program commenced in 2007 under the then coalition government with the objective of encouraging positive educational outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. In 2011, a total of 22 providers delivered 68 projects under the Sporting Chance Program for up to 11,000 primary and secondary school students at risk of not completing their schooling. The use of sport as a key engagement tool in assisting in the educational development of young Indigenous people has been successful. The Indigenous Youth Mobility Program helps young Indigenous people move away from their home to gain the skills one needs to get a job, whether it is in their community or somewhere else. Youth Indigenous people aged 16 to 24 from remote areas can relocate to a program host location to undertake post-secondary education and training options. Training options include Australian apprenticeships, vocational education and training, and higher education options that lead to qualifications in nursing, teaching, business administration and accounting, to name but a few possibilities.


This extension is described as being necessary to allow for the completion and release of the review of funding for schooling report due sometime in 2011. By the government's own admission, the review is focused on the mainstream but there may be some implications for the design and operation of these programs. Longer term funding, and therefore future planning, for successful programs is now being held hostage to the Gillard Labor government's endless reviews. This is yet another example of the Rudd-Gillard government's approach to policy and law-making: indecision, ineptness, reviews and, of course, short-term fixes. Labor has failed to pay due attention to what is an important issue and failed to provide any long-term commitment to programs that are improving school attendance and completion rates.


The coalition supports this bill. It builds on the good work done by the coalition in introducing programs, but there is a stark difference, I am afraid, between the coalition and the government. We make decisions; we take action. This Labor government is crippled by indecision and inaction.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2011-07-04,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (16:36):  I rise today to speak in support of the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2011. In doing so, I am reminded of some comments I made at a recent event for Mabo Day. In honouring the life of Eddie Mabo, I stated that this country had come a long way in achieving a true reconciliation between Indigenous and white Australia.


It was a proud day for me as a citizen of this country to watch the former Prime Minister make a historic apology to Australia's Indigenous peoples. However, an apology alone is not enough. While important in acknowledging past wrongdoings and hurt, an apology cannot fix today's problems. If we are to achieve a true reconciliation, we must bridge the gap in health, education, jobs and opportunities that exists between Indigenous Australians and non-Indigenous Australians. In the 21st century we should not accept that Aboriginal children have lower life expectancies than their non-Aboriginal peers. We should not accept that they do not have the same outcomes in education. We should not accept that they do not have the same meaningful opportunities for work. Most importantly, we should not accept that it is beyond the people in this place to fix this problem, to ensure that there is no difference between opportunities for all of Australia's children. We have to work hard as a nation to bridge the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. We have to work hard to deliver the same opportunities to all Australians regardless of their background. I believe that to do otherwise would be a serious failure of government, a serious failure of parliament and a serious failure of each member of this House.


For this reason, I am very pleased to be able to speak this afternoon on this bill and on what this government is doing to support Indigenous education. I have said many times in this House that education through all levels of life is a silver bullet to solving poverty, improving health outcomes and increasing employment and productivity. I am very pleased to be in this place and to be part of a government that has education at its core—to be part of a government that understands the great transformative power of education to build confidence, to create opportunities and to deliver happiness and hope to so many Australians, not least of which are Indigenous Australians. Given that the government have an education reform agenda, it should come as no surprise to any member of this House that our approach to closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous includes comprehensive policies designed to support the education of young Indigenous people. This bill provides a raft of programs to encourage and enhance the educational outcomes of students. In my electorate there are a number of programs that are helping Indigenous families and students get the education that is their right as Australians. The federal government has provided as part of the Parent and Community Engagement Program almost $360,000 for the Northside Community Service's Tuck-In education program that encourages parents to play an active role in their child's learning. It also strengthens the community's capacity to involve themselves in the school community.


Similarly, over $70,000 was provided to the Tuggeranong Child and Family Centre for its Our Mob Tuggeranong project that builds the knowledge of Indigenous parents, grandparents, family members and carers so they can engage with confidence and effectiveness with their school communities. There is also half a million dollars for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community literacy project. The project aims to improve the literacy skills of at-risk Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students in years 6 to 9.


Finally, 68 of 72 Canberra schools are members of the Dare to Lead program, a $13.6 million program that provides principals and other school leaders with local school situation strategies that promote awareness and provide the drive to address educational outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. Through professional development and cultural awareness activities, workshops and seminars, principals and school leadership teams are able to enhance their understanding of the educational needs of these students and to promote reconciliation in all schools.


These are four local Canberra projects but they exemplify what this act is doing nationwide. In highlighting these examples, I want to pay tribute to the teachers and the schools, to the doctors and nurses, to the community groups and to the Indigenous community themselves who are responsible for the ongoing success of these programs. While it is our responsibility in this House to provide the leadership and funding that allows these successful programs to continue, we should not forget that it is these individuals who are responsible for delivering the success of these programs on the ground day in, day out. It is these dedicated individuals and organisations that are making the changes that must be made person by person, family by family, community by community.


In my electorate, I have seen firsthand the work of dedicated teachers at Richardson Primary School and their commitment to Indigenous education. I have seen the fantastic work of the Winnunga aboriginal health service down in Narrabundah and its dedicated staff who provide a raft of initiatives and programs for people in dental health, diabetes health, infant welfare health, maternal health—a range of programs there; just a phenomenal organisation. It is through the work of these individuals passionate about the cause and committed to the very end that the gap will be bridged, and we must do what we can to support their efforts.


In this light, the amendment before this House today extends the funding for the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 to incorporate the 2013 calendar year to line up with the Schools Assistance Act 2008, also recently extended, and timing of the review of funding for schooling. It will appropriate $159 million for 2013 to continue to fund those programs I have mentioned. The government does this to give sufficient time to consider any recommendations from the review of education funding while also ensuring that adequate and appropriate consultation is given to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and organisations. This is appropriate as nowhere is there a greater need to improve education than for our Indigenous communities.


I acknowledge that much has been achieved and there have been real successes in this area; nevertheless there is much more that still needs to be done. This will require an ongoing commitment from government across Australia, and I believe that this government has that commitment. This is a government that has the drive and the will to see this through to make policies that close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. In my own life a good education changed what was possible for me, and I believe the same is very much true for ensuring what is possible for Indigenous Australians: it is the great enabler. In speaking on another bill in this place, I said that I would always stand up here in support of those bills that seek to enhance the access and outcomes of education for all Australians. I do so again today and I commend this bill to the House.

"Randall, Don, MP",LP,2011-07-04,"



Mr RANDALL
 (Canning) (16:44):  I am pleased to speak on the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2011. This bill seeks to amend the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000. The bill seeks to extend the funding arrangements, including indexation arrangements, for the 2013 calendar year for non-Abstudy payments. Non-Abstudy payments include funding for a number of Indigenous school programs, including the Indigenous Youth Mobility Program and the Sporting Chance Program, which I want to talk about mostly because I am sure everyone else has covered every other aspect.


I support his bill but I have a number of concerns. The current bill seeks to extend the current funding arrangements only for another 12 months out, for the 2013 calendar year. The Labor government has failed to provide funding security for this education sector and instead has simply provided for 12-month extensions in the last two budgets. Extensions are no good. Ongoing funding in the forward estimates is what is really needed. The government claims that a short-term, 12-month commitment is necessary because of the Review of Funding for Schooling report, which is due some time later this year. The binding up of legislation through inquiry after inquiry and review after review is just typical of this current Labor government, which cannot make effective and timely decisions. This is seen in everything they do.


Thankfully the Labor government was wise enough to continue two important programs originally initiated by the coalition government. They are the Sporting Chance and Indigenous Youth Mobility programs. I could say much about these and talk about the fact that the Indigenous education programs are something that all governments commit to, and some eventually get somewhere towards their commitments.


The program I mainly want to talk about, Sporting Chance, has been a most successful program for Indigenous boys. The program was originally begun by Gerard Neesham of the Clontarf Football Academy. For those who are not aware, I will give a brief history. Clontarf is a former Christian Brothers school on banks of the river in Perth. It fell on hard times and then, in 2000, with a group of just 25 boys Gerard Neesham went there with a number of other school teachers who had decided to do something for Indigenous boys. For those who do not know Gerard Neesham, he was a very good AFL player who played for the Sydney Swans, amongst others. He also played football for Graylands Teachers College, where I knew him. He and I played together on that side. I think he made me look good! Eventually Gerard was the inaugural coach for the Fremantle Dockers. So his football pedigree is unbelievable. His whole family, the Neeshams, the Regans and the Millers are legendary in that area.


For Gerard to begin this, post his Dockers coaching, was something quite admirable. That is when I reconnected with him, after teachers college. With the support of the federal and state governments and the private sector the group of 25 boys grew into 400 boys in six academies. I first met Gerard out there under the ATSIC days when Philip Ruddock went out there to help him get money he was owed by ATSIC—$30,000, which was not much at the time. He then came to Canberra with Ross Kelly, the chairman of the Clontarf Foundation and put a case to the then education minister and, interestingly, his staff member Alan Tudge, who is now the member for Aston, came up with $100,000, which was just fantastic. Gerard then got bogged and came back with Ross Kelly again and asked for $1 million to continue his program. Gerard got this, on behalf of the foundation, through Dr Nelson.


I said to Gerard at the time, 'Be careful whatever you do. Once you start rolling out away from one academy you will lose control of the levers. You need to be hands-on yourself.' I was wrong because Gerard was able to roll out a number of academies in Western Australia by using ex-AFL footballers and people in the AFL and football industry who were very good at what they did. So, his selection of personnel has been the secret to his ability to run academies. The other part of his successful template is that he attaches himself to existing schools. For example, I went to the Broome High School when he launched a program there. I was representing Julie Bishop at the time, the federal minister. State members of parliament also attended, as well as Michael Chaney from the NAB and a representative of Goldman Sachs, who were there to help with private sector funding. This model does not rely on one bucket of money; it relies on money from three sources: federal money, state money and corporate money. This means that it is not dependent on one or the other and that means that should one decide to not deliver then the program would not be left stranded.


Gerard was invited by Clare Martin, the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory at the time, to go into the Northern Territory. Some of the Aboriginal communities there, as we know, had become very dysfunctional. But what Aboriginal boys in particular do know about is AFL football. As Gerard tells me, you can ask any boy anywhere in Australia whether they know who the full forward for St Kilda is or who plays centre for Carlton and they can tell you. They wear their footy jumpers with pride in the heat and in the cold in the outback. AFL is a currency among Indigenous kids.


Why is this template so successful? Because it gets them to school with the hook of playing football. Some of them have gone on to be AFL footballers. There are quite a number who are currently playing AFL who came through the Clontarf academy. But the reality is that very few of them end up in the AFL. They end up playing football, but they go to school. That is the secret of the whole program: they go to school. When they get to school, their health improves. Their dysfunctional behaviour improves. Gerard quotes the figure of how much it costs to keeps a boy at Clontarf against the figure of how much it costs to keep him incarcerated. It is light years away. A program like this sees boys not only improve their health and their behaviour but also get into jobs. Clontarf delivers them not only to year 12 but also into employment and the workforce after year 12.


At the moment, over 80 per cent of Clontarf year 12 students are placed in employment or training within six months of completing school. Of the 160 boys who completed year 12 last year, 75 are currently in employment or further training. This goes on. The fact is that this program is highly effective because it gets the boys to school and gets them into a pattern. They stop sleeping in. They get out of their dysfunctional environment, because they are among peers. And this is where Gerard is also successful: he brings in Aboriginal mentors, particularly from the footballing fraternity, and these kids look up to them. They want to be at school.


Clontarf has a very ambitious program. Dare I say that this transcends both sides. This is not a Liberal Party thing or a Labor Party thing; this is a bipartisan arrangement. I mentioned Julie Bishop and Brendan Nelson. But when the government changed in 2011, Kevin Rudd, in an article from Thursday 11 December 2008—and Kevin loved a photo and next to the article there he is with the Clontarf boys in Perth—promised $10 million. And that was delivered. The state government under Alan Carpenter delivered his moneys, $4 million. The corporate world continues, through BHP and others, with their support.


The only thing that I will say to the members opposite is that the money that comes through the federal government and other governments is always a bit slow, because it is handed out piecemeal. There needs to be an ongoing commitment to the funding of these programs into the future, because their outcomes are so successful.


There have been other instances in which Indigenous people post their football life decide to start up some sort of program for Aboriginal kids. It seldom works. They get themselves a car and an office—in other words, a job—and there is no widespread effect; it is a one-man band. Eventually, once the money has gone, the program goes. This is a program for the future. This is a program, dare I say, is in the business of saving a generation of Aboriginal boys. We almost lost a generation of Aboriginal young men through alcoholism and dysfunction, mainly because, as most people know, they became dependent on welfare and the Centrelink model. This is getting them back into real jobs, getting them away from alcohol, getting them away from dysfunctional behaviour and showing them that there is another way. This does not just apply to football—and I will get onto that in a moment for my learned friend from New South Wales, and demonstrate that this model can be rolled out there. In Western Australia there are 21 academies with 1,335 participants. At one stage, three out of every four boys in year 12 were in the Aboriginal academies doing year 12. It was something that was unheard of—17-year-old Aboriginal boys doing year 12. In the Northern Territory there are currently 15 academies with 1,015 boys. In Victoria there are five academies with 190 boys. There is nothing in Queensland and nothing in South Australia.


The federal government currently contributes one-third of the Clontarf Foundation's operating costs—that is, $5.7 million per annum or $2,244 per participant. There is a way forward, and they want the federal government to continue its commitment. In the 2014-15 forward years they would like to have 28 academies in Western Australia with over 2,000 boys; 19 academies in the Northern Territory, with 1,490 boys; and five academies in Victoria with 550 boys—because there is a low Indigenous population in Victoria.


We know that New South Wales does not have AFL but the template works for football, and a well-known rugby enthusiast and champion, Smiley Johnson, is involved in this program and he is going to be part of the template in New South Wales to roll out this program for rugby for Indigenous boys. They are looking to have 44 of these academies and to include 2,820 boys. There is the same thing with rugby in Queensland. Big news: we have got the State of Origin coming up this Wednesday night and we know how big it is. They are looking to have 30 academies with 1,740 boys. In South Australia they are looking to have eight academies with 400 boys.


So we want to go from 2,500 boys in this current financial year to more than 9,000 boys. To make this happen, the federal government has to commit to an increment of $4 million a year so that they can continue building these academies on a sound footing. If the $4 million is not committed over and above current funding per annum, they cannot do this, because it ratchets up the other help from the state governments. They are obliged to come in with complementary funds, as is the private sector.


This is an outstanding opportunity for us to do something meaningful and real through the sporting champions funding for Indigenous boys. Dare I say it will work for Indigenous girls, with netball and other sports. But, as Gerard says to me, where the boys are the girls will be—and, if you go out to Clontarf, you see that the girls are at school, because the boys are at school. That is how it works.


I would advise those who want to criticise and say, 'This is a private arrangement,' et cetera, that this is audited and all the salaries are benchmarked on tertiary pay scales for principals, teachers et cetera. I implore this House to continue the support for this marvellous program for now and into the future. We know that there are lots of reasons that Aboriginal men go so well in the AFL. They seem to be particularly adept at it. It is a bit like the young men from the Balkans—the Jakoviches et cetera. They seem to have the physical shape to play football. Aboriginal kids from the Tiwi Islands through to Tasmania are really good footballers. The fact that about 2½ per cent of the population are Indigenous and yet more than six per cent of the AFL population are Indigenous says something about the ability of Aboriginal people in this sport. I commend this bill to the House and I implore the government to continue its meaningful and ongoing funding, because the program and the template work.

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2011-07-04,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (16:59):  The 13th of February 2008 was a historic day for Australia. On that day, for the first time, an Australian Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, officially apologised to the stolen generations. This was a historic moment for Australia—a moment when we acknowledged the tragedies of the past and looked with a fresh eye to the future, a future in which there is no gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians in life expectancy, educational achievement or economic opportunity.


When the Labor government took office in 2007, we inherited an appalling legacy of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander inequalities. In the areas of housing, poverty and health, large gaps persisted under the Howard government. We know that Indigenous Australians have a substantially shorter life expectancy. When a young Indigenous baby is born, he or she can expect to live a decade or two fewer than a non-Indigenous baby. It should be simply unacceptable to all of us in this place. It is something that must change—something that will be changed.


Another main issue is improving the educational levels of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. Improving education is fundamental to improving welfare and improving living standards. This government has set out to close the gaps in Indigenous disadvantage. We have set out to close the life expectancy gaps, to close the child mortality gaps, to close the gaps in employment opportunities and to close the gaps in access to early childhood education and educational attainment.


Horace Mann, the early 19th century US congressman and education reformer, whose personal political persuasions were actually more closely akin to those of members opposite, once stated: 


Education … beyond all other devices of human origin, is a great equalizer of conditions of men—the balance wheel of the social machinery.


This Labor government shares those sentiments, regardless of the political alignment of their initial spokesperson. The importance of education extends well beyond partisan politics.


Education's place in helping to overcome inequality and disadvantage was reinforced for me when I visited Cape York last year and earlier this year, travelling with the House Standing Committee on Economics. Our task was to consider Indigenous economic development, so I used the chance to ask some of the witnesses about the local schools. It was an issue that had come up when we were chatting outside during the coffee break but which did not seem to be getting air time inside the room. Phyllis Yunkaporta, a witness appearing before the committee, told me:


The education system, as I knew it before, has been of low standard. The curriculum in the past, as it is in all cape Aboriginal communities, has been of very low standard. By the time our children go out to mainstream schools they are hardly there—a child in grade 8 still has the understanding of a child in grade 1. Speaking for Aurukun, I was one of the persons who were invited to the States last October; I went to New York and Los Angeles visiting African-American schools. What we have brought back to Aurukun is a new kind of teaching method and we are having that implemented in the school. Of course it took time. At the beginning it pretty much had been, in my words, chaos before that. Since having this new program come in, if you come to the classrooms in Aurukun the kids are fully focused. This new method of teaching has got them going. The teacher is full-on with the tasks given and you cannot believe it when you enter those classrooms—it is as if some of those kids are play-acting. They are not; they are just full-on, focused. I guess in time we have to have expectations for our children to be educated in a way where they have to balance both worlds—the Western world and the traditional way. Of course we want them to hang onto the traditional way because that is where they are going to be identifying themselves for the future. And with them having to venture out into mainstream, we want them to compete. It is a competitive world out there. We want our black little kids to start taking on the world. That is the aim of all this.


No words could be closer to the truth. In work that I did as a professor of economics at ANU with Xiaodong Gong, which was published in Education Economics, we looked at the educational attainment gap in Australian schools. We found that when Indigenous children first enter school they are about a year of educational achievement behind their non-Indigenous peers. We also found that by the time Indigenous children have got to the end of primary school the gap has widened—it is then about two years of educational attainment. Our view is that, perversely, that is something to be optimistic about, because there is something going on in the school system—a system which I think government policies are far more amenable to fixing than would have been the case had we discovered that, for example, the gap was already there when the children first entered school. So that work gives me optimism; it gives me a sense that we can do something about closing the gaps between the performance of Indigenous and non-Indigenous children.


But those gaps, make no mistake, are substantial. In 2006, 58 per cent of Indigenous children were rated by their teachers as having low academic performance. In contrast, only 19 per cent of non-Indigenous students were rated as having low academic performance. Of those who started year 11, only 22 per cent of Indigenous students went on to complete the year 12 certificate, compared to 62 per cent of non-Indigenous students. These figures provide some sense of the magnitude of the task faced by this Labor government in addressing the gross inequality in educational attainment in Australia.


Since 2008, the Gillard government has invested over $51 million in Indigenous literacy and numeracy projects. Over 20,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students in over 670 schools across the nation have benefited directly from this assistance. Over the 2009-12 period this government has invested $56.4 million nationally to expand literacy and numeracy programs for Indigenous students. We have provided professional support to assist teachers to develop personalised learning plans for their students. We now have 200 additional teachers in the Northern Territory. The $2½ billion Smarter Schools National Partnerships, which holds Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education as a key focus, has been introduced to target disadvantage and to contribute to improving literacy and numeracy outcomes. We have also approved more than $25 million for 17 projects, over 2011-12, to continue these efforts.


We have seen the early results of such initiatives. The share of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders obtaining year 10 and year 12 certificates has gradually grown, as has the number of Indigenous students undertaking university education and achieving bachelor degrees. It is important that we continue to track these measures and hold our higher education institutions to account to ensure that the educational outcome that we want—boosting bachelor graduation—is actually achieved. It is my view that we should ask universities to publish as much data as they can not only on the number of Indigenous students who are accepted into the institutions but also on the persistence of those students through the system; the ability of our universities to hold on to Indigenous university students at the same rate as they hold on to non-Indigenous university students. Improving the standard of education among Indigenous communities is at the heart of this government's endeavours to affect broad social and cultural change and break the cycle of disadvantage that plagues these communities.


There are three initiatives that I am particularly proud of in my electorate of Fraser—Learning Journeys, the Indigenous Youth Leadership Program and the Indigenous Youth Mobility Program. Learning Journeys, which is administered by the Northside Community Service, is a $359,000 program which started in May 2010 and is expected to finish at the end of June 2012. It focuses on the development and implementation of creative and innovative approaches to improving educational outcomes for young Indigenous people as well as on improving parental engagement in schools and with education providers and on the engagement of parents with children's education at home. The project focuses on motivating and encouraging adults within families to play an active role in their children's learning journey. This is the kind of active role that we know is so important to educational success. It aims to strengthen the capacity of communities to become active in the school community and to feel respected and empowered to comment on and contribute to the development of schools. It has been a little over 12 months since the program's commencement but already we can point towards a number of outcomes: 82 per cent of parents involved have reported a greater engagement with the local schools; 76 per cent of parents have reported increased presence in the local school community; and 58 per cent of parents say they attended extracurricular events at their school. 


The Indigenous Youth Leadership Program likewise is helping to close the gap in Indigenous education disadvantage through support for disadvantaged Indigenous students, mostly from remote and regional areas. There are now six tertiary education students studying in my electorate of Fraser with the support of an Indigenous Youth Leadership Program scholarship. I would like to pay tribute to those students and wish them all the best in their continued studies.


Thirdly, the Indigenous Youth Mobility Program supports young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students aged 16 to 24. This program is administered in the ACT by Auswide Projects, which was originally assisting around 16 participants and due to an increase in demand has now increased its number of places to 24 participants within the ACT.


It is absolutely imperative to the welfare and the quality of life of Indigenous communities that we maintain these efforts. The Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Bill will ensure the government's good work to date will continue. The current Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act provides funding over the 2009-12 period and this bill will extend the current quadrennium to incorporate the 2013 calendar, bringing it into line with the recently extended Schools Assistance Act. This will coincide with the timing of the review of funding for schooling, allowing the government to consider the findings of that report and determine the future structure of funding run under that program.


By re-aligning the legislation to reflect the Schools Assistance Act, we can make sure that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education programs are afforded the attention they deserve. It allows us to engage in close consultation with Indigenous communities and create a cooperative and inclusive learning environment. Such a learning environment has been brought home to me in my own electorate of Fraser, which includes the Jervis Bay Territory. In May I visited Jervis Bay Primary, a school for the children of Defence Force personnel serving at HMAS Creswell and the children of the Wreck Bay Indigenous community. The school has the lowest ICSEA score of any school in my electorate but, when you do a like-schools comparison—as is possible under the government's terrific MySchool website—you actually see that on a like-schools basis Jervis Bay Primary is one of the top performing schools in the ACT system on pretty much every measure you look at.


Jervis Bay Primary is also one of the most beautiful schools in the electorate of Fraser. The oval looks out across the kangaroos to the Pacific Ocean. You get a real sense that this natural environment is part of what builds a strong sense of community in the local school. There are only 84 students, 63 per cent of whom are Indigenous, but everyone seems to know everyone else. As I walked through the K-2 room with two women from the P&C, I heard behind me one of the boys say, 'What are you doing here, Mum?'


I would like to pay tribute to the principal, Bob Pastor, who coordinated a Learning 4 Life meeting, a really valuable initiative which brings together representatives from the local school community as well as Vincentia High School, the main school into which Jervis Bay Primary feeds, the University of Wollongong, Noah's Ark, Booderee National Park, and local preschools and childcare centres. The group promotes the value of education to Indigenous parents and students, with involvement right through the education spectrum from early childhood right up to TAFE and university. It is that lifelong learning philosophy that pervades the bill that is before us today.


The existing range of programs funded under the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act are aimed at improving educational outcomes for Indigenous people, taking a well-rounded approach to improving education outcomes and life opportunities for Indigenous students. The programs are designed to build strong relationships between Indigenous communities—children, parents and teachers—and the government to ensure that specific needs are met with targeted and effective attention. Such programs include the Sporting Chance Program, the Indigenous Youth Leadership Program, the Indigenous Youth Mobility Program, and the Parental and Community Engagement Program. These programs that are delivered under the act are complementary to mainstream schooling activities. The extension of funding for such programs until the end of 2013 will ensure providers, as well as the Indigenous communities, have certainty of continued program operation. I would like to use this opportunity to commend the bill to the House and extend my praise to all those who have worked in its drafting. (Time expired)

"Wyatt, Ken, MP",LP,2011-07-04,"



Mr WYATT
 (Hasluck) (17:14):  I rise today to support the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2011, which extends the funding arrangements for the 2013 calendar year. I do so on the basis of my experience within a raft of key areas—not only my personal experiences over the last 59 years but also my experience of involvement with the Commonwealth Schools Commission when it was in existence, and the structures that sat underneath it; of the National Aboriginal Education Committee; of the period of the AESIP or Aboriginal Education Strategic Initiatives Program, which became IESIP when 'Aboriginal' was changed to 'Indigenous'; and of two MCEETYA taskforces.


'Education is the great engine of personal development. It is through education that the daughter of a peasant can become a doctor, that the son of a mineworker can become the head of a mine, and that the child of a farm worker can become the president of a great nation.' That is a set of words that have always been dear to me because Nelson Mandela goes to the crux of the importance of education in all its facets. The programs that are there to support and make a difference are absolutely critical. So this bill is important.


I also want to commend both the member for Canberra and the member for Fraser—the member for Fraser in particular, for having gone out and sat with people and listened to their views and heard their opinions. That is an important element if we are going to change things. Our destiny is shaped by the choices we make and the decisions each of us enact in our professional, personal and social pathways. What is critical to bringing about success is our individual preparedness to challenge and overcome barriers and to deal with the setbacks to our dreams and aspirations. That is often underpinned by good education. A well-grounded education is fundamental to success, although many have transcended this through personal drive—and all of us have experiences of people who did not finish school but who became highly successful and for whom every interaction with another individual provides an avenue to acquire knowledge, information and experiences that enhance their repertoire of skills.


The preliminaries to the National Indigenous Reform Agreement Intergovernmental Agreement on Federal Financial Relations articulate the challenge for all Australian governments:


Despite the concerted efforts of successive Commonwealth, State and Territory governments to address Indigenous disadvantage, there have been only modest improvements in outcomes in some areas such as education and health, with other areas either remaining static or worsening. Even in those areas where there have been improvements, the outcomes for Indigenous Australians remain far short of the outcomes for non-Indigenous Australians.


In December 2007, the Council of Australian Governments, or COAG, agreed to the National Indigenous Reform Agreement partnership between all levels of government. It included a number of other elements in terms of NPAs that went to education, employment, early years and health, but particularly education. It also provided links to those national agreements and national partnership agreements across COAG, which include elements targeted at closing the gap in Indigenous affairs, and particularly targeted at Indigenous disadvantage. The National Indigenous Reform Agreement is the basis of this reform, and the bill, in promulgating funding for another 12 months, is important in achieving closure of those gaps. COAG recognises that individuals and communities should have the opportunity to benefit from the mainstream economy through real jobs, business opportunities, economic independence and wealth creation. Ultimately, Indigenous economic development is about providing Indigenous people with the same opportunities as non-Indigenous Australians. They will not achieve this universally, but education is the cornerstone of change and a prerequisite for employment within our contemporary society for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians.


I was invited to write the foreword to the Western Australian Aboriginal Child Health Survey Volume 3: the Educational Experiences of Aboriginal Children and Young People, which was officially launched on 24 March 2006. I will cite from what I wrote. Of the numerous research projects into Aboriginal education there is none so profound as the Western Australian Aboriginal Child Health Survey, Improving the educational experiences of Aboriginal children and young people. It provided confronting evidence that the benefits of education remain poorly realised by the vast majority of Western Australian Aboriginal children, and you could translate that across all jurisdictional regions of this country. The more fundamental issue is the failure over the past 35 years by education providers to improve the educational outcomes of the vast majority of Aboriginal students. It is important to accept the reality that failure over the past 30 years to improve educational outcomes of the vast majority of Aboriginal school children has affected three generations of Aboriginal children and young people who are highly likely to have limited access to lifelong learning, employment and economic opportunities.


There has been tacit acceptance of the nonachievement of educational standards by Aboriginal children and young people, and the resultant acceptance of this lack of educational success has had a cumulative effect—hence my question to the member for Blair. It is fine talking about programs, initiatives and funding, but what of the educational attainments at the end of 12 years of schooling? What of the outcomes after tertiary level education, be they through the vocational education training sector or through the universities? If our results show that the proportion has not increased on a comparative basis to Australian society in mainstream youth and young people going through, then we have a challenge that we still have to address, and we certainly need to look at those targeted outcomes.


It is based on the belief that Aboriginal children and young people will never reach their full potential and if they fall behind society then welfare will protect them. Their low level of educational success is accepted as a normative expectation. This has to change. If we are to change the outcomes, if we are to close gaps and if we are to take the advice that the women gave the member for Fraser, and others that I have been involved with, then we have to raise the bar. We have to say that programs are fine—funding does not solve the problems that become inherent when you fail within systems, because the outcomes that any society seeks will not be attained. Certainly, there is resentment at the level of funding that is channelled into welfare and supporting people who become passive recipients of programs and services. I would want them to be responsive. I would want them to be shaping the direction for the future. I would want them to be, as you described, part of the process, and where people are part of the process, things change. It has become acceptable for Aboriginal children and young people to work at their level unless it becomes problematic or the sociopolitical structures are pressured to bring about change. There is a moral obligation to redress the needs of Aboriginal children and young people to be successful and to achieve the level of educational attainment that builds social and human capital to be achievers in the Australian and global community.


The act as it stands has provided numerous opportunities over a period of time but I think the accountability that I wish we could emulate in what we are seeking in the new structures for the health reform agenda and the accountability of states and territories that go to some critical elements of health reform should be equally applied with passion within this arena. Otherwise, we are inconsistent in the way we address the gap that exists, because the problem with the lack of education and the lack of attainment is that we then see the cyclic pattern of people with generations of family members who have never been employed because their education attainment does not make them competitive within the society in which they move, live, work and play. We have to change that.


There is bilateral agreement. Those societies which continue to invest in the education, training and employment of their people have prospered and enjoy a high standard of living and access to resources , health and human and social capital, which builds upon individual and societal successes. All Australian governments acknowledge that investing in education and training is essential for Australia's economic and social prosperity. It is also about positioning Australia to meet the new challenges and opportunities, as I have said previously, in international markets in a world without economic borders, the emerging new knowledge based society, with the pressures for change, global and international competitiveness, access to information and technology and new and emerging global clients, which we often refer to in this House in terms of other legislation. 


Australia will require a flexible, well-educated, well-trained, high-performing workforce to achieve and sustain these reforms. This will pose problems for the majority of Aboriginal children and young people, who continue to perform poorly in their education because they will not access the opportunities which will flow for well-educated Australians. Although I agree that we have had successes and we are seeing some good outcomes, they are not uniform—and we are seeing people succeed, even against the barriers, including barriers of racism in instances. But they have not given up, nor have they surrendered their will to achieve and to contribute. 


There is growing demand for an educated, more highly trained and more technically skilled workforce. However, most Aboriginal workers are at the lower, shrinking end of the employment market and are becoming part of the growing underclass. The question that arises for Aboriginal children and people is: why are they excluded from the advantages of being an integral part of a vision in which Australia's global competitiveness and future depends upon all Australians having the necessary education, training and learning ability and that is dependent upon the application of knowledge to support innovation, stimulate business development and improve workforce productivity to live productive and fulfilling lives? 


It is important for Aboriginal children and young people to acquire the same proficient standard Australian English, as well as to be taught to recognise the way in which language is used, contextualised, understood and applied in a global and knowledge based society, in order to participate in Australia's economy. The task of developing appropriate resources and teaching Aboriginal students to become proficient in standard Australian English should be achievable. Over a period of 12 years, a student should be able to learn English, when it is considered in this context. English has 26 letters and only 44 sounds. It has an approximate total of 550,000 words, and 2,000 words make up 90 per cent of most speech. Four hundred words make up to 65 per cent of most writing, and there are only 70 main spelling combinations. Graduation from the final year of secondary schooling provides measures of success, including the completion of school entry, to university and higher education, access to TAFE, apprenticeships, traineeships, employment and an income. Aboriginal children and young people who do not achieve secondary education and who do not acquire the basic skills of literacy and numeracy are unlikely to be competitive in the labour market, and that goes for any student who fails at schooling. They will subsequently be vulnerable to structural change within the labour market government reform and therefore will be reliant on government income support. Seriously, if you do not achieve year 10 graduation then you are doomed eternally to welfare dependency, unless there are interventions that break that dependency.


One thing is that we have got to stop focusing on programs, which is the reason I asked the member for Blair the question about understanding what the educational outcomes are. We have to stop focusing purely on money. The question that we as members all need to ask and know the answer to with a degree of certainty within our electorates is: what is the educational attainment not only of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children but of any child who experiences socioeconomic challenges and difficulty? I think it is beholden upon us to know what the gaps are within our electorates so that we can address them and advocate for and champion those who need the champions of this House. It is only through the processes of strong bilateral commitment that we will see the changes that are absolutely necessary for any child who requires a level of support and intervention, in particular in this bill. 


I commend this bill to the parliament.

"O'Neill, Deb, MP",ALP,2011-07-04,"



Ms O'NEILL
 (Robertson) (17:29):  As I commence speaking in support of the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2011, I am proud to follow the member for Hasluck and the member for Fraser—the member for Hasluck because of his particular authentic voice in this debate as the first Indigenous member of the House of Representatives and the member for Fraser because of his obvious passion for and commitment to education. In these times when politics and politicians are maligned nearly as much as climate scientists and economists, I think it is important for people who might be listening to this debate to understand that the work of the House involves people working across boundaries in the interests of the nation. That is the kind of work that I came here to do as the member for Robertson, and that is why I am very, very proud to be speaking today to this bill, which is firmly and squarely targeted at changing life outcomes for the most underprivileged and most isolated people in this great nation of Australia, our Indigenous people.


This bill itself demonstrates that the Gillard government are deeply committed to governing with a clear and dedicated focus on closing the gap that we have to simply accept exists between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples in terms of not just living standards but every possible measure of life outcome: health, wellbeing, educational status and opportunity. Of all the tools at our disposal to achieve these equitable goals, education, in my view, is the most powerful one—and there is much research to support this. The adequate provision of education has been proven over and over, time and time again, as the greatest equaliser of opportunity available to a society. The Gillard government is absolutely committed to closing the gap in Indigenous education disadvantage. In my view, it is essential that it remain our most important objective.


Of all the national issues, this one, perhaps more than others, has a very particular local face in a range of different settings across the nation. I will always—and as I speak here today I want to particularly—value and appreciate the local Indigenous community in my electorate. The Central Coast is an area that has been proudly inhabited by the Darkinjung-Guringai people. I will always feel privileged to be the representative in this parliament of the land in which the Aboriginal elders of my region continue to hold their custodianship with such care. The coast certainly has a proud Indigenous history, and members of the Indigenous community have always sought to maintain and strengthen their cultural heritage, but the reality on the Central Coast is similar to the reality around the rest of the nation: our Indigenous kids are underrepresented in terms of health and wellbeing, they are underrepresented in the successful completion of schooling, they are underrepresented in our universities and they are underrepresented in their opportunities to be full, successful and participating members of our society with all the choices that are afforded to children who are born to non-Indigenous parents.


The purpose of this amendment bill is to extend funding amounting to $133.5 million for non-Abstudy payments for the calendar year 2013. Additionally, this bill will reduce by $157.7 million in net terms the appropriations allocated for non-Abstudy payments to fund previously agreed government policy and initiatives. While decision making that shifts money in economically responsible ways is necessarily a difficult task for all governments, we in this government understand that we must remember, in the allocation of funding, that it must go to where it is most needed and can have a powerful and positive impact on our communities. The changes to funding arrangements reflected here reflect changed arrangements which were implemented under reforms to federal financial relations.


It is always important to consider that not only is it important to provide welfare to Indigenous communities but its provision must be enabling for the communities. It must be efficient, it must be effective and it must be—as the member for Hasluck so clearly outlined—directed at real, practical outcomes. 'It's not about the money,' he said. 'It's about what we actually make happen, what we make possible, what we envision and what we deliver for Indigenous communities with Indigenous communities.' The new arrangements reflected in this bill provide greater autonomy for states and territories to tailor their own policies to suit local circumstances. This is a very important part of the bill—that the face of need in each community is different and that that needs to be taken into consideration at the state level as well as at the totally local level. The circumstances faced by Indigenous Australians vary phenomenally throughout this Commonwealth. It is appropriate, then, that policies in relation to education should also vary. Reform to the Commonwealth-state relations in Indigenous education policy has been immensely beneficial in the development of a policy aimed at closing the gap. An example is the approximately $80 million transferred to the Northern Territory national partnership agreement. This COAG agreement is aimed at closing the gap, and a significant part of the agreement is the National Partnership Agreement for Indigenous Early Childhood Development. When it comes to changing outcomes for Indigenous children, we must constantly acknowledge the power of investing in early education.


We talk about expectations—and I want to say a little more about that later. Expectation about what is possible for every child is at the heart of a teacher's role, but teachers do not do this alone; it is parents and the community in toto. It is often said it is not just the family that raises a child—it is not just the mother and father—it is the village. Early childhood exposure to great quality education changes expectations for everyone. It changes expectations for the children themselves when they begin to see other ways of doing, other ways of being, other ways of knowing, other ways of listening and other ways of speaking. In a clearly and carefully dedicated formal education setting that is combined with the sound advice of policy and research in early childhood, we begin early on the journey that might have positive outcomes for future generations of Indigenous Australians.


The National Partnership Agreement for Indigenous Early Childhood Development commits $564.6 million—that is a large amount of money—over six years. It is currently funding 36 children and family centres. I have not had the opportunity yet to visit one of those, but I certainly hope that I will have the opportunity, because the people working there are doing some of the most important work in our community. They are the people who will build these potential futures. This COAG agreement is designed to meet the specific needs pertaining to particular states and territories, who will develop and implement their own plans in consultation with their local communities.


The bill also reflects the government's election commitment to increase support for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students from remote Indigenous communities attending non-government and non-remote boarding schools. This initiative is really about making it possible for individuals who have different needs to receive different responses. There is no one Aboriginal culture; there are multiple Aboriginal cultures. There is no universal student; there are multiple individuals, Indigenous and non-Indigenous, who need particular responses. The uniqueness of the human person is a challenge for all educators. This bill does many of the structural things that allow teachers to actually begin to do that kind of dedicated work.


Sadly, not every Indigenous Australian child will have access to the program, but significant numbers will. This really does have the potential to change lives. As a former teacher, I am very well aware, having spent 25 years in classrooms, that education transforms lives. I am passionate about education because I have seen it. I have seen kids arrive with low expectations and I have seen them at the end of 13 years of schooling, having been well engaged, being able to do wonderful things and fulfil their dreams. Sadly, some children have never had those possibilities offered to them. I see Australians who represent great resources, to themselves, to their families, to their local communities, to their nation and, indeed, potentially to the world, who, by the time they have left school, do not have the skills or the belief in themselves that they need to advance and really become the best people that they can be. Education is a rich field in which to work and a great education is a holistic experience. It empowers students intellectually, socially and, just as importantly, emotionally and culturally. This program of supporting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders from remote areas to attend non-government schools has the potential to provide that empowering experience. But such programs must always be mindful of the challenges faced when moving from one cultural setting into another cultural setting. There is a lot of research about students from disadvantaged social backgrounds having two language practices, trying to identify in a tertiary setting and using a particular discourse capacity in that context and then also having to go back to their own families and talk, live, work and speak in different ways. This is not a small thing that we are asking. That is why it needs to be offered to particular kids who look like they are able to take up that opportunity and why it needs to match their particular needs.


Every Indigenous student who finishes secondary education and gains a tertiary qualification is benefiting their community. They are benefiting their local community, the Aboriginal community and the Australian community. The more successful we are at promoting education in remote Indigenous communities, the more able we are to improve the life outcomes of those individuals and their communities and to close the gap, which really is a shame and a blight on our national history at this point in time.


As a member of this parliament and this Australian community in 2011, I often hear the general public's frustration at the Commonwealth-state blame game. Indeed, I understand that in our federal system Commonwealth and state governments inevitably dispute. However, Indigenous affairs is an area of policy where we must not fail. We must not allow this gap to be maintained. It is for this reason that I am heartened by the fact that there is a defined COAG agreement, aimed at closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.


Commitment to cooperative targets is also demonstrated by the newly updated Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Action Plan 2010-2014. This action plan commits the Australian government to 55 clear actions concerning the educational outcomes of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and young people. These 55 actions are linked to six priority domains, which are reflective of an outcomes based holistic approach to education: school readiness; engagement and connection; attendance; literacy and numeracy; leadership, quality teaching and workforce development; and pathways to real postschool options.


These six areas are critical and foremost and, under this agreement, each state was able to tailor how they approach those policy objectives in their own context. One approach I found particularly encouraging was the New South Wales strategy of developing a personalised learning plan for all Aboriginal students, in conjunction with students, parents and/or caregivers and teachers, including Aboriginal school personnel. In particular, it was focused on students' wellbeing in spiritual, cultural and personal domains. If we do not attend to those realities, then students will not be likely to engage in the intellectual domain.


This approach demonstrates the ideal that each student is a unique individual, with different strengths and weaknesses and a different personality that needs different responses. We must never forget that this legislation and the COAG agreement are being discussed here in this place today because, in 1967, again, very belatedly, the Australian people voted to enable the Commonwealth to legislate for Indigenous Australians. It is our responsibility in this federal place to have high expectations of ourselves and of the Indigenous community to be able to achieve these goals. It is therefore imperative that the Commonwealth use every power that we have at our disposal to assist in improving the educational outcomes of Indigenous students.


It remains a concern to me that, in 2010, only 64 per cent of year 9 Indigenous students achieved at or above the minimum standard in reading, compared to 92 per cent of non-Indigenous students. Twenty-four per cent of Indigenous students in remote areas achieved the national minimum reading standards. That is just not good enough.


Despite the challenges that face us, the Australian Labor Party and this government understand the importance of education and its enabling capacity. As a member of the House, I certainly have a vision for an Australia where Indigenous Australians have equity in outcomes and, on the basis of that, I commend this bill to the House. (Time expired)

"Jones, Ewen, MP",LP,2011-07-04,"



Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (17:44):  I rise to speak on the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2011 and give it my qualified support. In fact, a lot of my thoughts will be exactly the same as those of the member for Robertson. My wife is in fact an early childhood teacher. One thing that I would like to see in the future is equalised funding going to primary schools and, in particular, to early childhood centres, because that is where the battle is won or lost. If we can get these kids into a classroom, get them to know their alphabet and learn the outcome based education, then we will all be a lot better off.


As I said, a lot of the things I will be covering here will be covered with exactly the same feeling as that of the member for Robertson; I will just come at it from a different direction. The good part of this bill is that it extends the current funding arrangements, including indexation arrangements, for the 2013 calendar year. The funding covers programs such as the Indigenous Youth Mobility Program, helping Indigenous youth move away from home to gain skills for employment. In the city of Townsville a number of people are prepared to assist with this. We have a fantastic TAFE, Tec-NQ and we also have Shalom Christian College. St Pats, run by the Sisters of Mercy, is a great school. It has an incredible population of Torres Strait Islander and Palm Islander girls, who come across there to complete their education all the way through, from grade 8 to grade 12. 


The bill also covers funding for the Sporting Chance Program, which uses sport and recreation activities as a means of increasing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander engagement in school. Both these programs were implemented by the coalition and, to the government's credit, both these good programs have been continued. Both have been successful in increasing student participation and retention rates. This so-called necessary extension of funding is because we have to allow time for the report, which is due sometime this year, following the review of funding for schools.  The government has acknowledged that this review may have implications for the programs run under the IETA Act. I would urge the government not to touch the programs that are working to get kids into schools.


This is where I start to have problems with this legislation and, by extension, all the legislation relating to Aboriginal and Islander affairs. For a start we have these good programs, using sport and recreation, which actually get the kids into school. When we get them there, we sit them down and either they participate in the NAPLAN or we make them prepare for NAPLAN. Too many schools these days are wasting time just preparing for tests and going through tests to get them ready. So we say to the kids from the missions: 'Come in, go to school.' We use sport, music, dance and art to get them in there and, as soon as we do, we throw that out of the window and they no longer participate and we wonder why they do not go back to school. 


I agree with the member for Robertson: we as a community have to look at and decide what success is. Is the fact that they can actually speak English by the time they finish school a success? In some cases, it should be. But how do we qualify that and how do we ensure that they are getting the right funding? Those are the questions that we have to ask.


I recognise that this is a big issue. But, for the life of me, and the First Australians of my electorate, we cannot see where all the money is going. For all its good intentions, this place must see the frustration. For all its well-thought-out plans, bills and amendments we are still seeing a complete lack of clear results in our communities. Our Aboriginal and Islander school children remain the most troubled group. They are the most likely to be truant. They are the most likely to finish their education early. They are more likely not to possess the basic literacy skills required to achieve anything above menial labour. They are more likely to die young and they are more likely to suffer substance abuse. I have been a member of this House for less than a year, and yet I feel a great frustration when it comes to the provision of services for our First Australians. In my maiden speech, I pointed to people and organisations who were trying to make a difference. They are making a difference in the community by targeting specific groups, specific programs and specific native groups of people to get things done.


I continue to talk about, for want of a better term, federalising the industry of Aboriginal and Islander affairs, and the member for Robertson addressed that matter as well. I am not a federalist by nature. But, for the life of me, when I speak to the mayor of Palm Island, the mayor of Yarrabah or to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander elders in my community they do not know where the money is going. It goes from federal to state, to local and there is a trickle that comes out the bottom. They are raising concerns with me as to where the money is going. Are there too many consultants? Are the state governments robbing us blind? Is the federal government through the Public Service not getting the funds through? Those are the questions that just do not seem to be heard, because it all leads to money not getting to the pointy end—and that is what we need. Too often we see people falling through the gaps. We now have more people in care than during the stolen generation. When you think about how much money we have thrown at the issue, you have to pause and ask, 'To what end?'


I was at the Cleveland Youth Detention Centre recently. They have instigated a program where the boys in the centre are exposed to normal businesspeople who mentor them in life. They do not judge the boys nor do they care what they have done. The people who participate are there to see if there is anything that they can offer, anything in their own lives which they have done which could give these boys a chance they so desperately need. These people are not qualified as social workers; they are qualified as people who have jobs and who have life experience. They spend time with the boys. There are some of the Cowboys players that are so welcome in that place but, more often than not, they are just businesspeople going in and spending time with them.


When you go into Cleveland Youth you see the existence of foetal alcohol syndrome and abuse they have suffered are rife in the inmates in the centre. The blame for that lies across the whole region and the whole community. But the mentors do not let them make excuses. They tell them that sometimes bad things happen; some things are beyond their control; and sometimes you just have to suck it up and have a go. That is the mentors' basic message: have a red hot go, be prepared to fail and fall over but have a go.


It is with this in mind that I suggest that we change the way we do things. The current way is simply not good enough. If it was a business venture, you would have cut its head off long ago—too much money and very little return. I was on Palm Island last week and I sat down with Mayor Alf Lacey and acting council CEO Jeff Brown. Alf's mantra is: 'Do not talk to me about welfare. We are over it. What we want to talk about is economic opportunity to be masters of our own destiny.' To that end, Palm Island council are working as a council and as a community to try to lift the island's profile in Townsville for its economic opportunities.


You only have to come over the hill to see what they are doing with weed eradication, the way the town square has been spruced up with paint and the way the council chambers have been cleaned up. What a pretty place it is and is going to be. There is cyclone damage across the foreshore roads where you still have power poles basically in the sand. It is a long road to travel, but they are heading in the right direction.


We need to look at opportunities for our first Australians but we cannot have some bureaucrat or politician in Canberra telling them what that opportunity is and the money will be that and they will be doing this and they will be getting paid that. We need these communities to stand up and tell us what they want to do. We need to help out as a silent partner with business plans and paperwork. Let the residents have a go. Let them drive their own future. We need to micro manage each of these. We need to see what can be done and fund it directly. We need our ministers to do more. We need our directors-general to do that. We need our public servants to change the basic way they are dealing with this part of Australia's life.


For too long we have been giving money over and patting them on the back and sending them on their way. This has to stop. If there is an Aboriginal or Islander person who wants to change and wants to step up, we should be handling their case as a single unit. We need to set out goals and manage their future along with them until they have made it. We also have to acknowledge that this is not for everyone. The more we look at this issue, the deeper it gets; the deeper it gets, the less we do; and the less we do, the more money it costs us. 


This is not a swipe at the government, but I do believe that spreading the portfolio of Aboriginal and Islander affairs across so many portfolios and having it as a small part of mega large departments does not seem to be the answer. I do not question the commitment of Minister Snowdon or Minister Macklin, but it is too easy for staff of the department and for even the ministers to say that it is the duty of another portfolio and another department and wipe their hands. That goes across the state as well.


We need to change our focus. We need to be outcomes focused and not budget focused. We need to have as the focus of each member of the Public Service that we want to educate our Aboriginal and Islander children, teenagers and adults. Those who want to work for it will be rewarded with the gift of literacy and better health and jobs and futures. We have to do this one person at a time. This year's theme for NAIDOC Week is 'The next step is ours'. Let us be right there with those who want to take that step and give them the assistance they require. No-one wants any more than that. They are not asking for any more than that. If I am to be accused of being simplistic, then so be it. My idea may not work. But what has?

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2011-07-04,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (17:55):  I welcome the opportunity to speak to the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill. Can I begin by acknowledging that we are celebrating NAIDOC Week this week, between 3 and 10 July—a week that has been recognised by Indigenous people in this country for almost 70 years. It started off with William Cooper back in the 1930s, when he formed the Australian Aborigines League, and at the time there was even a call for Indigenous people to b e represented in this place. What was originally considered to be a day of mourning has now become a week of celebration for Indigenous people across the country, and I certainly wish them well in the celebrations of this week because I know that, right across the country, in many, many communities, there are individual events taking place. 


The purpose of this bill is to extend funding for existing programs under the Indigenous education targeted assistance for a further year and to reallocate some funds to other programs and initiatives. The Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2011 aligns funding so that the review of funding for schooling, due to report in 2011, can be considered and any changes implemented with adequate planning and consultation. In 2007 the Council of Australian Governments agreed to six targets for closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, including in relation to educational achievement. Some of those targets were to halve the gap in reading, writing and numeracy achievements for Indigenous children within a decade, and to halve the gap for Indigenous students in year 12 attainment rates by the year 2020. These targets were formalised in the National Indigenous Reform Agreement (Closing the Gap) agreed by COAG in October 2008. The bill aims to extend the funding for the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 to incorporate the 2013 calendar year to line up with the Schools Assistance Act 2008, and timing of the review of funding for schooling. This extension, if passed, will appropriate an approximate total of $150 million under the act for 2013.


Nowhere is the need for improving education greater than in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. I think that everyone in this House would agree that, if we are ever to overcome disadvantage for any group within our community, then we should begin with improving the education standards. I think it is universally agreed across the world that that is the single thing that makes so much difference to the lives of people. Certainly here in Australia, where we know that Indigenous people are more disadvantaged than the rest of the people in this nation, then starting with a good education outcome is an important priority for the government, and it should be for the nation.


Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education focused programs run under the act are critical to the future of Indigenous Australia. Initiatives in funding for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are already underway and there are a range of commitments that this government has already made with respect to reducing Indigenous disadvantage. I want to go through what some of those are. The sum of $56.5 million has been allocated nationally to expand literacy and numeracy programs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students and to provide professional support to assist teachers to develop personalised learning plans for students over the period 2009 to 2012. The government is honouring its 2007 election commitment of $21.9 million to support students from remote communities attending non-remote boarding schools. The government has also allocated $28.9 million for three new boarding facilities in the Northern Territory to support Indigenous kids to achieve a year 12 certificate; $23 million has been allocated for a quality teaching package to upskill and retain the education workforce in Northern Territory schools; $22.7 million has been allocated for on-site accelerated literacy and numeracy support for teaching staff in the Northern Territory; $107.8 million over four years for an additional 200 teachers in the Northern Territory has also been allocated; $35.4 million has been set aside for the school nutrition program for remote schools in the Northern Territory; $9.1 million of funding was announced in the 2009 budget to support creches; $8.9 million was allocated under the Building the Education Revolution for additional classrooms for remote communities, as was $2.5 billion of Smarter Schools National Partnerships funding which targets disadvantage and contributes to improving literacy and numeracy outcomes, with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education a key of that focus.


All of those amounts highlight an additional important point—that is, if we are going to address Indigenous disadvantage and lift education standards of Indigenous people across the country, then we need to target funding to specific needs because the reality is that across Australia different communities do have different needs. If we do not recognise that then we will find that, all too often, money that has been allocated in fact does not target the people who need it the most. So by breaking it down into those specific allocations that I have just run through, it means the government well understands what the priorities ought to be and where the focus ought to be of that funding. 


When I look at the programs covered in the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 it is evident that many programs are aimed at engagement as well as education. The programs delivered under the act are complementary to mainstream schooling and employ a range of diverse programs designed to improve educational outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The Sporting Chance Program combines school-based sports academies with education engagement strategies that provide a range of sport, recreation and education activities for primary and secondary school students. Other programs include the Indigenous Youth Mobility Program, supplementary recurrent assistance for both non-government vocational education and training and early childhood, as well as Abstudy and mixed mode Away From Base assistance. 


If we are going to engage more children in our education sector, we need to begin by also engaging the parents. The act is also about community involvement, as is evidenced by the Parental and Community Engagement Program. The importance of community engagement should never be understated. Historically, low Indigenous engagement in the education system as well as poor education and employment outcomes mean that Indigenous students are less likely to have parental assistance in their studies than non-Indigenous students. The reality has several flow-on effects. Low parental and family education has: firstly, negatively affected Indigenous experiences of and attitudes towards the education system; secondly, reduced the capacity of Indigenous parents and families to engage effectively with the education system; thirdly, reduced parental involvement in school based activities and decision making; and, fourthly, limited the capacity of Indigenous parents and families to support their children in education and employment. The Parental and Community Engagement Program aims to reverse this situation. The government will continue to work at building and strengthening partnerships between families and schools supported by government funding and unflagging determination. In my electorate of Makin, there is an example of the Parental and Community Engagement strategy in place at the North Ingle school at Ingle Farm. The program, which is being run by Centacare Catholic Family Services, has been allocated $23,650 of funding for the family wellbeing project. The project started in January 2010 and is expected to finish on 30 December this year. Centrecare is conducting workshops to empower parents and caregivers of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students who attend the North Ingle School to engage with school staff and support their children at the school. It is a good example of what can be done at the local level when you understand what the needs are.


The Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 also aims to empower young Indigenous people through the Indigenous Youth Leadership Program. The role Indigenous mentors and role models play in the community is an important one. This program also has the potential to underline the importance of culture, community development and governance in the school environment. The Aboriginal And Torres Strait Islander Education Action Plan was developed by the Ministerial Council for Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs and launched on 9 June 2011. The action plan includes targeting approximately 900 focus schools and outlines 55 actions at national, systemic and local levels across the following six key areas: readiness for school; engagement and connections; attendance; literacy and numeracy; leadership; quality teaching and workforce development; and pathways to real post-school options.


In last year's budget $15.4 million over four years was prioritised to deliver on the government's commitments under the action plan. We have also approved more than $25 million for projects over 2011 and 2012 to expand intensive literacy and numeracy approaches for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. Indeed, since 2008 the government has invested $51.5 million in Indigenous literacy and numeracy projects. Over 20,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students in over 670 schools across Australia will benefit from this assistance.


In my home state of South Australia $1 million was provided to Catholic schools for their intensive literacy and numeracy program for Indigenous students and their whole-school planning for targeted personalised learning, with the dual focus on school intervention and literacy and numeracy. Government schools in South Australia will receive a further $1 million for the Unlocking the Future program, which is focused on literacy and teacher capacity. All schools in South Australia—that is, government, Catholic and independent schools—will receive over $3 million to deliver a national program known as Make It Count. This program is focused on improving literacy and teacher capacity.


I close by talking about a local project in the northern and north-eastern suburbs of Adelaide which was undertaken as a partnership between the federal government, the state government of South Australia, Woolworths and two training organisations: Trainme and Globally Make a Difference. It was put together by the Mining, Energy and Engineering Academy of South Australia. This is a program whereby Indigenous people of all ages are selected from the community. Woolworths, as one of key partners, guarantees them a job if they undergo a training program, which in turn gives them a Certificate I or Certificate II in Retail Operations. The program has been an incredible success. Roughly 100 people were originally listed for the program. To date, 91 of those people have commenced the program, 72 have graduated, 42 are currently working with Woolworths and 22 are doing further training. I think those figures are remarkable—remarkable because these were people of all ages who in many cases had never worked before. They were people who had found an incredible number of barriers along the way to getting them into the workforce. But providing them with an opportunity of training and, in turn, the guarantee of a job at the end of that training made a world of difference. 


What also made a world of difference was that the two training organisations—and, in particular, Mark Siaosi from Trainme and Melinda Cates from Globally Make a Difference—really understood the people they were working with. They understood them well enough to understand how they should best tailor the training programs that they were providing. They worked with the trainees from start to finish to ensure that they not only completed their training but also participated in the employment experience that was provided by Woolworths along the way. It shows that, when you understand how to run a program and you can guarantee people a job at the end of it, you will get outcomes. I particularly commend Mike Batycki from Woolworths, who is the state manager in South Australia, for overseeing this program and making it available. I have now attended two graduations of the program—this year and last year. I was indeed impressed to see the people coming through the program having graduated and to see the excitement on their faces to think that they had actually achieved something and they had a job waiting for them at the end of the program. That is another good example of where sometimes, if you want results, you have to tailor make the whole program. The federal government has provided $1.2 million of funding as part of its Indigenous Employment Program to fund the program, and it is working. To those people involved—Alan Tidswell, from the Mining Energy and Engineering Academy; Mark Siaosi;Melinda Cates; and Michael Batycki—I say thank you and well done.

"Laming, Andrew, MP",LP,2011-07-04,"



Mr LAMING
 (Bowman) (18:10):  In considering the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2011, the question that comes before anyone who debates this issue on either side of this chamber is the No. 1 concern of school attendance. While we as politicians can continue to mouth the promises of small programs, small financial transfers and small gains in attendance in restricted areas and small cohorts in different parts of Australia, the only thing that will measure our time in public life will be whether we have turned education for Indigenous Australians in remote and rural Australia around so that attendance is something equivalent to what we see in the mainstream. It is great to focus on closing the gap, but today I want to look through the prism of the national quality framework and see what we have achieved since it was first raised back on 3 July 2008, to see some progress in Indigenous outcomes in both early childhood and later education. Secondly, I will look at the human rights issues around school attendance and compare them to worldwide concerns. Thirdly, I will look at the social and, fourthly, the economic implications of school attendance.


When we listen to our words today decades from now, the question will be not, 'Could we fill our 20 minutes with examples of what a government is doing?' but, 'Were we actually achieving any change whatsoever?' There are scarce few examples in this country of successful achievement in getting Aboriginal kids to school. I can start with a list of reasons, but our job is not to continue to expand on the list of reasons. We have one single role in this place, and that is to turn our words—our good words on both sides of the chamber—into reality, particularly in remote and rural Australia. So, while I have seen very, very alarming statistics that talk about only 24 per cent of Indigenous Australians even having a high school in their community and 40 per cent of Indigenous Australians completing year 12 but only 10 per cent of Indigenous Australians actually graduating from year 12, let us remember that it is magnified enormously the more remote or rural the area is. So, in areas like the Warlpiri communities around the Tanami of Yuendumu and Lajamanu, we have seen massive falls in school attendance at the same time as we were attempting the Northern Territory emergency intervention. It was not through any fault of the intervention. The intervention made it clear: send your child to school or face the impact of quarantining. The great problem is that quarantining was extended to absolutely everyone, and here we are, three to four years later, with an almost anthropological fascination with the intervention—watching, looking, talking about it and measuring it—but school attendance has not changed. No, school attendance flatlined for three years after we brought this intervention in. We got an initial 20 per cent jump, and it has sat there at 60 per cent ever since.


My great concern in those prescribed communities is that 40 to 45 per cent of Indigenous children simply do not go to school. I will say it again, and it will be remembered decades from now: it is Australia's greatest human rights violation that Indigenous Australians do not go to school. There is no greater tragedy for this nation. We know that levels of maternal education predict the futures of kids. We know that should be our No. 1 priority after child safety. But we are getting nowhere.


As I said, through the prism of the national quality framework, we talked about it in July 2008. We then talked about it again in October 2008. Then, Indigenous Australians can be delighted to know that on 2 July 2009 we accepted a revised version of the previous year's document—so there went one year. And now I move forward to 2011, and I say to Indigenous Australians, what have we delivered to you in the form of Children and Family Centres? This conversation started years ago. The kids who were most vulnerable in grade 1 are now most of the way through primary school, and what can I report to you? I can report that we had a press release in May saying that they were looking at setting up, in temporary premises, in the middle of this year, an arrangement for Doomadgee, Mareeba, Mount Isa, Ipswich, Mornington Island and Cairns. What about the other 16 remote Queensland communities? Nothing. It is one thing to run around and look for pilot schemes and roll things out in selected communities, but ultimately we need to remember we have two concurrent objectives here. One is the quality numerator—that is, how well we teach the kids. But no matter how good the quality is, if the denominator of school attendance is not there then quality means nothing. The great challenge is that we will have a rollcall and report that an Indigenous child has turned up at school but they are not there at lunchtime. They are gone by lunch, and they are not there on the other days when we are not counting the roll.


I now move to the second issue, the social issues in remote Australia. We put way too much pressure on bureaucrats and, in particular, on principals to be policing and pushing Indigenous liaison workers out to pick kids up from school in buses and cars. And for too long we have hung off the excuses of not having  a pair of shoes or food in your tummy as an excuse not to go to school. But it is the other way round; the kids must be at school. There is no corner of this nation where there is not a law that clearly and explicitly points out that very fact. We are failing to apply ordinary laws that apply to the rest of Australia in remote Indigenous Australia. We are effectively creating a racial divide: a two-tiered system where the very rules that apply in most of Australia are exempted in Central Australia. And all most people would ask for is that the rules are applied.


As I said in my second point, from a social perspective I can appreciate there are damaged and incapacitated people in every community. There may well be more in some than others. So it is beholden upon us to identify those people and help their children because that is a child protection issue and that is No. 1. We know from the Bath report that there are 800-plus reports of completely uninvestigated child welfare issues. That is a failure, and without that being fixed we cannot even talk about education.


I have a fair bit of respect for teachers who say we need more resourcing, that we need better skilled teachers in remote areas and that we need to keep them there longer. They are all very important issues of continuity and quality of education. But, as I have said before, the denominator here is attendance. If kids cannot turn up then their parents need to bring them. And if kids will not stay at school because the minute the parents leave the children leave, then we have an issue where we must ask our parents to stay at school. We may well have to rethink education models and admit that, as was traditionally the case in Indigenous Australia, education was a multigenerational process. It is quite possible that caregivers need to remain at school and be accommodated in school grounds. I just ask the question: are we prepared to reconsider the way we deliver a Western education to promote attendance? I will have any discussion in any community about parts of the syllabus which Indigenous Australians do not support or have concerns about, but ultimately this is a discussion we should have had decades ago.


Fred Hollows identified this in the seventies. He found out a century too late for Indigenous Australia that education fundamentally had to be a buy-in process from the very families who send their kids to school. I can understand that it looks like there are no jobs at the end of the tunnel, but that is an argument for another day because No. 1 has to be school attendance, and that comes only through parental acceptance of its importance. When I visit Indigenous communities parents do tell me just that, but they will also tell me: 'Whether I send my kids to school or not, I'm quarantined. So there's no great incentive if I've improved my efforts in sending a kid to school. I don't see many carrots for sending my kid to school in a direct and real time. And ultimately if I thumb my nose at the system and I say, ""Well, you've quarantined me and there's nothing more you can do,"" the reality is it is quite right, there is very little that the system can do.' So at some point we need to say that kids not attending school is just as serious as a range of other child welfare issues, and we need to be able to talk to aunties and extended families about ways of getting those kids to school.


There is a very easy way to reduce the number of kids that are in this situation—that is, to engage a community and ensure there is buy-in. There is nothing worse than going to a remote community where they say: 'We don't have much to do with that mob. We don't know the teachers very well; they come and go. We certainly don't have confidence that they're teaching the right things.' Then there is a driver for engagement with the community, and I would like to see more flexible state education systems start that conversation.


When Marion Scrymgour, as the NT education minister, moved English to a position of pre-eminence and then the intervention backed it up with mandatory four hours of English education at the start of the day, I can see what they were trying to do. But we have thrown out the entire cultural underpinnings of bilingual education for Indigenous Australians. Every other part of Australia teaches languages other than English as an alternative for kids, but we have lost that in many parts of Indigenous Australia that develop fabulous bilingual curricula. We need to bring that back, in no way threatening English because you need to learn English to be able to learn in English, so English must be a core part of education. But to remove the right of a community to have cultural and traditional elements in their curriculum is inviting disaster and disengagement. What we cannot afford is to lose these wonderful young kids at the ages of 10 or 12 when they go through subincision and other traditional processes and we lose them to education until they have gone through their final ceremony. In that period between 12 and 16 we have our greatest challenge in retaining kids, particularly in remote Australia, within our schools. The answer to that is simple: the answer to that is to talk about extended families and to talk to the senior caregiver—who is not always the mother. We need to talk to aunties and elders and ask them what we have to do for the children in your care in terms of keeping them at school. Once we have had that discussion in a community about what is valued in a curriculum it becomes far more powerful.


I have the sense that we are caught somewhere either side of this debate. Centrelink can approach an individual for not sending a child to school, and then at a community level we are trying to negotiate with elders. But in the middle there we need to remember that the strongest remaining part of Indigenous culture is the family group. Perhaps we have to talk to parents and say that part of the parenting payment is being a parent and part of being a parent is sending your kid to school. If they are not sending them to school, I would genuinely ask the question as to whether they are fulfilling their obligations in a modern society to your children.


Noel Pearson said in his Quarterly essay that we need to start thinking about Indigenous Australia not as being doubly disadvantaged but as being able to walk in both worlds and having the best of both. It is completely possible that Indigenous Australia, if it thinks about where it wants to be a decade or a generation or more from now, will say: 'We can retain our connection to land but we do not have to live there 100 per cent of the time. We can go and live where there is work. We can orbit from our communities and have the best of mainstream culture while having our connection to spirituality and the land.' Perhaps that is where we are heading. But it is time for Indigenous Australia to have that debate with itself, because that is a uniquely Aboriginal discussion to be had. I know that if that was to occur then education would be a fundamental part of it.


From our point of view, in the mainstream we need to recognise the important role that mothers, aunties and grandmothers play in education. I cannot see why in remote Indigenous Australia mums and aunties cannot be more than just teacher aides; they can be fundamental parts of an auxiliary volunteer education arm in a school. They could come along and do what auxiliaries do in hospitals, which is support your own education system. We have seen at Batchelor college the important role that elders can play through staying in residential colleges. That should apply in every community in which there is a school. The last thing that we can afford is to set up creches, preschools and kindergartens where Aboriginal families are encouraged to hand the kids over the fence and walk away. That works if you have to go to work, but leaving Indigenous parents completely separated from the education system that is over that fence is not the future.


We may have to be novel; we may have to try new things. But there is one thing that we should never back away from here: we must achieve the same school attendance results that we achieve in the mainstream in remote Australia. That can only start by allowing education departments flexibility, supporting the principals and not making them the policeman at the same time and having Centrelink work very closely on early identification of kids who do not go to school.


In the end, I appreciate that not all parents have the capacity to ensure that their kids go to school every day. But that is a child welfare issue as much as it is an education one. We need to take those children and talk to the extended family—the aunties—about getting them to school. As I have said before, we need to get them engaged with extended family.


Once we achieve that, the final part is the economic implications of school attendance. Everywhere you go, you will see worldwide that an extra year of formal education can do incredible things to a family's earnings over a life. So our priority must be to keep Indigenous kids at school—and particularly when they hit grade 7, because we know that from grade 7 to grade 9 when there is no high school to go to we have a huge drop out of kids.


Those figures that tell us that only one in four Aboriginal kids who stay to grade 12 actually graduate from grade 12 present us with another challenge, and that is whether we should be shifting large numbers of remote and rural Indigenous Australians onto welfare through Newstart. Is it right that large numbers of kids in areas where employment levels are down below 25 per cent should be shifted straight on to welfare payments? My argument is that that mitigates against exactly what we are trying to do, which is engagement through workforce participation. What we know is that all of the antisocial elements—such as alcohol or drug abuse—will always be higher where workforce participation is lower. It simply stands to reason. There are certain social problems that can only be addressed by engaging a greater proportion of people in the workforce. So as long as those figures roll along at around 25 per cent, I argue we can never ever start to get any form of improvement in social issues such as drugs, petrol and alcohol. It starts at school: once you keep kids at school, you give them a chance to transition to meaningful work, training or orbiting. We can do that in the time we have here in public life. But it will take the enforcement of laws that exist in this country now, throughout central, remote and rural Indigenous Australia.

Mr SLIPPER
 (Fisher—Deputy Speaker) (18:25):  At the outset, I am indebted to my friend the honourable member for Dawson for reminding me that private members business commences once again at 6.30, so my contribution will necessarily be brief tonight.


It is important, as a compassionate society, and as a society that seeks equality for all of its citizens, that we do whatever we can to improve educational outcomes for all Australians, including those Australians who are Indigenous. As a nation, we do not have a lot to be proud of with respect to Indigenous affairs. Governments on both sides, historically, have sought to solve the problem through throwing money at the problem, rather than focusing on practical outcomes and practical solutions to very substantial problems. The former Howard government had a much better policy than prior governments and it sought to achieve practical reconciliation and sought to improve outcomes. As chairman of the then House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, I was appalled to discover that Indigenous males live approximately 20 years less than non-Indigenous males. When one looks at Indigenous health, we see that so much more has to be achieved. Similarly with respect to education.


That is why I am very pleased to be able to support the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2011, although with some reservations. This bill is a positive bill. It builds on the initiatives of the former Howard Liberal-National government. It essentially seeks to extend the funding for two Howard government programs. It is unfortunate though that the Labor Party has constantly indulged in reviews. Simply giving a one-year extension in funding for the second year in a row does not permit long-term planning and does not build on the very positive outcomes which these programs have successfully achieved in the years since they were implemented.


The Indigenous Youth Mobility Program along with the Sporting Chance Program endeavour to assist Indigenous young people. The Indigenous Youth Mobility Program helps young Indigenous people move away from home to gain the skills they need to get a job in their community or elsewhere. The Sporting Chance Program is an Australia government initiative that started operations in schools in 2007, with the objective of encouraging positive educational outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students.


It really is important to make sure that Indigenous Australians have appropriate educational opportunities, because as we all know the key to success in life is a good education. If someone is able to read, write and count, then the employment prognosis is infinitely better. It really is important also to recognise that many in the Indigenous community have not enjoyed the opportunities of others in the wider Australian community and that governments must therefore focus on doing whatever they can to build positive futures for Indigenous people. The way to a positive future for Indigenous people is by building up the prospects of children and future generations of Indigenous people. It is important they are given the support they need to receive a good education and receive the guidance they require to make them move into a rewarding career where they can become well-rounded and contributing members of the community generally, and become positive role models for other Indigenous Australians. It is probable that the challenges and difficulties faced by the Indigenous community may be addressed and their harshness reduced if the current generation of young people are able to build their abilities and educational opportunities in the future.


Debate adjourned.

"Hayes, Chris, MP",ALP,2011-07-04,"



Mr HAYES
 (Fowler—Government Whip) (18:30):   As a member of federal parliament I feel I have made a commitment to publicly condemning blatant violations of basic human rights. In moving this motion I sought to bring attention to atrocities that are currently occurring in Vietnam against freedom and justice. Though we may call Vietnam our South-East Asian neighbour and our valued trading partner, I for one am appalled that there are more than 400 people currently incarcerated in Vietnam for exercising their fundamental human rights. I refer to people whose only crime is to support political groups not recognised by the state, to criticise government policy or to call for democracy. Today I wish to highlight some recent cases of this.


In Vietnam in recent years there have been a growing number of individuals and activist groups openly voicing their opposition to the government. In response, the Communist regime has been attempting to silence this dissent through imprisonment. The arrest of those advocates of human rights and those seeking democracy is arbitrary, and their trials have been unjust. Beginning in summer 2010, the Vietnamese government embarked on one of the biggest crackdowns on dissidents, specifically targeting land rights activists, most of whom belong to the Mennonite Church, in the Mekong River Delta region. Among those arrested I specifically refer to the seven people I referred to in my notice of motion.


The story of these people is appalling. All seven are members of the Cattle Shed Congregation of the Mennonite Church, the name of which refers to the fact that they have to practice their religion in a cattle shed. In what can only be seen as a severe miscarriage of justice, these seven individuals were detained and held incommunicado from July 2010 until their trial on 30 May 2011 without access to legal counsel or access to their families. When the accused were finally brought before the People's Court of Ben Tre, the hearing, which lasted less than one day, was closed to the public, the defence had limited access to the evidence against their clients and all requests for foreign diplomats to attend the proceedings were denied. To further compound these shocking circumstances, the lawyer Huynh Van Dong, who was appearing for two of the defendants, was ejected from the courtroom during the argument stage of the case. Following the trial, Huynh Van Dong said that the court itself had violated the law from the very beginning. He claimed that any statements that he made in the court room on behalf of his clients were cut off by the judges—in other words, he was effectively silenced.


Due to their association with Viet Tan, a pro-democracy organisation, the seven were charged under article 79 of the Vietnamese penal code, which cited their attempt to overthrow the socialist government. They were accused of the following so-called criminal acts: attending a seminar on non-violent protests, publishing signs concerning Vietnamese ownership of the Paracel and Spratly Islands and organising farmers to protest against corruption. These activities are hardly objectionable by any reasonable standard, and each of them is acceptable and fully within the framework of international law. Collectively they were sentenced to 33 years of imprisonment and 28 years of house arrest. Article 79 of the Vietnamese penal code is vague. It does not distinguish between violent acts endangering national security and peaceful political advocacy. It appears to me that the Vietnamese government has exploited this and in doing so has violated numerous articles of the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, both of which apply in Vietnam as they are a signatory. To any reasonable person, the action of these seven standing up against corruption, seeking to avail themselves of constitutional rights, could hardly be seen to be criminal but rather the actions of a true patriot. They have been faithful to their religious ideals. They have been selflessly serving their communities. They rightly claim that the communist authorities in Vietnam are using the penal code to rationalise human rights abuses and the silencing of peaceful opposition. In any objective sense the Vietnamese government has failed in every way to prove that these seven people engaged in a single illegal act under international law and therefore the enforcement of article 79 of the code in this manner simply punishes the individuals for exercising their rights to freedom of association, freedom of assembly and participation in national affairs. 


I assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that as Australian parliamentarians we are not alone in our concern about Vietnam's arbitrary detention and conviction of innocent individuals who are fighting for freedom and justice. Human rights groups, elected officials and foreign embassies all around the world have criticised the regime and its actions. In another case of Vietnamese suppression a 50-year-old novelist and journalist, Tran Khai Thanh Thuy, was recently deported to the United States on humanitarian grounds following fierce pressure from the United States State Department and strong backing of Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez. Thuy had been sentenced to 3½ years imprisonment earlier that year on assault charge. The charge had been found to be a complete fabrication and an excuse by the government to arrest Thuy for her involvement in the pro-democratic movement, particularly her association with Viet Tan. Thuy's case is a landmark and it is the first time international pressure has been successful in affecting the actions of the Vietnamese government. As a signatory to the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, Vietnam has willingly agreed to grant its citizens the rights of freedom, particularly freedom of association.


As a trading partner and an aid donor, I believe Australia has a right to demand that Vietnam abide by its international legal obligations. On numerous occasions I have drawn the parliament's attention to the ongoing human rights abuses in Vietnam. Recently I spoke about three people who were jailed for nine years for organising a strike at a shoe factory in pursuit of fair wages and conditions. I have also spoken about the legal scholar, Cu Huy Ha Vu, jailed for seven years for initiating legal action in respect of a Chinese mining project and challenging the constitutional validity of a prohibition order against class actions.


We do not need to chronicle the human rights abuses; we need to see genuine progress. Positive outcomes can be achieved when pressure is placed on the Vietnamese government, as in the release of Tran Khai Thanh Thuy. This case is evidence that when we work in conjunction with the international community and put full pressure on the Vietnamese government we can work towards ending these atrocities. At the very minimum Australia, along with the international community, should demand that the undertakings given by the Vietnamese government in signing the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights be honoured. As I say, that should be seen as an absolute minimum. 


As you are aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, in my electorate I have the good fortune to represent a large number of Vietnamese people. Since the fall of Saigon some 36 years ago Australia has received 200,000 Vietnamese refugees. To Vietnamese people, this is still very real. We are not talking about something in a distant land; or about something in their immediate past, but their families and their welfare.


We have taken a leading role within our region in pursuing human rights and we should be proud of that. We have taken a leading role in developing trade in countries such as Vietnam. Again, that is something we should be proud of. In doing that, we need to go further. We should now be demanding of those countries that sign for whatever reason, trade based or otherwise, the International Convention for Civil and Political Rights that not only the spirit of that convention be upheld but each and every one of its articles, as they apply to its people—that is, in respect of the freedoms associated with the application of those conventions—also be honoured. It is not too much to ask that we, along with our international colleagues, work collectively to ensure that progress is made in improving human rights in Vietnam.

"Simpkins, Luke, MP",LP,2011-07-04,"



Mr SIMPKINS
 (Cowan) (18:40):  I take this opportunity to protest against the abuse by the government of Vietnam of human rights and the outrageous treatment of human rights activists, dissidents and supporters of a democratic Vietnam. It was certainly the case that when the detail of this motion was distributed I immediately sought the opportunity to speak. I believe that I am on the record in this place as being very strongly on the side of a free and democratic Vietnam. I thank my friends from the WA Vietnamese community: Peter Le, the president; Dai Nguyen, the vice-president; the committee, as well as my friends in Viet Tan, the Vietnam Reform Party; and the master of the Vietnamese temple, the venerable Thich Phuoc Nhon. 


I am particularly keen to participate because of my personal link in this matter. I say that because I worshipped with the members of the Cow Shed congregation of the Mennonite Church on Sunday, 9 January this year, and met with the friends and family of the seven people named in this motion. I sang with the members of the church and I prayed with them on that day. In speaking with the members of the church, we spoke of five of those mentioned in the motion: Pastor Khai; Evangelist Nguyen Chi Thanh; and followers Pham Van Thong, Nguyen Thanh Tam and Pham Ngoc Hoa. All were in jail at the time of my visit to the flooded Chuong Bo Church in Saigon. 


It is tragic that there were arrests and now sentencing, on 30 May 2011, of the seven activists. It is in fact an indictment of the Vietnamese system of government and justice system that they should be able to be convicted of a charge of attempting to overthrow the people's administration when what they did was to support open and accountable government, support human rights and act as patriots of a free and independent Vietnam. That is what they did when they chose to advocate for democratic reform; engage in non-violent protests to prepare and distribute materials affirming Vietnamese sovereignty over the Paracel and Spratly Islands; petition the state for redress on behalf of local landowners; and engage in peaceful advocacy for social justice. 


When I think of how these courageous people suffer for an excellent cause, I think back to that morning I spent with their family and friends. I will not name who was there in the church on that day, because I know that what I have said in the past here is read by the Vietnamese Ministry for Foreign Affairs and I do not want to put them at any more risk than they have already endured. However, there is not a day that goes by when I do not think of the Cow Shed Church and its members. I think of their fearlessness, their courage and their determination in the face of a government determined to maintain power, using security forces that amount to one officer for every 10 families in Vietnam. There is little doubt that those who choose to resist risk a great deal for their cause and their faith. Pastor Duong Kim Khai was evicted from his home where the congregation had met and had to move to the cow shed. So when I think of the wooden framed shed, with the palm tree frond roof and the flaps of silver insulation on the side and of the wooden plank that his wife has to sleep on it reminds me that there are big problems in Vietnam. It reminds me that the country is not democratic and that many people are oppressed by this regime. 


I recall how I got to the church that day after changing transport on many occasions just to avoid being followed. Yet for me that was just one morning, whereas for those who are still there it is their life and that breaks my heart. I therefore fully support the view expressed in this motion that the authorities of Vietnam use legal processes to rationalise human rights abuse and to silence peaceful opposition. We call on the federal government to use the full weight of their diplomatic relations with Vietnam to lobby for substantial reform in human rights and basic freedoms in accordance with the provisions of the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights, to which both Australia and Vietnam are parties. It is, however, right that I take this opportunity to speak more widely of religious freedom in Vietnam. From my two visits to Vietnam I am committed to the view that there is no religious freedom in Vietnam. If you want to worship you can do so, but you must provide the list of your congregation members to the authorities. You must also provide the names of anyone who visits your church or temple. Your minister must also be registered. So if you do all that, along with ensuring that any sermons are not critical of the government and that you fly the flag of the state in front of your church, then you can carry on. But I do not call that freedom of religion; that is just state controlled religion, and it is not what we would accept here in Australia.


On the matter of religious freedom in Vietnam, as part of my visit to Vietnam in January this year I had two meetings that I specifically wanted to achieve. I wanted to visit the Roman Catholic priest in Hue, Father Ly, and I wanted to visit the Most Venerable Thich Quang Do in Saigon, both of whom I have previously spoken about in the parliament, as has the member for Fowler. Father Ly, who was born in 1947, has spent more than 15 years in jail for his belief in freedom of speech and freedom of religion. He is a man committed to peaceful and non-violent protest. Father Ly has been speaking about and taking action for democracy and religious freedom for many years. Since 1977 he has been harassed, arrested, brutalised and jailed for his activities.


On 8 April 2006, a group of dissidents signed the Manifesto on Freedom and Democracy for Vietnam. The manifesto calls for a multiparty state in Vietnam and that group became known as Bloc 8406, named for the date they signed the manifesto. It calls for democracy, and Father Ly was a founding member for Bloc 8406. In September of that year, Father Ly was also involved in the establishment of the Vietnam Progression Party. For his courage and commitment to democracy and for his support of Bloc 8406, Father Ly was jailed for eight years on 30 March 2007. He had been arrested on 19 February after a raid by security police in the Catholic Archdiocese of Hue. Father Ly is a courageous and honourable man who has made great sacrifices for his beliefs. He has spent many years in jail. He has spent many years being harassed and brutalised by an oppressive regime. After suffering a stroke, he was released from jail and remains under house arrest in Hue. 


My meeting with Father Ly was scheduled for 7 January 2011. On 6 January, in Hanoi, I met the Deputy Director-General of the Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Mr Hoang Chi Trung said that if I attempted to visit Father Ly in Hue they could not guarantee my safety, which I took to mean I would be arrested and probably deported. Mr Trung also made reference to my support of what he called a 'terrorist organisation', the Viet Tan. In speaking of Father Ly, it was clear that the view of the deputy director-general was that any suggestion by Father Ly or others of establishing opposition parties or opposition bodies outside of state affiliation or agencies constituted a direct threat to national security. In this case, rather than risk deportation, I decided to go to Saigon and attempt to meet with the Most Venerable Thich Quang Do on 8 January. 


After being picked up in a taxi by two of the Most Venerable's followers, we drove into the suburbs of Saigon followed by security force officers. Despite being followed, we arrived at the Thanh Minh temple and were not stopped by the plain clothes security officers across the road. So in that regard I am grateful to the government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam for allowing that meeting to take place. In that meeting, the Most Venerable Thich Quang Do stated that nothing had changed in the last 30 years. He said that in Vietnam you must bow down to the communists and follow their orders. He said that in Vietnam, there is one police officer or security person for every 10 families and that while it was bad in Saigon, with security police ruling each district, it was worse in the country, where the security forces could oppress the local people extremely and easily, monitoring or stopping meetings taking place. Life in the country was already bad because people did not have enough food to eat.


Thich Quang Do also said to me that he and his supporters were always followed wherever they went and therefore he rarely went out other than for medical reasons, normally. It was clear on my arrival that plain clothes security personnel were across the laneway from the temple. He also said that he had never been charged, tried or convicted of any crime but he has been verbally told that he is under house arrest. But they are careful to ensure that there is no hard evidence of this abuse of his human rights.


In speaking about the situation in Vietnam, he said that the communists rule for themselves and they will never give up or share the power in Vietnam. He said they sell the country to China and reap the profits themselves as a small ruling elite. He said that many had died at the hands of the communists but another very important problem is the bribes and corruption. Corruption takes place from the local offices all the way up to the top officials.


It is certainly the case that when you look at what takes place in Vietnam, despite the assertions made by the ruling party in the country, there is a long way to go before there will be religious freedom. There is oppression that takes place across the whole spectrum, in religion as well as democracy—the oppression of the Montagnards, the Mennonite followers, the dissident Catholics, the dissident Buddhists. There is oppression everywhere and there is very little reform. So it is right that we talk about it in this place. We hope that the government will take it forward and continue to apply pressure, and apply more pressure, on the government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam to pursue dramatic reforms of human rights and freedoms via our diplomatic relations with that country.

"Parke, Melissa, MP",ALP,2011-07-04,"



Ms PARKE
 (Fremantle) (18:50):  I thank the member for Fowler for his motion and the member for Cowan for his words tonight. The motion that we are speaking to highlights the importance of Human Rights Day and details the difficult circumstances faced by many of the world's human rights defenders. I note the member has a particular focus on the situation in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, where the human rights situation continues to be dire in terms of freedoms of speech, press, assembly, movement and association and where political activists, unionists and human rights defenders continue to be arrested, detained and subjected to unfair trials in addition to lengthy periods of incarceration.


On 30 May this year, seven activists in Ben Tre were jailed for 'attempting to overthrow the people's administration' by engaging in such activities as attending courses on non-violent protest and assisting victims of government corruption. Human Rights Watch has called for the release of a number of corruption-busting human rights lawyers and legal defenders who have been arbitrarily arrested, detained, disbarred and pressured not to represent political or religious activists. Human Rights Watch has also noted in its country summary:


Vietnam, which served as the chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 2010, demonstrated little respect for core principles in the … (ASEAN) Charter to ""strengthen democracy"" and ""protect and promote human rights and fundamental freedoms.""


Earlier this year Amnesty International called for the release of Vi Duc Hoi, who was given an eight-year prison sentence for posting articles on the internet calling for democracy.


It is for reasons like these that the Human Rights Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade has commenced an inquiry into Australia's annual human rights dialogues with Vietnam and China. One of the main aims of the inquiry will be to ascertain whether Australian parliamentarians might have an expanded role in these dialogues.


Of course, as the member for Fowler has noted in his motion, instances of suppression of freedom of speech and of democratic participation are not confined to Vietnam and China. It is important that we continue to speak up for the benefit of human rights and democracy defenders in Burma, Iran, Syria, Bahrain, Pakistan, Western Sahara, Zimbabwe, Sri Lanka, Russia and other countries and that, to use Aung San Suu Kyi's words, we use our liberty to promote theirs.


In 2008 one of my favourite poets, Seamus Heaney, reflected on the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in an essay called The Poetic Redress, in which he wrote, inter alia:


All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.


In the boldness and buoyancy of these words there are echoes of many of the great foundational texts of western civilisation, from Sophocles' ""wonders of man"" chorus through Christ's Sermon on the Mount on up to the American Declaration of Independence and the French Declaration of the Rights of Man. So even if this First Article cannot guarantee what it declares, if its writ cannot be made to run in China or Zimbabwe or Guantanamo, it nevertheless gestures so confidently towards what human beings desire that it fortifies a conviction that the desirable can in fact be realised.


…   …   …


Since it was framed, the Declaration has succeeded in creating an international moral consensus. It is always there as a means of highlighting abuse if not always as a remedy: it exists instead in the moral imagination as an equivalent of the gold standard in the monetary system. The articulation of its tenets has made them into world currency of a negotiable sort. Even if its Articles are ignored or flouted—in many cases by governments who have signed up to them—it provides a worldwide amplification system for ""the still, small voice"".


…   …   …


Flouted though the Articles have been and continue to be, their vulnerability should perhaps be regarded as an earnest of their ultimate value. If, for example, an effort were to be made to enforce them by the exercise of military power—as in the effort to enforce ""democracy"" on Iraq—it would not only end in failure but would discredit utterly the very concept of human rights. They would be stigmatised as the attributes of an imperium rather than an inherent endowment of the species.


It is this vulnerable yet spiritually inviolate quality which makes them attractive not only to the wronged and the oppressed of the Earth, but to writers and poets as well. The Universal Declaration is not a sure-fire panacea for the world's ills; it is more geared to effect what I once called ""the redress of poetry"" than to intervene like a superpower. This idea of redress I discovered first in Simone Weil's book, Gravity and Grace, where she observes that if we know the way society is unbalanced, we must do what we can to add weight to the lighter side of the scale. The Universal Declaration, it seems to me, adds this kind of weight and contributes thereby to the maintenance of an equilibrium—never entirely achieved—between the rights and wrongs.


I thank the member for Fowler for once again reminding us of this international moral consensus and adding weight and buoyancy to the lighter side of the scale.

"Ruddock, Philip, MP",LP,2011-07-04,"



Mr RUDDOCK
 (Berowra) (18:55):  Like my colleagues who have spoken before me, can I congratulate the member for Fowler for bringing this matter forward. Unlike the member for Fowler, I have few Vietnamese living in my electorate and have, over a long period of time, taken a personal interest in these issues—only contained from the time I fulfilled ministerial responsibilities and was not free to speak beyond my portfolio responsibilities. But I must say that I was very impressed with the member for Cowan's comments about his activist role in relation to Vietnam. It reminded me of the time in which I visited Vietnam myself as a backbencher seeking the release of Vho Dey Thong, who was held in what was euphemistically known as the Hanoi Hilton. We were, I might say, able to secure his release. I do not know that it was all my efforts; it may have had something to do with someone well known to the member for Fremantle, the former foreign minister, Senator Evans, who I know took the matter up forcibly as well.


I command the member for Fremantle in relation to her comments tonight because they enabled us to focus on one area of the parliament—that is, the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and its Human Rights Subcommittee, which has had an opportunity to hear recently from a number of Vietnamese representatives about what was happening in Vietnam and inviting us to play a more active role. I might say that I particularly asked them after those hearings to obtain some information about what the international bodies are doing in relation to this matter—organisations like the United Nations Human Rights Council, who often opine on matters even relevant here in Australia. I wondered how active they were as part of the broader international community in taking these matters forward.


For my own part, I was for a long time associated with the Australian committee for a free Vietnam. I played a part in many debates about this matter of human rights in Vietnam since 1976, when the Communist Party came to power. I, like many, hoped in 1986, when they started to embark upon certain economic reforms, that we would see some change in their modus operandi. It is the case that the government has fostered economic growth and there has been some increase in standard of living. But it has also been accompanied by allegations of corruption and disputes over access to resources, particularly land, and we have seen a situation where the oppressive banning of political parties as well as trade unions and human rights organisations continues. The fact is that Vietnamese law has discriminated very significantly against religious groups, which are required to register. The adherents and some unregistered groups have been subjected to harassment and house arrest and detention. We have heard mention of that in relation to Protestant religious groups, the Roman Catholic Church and the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam, of which my friend Thich Quang Do in Canberra is very much associated.


I too read with great alarm the reports of what has happened to the seven people who have recently been convicted in a closed one-day trial. That is obviously what prompted this motion. I hope that the parliament will continue to take an interest in these matters. I would like to see the government play an active role in these matters, although I suspect that the member may not get what he seeks from the government. But I am sure, in the bilateral dialogues and in the human rights dialogues which the former government initiated, this would be a matter that people would want to see raised. I hope, through the monitoring of the Human Rights Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, we can play a part in ensuring that those matters are addressed very positively when that dialogue occurs. I thank the honourable member for raising the matter. I am sure his constituents will very much appreciate the effort that he has put in. (Time expired)

"O'Dwyer, Kelly, MP",LP,2011-07-04,"



Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (21:00):  One of the big risks to productivity is this government's lack of understanding of the economic fundamentals and how these economic fundamentals intersect with policy changes. This Labor government lacks an aspiration for the Australian people to obtain a higher standard of living and to grow their wealth and prosperity. These are things in which the government could assist by removing those things that would weigh productivity growth down or, worse still, make it negative. While the government wrestles with the short-term political problems of its own creation, it is neglecting the bigger picture. It is failing to put forward a long-term economic reform agenda. When the government talks about economic reform, all it can come up with is the mining tax and the carbon tax. In fact it has predicated all of its 'reforms' on new taxes. But what about real economic reform that targets productivity? Instead of introducing new taxes and calling it reform, why not go right to the heart of what generates our long-term economic growth and target our nation's productivity? As Gary Banks, the Chair of the Productivity Commission says: 


Productivity enhancing reform is so crucial to our economic (and social) futures because productivity growth itself – the ability to get more out of a country’s resources – is the mainstay of economic progress.


He also points out that productivity is currently facing a decline in Australia, stating:


Following a stellar performance in the 1990s, driven in large part by the structural reforms initiated in the previous decade, our productivity growth in the early 2000s fell back to its long term average. That in itself is no cause for alarm. But since then it has fallen below even pre-1990 rates. In the most recent year for which we have data, 2009-10, there was only slight growth in (the traditional 12 industry) market sector MFP; though this was an improvement on the previous year when MFP, buffeted by the global crisis, actually fell by 2.4 per cent, something not seen in almost 30 years.


In the March quarter we saw that GDP per hour worked was lower than in the last quarter of the coalition government. We are not simply talking about a slowing in the rate of growth; it is much more significant than that. We are talking about a decline. Eleven years of coalition government delivered an increase of more than 25 per cent in GDP per hour worked. Less than four years of Labor-Green government has seen a fall in GDP per hour worked. So we have a situation where productivity is declining in Australia. We are not getting as much out of our labour and capital resources. If this trend continues and policy is not geared towards helping us improve our productive capacity then we are essentially forgoing a higher standard of living for no good reason. 


One of the most effective means of improving productivity is to encourage wider workplace participation. As I have said before in this place, central to employment participation is a flexible workplace system. The union dominated government has turned back the clock, not just BH, before Howard, but BH, before Hawke and Keating. This government has gone so far as to wind back reforms championed by Hawke and Keating, returning us to antiquated system of union dominated bargaining arrangements where you can strike before negotiations rather than after them. I do not propose, however, to focus on this issue tonight; rather, tonight I want to focus on getting more women and more parents into jobs when they are interested in working. This is clearly something which can potentially boost our productivity to a significant degree. 


We know that the current ABS measure of unemployment does not tell the full story on what is happening behind the scenes when it comes to our unemployed. What we cannot tell from the headline unemployment figure is how many people who are currently working are seeking more hours but cannot get them. Equally, there are countless women who have resigned themselves from the job-seeking process because they have taken on primary care responsibilities and are unable to find appropriate work. Together, this unidentified group of people represents what the Australian Financial Review has called a 'hidden army of unemployed'. We cannot see them, because they have left the job-seeking process disheartened, but we know they exist. Bringing parents into the workforce or allowing them to work more hours, or to have flexibility in workplace arrangements, are important steps towards greater workforce participation. One of the biggest barriers parents are facing is a lack of quality affordable childcare. This means that work arrangements need to be stretched in order to earn an adequate income to support the family. While the working-aged female participation rate has increased from around 50 per cent to 70 per cent over the past 30 years, workforce participation by Australian women during their peak childbearing years has been reduced by a greater amount than it has for women in other leading industrialised countries.


As the Prime Minister acknowledged in her address to the Australia Day reception at the start of this year, analyses of the causes of lower rates of participation amongst women have repeatedly highlighted the problem of accessing affordable child care. This is absolutely true. But what has Labor done about it? We were told that there was a crisis facing working families and that hundreds of new childcare facilities were required. Before the 2007 election, Labor promised to build an additional 260 childcare centres. This was supposed to be the government's solution to the 'double drop-off'. After promising to build these additional 260 childcare centres, this government has now done a triple-backflip-with-pike and announced it will build only 38. The government promised that it would deliver, and the women of Australia took Labor at its word. Unfortunately for them, this ended up being just another item on the long list of broken promises and failures in policy. At last reckoning, only three childcare centres had been constructed in three years. At this rate, an average of one a year, we have another 35 years to go.


In the 2010 budget, the Gillard government made a decision to stop funding the Take a Break program, TAB, a program supported by federal and state governments to provide occasional care to parents. It delivered practical services to families that did not require full-time care but did require a childcare service on an occasional or ad hoc basis. This program was a great example of federal and state cooperation to deliver vital services to the community. These services ceased as of 30 June 2010, and parents who relied on these services were forced to make adjustments to their work arrangements. The original funding mix was 70 per cent Commonwealth and 30 per cent state government. Since the discontinuation of the TAB program, the Victorian government did its best to continue to fund the program for an extra year, until 30 June 2011. But of course this placed a significant strain on the Victorian state budget, particularly the one that blew out thanks to the legacy of the last Labor government.


The current Victorian Minister for Children and Early Childhood Development, the Hon. Wendy Lovell, has said that the Victorian government will continue to fund the program until 31 December 2011. The Victorian government has formally requested that the Gillard-Greens government renew its commitment to the program—but to no avail. If the Gillard-Greens government is serious about its childcare commitment, it will reinstate funding for the TAB program and allow the states to continue to fund their share of the program on a sustainable basis.


It was a coalition government that introduced the childcare rebate in 2005—the most significant reform introduced in this area, and one that has had bipartisan support for many years since its inception. We went to the last election with a policy of reintroducing indexation of the childcare rebate. For those parents receiving the maximum childcare rebate, this would have provided a benefit of around $300 per year for every child in care, and the coalition is currently committed to reinstating the $12.6 million of occasional care funding cut by Labor.


Labor is also making child care more expensive through their rushed National Quality Framework, which they have committed to rolling out from January next year. This framework will increase cost-of-living pressures on families that are already under significant financial stress. Industry predicts that the impact of this new regulation will be between $12 and $22 a day. Other surveys have predicted that the cost of the new regulatory scheme will impact the cost of child care by, on average, $13 a day. Any way you cut it, it is significantly more than the 50c to $1.70 figures that the minister is so fond of quoting.


On 30 June the Productivity Commission released its draft research report Early childhood development workforce, which went further. It said that the costs would be significantly increased if this quality childcare framework was introduced. It said specifically:


In practice, it is likely that the majority of the increased cost will be shared between governments and parents. The Australian Government will fund up to half of the increase in costs through current child care subsidy arrangements, the Child Care Benefit and the Child Care Rebate. However, parents are likely to pay the majority of the remainder of the increase.


The impact of this increase will not be felt evenly—disadvantaged children often come from disadvantaged backgrounds, and many forms of disadvantage place additional pressure on family budgets. In the absence of appropriately targeted additional funding, the increase in ECEC costs will see some children have reduced access to, or be withdrawn from, ECEC services, many of whom would have stood to benefit most from these services.


It could not be plainer than that. In my seat of Higgins and in the municipality of Stonnington there are 21 council-run and private childcare providers. All of them will be impacted, just as every family who uses them will be impacted.


To put an end to Labor's short-term view of the economy we need a vision that will encompass our long-term productivity needs while giving everyone the opportunity to participate in work and in society. Labor has failed to provide this vision time and time again.


Tony Abbott announced a much more comprehensive paid parental leave scheme that would better meet the financial needs of Australian families. The coalition announced a much more generous scheme that also undertook to provide 26 weeks with full superannuation, compared with Labor's 18 weeks and no superannuation. Our policy provides maximum social benefits, whereas Labor's scheme falls short of delivering real outcomes. Labor's pattern of failure is a pattern that Australian parents can do without. We will continue to advocate for our superior economic policy.
