Senator MADIGAN
 (Victoria) (09:34):  by leave—I seek to clarify a small matter in relation to an adjournment speech I gave last night. The 'Oh, what a tangled web we weave' quotation I referred to last night was originally thought to have come from Shakespeare. Literary experts tell me it was actually first used by Scott. It is important to be correct on this. The proposed wind farm project on the former Gunns site recently morphed into a tourist project. I also referred to Mr Oquist as having worked for the MEP, the Motoring Enthusiast Party. In fact, his reported official engagement was with the PUP. Small matters but it is important to correct them. Thank you.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (09:35):  I seek leave to make a five-minute statement.



The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted.




Senator WONG:
  Today the government will use its numbers with the support of some members of the crossbench to deny this Senate its opportunity to fully consider the carbon price. It will truncate debate and it will put all of the remaining questions at 11.50 this morning. So after just two days of debate in the current Senate, the government is forcing debate on this package of nine bills to an end. Let us just reflect, if we may, before this motion is put, about the events of this week. On three or four sitting days this week, this government has moved motions without notice, seeking to cut short debate on these bills. At the end of this morning's procedural votes, the new crossbench will have been asked to vote five times—



Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order on my right!




Senator WONG:
  in their first week to stop senators doing what we were sent here to do which is to debate legislation. Having already forced this Senate to sit in July, just days after new senators took their seats, and having already brought forward debate on the carbon bills from 14 July, what we have seen is this government bullying, cajoling, and pressuring the crossbench into shutting down debate after just two days. 


I indicated yesterday that the opposition had on Tuesday offered to give up our time not only this morning but also this afternoon for further debate on the carbon price bills. This Leader of the Government in the Senate did not do me, the opposition or any senator, as far as I am aware, the courtesy of even responding to that offer. The response that we did get was the motion moved yesterday, without notice, in which the government sought unsuccessfully to bring the debate to an end by lunchtime that day. So I say this to the crossbench: we accept your right to have different views on the substantive issues before the chamber—and you will have different views on the substantive issues. We accept your right to debate them; we accept your right to vote the way you wish to vote. What I say to the crossbench is: the chamber does not need to operate in this way. The chamber does not need in the first week of the sitting of the new Senate to have no less than five votes to shut down debate and to have three or four days of procedural debate because the government wants to shut down debate. It is not because they have to get the bill through; the bill would have got through. All of you, or your staff, were at the meeting of leaders and whips and you know that the bill would have passed this fortnight—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  On a point of order, Mr President. I draw the Senate's attention to standing order 194, which says:


(1) A senator shall not digress from the subject matter of any question under discussion, or anticipate the discussion of any subject which appears on the Notice Paper.


My point of order, Mr President, is that Senator Wong is clearly anticipating a discussion on something that is on the Notice Paper for discussion later today. She is suggesting that different senators may vote a particular way, and in so doing I think she breaches the provisions of standing order 194.



The PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order, Senator Macdonald. Senator Wong has been given leave by the Senate to speak for five minutes concerning these bills.




Senator WONG:
  Again, I say to the crossbench: the chamber should not operate this way. Just because this government has no respect for the Senate does not mean that you have to accept this. I say to you: do not let the events and the practices of this week become the norm. Do not let the Prime Minister's office and its enforcers lean on you to shut down debate, to deny scrutiny, to turn this place into an arm of the Prime Minister's press office by telling the media what you will do before you tell them—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  On a point of order, Mr President. I raise for your attention and the Senate's attention standing order 193, relating to use of offensive words et cetera. The bit I want to draw to your attention, Mr President, is this:


… all imputations of improper motives and all personal reflections on those Houses, members or officers shall be considered highly disorderly.


The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate is suggesting that some senators who are not members of the coalition are part of, I think she said, the Prime Minister's media campaign or media group. 



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  I hear the interjections of Senator Bilyk. She has never even read the standing orders and would not know how to if she did.



Senator Bilyk interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald, stay with the point of order. 




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  I ignore the interjection, Mr President, and suggest that Senator Wong is imputing improper motives to those who might have a different view from her on the subject.




Senator Moore:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order. I want to make the point that Senator Wong was in the process of making her statement in response to the lead that was given. It is interesting that Senator Macdonald, in calling a point of order on a point about casting reflection in the chamber, needed to use the same point of order against one of the senators on this side of the chamber.



The PRESIDENT:  You are starting to debate, Senator Moore. Order! Senator Macdonald has the right to raise a point of order. In this case there is no point of order. Senator Wong has been given leave.




Senator WONG:
  I say to the crossbench: do not let the events of this week become the norm with the Prime Minister's office and its enforcers and others leaning on you to shut down debate, to deny scrutiny, to turn this place into an arm of the Prime Minister's press office. As I said, the media are told what you will do before you tell the chamber, and the conclusion of this debate is timed so as to accord with the Prime Minister's schedule for his media conference. I say this to the crossbench: do not let this Senate become Mr Abbott's rubber stamp. 




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  On a point of order, Mr President. Not only is that an imputation against senators, but it is also an imputation against a member of the other House, namely the Prime Minister—



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  and the allegations that he is leaning on senators and that senators are going to become part of his rubber stamp are imputations of improper motives.



Senator Conroy interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Conroy, it will be quicker if you allow the debate to proceed correctly. On the point of order, Senator Macdonald, you possibly have a technical correction in your point of order, but if I were to apply that point of order to every senator in this chamber, debate would be completely stifled. However, could I remind all senators, not just Senator Wong, that standing orders do exist to run orderly and respectful debate.




Senator WONG:
  This government has turned on the people who elected it and only this chamber can stand up to them. So I say again to the crossbench: do not let this Senate become Mr Abbott's rubber stamp and do not allow the events of this week to become the norm. There is a better way to run this chamber. We are prepared to be reasonable up front and negotiate. We do not need the stealth-attack approach to running the Senate chamber.

Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Minister for Employment) (09:44):  I seek leave to make a short statement.



The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator ABETZ:
  Thirty-three hours and 52 minutes of debate, plus that which has occurred this week, has already taken place on these measures. Fifty-two bills were guillotined in this place without a single syllable spoken, courtesy of Senator Wong and the Greens—let's keep that in mind. The urgency of this is that the markets need to react to the decision of the Senate in relation to the carbon tax. Given that the Labor-Greens carbon tax, which we were promised would not be introduced, ticked over again on 1 July with another rate increase, power companies need to know whether or not to charge the extra tax imposed by Labor. The urgency of this is so that we can do the will of the Australian people and remove this toxic tax, which is a burden on the cost of living and which has been destroying jobs without doing anything for the environment.

The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator MILNE:
  What has gone on here this week is that the government has abused process by bringing the Senate back in the first week. The Greens opposed that decision at the time and said clearly that the Prime Minister wanted to ram through his political agenda in this first week with people who were new to the Senate. What we are now experiencing is the logical extension of his intention to show such contempt for the Senate and for new senators. Since the government are intending to cut this debate short and deny much time to speak on it, I urge the minister to stop filibustering in the committee part of this debate, so that we can get questions answered in the very short time we have.

 (South Australia) (09:46):  I seek leave to make a short statement.



The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator XENOPHON:
  In the six years I have been here I have always hated the guillotine. I hate the gag. I hate the fact that this time last year there were something like 50 bills rammed through without any debate. We need to have a better way of doing things. I appreciated very much yesterday that Senator Milne gave an opportunity to at least extend the debate by several hours. That was at least some improvement in the process. This is the Hobson's choice I have. I cannot in good conscience support a guillotine. Where I stand in this debate is another issue, but I urge my colleagues to consider that there must be a better way of managing the business of this place. Maybe earlier this week we should have agreed to sit extra hours so there could be extra debate. That motion was not forthcoming. In the circumstances, I expect these bills will be dealt with today. It would have been better if we had had much more time.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the motion moved by Senator Fifield that certain bills be considered urgent be agreed to.

  Mr President, I raise a point of order and I seek your advice in relation to it. You have already ruled that the stunt that we saw in the gallery was a disturbance of the Senate under matters constituting contempt in the rules. The matter I raise with you and seek your ruling on is: a couple of senators actually turned around and applauded those who had deliberately disturbed the Senate. I wonder if that constitutes a contempt by those senators who were clearly encouraging people to disturb the Senate. 



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald, that does not constitute a contempt. However, it is disorderly conduct and I was going to raise the matter privately. Senator Macdonald, you have raised the point of order and thank you.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2014-07-10,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (10:03):  Yesterday I raised with Senator Cormann as to why the Liberal Party would not be supporting these amendments, because they bring in a market based mechanism to deal with carbon pollution—something that Liberal Parties usually support. However, Senator Cormann made it clear that, obviously, the government is not supporting this market based mechanism despite the number of conservatives across the globe that are urging the government to do so—that is, people on their own side asking this government to recognise that it is denying its own policy of supporting market based mechanisms by not supporting this amendment for an emissions trading scheme.


Beyond asking Senator Cormann why the Liberal Party will not support a market based mechanism, I now ask: why will the Liberal Party not support the science? The science tells us clearly why we need an emissions trading scheme. The science goes back to before 1990 when we had the first IPCC report and we have had subsequent reports—I think there have been five since that time, all of which have the support of over 100 countries who make it clear that there have been observed changes in the climate system and that we need to respond as governments across the globe to those observed changes. 


What are those observed changes? I am sure Senator Cormann knows, but he needs to be reminded because this is, I have to say, a day where this country is going to go backwards on climate policy. These are the reasons Labor acted strongly, because carbon dioxide concentrations have increased by 40 per cent since pre-industrial times—primarily, from fossil fuel emissions and, secondly, from net land-use change emissions. The oceans have absorbed around 30 per cent of that emitted anthropogenic carbon dioxide causing ocean acidification. 


Continued emissions of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and changes in all components of the climate system. Limiting climate change requires substantial and sustained reductions of greenhouse gas emissions. The best way for a country to address a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions has been made very clear by economists and scientists: through an emissions trading scheme. We are debating this amendment, because it is so important for this country to play its part internationally in trying to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by putting a legal cap on carbon dioxide pollution. That is what an emissions trading scheme does and that is why it is so surprising that Senator Cormann provided comment yesterday as to why the Liberal Party, the coalition, will not support a market based mechanism. I am still baffled as to why the Liberal Party does not support market based mechanisms.


On top of that, though, the Liberal Party is ignoring the will of the Australian community. The number of people who came out this week, last week—since this debate was put on the table for this parliament—against having no legal limit on carbon pollution and against there being no price on carbon, has become stronger and stronger. This government cannot ignore those voices. The voices of some 20 civil society groups, ranging from youth, health, community, emergency services, trade unions and faith based groups have made themselves heard very loudly this week. I ask Senator Cormann: is he aware of this huge list of growing community groups who have made their dissent and their views known about this government's policy when it comes to climate change?


I could not say it more succinctly than they have said it, when they said in their statement: 'We support Australia having a price and a limit on carbon pollution. This is the fairest and most cost-effective way for Australia to address our economy's dependence on carbon pollution and reduce its impacts on our climate, our health, the environment, the economy and national security.' Therein lies the full breadth of what these repeal bills mean. Yes, they mean something for our environment, but they mean so much more than that. They mean something for our health, they mean something for our economy and they mean something for our national security.


This is a holistic policy issue. It is a holistic policy issue that commenced decades and decades ago when the science made it very clear—through the work of the IPCC and its associated hundreds and hundreds of peer reviewed scientists who have contributed to its reports—that the world needs to act swiftly on reducing carbon pollution, on reducing the greenhouse gas emissions that are continuing to have a huge effect in changing our climate, which has of course has had thrown-on effects to do with natural disasters and the like. That is why it is important beyond just our environment. That is why it is important for our health. That is why it is important for our national security, our economy and those issues that have been raised by those 20 civil society groups.


So I ask Senator Cormann if he is aware of those 20 strong community groups of various persuasions, including, as I said, emergency service workers and firefighters—some of whom were here yesterday out the front of Parliament House making it very clear that they want this parliament to act on climate change, to have a price on carbon pollution and to have a legal limit on carbon pollution. How can Senator Cormann ignore those 20 community groups? How can he ignore the 200 young people I joined earlier in the week? How can he ignore the science? And how can the Liberal Party ignore a market based mechanism to deal with a reduction in carbon pollution?


I understand it has been reported this morning that both the United States and China have signed eight partnership pacts on climate change, bringing the two powers—which both have extensive emissions trading schemes in place at different levels—closer together. So, as I said yesterday, it is a complete furphy for Prime Minister Abbott to claim that the world is not acting on emissions trading schemes. The world is acting strongly on them. This is made clear in the Parliamentary Library's work on the number of emissions trading schemes that have been in place in China, the US and elsewhere in the world—China, most notably, being the country proposing new schemes and with a network already of seven pilot schemes. They want to reduce their carbon emissions. They want to act on climate change.


After today, Australia will be the only country in the world moving backwards—going backwards. Yes, that will have an effect with respect to our international standing. How we are addressing this increase in greenhouse gas emissions will of course have an effect not only on our environment but also on our health and on our well-being as a nation. So I ask Senator Cormann again: why is the Liberal Party not supporting an emissions trading scheme? Why are you not supporting a market based mechanism to put a legal cap on carbon pollution? I cannot help but think that it is anything other than pure politics—and, of course, the ideological bent of some on your side. I think Senator Macdonald fits the mould of not accepting the science. In addition, I ask Senator Cormann about his knowledge and understanding of the statement provided by those 20 community groups and how he wishes to respond to their voices.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (10:13):  Thank you, Mr Chairman.




Senator Cormann:
  I thought we were going from side to side.



The CHAIRMAN:  I understand that point, but in these discussions it is often Senate practice that party leaders, ministers, the Leader of the Government in the Senate or spokespeople for the opposition take precedence.




Senator Cormann:
  That is not right.



The CHAIRMAN:  Excuse me; don't tell me it is not right, Senator Cormann. This is in Senate Practice, and I will refer you to the appropriate clauses if you wish. I will certainly come to you, Senator Macdonald, but both you and Senator Milne jumped at the same time and I am following what I believe is Senate practice in giving the Leader of the Australian Greens party precedence in that call.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  My understanding is that you always go from side to side—government, opposition, government, opposition, and so on. If you have a party representing an infinitesimally small part of the Australian public, claiming that because she or he is the leader of that, should not in my view interfere with the normal procedure of going government, opposition, and then third parties, if that is the case.



The CHAIRMAN:  For senators interested, I refer them to pages 240 to 241 of Odgers' Australian Senate Practice.




Senator MILNE:
  I have a number of specific questions, because we are in the committee stage of this particular set of bills, and we now have a gag on it, thanks to the government, with the support of the Palmer United Party. I want to ask some very specific questions. I asked Senator Cormann last night how much of the five per cent emissions reduction target was expected to be delivered by the Emissions Reduction Fund. The government still has not responded to that. It is important that they do, because there are certain senators in here who have said they will not support the abolition of the existing emissions trading scheme unless there is something better in its place. Therefore, we need to have the government say exactly what they expect their Emissions Reduction Fund to do.


I also have some other specific questions for the minister and I will go to those now. The Australian Renewable Energy Agency, ARENA, and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation were secured by the Greens through the negotiations with the former government to develop the Clean Energy Package. The allocation of funds for ARENA was in the legislation. The abolition legislation is to come here later, but the schedule to gut the funding from ARENA is part of these bills.


I understand that an agreement has been reached with the Palmer United Party to take millions out of the ARENA funding and support the government's schedule. I find it extraordinary that we do not have a single member of the Palmer United Party here, in the committee stage, when they have an amendment that I would like some answers to. I would like to know why or whether they are going to support an emissions trading scheme, as their leader has said. But I understand they have abandoned this debate on getting rid of the emissions trading scheme—and returning millions to the pockets of Mr Palmer—to go and launch a report on renewable energy. We love renewable energy, and I am very grateful for the fact—



The CHAIRMAN:  Senator Macdonald on a point of order.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  The reflection on a member of another house in this parliament, that he is voting for this thing to put millions in his pocket, is clearly disorderly and insulting. I ask that you ask the senator to withdraw.



The CHAIRMAN:  Senator Milne, I think you ought not reflect on members of other houses in that way.




Senator MILNE:
  I withdraw that and note that Mr Palmer abstained from the vote in the House of Representatives because he has a conflict of interest. I have called many times for the Palmer United Party senators to abstain from the vote because of the clear conflict of interest. The nickel refinery in Queensland operated by Mr Palmer's company had a substantial carbon price bill to pay—many millions—which was settled only a few weeks ago, prior to his new senators coming here. I think there should have been a discussion here about the actual impact of the extent to which taxpayers' money is now going to be taken out of their pockets to support the government's scheme. And what we are now seeing is a reward to the big polluters—$18 billion is going to be left in the pockets of the big polluters and the community is going to have to pay through other means.


I want to return to the point of the schedule of funding for ARENA for the minister to explain something to me. Now we have a situation where ARENA is going to have only $89 million next year and $57 million the year after, in new funding—although, they will have the funding they set aside for their existing projects. Given this really substantial cut in the funding for ARENA and given the dates on which the current board members lose their positions—I understand the contracts for two board members run out on 30 June and the final two are on 15 July—I ask the minister, now that the Senate has made its position clear that it wants to keep the Australian Renewable Energy Agency: will the minister make sure there are board appointments so that the agency can continue with the level of funding that it will now have?


I would like to ask specifically about the level of funding. If it turns out that any of the projects that have already been approved do not proceed, will ARENA be able to keep the funding that is freed up as a result of projects not being able to proceed? I would like to have a clear answer on the board members. Are they going to be re-appointed or are other people going to be appointed? Secondly, on the issue of existing projects, will any funding savings from those be retained in the organisation? Thirdly, with this schedule of cuts, have you had any discussions with ARENA about taking this money from them? And what will it actually mean in terms of investing in the early research and development ARENA was set up to do?


I want to now move to the amendment that the Palmer United Party has, which is related to guaranteeing that—



The CHAIRMAN:  That amendment has not as yet been moved. We are dealing with the first amendment.




Senator MILNE:
  I will wait until somebody turns up to move it and I will return to discussing the first amendment. I want to ask the minister some specific questions. A lot has been said about the supposed freeing up of industry from the ending of carbon pricing, and I want to ask the minister about its impact on Hydro Tasmania. Last week, Hydro announced that they would be scrapping 100 jobs in Tasmania—10 per cent of their workforce. They have gone on to say that their last annual report attributed $140 million of their profit entirely to the price on carbon and that it would have been even higher for the financial year that has just finished. Will the minister now confirm that that revenue stream to Hydro Tasmania will be gone? Can he further confirm, as Saul Eslake, one of their board members, has stated that 81c in every dollar of Hydro's profit goes to the state government? And will he confirm that this means the $112 million that went to the Tasmanian government for schools, hospitals, concession payments et cetera will now no longer exist? Will he confirm that abandoning the carbon price will lead to direct job losses in Tasmania? This is clearly what the impact will be from ending carbon pricing in Tasmania.


I want to come back to the emissions trading scheme itself and ask the minister: have you had any representations from the Australian Industry Group, the Business Council of Australia, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry or any other peak business group asking you to retain an emissions trading scheme? Have you had any representations from business groups saying that they would support the retention of an emissions trading scheme if it went to flexible pricing immediately, and therefore the European price would bind at $7 to $9 or thereabouts? Having seen reports today that the government has ruled out emissions trading as something that it would even consider, I ask: has the government told that to these business groups or is it in conversation with them about allowing the purchase of CER credits, currently trading at 16 euro cents—25c, or thereabouts, Australian?


I think it would be extremely useful to get some answers in relation to those particular matters, because today is the day that Australia goes backwards—absolutely backwards. If we lose our price on carbon, we are going to be seen as a backward country in a global context. We are going to be seen as being on the wrong side of history, because every other major economy is now looking to the 2015 global treaty. With so many countries now involved in emissions trading and in various forms of carbon pricing, carbon taxing and other measures, Australia is going to be left on its own, and you are going to have answer to future generations. In fact, this summer, as extreme weather events set in around Australia, people are going to be seeing you in the context of having rewarded the big polluters and as having passed the cost to the community—cost in terms of lost infrastructure and cost in terms of absolute loss, not only of infrastructure but, of course, of people's lives. That is the absolute issue we have before us here in this parliament today. It is one of those moments in history that matter, where a country chooses the past or the future, where a country chooses the big end of town and the vested interests of the old order or the future—the new industries, the new economy, the innovation and the investment in education and new technology. This is why I am pleased that we are keeping the Renewable Energy Agency, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Climate Change Authority, because we need good, sound assessment done with rigour on new projects and on climate science and policy. I ask as a final question on the Climate Change Authority and in this context: how many board members of the Climate Change Authority have resigned to date? What is the process for appointment of new board members?

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (10:26):  I actually want to ask the minister some questions, but before I do I just want to explain to those who might be listening to the debate what the committee stage of a bill is—which is what we are dealing with now. This stage gives senators the opportunity to ask either the minister or whoever has moved the amendment questions on particular information in the bill or the amendment.


I mention in passing that we have had all these pious pleas from senators over the last couple of days about not having enough time for debate, and yet we had the first speaker for the opposition this morning spend 15 minutes on a rhetorical address—something that she and her colleagues have said many times over—to the Senate and not ask a serious question, except for: 'Why doesn't the Liberal Party support market schemes?' This has nothing to do with the bill before the chamber. There is the hypocrisy of senators claiming a shortage of time to ask questions when it is wasted on a 15-minute speech that we have all heard time and time again.


I have to say to Senator Milne that at least she did start off by asking some questions about the matter before the chair, but then she could not help herself and got into the rhetoric of the big end of town. I think Senator Singh also mentioned those conservative groups. No doubt they are both talking about Lord Deben—a retired United Kingdom politician, who is now 'His Lordship' and a member of the unelected upper house in the United Kingdom and who has very significant business interests in the biggest wind farming conglomerate in Europe. He is also a consultant for a sustainability consultancy company. One might ask Lord Deben when he comes to interfere in Australian politics just what his interest in wind farms and alternative energies is. I have said in the media that matters relating to Australian policy and Australian government are matters for Australian politicians, not for retired British politicians now serving in the unelected House of Lords. If he wants to take part in the debate, perhaps he could just indicate to us what his financial interest is in ensuring that sustainable renewable energy continues in Europe and in the United Kingdom.


As I said, I do want to ask some questions about the bill before the chamber. I will try to do that quickly, because I acknowledge that, although we have had these debates ad infinitum over many years, there is a limit on the time today and I do not want to take up the time of other senators who want to put forward genuine questions. But I might say to the Labor Party that, if all they are going to do is to get up and give 15-minute political addresses about what we have heard time and time again, that is not what the committee stage is about. If that is going to be abused I would urge other senators to take note of the hypocrisy of the Labor Party in not using the time to ask questions but simply giving boringly repetitive speeches that we have heard many times before.


Minister, you have been asked by Senator Milne about the job losses that might occur in Tasmania if something happens, but I would like to ask the minister a similar question. Minister, do you have any reliable statistics on the job losses in Australia that have happened as a result of the imposition by the Labor-Greens alliance of a carbon tax? I know we can look at Toyota and Holden; we can look at the coalmines of Central Queensland, up where I come from; we see reports of the numbers of jobs that have been lost; we see increasingly Australian manufacturing organisations moving overseas because of the high cost of energy and the carbon tax. So I ask the minister whether he does have any statistics about that. That is one question.


I also want to ask the minister: is it correct that Australia emits less than 1.4 per cent of the world's carbon emissions? The great friend of the Labor Party, Lord Deben, is indicating that the United Kingdom climate is part and parcel of the Australian climate. That is a self-evident statement, I would think. Of course, the globe's climate is one and the same thing. But he and the Labor Party and the Greens seem to think that, because Australia—which emits less than 1.4 per cent of the carbon emissions in the world—is getting rid of this carbon tax, that it is going to affect the climate of the United Kingdom and everywhere else in the world. I am sure the minister will be able to assist me as well on just what percentage of the world's carbon emissions come from Europe, from China and from North America. If that is readily available I would appreciate the minister's answer, because I just want to put it in perspective. Australia emits, I think—I seek confirmation—less than 1.4 per cent of the world's emissions of carbon. The Labor scheme was meant to reduce that 1.4 per cent by five per cent. According to Senator Milne and Lord Deben, all these cyclones would stop, all the floods would stop and all the coral bleaching would stop if Australia were to reduce its 1.4 per cent of emissions by five per cent. I simply ask the question, Minister: is it correct that Australia emits less than 1.4 per cent?


I also want to ask the minister to remind me, if he has this information, what the Labor government's forward trajectory of carbon emissions in Australia was under their scheme. I seem to recall that, rather than reducing carbon emissions, the Labor scheme actually quite substantially increased carbon output through to 2020. I seek the minister's advice on that.


Finally, I suspect the minister may have answered this question yesterday when I was not in the chamber—I think Senator Xenophon may have raised it—but perhaps the minister could explain briefly why the government did not accept the amendment of Senator Xenophon. Senators might recall that I actually voted against my government and in favour of Senator Xenophon's motion because, having seen it only very quickly in the previous division and having less than 60 seconds to make up my mind, it did seem to be quite a fair second reading amendment that sought to look at a couple of other aspects—besides the carbon tax, that is—of the increases in electricity.



The CHAIRMAN:  Senator Macdonald, I draw your attention to the fact that that amendment was dealt with yesterday and is not part of the question before the committee.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Okay. I apologise for that. That was a second reading amendment, but I understand that Senator Xenophon did ask yesterday in the same way that I am asking today. The chairman at the time did not stop Senator Xenophon. I am just interested, not in dealing with the second reading amendment, but I will remove that from my questions for the minister, unless he should be desperate to answer it. I will leave my questions to those that I have raised.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2014-07-10,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (10:36):  I thank Senator Macdonald and other senators for the questions they have raised as part of this debate. I will do my best to give a comprehensive answer to all of them. Firstly, yes, I can confirm that Australia is responsible for less than 1.4 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Senator Macdonald asked me how that compares with the emissions from other jurisdictions. The advice I have is that the United States is responsible for 19 per cent of global emissions, China is responsible for 23 per cent of global emissions and the European Union is responsible for 13 per cent of global emissions.


I can also confirm for Senator Macdonald that, according to the previous government's own modelling of the impact of their carbon tax, after all of the imposts and all of the sacrifices imposed on the Australian community with their carbon tax, emissions in Australia were continuing to go up and up and up. In fact, Labor's own modelling of their carbon tax showed that their expectation was that emissions in Australia would go from 561 million tonnes of CO2 in 2010 to 621 million tonnes of CO2 in 2020. These are not my words. That is the information that was provided by the previous Labor-Green government. They will say, 'But it would have been so much higher if it had not been for our carbon tax.' What we say is, to the extent that it is not as high as it might have been, that is only because we have shifted economic activity, along with all of the emissions that come with it, from Australia to other parts of the world.


This is something the Labor Party has never understood. The problem is that, if you take manufacturing activity that is comparatively—internationally—environmentally efficient here in Australia and you move it to other parts of the world where the emissions for the same amount of output are going to be higher, then what you are actually ending up with is higher global greenhouse gas emissions. The Labor-Green carbon tax actually makes global greenhouse gas emissions worse, not better. Even with Labor's carbon tax, emissions were still expected to go up. To the extent that they are not going up by as much as they otherwise might have, they are just shifting emissions to other parts of the world where, on many occasions, for the same level of economic output those emissions are going to be higher than they would have been in Australia.


Senator Macdonald asked me about job losses. Obviously, if you impose additional costs on doing business here in Australia that are not faced by our competitors in other parts of the world, then you make it harder for businesses in Australia to compete with businesses in other parts of the world, to the extent that they take market share away from us. Obviously, that means that not only economic activity and emissions go overseas but also jobs go overseas. Just to put a bit of context around all of that, a report that was released by none other than the Productivity Commission said:


… no country currently imposes an economy-wide tax on greenhouse gas emissions or has in place an economy-wide ETS.


Australia's carbon tax of $24.15 per tonne, which went up again on 1 July to about $25 per tonne, covers around 60 per cent of total emissions. By comparison, the European Union emissions trading scheme covers just 45 per cent of total emissions at around $7 to $8 dollars a tonne. The United States does not have a nation-wide emissions trading scheme. Senators on the other side can repeat ad nauseam what they have tried to make people believe for many years now. The United States does not have an emissions trading scheme. President Barack Obama does not have any intention whatsoever to legislate for an emissions trading scheme. What President Obama is doing is not unlike what we are doing here in Australia in the absence of an appropriately comprehensive global agreement to price emissions, and that is to pursue direct action initiatives. In the United States, the state of California has an ETS which currently covers just 35 per cent of total emissions. I hope that that gives Senator Macdonald a bit of flavour.


I will quickly go through a series of other questions. Senator Singh asked: 'Why are you not accepting the science?' We do accept the science. We just do not accept Labor's carbon tax. She asked why we are ignoring the will of the Australian people. This is extraordinary chutzpah. There is actually a very old-fashioned way to test the will of the Australian people on a regular basis, and that is called an election. Of course, there was an election in 2013, which you lost. There will be an election in 2016 where you can make your case for the introduction of the carbon tax if you think it is such a good idea.


I was asked how we are going to achieve the five per cent reduction in emissions by 2020. As we have said many times, that is through our Direct Action policy. The question was asked: what will happen to ARENA? I remind the chamber that the reduction in funding in this package of bills is actually the implementation of a Labor government budget measure that was supported by the Greens. Matters related to the board of ARENA are matters related to legislation that comes before the chamber much further down the track. Incidentally, the carbon tax does nothing to help Hydro in Tasmania. It is the renewable energy target that is of interest to them. Two people have resigned from the Climate Change Authority. Have I received representations from Industry Group and the Business Council? Personally, no, I have not. But what I am very conscious of is that the Australian people passed a very clear and comprehensive judgement against Labor's carbon tax and it is time that the Senate got on with it and got rid of it.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2014-07-10,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:43):  There are two matters I would like to address—firstly, the amendment that is before the Senate at the moment. I can indicate that I will not be supporting the amendment for a number of reasons. Firstly, I support the principle of an efficient, well designed ETS. I do not believe that what has been proposed is such. It effectively keeps the existing model and framework which I found very problematic. I made no secret of the fact that I still believe the best form of an ETS is that modelled by Frontier Economics for Malcolm Turnbull and me when Malcolm Turnbull was opposition leader in 2009. I am concerned that this model keeps an estimated $9.2 billion in compensation to emissions intensive trade exposed industries. It keeps an estimated $5.5 billion in compensation to brown coal generators. It does not change prices for diesel aviation refrigerants. While the carbon price may drop initially, it will then increase until, under a floating carbon tax, it reaches an estimated $38 in 2020. That is based on modelling by Treasury and the Climate Change Authority. They modelled that it would rise to $25.40 in 2014-15 and $38 in 2020. It locks Australia into the European emissions trading scheme prices, which have been extremely volatile and subject to, I think, political considerations, which does not give investment certainty. It will continue to hit households and businesses through higher electricity and gas prices through that revenue churn and through a distortion of the merit order in terms of pricing and also in respect of the tax interaction effect—the multiplicative effect on taxes and on the economy. For those reasons, while I support that a well-designed emissions trading scheme is the best way forward, I support the comments made previously by Danny Price from Frontier Economics about his concerns about the structure of the scheme. I just want to make that clear.


I hope Senator Cormann is listening—I know he is engaged in conversation, but I am sure he can do two things at once—because I do want to put a question to Senator Cormann. It relates to discussions I have had with Minister Hunt over a number of weeks and again this morning about ensuring that the Direct Action approach of government would be more strenuous, more rigorous, more efficient, and more effective in terms of emissions abatement. I understand that Senator Cormann, after my discussions with Minister Hunt, will be making a statement so that it is on the record, and I would be grateful if he could be in a position to make that statement.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2014-07-10,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (10:46):  I thank Senator Xenophon for his comments and for his questions. On this side of the chamber we have very much appreciated the very constructive way in which we have been able to work with him through these policy issues both in opposition and now in government. I am pleased to be able to reassure Senator Xenophon that the government is firmly committed to reducing Australia's emissions to meet our target of five per cent below 2000 levels by 2020. Since coming to office, we have, in a very methodical fashion, step by step, implemented the Emissions Reduction Fund which is, of course, the centrepiece of the direct action policy to reduce Australia's emissions.


On 24 April 2014, the government released the Emissions Reduction Fund white paper. This was, as Senator Xenophon is aware, the result of significant consultation with business, and it set out three elements of the Emissions Reduction Fund.


The first element is the crediting of emissions reductions using the tried and tested approach of the Carbon Farming Initiative. The government has introduced to parliament the Carbon Farming Initiative Amendment Bill 2014 to expand the Carbon Farming Initiative approach beyond the land sector to the rest of the economy. This bill has already passed the House of Representatives and no doubt will be considered by the Senate sometime in the future.


The second element is the purchasing of emissions reductions by the government using a reverse auction approach. The 2014-15 budget set out $2.55 billion for the fund, with the full amount available to be committed from the commencement of the fund.


The third element of the government's policy is a safeguard mechanism, and the safeguard mechanism will be introduced to ensure that emissions reductions paid for by the Emissions Reduction Fund are not displaced by a rise in emissions elsewhere in the economy, which goes to the heart of the question, I believe, that Senator Xenophon was asking. The government has already made a number of significant policy decisions regarding the safeguard mechanism in the Emissions Reduction Fund white paper—in particular, that it will commence on 1 July 2015. The mechanism will cover facilities with direct emissions of 100,000 tonnes or more. For existing facilities, baselines will be based on absolute emissions based on existing data reported under the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Scheme over the period 2009-10 to 2013-14.


As set out in the white paper, the government continues to consult with business and other stakeholders on other aspects of the policy, including the treatment of new investment, large business expansions, the application of the mechanism to the electricity sector, and options to ensure effective compliance. The safeguard mechanism is a critical part of the Emissions Reduction Fund policy and, following consultations with business, the government will introduce legislation in 2015 to give effect to the safeguard mechanism for commencement on 1 July 2015. This commitment has been outlined in the Emissions Reduction Fund white paper, as well as the explanatory memorandum to the Carbon Farming Initiative Amendment Bill 2014, and by my good friend and valued colleague the Minister for the Environment in his second reading speech introducing the bill. The government will list the Carbon Farming Initiative Amendment Bill 2014 for debate in the Senate in the spring session this year.


I do acknowledge, as I did at the outset, Senator Xenophon's longstanding commitment to an effective climate change policy in Australia. I also acknowledge his appreciation of the imperative of an effective safeguard mechanism as part of the Emissions Reduction Fund policy. I look forward on behalf of the government to continuing to work with Senator Xenophon as we finalise the development of that safeguard mechanism.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2014-07-10,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (10:50):  I want to raise a couple of matters. But, first, Senator Macdonald, your contribution was very surprising in the sense that I think the day the Senate takes advice from you will be a very sad day for this democracy. And I do need to correct you: it is actually Lord Deben, not Lord Debenham as you repeatedly said; so could you get that right next time.


I did want to raise some of the issues that Senator Xenophon highlighted, and I understand Senator Xenophon's position in relation to this amendment. I would urge him to reconsider his position and vote with the opposition for this amendment for an emissions trading scheme. But I understand what he raised in relation to price. Of course an emissions trading scheme is a market based mechanism, but we have got emissions trading schemes in the world—some are fledging; some are more developed. The EU's emissions trading scheme is very developed. Its price has declined, based on a range of factors. As schemes become more developed and you look at the cap and you look at the development of any market that can show that volatility, price changes. Obviously we have seen a price stabilise in the EU, but I do think that, as further markets develop in the world, we are likely to see that international market change over time. It is certainly not something that is fixed like the carbon tax—it is a market based mechanism, so it is about business working out that price—so I urge him to reconsider his position, understanding the points that he raised.


Before I talk about the government's position and the Palmer United Party's position, I would like to talk about the Greens' position. The opposition is pleased that the Greens are supporting this amendment for an emissions trading scheme. However, I would draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that the Australian Greens party have voted against an emissions trading scheme three times so far. They are purportedly the party for clean energy, but they have voted against an emissions trading scheme at least three times. I am pleased that they are voting for this scheme now, but if we are to strive to address climate change, then it is Labor's position that has been consistent on moving from a fixed price to an emissions trading scheme. We put this amendment in March when the Senate had a different make-up and, on that basis, this amendment could have passed in this place. So it is disappointing that their vote in support of this amendment has come too late. Having said that, Labor obviously supports their support for it.


In relation to the government's position, and the Palmer United Party's position of supporting the government—that is, not supporting this amendment for an emissions trading scheme for this country—what exactly will the government and the Palmer United Party achieve if they do not achieve this amendment? What will they achieve for our children and for our children's children? Voting with us on these amendments is the only way of ensuring a cap on pollution; it is the only way of ensuring that we will reduce our carbon emissions. This is my last-ditch attempt to ask the Senate to see some sense and vote with the opposition for an emissions trading scheme. We know that the replacement is a tokenistic attempt to have a climate change policy; Direct Action falls very short of achieving anything meaningful in relation to acting on global warming.


The furphies put out by the Prime Minister on his recent overseas trips and the like have not been supported by other global leaders. He has tried to create a coalition of the unwilling and was pretty much left standing on his own. Senator Cormann talked about the fact that the US does not have a national trading scheme—other than all the states that are moving that way. President Obama said recently to students at the University of California: 'I'm going to talk about one of the most significant long-term challenges that our country and our planet faces, and that of course is the threat of a rapidly changing climate.' So President Obama does get it, and that is why, as I said earlier, the United States and China have signed a partnership pact. Of course, when the New Zealand Prime Minister heard of what Tony Abbott was trying to achieve with his coalition of the unwilling on climate change, he made it very clear that he did not want a bar of it—as did the UK, another conservative government that does not support this conservative government.


In abandoning Labor's commitment to an emissions trading scheme the Abbott government is taking Australia from being a world leader in addressing climate change to a nation standing out from the international community in refusing to acknowledge this pressing problem. The Abbott government, in isolating Australia from the international community on an emissions trading scheme, is denying the country the ability to play a meaningful role in addressing this challenge on both a national and global scale. In putting this amendment, I ask the government: if you vote down Labor's amendment, how can you guarantee that Direct Action will deliver our reductions of five per cent by 2020, and is there an emissions trading scheme that you will accept?

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2014-07-10,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (10:58):  We have an emissions trading scheme in Australia now; it was negotiated by the last government. Senator Singh has a very selective memory. I was in the Senate when the former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd abandoned what he called the greatest moral challenge of all time. Before Copenhagen and after Copenhagen, the gang of four in the Labor Party decided to abandon emissions trading in spite of the compromise the Greens had on the table at the time. They said they would prefer to go after the mining tax and abandon carbon pricing. They went into the 2010 election with no policy on carbon pricing and it was only as a result of negotiations after the election that the Greens secured a commitment that we would introduce a price on carbon and it would be legislated and take effect from 1 July 2012.


So let's not hear any more of this arrant nonsense and also let's put on the record that the scheme negotiated between the former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and the then Leader of the Opposition Malcolm Turnbull 'browned it down' so that it was next to useless. In fact, it was worse than nothing, in my view, because it would have locked in expanding free permits over time. It would have locked in mega compensation to coal fired power stations. It had no driver of renewable energy, no Clean Energy Finance Corporation, no Climate Change Authority and had a weak five per cent target with no capacity for the parliament to drive it higher. So it was a complete junk policy. We now have a very good policy which we should be proud of and the question before the chair is: will the Palmer United Party, which says it supports emissions trading, now support a scheme which has an 18 per cent target as a result of the 31 May deadline expiring? We now have an 18 per cent target in Australia. That is what makes it different now from earlier in the year.


Mr Palmer says he supports an emissions trading scheme. Good, so do I, so does the Labor Party, so let us vote to keep the one we have. The compromise here is to go to flexible pricing straightaway which would take the price from $25 down to $7 to $9, which is a more than reasonable compromise to put on the table. If Mr Palmer is serious about an emissions trading scheme then let us vote for this amendment together and secure the amendment to put it back to the government. I notice the minister still has not answered my question about whether he has had talks with the Business Council of Australia and the Australian Industry Group—who he has had talks with—in relation to securing an emissions trading scheme, because they are saying in the papers that that is what they want. Are they telling the government that?


There is another matter that I want Senator Cormann to answer. I understand the government has been having talks with the Palmer United Party about how to secure the price reduction obligation to be returned to consumers. It is now a circulated amendment, though not yet moved. Mr Palmer has said that he has had discussions with the government. Regarding these costs, directly or indirectly attributable, that are to be accounted for, I ask the minister two things. Firstly, if it is an indirect cost, how widely defined is that? There is no-one here from the Palmer United Party who can tell me, so maybe you can, Minister, since you have been in discussions with them. Secondly, they have just changed their foreshadowed amendment, obviously as a result of discussions with the government. So, Minister, can you tell us what conversations you have had with the Palmer United Party and what this new amendment is actually going to do?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (11:02):  Firstly, I remind Senator Milne that right now we are dealing with amendment (3) on sheet 7506 moved by Senator Singh, which seeks to modify the carbon tax as it currently stands and rebudget. I will deal with other foreshadowed amendments and other amendments that have been circulated at the time we are ready to go with them. The thing is we can continue to go around and around in circles, so I will just make two very quick points. Senator Milne talks about Australia having an 18 per cent emissions reduction target by 2020. No, we do not because this government, very transparently, went to the last election in a bipartisan fashion and committed to a five per cent emissions reduction target by 2020 based on 2000 levels. That is what we will deliver on. This debate has been going around and around in circles for so long. By the way, an emissions trading scheme is a government intervention. It is no more a market based mechanism than going into the market to ask people to competitively tender for the lowest cost opportunity to deliver emissions reductions. Whether it is a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme, these are government interventions that are highly regulatory and impose significant burdens on the economy. We have been very clear that we do not support it. We can continue to go around and around in circles. I suggest that the Senate now vote on the amendment moved by Senator Singh so that we can move on to the other amendments on the Notice Paper, bearing in mind the remaining time available to the Senate to deal with these matters.

Senator RUSTON (

South Australia
—
Deputy Government Whip in the Senate
) (
11:1
3
): I seek further clarification from the minister in relation to the emissions trading scheme. I am wondering if he can put on the record exactly what it involves.




Senator Milne:
  On a point of order, Mr Acting Chair. We have just voted on that amendment. We are now moving to the next amendment on the sheet. This is a stalling tactic to allow the Palmer United Party to get themselves in order.




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Bernardi
):  Thank you, Senator Milne. I do recognise we have voted on the amendment, but there is another amendment before the chair at the moment and Senator Ruston did have the call. She has posed a question to the minister and it is appropriate for the minister to answer it.




Senator Wong:
  What an arrogant government—filibustering your own guillotine! This is outrageous.




Senator CORMANN:
  We have Senator Wong interjecting loudly. Senator Wong was part of the government which went to the election in 2010 promising there would be no carbon tax only to introduce one after. They went to an election in 2013 saying they had removed the carbon tax only to vote to keep it after. It is not the same thing to rebadge it or modify it. Those of us on this side of the chamber—and no doubt that is why we are now part of the government—




Senator Kim Carr:
  Where is your yellow tie?



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Order! Minister, please resume your seat for a moment. It is very difficult for me to hear you with the bellowing coming from my left.




Senator CORMANN:
  I know that the Labor Party are very embarrassed about their track record when it comes to imposing unnecessary and bad taxes on the Australian community such as the carbon tax.


As I was saying before, in 2010 then Prime Minister Gillard went to the election and said, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' What did she promise? She promised to have a climate change assembly. It was to be a citizens assembly with 150 citizens working to achieve consensus on how to deal with this area of public policy. But, of course, straight after the election the then government did a deal with the Greens. They entered into a coalition with the Greens. Everything that followed after that is history.


Earlier today Senator Singh asked me, 'Why are you not accepting the science?' As I said then, we are accepting the science. What we are not doing is accepting Labor's carbon tax, because it does nothing to help reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. Indeed, arguably it actually pushes up global emissions because it pushes up the cost of electricity in Australia, it pushes up the cost of gas and it pushes up the cost of doing business. It helps our competitors in other parts of the world become more competitive. It is helping our competitors in other parts of the world take market share away from us. It is helping our competitors in other parts of the world to grow jobs at our expense. In the process, it is shifting emissions to other parts of the world where arguably for the same amount of economic output they are higher.


You will never believe what else I was asked earlier today. I was asked why we were acting against the will of the Australian people. This really goes to the crux of this whole issue. Something that the Labor Party clearly has not understood is that we have a very old-fashioned method here in Australia to test the will of the Australian people on a regular basis. It is called an election. We had an election in 2013 and the Labor Party lost, with their carbon tax, and the coalition won saying that we would get rid of the carbon tax. What we are doing here without any ifs or buts is getting rid of the carbon tax and we are not supporting replacing it with a carbon tax by another name because it is not in the national interest for us to do so.


We have people here saying that an emissions trading scheme is a market based mechanism. No, it is not. It is not something that comes out of the market at all. It is a government intervention. It is government imposing a compulsory price on the market. It is government putting in place massive regulation. It is government putting in place a massive bureaucracy. It is government putting in place policing across Australia in order to enforce compliance with government regulation. Government regulation is not a market based mechanism. It might be in Pyongyang. In Pyongyang they might think that when you put government regulation in place it is a market mechanism. When you go to Pyongyang you might think that more regulation is like a free market. But here in Australia more regulation and more taxes are not because of the free market.


Our system is actually a market based mechanism. Our Direct Action policy is part of a market based mechanism. Our Emissions Reduction Fund is a market based mechanism. With our Emissions Reduction Fund we are going out into the market and asking the market to competitively tender to help reduce emissions in Australia in a way that is economically responsible and environmentally effective. We are forcing businesses and other people out there to compete with each other. When you force people to compete with each other, that creates a market. So here we are. We, the government, through our Emissions Reduction Fund and our Direct Action policy, are putting forward a genuine market based mechanism.


But the Labor Party does not really understand how the emissions trading scheme here in Australia—the largest and most comprehensive national economy-wide emissions trading scheme or carbon tax anywhere in the world—interacts with the fact that there is no such scheme anywhere else in the world. There is such a thing as a global economy. Australia is only a small part of a global economy. We represent less than 1.4 per cent of global emissions. The US represents 19 per cent of global emissions. China represents 23 per cent of global emissions. Europe represents 13 per cent of global emissions. We are a small part of a global economy. When we are imposing costs on businesses, individuals, families and pensioners in Australia that are not faced by people and businesses in other parts of the world, we are asking people in Australia to make a sacrifice that is not asked of other people or businesses in other parts of the world. In asking them to make that sacrifice, at least it should make a difference. The problem is that neither the carbon tax nor Labor's proposal for a modified or rebadged carbon tax do anything to help reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.


I see that Senator Bullock is here in the chamber. I know that he will say to me that all he is doing is faithfully promoting Labor Party policy. I have a certain fondness for Senator Bullock because I believe that he is a fundamentally decent and honest man. He went to the WA Senate by-election saying, 'Labor is scrapping the carbon tax.' The only problem was that on the very same day that he was making that statement in Western Australia—and I am sure that he was told to make that statement by his party—his Labor colleagues here in this chamber were voting to keep the carbon tax. Labor in this chamber were voting to keep the carbon tax on the very same day that Senator Bullock was sent out into the community by his party to say that Labor was scrapping it. These are the sorts of political games that we have seen from the Labor Party for way too long: in 2010, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead'; in 2013, 'We already have removed the carbon tax'; in 2014, 'Labor is scrapping the carbon tax'—all the way through, playing the game; all the way through, working to keep the tax that they are trying to make the people across Australia believe they have already got rid of.


And here we are still this week. On Monday, we had to have a debate all day on whether we could start the debate. Then later in the week they are saying, 'You're not giving us enough time.' We spent the whole day on Monday debating whether or not we could start the debate this week. What was that all about? The Australian people voted in September 2013 to get rid of this thing. They want the carbon tax gone, because the carbon tax is bad. The carbon tax is bad for the economy, it is bad for families, it is bad for jobs, it is bad for our international competitiveness and it is imposing sacrifices on our community without actually making a positive difference to the environment. There is absolutely no reason why we should have a carbon tax in Australia, either in the form in which it was legislated by the previous government or in the form that Labor now wants to rebadge it. That is at the heart, really, of why we are having this debate and that is of course why the coalition continues to persist with the approach we have taken.


It is always important for those of us here in this chamber, who represent our respective states, that we focus on the best interests of our states and on the best interests of our country. If we are serious about wanting to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Australia and globally, we should be having a conversation on how Australia could best contribute to that effort. And guess what: in the great state of Western Australia, which I have the privilege to represent in this chamber, we have a wonderful opportunity to help reduce global greenhouse gas emissions in an economically responsible and environmentally effective way. We can have a win-win-win situation: we can increase the level of economic activity, increase the number of jobs and help reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. How do we do it? It is by producing more LNG in Australia, not less, and exporting that LNG to China, to Japan and to other places around the world where it can displace less environmentally friendly energy sources.


Of course, Labor's carbon tax, or Labor's emissions trading scheme proposal, in the absence of an appropriately comprehensive global agreement, makes it harder for us to increase the level of LNG production, when that is something we could do here in Australia to help the world. There should be more LNG out of Australia. What does that mean? If we produced more LNG in Australia, helping the world, we would have to accept higher-emissions-producing LNG here in Australia domestically, but the good thing is that it would actually help reduce emissions by more in other parts of the world. So the net effect is beneficial, whereas the net effect of Labor's carbon tax and emissions trading scheme is to push up global emissions. So not only are people in Australia being asked to make a sacrifice; they are being asked to make a sacrifice, under the Labor-Greens scheme, which actually makes things worse for the environment, whereas our approach will help reduce emissions in Australia in a way that achieves a genuine, proportionate net reduction in emissions in the world. That is why we commend to the Senate our policy approach as a superior approach—and it is of course the approach that received the only tick of approval that matters, and that is that tick of approval from the Australian people.


I was asked whether I was aware of comments by X, Y and Z—this business, that stakeholder and whatever. We are of course aware of all of the comments that have been made by a whole range of people, but guess what: our sense of purpose is very clear—we made a promise to get rid of the carbon tax because that is good for the economy, because that is good for families, because that is good for pensioners, because that is good for jobs, because that is good for attracting investment in Australia and because it also means that, through a more effective alternative policy, we can reduce emissions in Australia in a fiscally responsible way. But, no, the Labor Party do not get this, even though this has been argued ad nauseam. The only time they get this is in the shadow of an election. If this carbon tax were still hanging around by the time of the next election, I bet that the Labor Party would go to yet another election promising to get rid of it. Why do we know that? Because in 2010 they said we would not get it; in 2013 they said they had removed it, even though it stayed; and since then they have voted to keep it. In 2014 they said they were scrapping it. They have not. But here we are today and the Senate has the historic opportunity to act in the national interest. Today the Senate has the historic opportunity to help ensure that we can reduce emissions in Australia in a way that is economically responsible, fiscally responsible and environmentally effective.


Clearly all the Labor Party and the Greens want to do is to shift emissions to other parts of the world—out of sight, out of mind. They do not care that they are making it harder for aluminium producers in Australia to be able to compete with aluminium producers in China, even though aluminium producers in Australia are 50 per cent more environmentally efficient, even though emissions in Australia, for the same amount of aluminium production, are much, much lower. They are quite happy for aluminium producers in other parts of the world to take market share away from us, even though that pushes up the level of emissions in the world. That is the short-sighted approach by the Labor Party and the Greens—imposing a negative impact on our economy, imposing sacrifices on families, pensioners, small business and big business, making it harder to create jobs, making it harder to attract investment. As the Parliamentary Budget Office independently assessed in the lead-up to the last election, getting rid of the carbon tax will deliver an economic growth dividend, and that is the economic growth dividend that Australia needs right now, because, as a result of the mismanagement of the previous government, the Labor-Greens government, we have an economy growing below trend. We inherited rising unemployment. We need to turn that situation around. Getting rid of this bad Labor-Greens carbon tax is a very important part of our economic action strategy to build a stronger economy where everyone has the opportunity to get ahead.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (11:29):  It certainly takes a special blend of arrogance and incompetence to seek to both guillotine and filibuster in the same debate, and that is what this government is doing. It is fantastic. Not only did they use their numbers in the chamber this morning to put in place a guillotine; they now have a government senator asking questions of a minister who just went for 15 minutes on a Labor amendment, which has already been knocked off, in order to give the government time out there in the corridors to try and cut a deal to repeal the carbon price because they—and I use Mr Palmer's words—appear to have doublecrossed the Palmer United Party. As I said, it takes a special blend of arrogance and incompetence to both guillotine and filibuster, and that is what is occurring here. 


While I am on my feet—and I will ask Senator Singh later, if she gets the call, to speak to this—the opposition opposes Schedules 2, 3, 4 and 5 in the following terms:


(4) Schedule 2, page 71 (line 1) to page 90 (line 27), to be opposed.


(5) Schedule 3, page 91 (lines 1 to 26), to be opposed.


(6) Schedule 4, page 92 (lines 1 to 29), to be opposed.


(7) Schedule 5, page 93 (line 1) to page 94 (line 4), to be opposed.


These amendments continue the position of the Australian Labor Party—that is, we want an emissions trading scheme. 


I want to make sure we all understand what is occurring. The Senate had, obviously, a long debate yesterday—one of a number of debates—where the government sought without notice to come in and refuse to take up additional time that was offered up by the opposition to debate this legislation and to put in place a guillotine and a gag. In fact, I think I said by the end of this week we would see not five occasions on which the Senate was asked to support a guillotine and a gag on legislation, notwithstanding the offer by the opposition for more time. The government refused that. It got the numbers on a guillotine and a gag.


We then see a range of amendments being circulated in the chamber from Mr Palmer's party—and I understand they have a particular position. We had a sheet. We had one amendment, which was circulated. This morning we then had another revision to that amendment, which was circulated and, just before I got to my feet, there was a third revision to the Palmer United Party's amendment. We have Senator Cormann and Senator Ruston filibustering their own guillotined debate in order to enable further negotiation of the third version of the Palmer United's amendments on the carbon price. This is the calm, responsible and considered government that Mr Abbott promised. If you walk around the corridors, you can see all sorts of little huddles where these various amendments are being discussed. 




Senator Kim Carr:
  Huddles? I thought you said cuddles.




Senator WONG:
  I didn't say cuddles; I said huddles. I want to ask some questions about the revisions of the minister after I finish this contribution. If the government did not try to subvert the Senate process in order to give Mr Abbott a media conference when he wanted to after he flew in from the Pilbara, then they would not be in this predicament of both filibustering and guillotining their own debate in order to give themselves time to negotiate the third round of amendments, to enable them to get the numbers in this chamber to repeal the carbon price. If they did not try to subvert this chamber's proper process, they would not be in the embarrassing position they are in now where they are running around trying to cut a deal with 15 minutes or so left on the clock—15 minutes, which of course is of their own making. Those of us on this side of chamber—obviously, not the Palmer United Party but the Greens and the Labor Party—made it very clear we wanted a proper debate on this bill. As I said—




Senator Williams:
  What about your history of guillotines? 




Senator WONG:
  I will take the interjection, and thank you for providing me with something to respond to, Senator Williams, in the circumstances. I understand that parties of government on occasion have, when they are faced with a circumstance where they cannot get legislation through at the end of a session, sought to have agreed limitation of debate motions—they have; I acknowledge that. But it is quite a different thing to do it on the Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday of the first sitting week of the new Senate. The only logical reason the government has done this, as I said, is that it wanted to make sure Mr Abbott could have his press conference. 


Why does Mr Abbott want a press conference today on this? You can see what has happened. As I said in the debate earlier today, this is a government that has turned on the people who elected it. It is a government that promised no cuts to education, no cuts to health and no changes to the pension, and it has broken all of those promises. This budget breaks all of those promises and many more: they have broken the promise around no cuts to the ABC, no cuts to SBS but, most importantly, no cuts to health and no cuts to education—a fundamental promise that Mr Abbott made not once, not twice but over and over and over again during the election campaign. Then they bring down a budget and completely turn their back on the commitments they made to the Australian people, because it is a budget which does cut health and education. It cuts our school system by around $30 billion. It cuts our health system by $50 billion and of course it imposes a GP tax and the tax on fuel—from the party that believes in lower taxes. 


This is the context to why the government has gone to such lengths this week to curtail debate—to contain debate—though it did so unsuccessfully on a number of occasions. What they want is for Mr Abbott to be able to stand up at the Prime Minister's press conference today and say, 'I've repealed the carbon price, but let's not talk about the budget where we did you over.' That is what this is all about.


I want to return now to a couple of the points in the legislation and the amendments that Labor have moved. I note that on a number of occasions, Senator Abetz and Senator Cormann have waved around comments that Labor made prior to the election about the ending of the carbon tax. The Leader of the Government in the Senate seems not to understand Labor policy. We made very clear our position, which is that we think the fixed price policy needs to end. We do want to move to a market mechanism. We do want to move to a floating price. The amendments that I have just moved—the amendments that Senator Singh has circulated—and that we are debating are fundamentally about Labor's policy position, which is that we should move to emissions trading.


Let us recall the sorts of people who are on the side of emissions trading. They include John Howard, Mr Hewson, Mr Turnbull, Margaret Thatcher's cabinet minister and many other members of conservative parties around the world. The reason is that an emissions trading scheme is a market mechanism. I will take Senator Cormann's point in the earlier debate—when he was doing his interesting filibuster in a guillotine debate—where he said that an emissions trading scheme is not a market mechanism. That is the most ridiculous proposition. Who sets the price? The market. That is the point. You set a cap on pollution and—




Senator Cormann:
  Who sets the cap?




Senator WONG:
  That is a policy decision, just as government makes policy decisions in a whole range of circumstances. You set a cap on pollution because you make a policy decision that, firstly, 'We want to actually try to reduce the amount of pollution that this nation puts into the atmosphere,' and, secondly, 'We want to give an economic incentive for business to find cheaper, cleaner ways of doing business. That is what we want to do. We want to reward the clean energy innovators of today and tomorrow.' That is what we do. It is a market mechanism, unlike under Direct Action. So, instead of some public servant determining what is the most efficient way to reduce pollution, we have the market doing that, the market finding the most efficient way and the lowest cost way for emissions to be reduced.


That is why consistently economies from the time John Howard set up his task group on emissions trading in, I think, 2005-06 and onwards—and in fact prior to that, but from then on certainly in the context of the Australian debate—have said that they believe that emissions trading is the most efficient way to reduce Australia's emissions. So the minister's proposition that somehow this is not a market mechanism is a false one and really flies in the face of reputable economists here in Australia and around the world.


It seems remarkable that this comes from a party that believe in free markets. This of course is Minister Cormann's argument for the deregulation of university fees—also a market the government creates by a policy decision. His argument in favour of the deregulation of fees is that it allows the market to work. It seems remarkable that a party that allegedly believe in the power of the market would prefer a bureaucratically run scheme where public servants in fact find the cheapest way—supposedly—of reducing emissions.


We obviously have some amendments before the chair and there are other amendments that people seek to speak on. I do have some questions that I might jump ahead at this point and ask of the minister, given the time. In relation to the newly revised amendment by Senator Lazarus, which has been circulated but not yet moved, I would like to ask the minister a few questions. First, is the government—



The CHAIRMAN:  Senator Wong, that question is not actually before the chair.




Senator WONG:
  That is true, but given that the debate is about to be truncated, I think it would be useful for the Senate to know if it is the government's intention for this amendment to be accepted in the House of Representatives. I think it is reasonable for the Senate to know whether or not this is an amendment that the government—




Senator Cormann:
  Why don't we quickly deal with your own?




Senator WONG:
  I am asking the question—




Senator Cormann:
  Let's deal with this amendment and then deal with the next one.




Senator WONG:
  I understand that it is technically not before the chair but I think it is in the public interest for the Palmer United senators to know if the government intends to accept this amendment on the floor of the House of Representatives—because, if it does not, and the minister is not prepared to say that in this chamber, then obviously the Palmer United Party might have been sold a pup.



Honourable senators interjecting—




Senator WONG:
  Sorry, I had to just say that once—just once. I promise I will not do it again—though others might. I just had to get that out once. I had to get that particular gag off my chest. I would ask if that could be made clear. I also want to ask the minister if he believes that this amendment is consistent with the government's deregulation agenda.

How are we supposed to look at what this actually means in the few minutes that are available to us? That is why it is important that the minister does tell us whether the government has stitched this up. We need to know exactly what deals have been going on behind here. Is this the way the parliament is now going to be run—in back rooms between these parties, and then accusing each other of duplicitousness? And we do not even have the opportunity to see what this amendment actually does.


This is a day when Australia will know whether we are going backwards or forwards—whether we are going to embrace the future or whether we are going to be landed back in a fossil fuel past, when we know this is a disaster for the planet and for the country. I would like the government to answer these questions: is this going to be accepted by the government; will you tell us what the differences are? Will you tell us what this amendment does? On this day the whole country wants to know whether we are going forwards or backwards, whether we are going to go with the rest of the world and address global warming or whether we are just going to go back to the last century. We need to know exactly what you have stitched up.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (11:47):  I thank Senator Milne for her contribution. Embracing the future means getting rid of the carbon tax, because getting rid of the carbon tax helps build a stronger, more prosperous economy. It helps create jobs. It helps to reduce cost-of-living expenses. It helps families. It helps pensioners. It helps small businesses. It helps big businesses. It helps Australia attract investment. It is very good news for Australia if we finally get rid of the carbon tax.


Obviously, as we have said for a very long time, the government is committed to ensuring that the cost reductions that electricity generators, for example, are able to benefit from as a direct result of the repeal of the carbon tax are appropriately passed through to consumers and to small business. We have already made a series of provisions to make sure that that does happen. The Palmer United Party put forward some sensible amendments to ensure that that could be put even further beyond doubt.


As far as the government is concerned, the overarching objective of this government is to deliver on the clear commitment we made in the lead-up to the last election, which was to get rid of the carbon tax so that we can bring down the cost of living for families and for pensioners, so that we can bring down the cost of doing business in Australia, so that we can facilitate stronger job creation and so that we can provide opportunities for everyone to get ahead. Of course, this government is totally committed to doing everything we can to ensure that any reductions in the cost of generating electricity, generating energy, as a result of getting rid of the carbon tax are properly passed through to consumers and to small businesses. All of the regulators that set electricity prices have come out to say that that is what is happening. A number of the private energy generators have already made it very clear that they are committed to passing through the cost reductions that come as a direct result of the repeal of the carbon tax. The ACCC has powers and will have powers to ensure that they can take appropriate action to make sure that any cost reductions as a result of the repeal of the carbon tax are properly passed through.


Today is when the Senate, including the Labor Party, has the opportunity to finally rid the Australian people of this bad tax.



The CHAIRMAN:  The time allocated for the remaining stages of these bills has now expired. I remind senators that under a guillotine I will put the question before the chair, and then the further amendments circulated at least two hours prior to this time. The question now is that in respect of the Clean Energy Legislation (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2013 [No.2]—




Senator Xenophon:
  Could I please get clarification from you? In relation to the amendment on sheet 7511, revision 2, which has been circulated but not yet been moved by the Leader of the Palmer United Party, Senator Lazarus, does this mean that amendment cannot be put?



The CHAIRMAN:  Under the standing orders it cannot be put unless leave is sought and given by the Senate. The original amendment will be put, because that was circulated prior to two hours before this time. But the revised ones will not be put unless leave is sought by the Senate. In respect of the Clean Energy Legislation (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2013 [No.2], the question is that schedules 2 to 5 stand as printed.




Senator Singh:
  Could I seek clarification on exactly what we are voting on?



Senator Cormann interjecting—



The CHAIRMAN:  Senator Cormann, I am sure Senator Singh is seeking clarification from me. In respect of the Clean Energy Legislation (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2013 [No 2], the question is that schedule 2 to 5 stand as printed.



The CHAIRMAN:  The question now before the chair is that amendments (1) to (20) on sheet 7511, circulated by the Palmer United Party, be agreed to.




Senator Milne:
  Mr Chairman, what you have just read out on the sheet: is that the third version? What you have just read out is the second version, so I would just like some clarity about which version we are asked to vote on.



The CHAIRMAN:  Senator Milne, as I explained earlier to the Senate, for amendments to be considered they have to have been circulated prior to two hours before the deadline of the guillotine. The amendments we are considering are on the original, unrevised version of sheet 7511. If the Senate were to consider a revised version it would need to be with leave of the Senate.




Senator Wong:
  Mr Chairman, further to Senator Milne's question: is the intention to seek leave to amend, or are we voting on the old ones? No leave has been sought.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (09:35):  I seek leave to make a five-minute statement.



The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted.




Senator WONG:
  Today the government will use its numbers with the support of some members of the crossbench to deny this Senate its opportunity to fully consider the carbon price. It will truncate debate and it will put all of the remaining questions at 11.50 this morning. So after just two days of debate in the current Senate, the government is forcing debate on this package of nine bills to an end. Let us just reflect, if we may, before this motion is put, about the events of this week. On three or four sitting days this week, this government has moved motions without notice, seeking to cut short debate on these bills. At the end of this morning's procedural votes, the new crossbench will have been asked to vote five times—



Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order on my right!




Senator WONG:
  in their first week to stop senators doing what we were sent here to do which is to debate legislation. Having already forced this Senate to sit in July, just days after new senators took their seats, and having already brought forward debate on the carbon bills from 14 July, what we have seen is this government bullying, cajoling, and pressuring the crossbench into shutting down debate after just two days. 


I indicated yesterday that the opposition had on Tuesday offered to give up our time not only this morning but also this afternoon for further debate on the carbon price bills. This Leader of the Government in the Senate did not do me, the opposition or any senator, as far as I am aware, the courtesy of even responding to that offer. The response that we did get was the motion moved yesterday, without notice, in which the government sought unsuccessfully to bring the debate to an end by lunchtime that day. So I say this to the crossbench: we accept your right to have different views on the substantive issues before the chamber—and you will have different views on the substantive issues. We accept your right to debate them; we accept your right to vote the way you wish to vote. What I say to the crossbench is: the chamber does not need to operate in this way. The chamber does not need in the first week of the sitting of the new Senate to have no less than five votes to shut down debate and to have three or four days of procedural debate because the government wants to shut down debate. It is not because they have to get the bill through; the bill would have got through. All of you, or your staff, were at the meeting of leaders and whips and you know that the bill would have passed this fortnight—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  On a point of order, Mr President. I draw the Senate's attention to standing order 194, which says:


(1) A senator shall not digress from the subject matter of any question under discussion, or anticipate the discussion of any subject which appears on the Notice Paper.


My point of order, Mr President, is that Senator Wong is clearly anticipating a discussion on something that is on the Notice Paper for discussion later today. She is suggesting that different senators may vote a particular way, and in so doing I think she breaches the provisions of standing order 194.



The PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order, Senator Macdonald. Senator Wong has been given leave by the Senate to speak for five minutes concerning these bills.




Senator WONG:
  Again, I say to the crossbench: the chamber should not operate this way. Just because this government has no respect for the Senate does not mean that you have to accept this. I say to you: do not let the events and the practices of this week become the norm. Do not let the Prime Minister's office and its enforcers lean on you to shut down debate, to deny scrutiny, to turn this place into an arm of the Prime Minister's press office by telling the media what you will do before you tell them—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  On a point of order, Mr President. I raise for your attention and the Senate's attention standing order 193, relating to use of offensive words et cetera. The bit I want to draw to your attention, Mr President, is this:


… all imputations of improper motives and all personal reflections on those Houses, members or officers shall be considered highly disorderly.


The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate is suggesting that some senators who are not members of the coalition are part of, I think she said, the Prime Minister's media campaign or media group. 



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  I hear the interjections of Senator Bilyk. She has never even read the standing orders and would not know how to if she did.



Senator Bilyk interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald, stay with the point of order. 




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  I ignore the interjection, Mr President, and suggest that Senator Wong is imputing improper motives to those who might have a different view from her on the subject.




Senator Moore:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order. I want to make the point that Senator Wong was in the process of making her statement in response to the lead that was given. It is interesting that Senator Macdonald, in calling a point of order on a point about casting reflection in the chamber, needed to use the same point of order against one of the senators on this side of the chamber.



The PRESIDENT:  You are starting to debate, Senator Moore. Order! Senator Macdonald has the right to raise a point of order. In this case there is no point of order. Senator Wong has been given leave.




Senator WONG:
  I say to the crossbench: do not let the events of this week become the norm with the Prime Minister's office and its enforcers and others leaning on you to shut down debate, to deny scrutiny, to turn this place into an arm of the Prime Minister's press office. As I said, the media are told what you will do before you tell the chamber, and the conclusion of this debate is timed so as to accord with the Prime Minister's schedule for his media conference. I say this to the crossbench: do not let this Senate become Mr Abbott's rubber stamp. 




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  On a point of order, Mr President. Not only is that an imputation against senators, but it is also an imputation against a member of the other House, namely the Prime Minister—



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  and the allegations that he is leaning on senators and that senators are going to become part of his rubber stamp are imputations of improper motives.



Senator Conroy interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Conroy, it will be quicker if you allow the debate to proceed correctly. On the point of order, Senator Macdonald, you possibly have a technical correction in your point of order, but if I were to apply that point of order to every senator in this chamber, debate would be completely stifled. However, could I remind all senators, not just Senator Wong, that standing orders do exist to run orderly and respectful debate.




Senator WONG:
  This government has turned on the people who elected it and only this chamber can stand up to them. So I say again to the crossbench: do not let this Senate become Mr Abbott's rubber stamp and do not allow the events of this week to become the norm. There is a better way to run this chamber. We are prepared to be reasonable up front and negotiate. We do not need the stealth-attack approach to running the Senate chamber.

Senator ABETZ:
  Thirty-three hours and 52 minutes of debate, plus that which has occurred this week, has already taken place on these measures. Fifty-two bills were guillotined in this place without a single syllable spoken, courtesy of Senator Wong and the Greens—let's keep that in mind. The urgency of this is that the markets need to react to the decision of the Senate in relation to the carbon tax. Given that the Labor-Greens carbon tax, which we were promised would not be introduced, ticked over again on 1 July with another rate increase, power companies need to know whether or not to charge the extra tax imposed by Labor. The urgency of this is so that we can do the will of the Australian people and remove this toxic tax, which is a burden on the cost of living and which has been destroying jobs without doing anything for the environment.

  What has gone on here this week is that the government has abused process by bringing the Senate back in the first week. The Greens opposed that decision at the time and said clearly that the Prime Minister wanted to ram through his political agenda in this first week with people who were new to the Senate. What we are now experiencing is the logical extension of his intention to show such contempt for the Senate and for new senators.

  In the six years I have been here I have always hated the guillotine. I hate the gag. I hate the fact that this time last year there were something like 50 bills rammed through without any debate. We need to have a better way of doing things. I appreciated very much yesterday that Senator Milne gave an opportunity to at least extend the debate by several hours. That was at least some improvement in the process. This is the Hobson's choice I have. I cannot in good conscience support a guillotine. Where I stand in this debate is another issue, but I urge my colleagues to consider that there must be a better way of managing the business of this place. Maybe earlier this week we should have agreed to sit extra hours so there could be extra debate. That motion was not forthcoming. In the circumstances, I expect these bills will be dealt with today. It would have been better if we had had much more time.

The speech read as follows—



MOTOR VEHICLE STANDARDS (CHEAPER TRANSPORT) BILL 2014


Brand new Australian cars guzzle more petrol than new vehicles sold in China, India, Europe and Japan. Australians are just wasting money on petrol when we really don't have to. 


Under this Bill, Australians will be able to take back control of rising petrol prices and reduce our reliance on imported oil as we see the fuel efficiency of Australia's cars improved by over 50% within 10 years.


This Bill would align Australia's fleet with the existing EU 2020 standards to achieve 95 grams of CO2 per kilometre for passenger vehicles by 2023—a three year delay. To put that into perspective our cars average 192 grams per kilometre, far higher than the global average.


Australian motorists will save around $850 a year on petrol under the scheme. After three years of driving a new car they will have paid off the expected increased upfront costs and will have freed up valuable income to spend on other things that are more important.


Not only will this Bill help motorists, but it will send a strong signal to our automotive trading partners like Japan who have the highest fuel efficiency standards in the world that we will be an enduring market for high-quality and efficient automotive products. 


We will join the three-quarters of all cars sold in the global market that have a strong fuel standard. By adding Australia to the list, we will create more competition for ever-more efficient vehicles, rather than driving them towards those global markets with standards in place.


The scheme won't place any more pressure on Australian automotive jobs because it won't start until 2017 when Australian automotive manufacturers are closing down their operations. On the contrary, it will inspire a new market for high-quality products that those in Australia's supplementary automotive manufacturing industry are well-placed to exploit.


It will require the Climate Change Authority to review the effectiveness of the scheme and recommend to Parliament further targets beyond 2023.


Finally, it will help drive down Australia's pollution levels. Passenger vehicles currently create 10% of Australia's total greenhouse gas emissions, but this is an area for easy pickings to drive massive reductions at no cost to government.


This Bill will save money for Australians, strengthen trade relationships, provide new opportunities for the automotive parts industry and rapidly reverse the 48% rise in vehicle emissions Australia has created since 1990.


It is for all these urgent reasons that I commend the Bill to the Senate.

But if I can please just turn, if I may, to the situation in Tasmania and what the government is doing in relation to Tasmania itself. You have asked me a question about what needs to be done in Tasmania. As the honourable senator would appreciate, the Tasmanian economy, as a result of 16 years of Labor and then a Labor-Greens alliance, has the highest unemployment in the country and the lowest retention rates in the country. And that is why we have put together the Tasmanian Major Projects Approval—

The PRESIDENT:  Order, Senator Carr! Thank you, Senator Moore. I noted that Senator Ronaldson was directly relevant at the commencement of his question. And he still has nearly under half his time remaining to answer. Senator Ronaldson, I will draw your attention back to the question.

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2014-07-10,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:06):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Ronaldson), the Minister for Finance (Senator Cormann) and the Assistant Minister for Social Services (Senator Fifield) to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today relating to the Enterprise Connect program, to Future of Financial Advice regulations and to the Dementia and Severe Behaviours Supplement.


I will focus on the answers from Senator Ronaldson about the government's farcical Entrepreneurs Infrastructure Program and its impact on Tasmanian businesses and Tasmanian jobs. Critically, Senator Ronaldson was not across his brief at all on the program. Senator Ronaldson would not answer any of the questions about the cuts to business advisory services in Tasmania. Senator Ronaldson could only take on notice to find out if the innovation centre in Burnie will remain open. The people of north-west Tasmania expect a guarantee from the minister and the local member in coming days, not in months, through the questions-on-notice process. 


I have seen the value of the Enterprise Connect service firsthand across north-western Tasmania. Under the previous Labor government, Enterprise Connect provided small to medium enterprises and companies with access to infrastructure and services to help them navigate business challenges and grow jobs. Almost $1.4 million was provided by the previous Labor government to 104 small- to medium-income firms across Tasmania. Recipients from north-western Tasmania included Anvers confectionery, Forth Farm Produce, Joinery Products, Penguin Composites and SERS engineering. Critically, a number of these firms have accessed grants from Enterprise Connect on two, three and sometimes more occasions. This is logical. A small to medium firm faces new challenges. They of course may want to utilise Enterprise Connect's valued advisory services or infrastructure grants on a second or third occasion. 


This week it was announced that 350 jobs would go at the Henty gold mine and the Mount Lyell copper mine on Tasmania's west coast. The west coast is an important part of the Mersey-Lyell region, which has already been identified as one of the most economically vulnerable in Australia. The Mount Lyell mine has been the lifeblood of Queenstown, on Tasmania's isolated west coast, since the 19th century. The Henty gold mine, some 20 kilometres north of Queenstown, will have been operational for roughly 20 years when it closes next year. I commend the leadership demonstrated by the Australian Workers Union officials Robert Flanagan and Ian Wakefield and the Tasmanian Labor leader, Bryan Green, in calling for a community-led federal-state west coast Tasmanian employment task force, to provide leadership, work with business and community and create jobs on the west coast of Tasmania. I welcome the news that the Tasmanian government has moved to establish a west coast economic working group involving the state government, West Coast Council, Copper Mines of Tasmania, the AWU and the community members.


I was in Queenstown last week and attended the Rotary Club's weekly meeting. Those present were aware of the need to diversify the local economy and were reaching out for assistance to make things happen rather than just talk about change. They were talking about expanding the aquaculture, fishing and tourism industries in particular, as well as support for new mines in the region. To make things happen requires finance, and the federal government is the only tier of government capable of providing the required assistance, whether in business advisory services like Enterprise Connect or co-investment grants like the previous Labor government's investment with the aquaculture industry in Macquarie Harbour. 


I am deeply concerned by comments from the federal member for Braddon, Mr Brett Whiteley, on the mine closures. It would be natural for Mr Whiteley, as the local federal government representative, to also be on the state government's working group, but Mr Whiteley's response was simply that the challenges facing the region would be discussed at the meeting of the Prime Minister's Tasmanian Economic Council. However, this council is not due to meet until later in July, and reports are that it has a lengthy agenda, so how much time will actually be spent on specific west coast employment issues is anyone's guess. Mr Whiteley, your constituents on the west coast need your help now, not in a few weeks time. 


Mr Whiteley, the federal government needs to play an active role in any working groups for employment on the west coast. Both sides of this place agree that government does have a role to play in creating jobs, and, despite Prime Minister Abbott's so-called budget emergency, the federal Liberals are providing $16 million for a tourism expansion at Cadburys chocolate factory, located next door to the world-famous MONA museum, a long, long way from the west coast of Tasmania. Mr Whiteley's stated priority upon election was 'jobs, jobs and jobs', but the people of the west coast want action, not words. (Time expired)

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2014-07-10,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (15:12):  I am absolutely delighted to respond to the motion that Senator Urquhart has moved to take note of answers by Senators Ronaldson, Cormann and Fifield. Let me dispense very quickly, if I may, with the questions by Senator Faulkner to Senator Cormann. Senator Faulkner quite correctly said that there is a statutory period of time—six sitting days, which expire next Tuesday—and I think it was a very good dialogue between the two senators, with one saying that, yes, he understood it and he would be responding, and Senator Faulkner, with his seniority, reminding Senator Cormann of his responsibilities.


What I want to focus on with some more detail is the questions put by Senator Urquhart to Senator Ronaldson with regard to the situation in Tasmania. As you know, Deputy President, I had a very keen interest in activities in Tasmania. I had a business in that place. I employed over 260 staff. I have to say to you that, during my entire tenure in Tasmania, in a very multifaceted business, never once did I have the state Labor government or any of their representatives come to me to see if they could assist in any way to encourage further employment. One business alone—the Burger King business—which I had as part of my Shell business in Hobart employed some 60 young people, and in all instances it was their first job.


I will tell you who my biggest clients were, Deputy President, because it is a sad litany when we see where those industries now are in Tasmania. The first was the forestry industry, a renewable industry, a phenomenal industry, north and south. Triabunna is a place that our leader in the Senate, Senator Abetz, is well aware of. The Triabunna mill, on the south-east coast of Tasmania, was critical, pivotal, to the forestry industry but, as a result of a deal done between the Greens and Mr Graeme Wood—no doubt following in some way a connection with a $1.6 million donation—the Triabunna mill was cut off at the knees, ceased to be a mill and became some sort of tourist venture, and there went one of the biggest employment groups and one of the biggest sustainable industries in Tasmania at the same time. It had employed people up and down the length and breadth of Tasmania.


The second industry—one that I know was sustainable, because I watched their activities and I provided a service to them 24 hours a day, seven days a week—was the fishing industry, both in southern Tasmania up to the Derwent, over at Bicheno, right up the east coast and across the north. I probably had about two-thirds of the Tasmanian fishing clients whose fuels and lubricants I supplied. What has happened to them? Again, they are dying on the vine.


As Senator Abetz would be aware, one of my best clients was Hydro Tasmania. I sold them very high-value, high-margin lubricants. I will tell you why I did that: because the then Labor government in Tasmania were ripping money out of hydro and failing to put the funds back into much-needed maintenance. In every cloud there is a silver lining and the silver lining for me was a very, very good trade in lubricants—which should never, ever have had to be used had that not been the case.


Now I turn to another industry—the aquaculture industry. Tasmania is leading the world in the aquaculture industry, but what do we now fear? As a result of perverse environmental pressures being put on that industry, we see the lack of expansion and I fear, Senator Polley, a reduction of an industry that is capable of creating more employment in the state of Tasmania—the very points that Senator Urquhart was making in her question to Senator Ronaldson. If nothing else, Senator Urquhart could have assisted this very day in reducing the burden on households and businesses—small and large—in the state of Tasmania by getting rid of the carbon tax, which must be hurting the businesses and the households in Tasmania. 


As we know, the cost of heating in Tasmania is higher because of the cold climate. Unemployment is high in Tasmania. I know the cost of electricity in Tasmania, Senator Polley: it was higher than it was in my home state of Western Australia. So when I hear Senator Urquhart talking to my side of government about creating employment opportunities, I say, thank God for the Will Hodgman-led coalition government, because it got rid of 16 years of failed Labor governments in the state of Tasmania.

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (15:17):  Again, Mr Deputy President, I congratulate you on your elevation to this high office. I take exception to the comments from my learned colleague across the chamber: it is not cold in Tasmania; we have a perfect climate down there. Secondly, we were in government for 16 years in Tasmania, and Tasmania is better off for it. I can guarantee you one thing: Will Hodgman will not be Premier for 16 years. 


I would like to revisit the question I put to the minister in relation to aged care and the dementia and behaviour supplement. I want to talk about how the representatives from the aged-care providers reacted to the decision that was taken unceremoniously, I might add, and without any warning, to axe the dementia and severe behaviours supplement, a supplement to assist those who are at the most vulnerable point in their lives. Dr John Kelly, head of Aged & Community Services Australia, said: 


It enables my members across 1,800 facilities around Australia to provide extra support.     


They may be able to put on a specialist, they may be able to put on a person with dementia training … We're going to miss out on that.


He went on to say:


Dementia is a chronic condition.


To think that you're going to pull money out of something that's been identified as a priority heath need and something that's intrinsic in the care of those older Australians, it's more than tragic. I think it's a travesty. 


But what about the for-profit sector? Were they impressed? No, they were just livid and absolutely scathing of this government. Patrick Reid, as I mentioned in my question, the head of Leading Aged Services Australia, said:


The Minister cites the reason for ceasing the supplement as a budget blow-out that has been known since August 2013; this action represents the Government turning its back on Australia's most vulnerable people, their families and the industry that provides specialist quality care 24 hours a day. 


In fact, the for-profit providers were so incensed by this decision that they met in Melbourne last Thursday to vent their disgust. They face an uncertain future. They are wondering every day just how they are going to provide care and support for those people at the most vulnerable point in their lives. They obviously cannot abandon those with dementia. It is not an option, so this decision by the government constitutes another hit to the pocket of providers, many of whom survive on a very slim profit margin. 


There is the question about consultation: was there any consultation with the sector? Senator Fifield reckons there was and he said that he consulted the aged-care sector committee, a committee set up to consult on issues like this, as well as unspecified experts. But did this actually happen? I can inform you, no, because Patrick Reid said:




At no stage was the committee consulted on the cessation of the funding.



There was no consultation, no warning, and those who were in the chamber last Thursday remember that the minister just snuck in here for the last question time of the previous Senate and made this announcement: no warning to the sector; no consultation with the sector, leaving the most vulnerable people and those who provide this valuable service out in the cold. 


This is just further evidence that this government does not have a plan for dementia just like they have no plan for aged care generally, and there is no minister for aged care or for ageing. By all accounts, Mr Fifield has decisions thrust upon him from high. It is not just me saying that we do not have an aged-care minister or a minister for ageing; quite frankly, that is what the sector is saying. 


The sector and the Australian community also remember that, during the Howard government, there were five different ministers for ageing, and none of them seemed to have any particular interest in the issues that involved older Australians. (Time expired)

Senator EDWARDS
 (South Australia) (15:22):  I rise to take note of answers from Ministers Fifield, Cormann and Ronaldson. I listened to Senator Urquhart's contribution here and her confected outrage. It is admirable that she talked about 'her' Tasmania, but I did not hear any mention at all about the fact that, when she was in government, there was no further funding beyond 30 June 2014 for trade training programs—the 200-odd trade training programs around this country—and she did not actually tell all those people that there was no budget provision for it beyond 30 June 2014.


I did hear Minister Ronaldson talk of the $500 million industry skills fund, which, as part of the initiative, is to provide $20,000 loans to apprentices to ensure that they are able to finish their apprenticeships. This is a good thing for rural Tasmania, rural South Australia and rural Western Australia. In all of those places this is an incentive. I have an apprentice in my family and I know how important and how good this would have been for him three years ago when he started his carpentry apprenticeship.


I also take note of the fact that, since this government has come to power, we have a wage subsidy for people caught up in workforce exclusion. There are now trade support loans for apprentices—support for apprentices in places like Whyalla, which we hear about so often in this chamber in relation to the carbon tax debate. There are reallocation allowances of $6,000, allowing people in the northern suburbs to relocate to places where there is plenty of work, where the jobs are—like Port Lincoln. This is trying to match employment with market forces with the assistance of the government—a friendly government looking to facilitate those people who want to work, who want to get to the places where the work is being offered. For the long-term unemployed, $2½ thousand will be paid to them if they stay in work for more than 12 months.


Also, a program has started in the northern suburbs of Adelaide, out of Gawler. Work for the Dole actively tries to re-engage the now 45 per cent of unemployed youth in the northern suburbs of Adelaide. We are trying to provide a culture where they can learn to work, learn to come to work to be around people who understand work programs. This program is trying to create a culture of worth and stability in their lives, where their work is valued and they gain the skills with which they can make a valuable contribution not only to their families but also to the community in which they serve.

I want to bring the Senate's attention to what actually had been agreed on by this Senate only hours earlier today, and that was 'That there be laid on the table by the Minister for Finance, no later than 1.50 pm on Thursday, 10 July 2014, the Corporations Amendment (Streamlining Future of Financial Advice ) Regulation 2014.' The Senate itself called on the minister to table these documents and he refused to do so.


The minister, in answer to a question to him today, showed a lack of understanding or appreciation of what processes had actually been undertaken. The simple fact is that these documents have been prepared for tabling, and it was the intrusion of Treasury officials to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel that stopped them being tabled. The minister or somebody within the government has instructed that these documents not to be prepared for tabling. It is an incredible breach. Let us be clear: this is not about giving people an opportunity to understand them. The minister knows the will of the Senate on this issue. This is about delay, delay, delay. It is not as though the regulations he will not table are not significant. For example, part 7.7A2, 'Best interests duty—identifying objectives et cetera disclosed' says:


(1) This regulation:


(a) is made for paragraph 961B(5)(a) of the Act; and


(b) prescribes a step (the prescribed step) in substitution for the step mentioned in paragraph 961B(2)(a) of the Act;


What does that mean? That means that this is nothing other than a watering down of the best interests duty—a watering down of the protections that have been provided.


The minister repeatedly has said at different points in time that by watering down these reforms, by adopting his regulation, it will not return to commissions or sales incentives or conflicted remunerations. He said that those matters are not going to come back. Frankly, that is not the case at all.


There are nine separate ways that kickbacks have been reintroduced by this government: the general advice exemption, which allows people to be able to narrow the scope of advice to get around the bans on conflicted remuneration by allowing commissions on execution services, a loophole to keep commissions by having a different adviser execute or implement the advice that other advisers initially provided; by allowing banks to pay commissions on all basic banking products extending the already broad exemption for basic banking products so that it applies to all staff, including financial planning staff; and by permitting ongoing asset fees, indefinitely allowing them to continue. The list goes on and on.


What does this mean? It means the basic protections, the fundamental protections, that people had been provided through the initial Future of Financial Advice reforms are being stripped by these regulations. In light of recent discoveries, in light of a Senate committee report that outlines the sheer horror of what has gone on in some of these sectors, it is unconscionable that this government make the decision that now is the appropriate time to water down these reforms. It is not. There are too many stories of people being ripped off and it is wrong for the government to want to side with a handful of crooks, shonks and conmen, who have given the financial services industry a bad name and are salivating at the opportunity to go to bad old days of financial advice when the regulation was at a minimum and they were able to keep clipping the ticket and keep making a buck at the expense of the people they were there to serve.

AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE
 REPORT OF THE 
JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON NATIONAL CAPITAL


AND EXTERNAL TERRITORIES


INQUIRY INTO THE ALLOCATION OF LAND TO DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS IN THE AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY (ACT)





Preamble



The Australian Government (the Government) welcomes the opportunity to respond to the report of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and the External Territories' (Committee) Inquiry into the Allocation of Land to Diplomatic Missions in the Australian Capital Territory (Report), published in March 2013.


The inquiry highlighted the need for an Australian Government policy to address the shortage of National Land to accommodate the anticipated future demand for diplomatic missions, supported by a National Capital Authority strategy for long term allocation of land.



This response seeks to balance the interests of the Commonwealth, the ACT Government, the diplomatic community and the residents of the Canberra community given the uniqueness of Canberra
'
s purpose built, planned city and the nature of the zoning of land as National Land or Territory Land.



It also takes into account Australia's international obligations under the ViennaConvention on Diplomatic Relations 1967 to facilitate the acquisition of diplomatic missions and safeguard the mission against intrusion or damage.




Considerations for Diplomatic Missions in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT)



Diplomatic missions play an important role in signalling a country's profile in and relationship to Australia, channelling communication between the country and Australia, representing and promoting the country's interests to Australia, and fostering and developing economic and cultural links with Australia.




Currently, Canberra, as the National Capital, hosts 101 diplomatic missions, 53 of which are located in the diplomatic estate. Given Australia
'
s increasing international role and importance, the demand for land for diplomatic missions is strong. Processes are in train for the establishment of four new diplomatic missions and enquiries have been received regarding the establishment of a further seven diplomatic missions. The Government understands that open National Land in the ACT, such as Stirling Ridge, is used recreationally and enjoyed by residents. The allocation of land and establishment of diplomatic missions needs to be considered in the context of national interest, security, and maintaining productive foreign and trade relations noting international obligations.





There are also the financial implications of purchasing Territory Land if suitable National Land is unable to be obtained.




In recognition of these complex issues, it is imperative that a long term strategy regarding the allocation of National Land for diplomatic missions be developed.




Recommendation 1



The Committee recommends that, in order to better utilise limited resources for the allocation of land to diplomatic missions, the Australian Government implement:


* Strengthened policies and regulations surrounding diplomatic leases to ensure compliance, with the policy of resumption of land within 36 months where development has not commenced being rigorously enforced


* Medium- and high-density options for housing chanceries


* Policies to allow the subdivision of existing sites within the diplomatic estate


* A policy framework that allows more extensive use of residential and commercial properties to house chanceries, along the lines adopted in Washington DC


* In the future, a steady evolution towards a more commercial approach (as in


Washington DC) should be encouraged.




Agreed



The Government supports the Committee recommendation to improve the policy regarding land allocation for diplomatic leases. At present there is no specific plan or policy governing the location of diplomatic missions. This function is managed by the National Capital Authority on behalf of the Commonwealth, in consultation with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and relevant security agencies. There are no legislative criteria for managing the location of diplomatic missions and administrative arrangements have evolved over time in an ad hoc manner. The Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development will develop an Australian Government land allocation policy to address the shortage of National Land to accommodate the anticipated future demand for diplomatic missions, supported by a National Capital Authority strategy for long term allocation of land.


The development of a policy will ensure a better coordinated and consistent approach to land allocation for diplomatic missions and will aid in providing greater clarity on diplomatic leasing issues.


The development of a policy will need careful consideration and time given the complexity of these issues. The Government has commenced early engagement with relevant government stakeholders to progress matters arising from the report.


The Government notes that there are a number of complex issues concerning diplomatic land allocation including maintaining diplomatic relations and the security of foreign nationals whilst also being sensitive to community interests. The policy will need to be developed with specific regard to the Australia's obligation under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations 1967.


In the interim, site allocation issues will be addressed on a case-by-case basis involving careful consultation with relevant ministers, the community and the National Capital Authority.




Recommendation 2



The Committee recommends that the National Capital Authority develop a long term strategy for the allocation of land to diplomatic missions in the Australian Capital Territory. This strategy should be developed in conjunction with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Australian Federal Police and ACT Government and integrated with the National Capital Plan and the Territory Plan. It should forecast demand and supply and establish the various mechanisms by which these forecasts may be met, including:


* Designating sites for future diplomatic enclaves


* Establishing a clear and binding framework for the granting and resumption of leases to diplomatic missions


* Creating a policy for medium and high density properties


* Establishing a framework for more extensive use of residential and commercial properties for chanceries


* Managing impacts on local residents


* Working out what role the private market might play.



Noted



The Government noted the Committee recommendation for the National Capital Authority to develop a long term strategy for the allocation of land to diplomatic missions in conjunction with key stakeholders.


The Government understands the importance of balancing the needs of the national government, local government, diplomatic community and the residents of the Canberra community to ensure that Canberra's diplomatic, economic, cultural community links are maintained.


The Government will ask the National Capital Authority to develop a strategy for long term allocation of land to ensure an inter-jurisdictional approach and alignment with the land allocation policy.




Recommendation 3



The Committee recommends that Draft Amendment 78 (DA78) be withdrawn.




Noted



The Government notes this recommendation and considers this a matter for the National Capital Authority.


The Government understands that the National Capital Authority responded to the Committee's report on 17 April 2013 and, in line with Recommendation 3 of the report, will be withdrawing Draft Amendment 78.

AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE


REPORT OF THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON NATIONAL CAPITAL


AND EXTERNAL TERRITORIES


INQUIRY INTO THE PROVISION OF AMENITY WITHIN THE PARLIAMENTARY TRIANGLE





Preamble



The Australian Government (the Government) welcomes the opportunity to respond to the report of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and the External Territories' (Committee) Inquiry into the provision of amenity within the Parliamentary Triangle (Report), published in June 2013.


The terms of reference of the inquiry were broadened by the Committee, from investigating amenities in the 'Parliamentary Triangle', a colloquial term used to define the land bounded by State Circle, Commonwealth and Kings Avenues, and Lake Burley Griffin to the 'Central National Area' (CNA).


The CNA is formally defined as the Parliamentary Zone and its setting; Lake Burley Griffin and Foreshores; the Australian National University; the Australian Defence Force Academy; Duntroon; Campbell Park and Canberra Airport/RAAF Base Fairbairn. Also included are diplomatic lands at Yarralumla, O'Malley, West Deakin and Red Hill1. This broadening of scope ensures consideration of the suburbs of Russell and Acton, areas that will be impacted by the introduction of pay parking on National Land, a precursor to the inquiry.


The Report makes three recommendations to improve amenities in the CNA by proposing the National Capital Authority (NCA): (1) develop a strategy for the provision of amenity, with funding from the Government; (2) report regularly on that strategy; and (3) that the NCA work with the ACT Government to improve access to public transport to and in the CNA.


In addressing the recommendations of the Committee, the Government is aware that one of the responsibilities of the NCA is to maintain or enhance the character of the National Capital. With this in mind the Government is keen to ensure the integrity of the CNA is maintained, including Commonwealth and National Heritage Listed areas and buildings, while accommodating amenities to meet the requirements of workers in the CNA.



Recommendation 1



The Committee recommends that the Australian Government direct the National Capital Authority to develop a strategy for the provision of amenity within the Central National Area, including the Parliamentary Zone, and provide funds for the development of the strategy in the 2014–15 budget, incorporating:


Provision of retail services


Provision of parking


Provision of access by public transport


Provision of childcare


Timelines for development


Development responsibilities




Agreed in part



The Government agrees that the NCA will develop a strategy for the provision of amenity within the CNA including timelines and responsibilities. Any funding required for the NCA to develop the strategy would be considered as part of normal Budget processes and made within the overall Budget settings and in consideration of Government priorities.


The NCA will conduct a comprehensive audit to identify any shortfalls in the CNA precincts in order to prepare a baseline needs analysis for services. The NCA will also consider the impacts that increased amenity and increased public transport would have on parking availability in the CNA. Based on this, the NCA will employ strategies to address any shortfall and amend or develop policies to ensure the strategies can be employed. If appropriate, the NCA may showcase demand and assist industry in working efficiently with the NCA to provide services in the area.


The Government notes that there are no legislative or planning obstacles currently in place which prevent amenities operating in the CNA, and in some precincts planning frameworks mandate that amenity space be provided. While the Government has a legitimate and important role in encouraging appropriate commercial development in the CNA and ensuring appropriate regulatory settings exist for such development to occur, it is the role of retailers, services suppliers and building owners to make commercial decisions regarding the viability of setting up businesses. The Government notes that the NCA has already engaged with owners of existing businesses encouraging them to consider expanding their services.


Specifically in considering the provision of childcare services in the area, should new centres be required, the planning and development of centres would need to take into account the relevant regulatory requirements.


The NCA will also work with the ACT Government to promote and negotiate any strategies that may enhance the provision of public transport in the CNA including negotiating a 'park and ride' facility on a suitable site as recommended in Recommendation 3.




Recommendation 2



The Committee recommends that the National Capital Authority provide a twice yearly report on development of amenities to the Committee as part of its regular biannual briefings.




Agreed



The Government agrees that the NCA will provide a report on the development of amenities, as proposed in the response to Recommendation 1, to the Committee on a biannual basis.




Recommendation 3



The Committee recommends that the National Capital Authority negotiate with the Government of the Australian Capital Territory upon the development of a 'park and ride' facility on a suitable site in order to improve access by public transport to the Parliamentary Zone, and making permanent the Centennial Year shuttle bus.




Agreed



The Government agrees that the NCA will work with the ACT Government regarding a 'park and ride' facility on a suitable site and explore options for a permanent shuttle bus based on the Centennial Year bus route.


The Government notes that the NCA has already publicly committed to working closely with the ACT Government to ensure public transport services meet levels of demand in the CNA.

 (Victoria) (15:50):  I move:


That the Senate condemns the Abbott Government’s vicious cuts to higher education and the devastating impact they will have on regional students, families and universities.


Since the government unveiled its grand plan for higher education in the budget, the Minister for Education has spent a lot of time touring regional Australia. He is desperately trying to spruik the benefits of what he sees as a deregulated system, as well he might, because regional universities and their students are likely to be the biggest losers if the proposed changes are ever implemented—the biggest losers, that is, amongst a litany of losers. All universities will be losers because of the $5.8 billion that the government is taking out of the higher education system. That includes a 20 per cent cut in course funding. So nearly all students in some way will lose because most will have to pay higher fees and take on much bigger HECS debts.


To recap, this is a budget that has shaved $3.2 billion from the HECS-HELP arrangements. These are arrangements that Australia has developed. They have been highly successful. They are internationally renowned as income-contingent contribution schemes. There have been proposals for the repayment threshold to be lowered and for real rates of interest to be charged on student debts. For some courses, the new HECS loan repayment will be at real rates of interest, which will mean debts in excess of $100,000 to get a university degree.


The government will be seeking to have the opportunity for universities to actually charge tuition fees for Australian students studying award courses within Australian universities. What we are seeing here is a tactic that clearly is not working for the government—a tactic being pursued where we have seen that not one of Australia's 39 vice-chancellors has given unqualified support to the higher education changes. It is a fact that all the vice-chancellors in Australia understand the enormous risks in what the government wants to do. They will all feel the force of the questions posed by those amongst them who are publicly questioning the government's direction. Take for instance the Australian Catholic University's Professor Greg Craven. He asked:


Is it really worth a couple of Australian universities getting very slightly better … at the cost of the remainder becoming very much worse?


In other words, the minister is willing to inflict substantial damage on a system built on equality of opportunity to pursue his illusionary goal of transforming some of the elite so-called sandstone universities into Australia's equivalent of Harvard or Stanford. He says that Australia will never have a world-class university unless universities can set their own fees, unless the higher education market is opened up so that non-university providers can compete for the diminished pool of public funds and unless students take on much bigger shares of the cost of their education.


Minister Pyne praises the American model of higher education without acknowledging what it actually means for the overwhelming number of Americans who can never attend a university such as Harvard or Stanford because their families are simply not wealthy enough and there are not enough scholarships. The minister should heed the warnings of someone who understands the American system much better than he does, such as the Nobel Laureate for Economics Joseph Stiglitz. He was recently visiting Australia and published an article in The Guardian today. In this article, Professor Stiglitz points out that, in the United States, total student debt is now more than $1.2 trillion. That is more than the entire United States credit card debt. It is not only a burden for individual graduates—it is a lifetime burden, in many cases—but it is now also an increasing burden for the entire United States economy. Professor Stiglitz says the failed US model of higher education funding is one of the reasons that, among the advanced countries, the United States now has the least equality of opportunity.


During his time in Australia, Professor Stiglitz repeatedly pointed out—and he advised the Prime Minister accordingly—that the Prime Minister and the education minister clearly do not understand the consequences of following through with an American model that they profess to admire so much. They simply have not grasped that none of the great US universities is a for-profit institution. It is not price competition that has made Harvard, Yale or Stanford great universities in the world. It is a competition of a very different type that has led to the success of elite US universities. They are either publicly funded or they are all supported by very large endowments that dwarf the operating budget of the entire higher education system in this country. It is their reputation for excellence in research that has made them the envy of the world. Of course, much of their research is actually funded by the US government. As for the so-called under-regulated US universities, they are indeed run on a for-profit basis. Professor Stiglitz says they:


… excel in two dimensions: the ability to exploit young people from poor backgrounds, charging them high fees without delivering anything of value, and the ability to lobby for government money without regulation and to continue their exploitative practices.


It is part of the US higher education experience with which many people would be familiar. It is not the Harvards or the Stanfords that Mr Pyne's reforms will impose on Australia.


I repeat: the United States has some of the best universities in the world, but it has many of the worst. The consequence of the policies being pursued in this country by this government will lead us not to the very best in the world but to some of the very worst. The open higher education market that Minister Pyne pines after will, of course, be an under-regulated system because the legislation before this chamber removes the national regulator from its critical role as the quality assurance regulator. TEQSA, under this government, has had its budget cut by $31 million; almost half of its funding has been taken away, and its functions have been reduced. So it has been deprived both of its resources and its powers to oversee at a time when the government is proposing that we have a very significant increase in the numbers of entrants into the so-called higher education market. So Minister Pyne's arrangements leave us with a shrunken regulator, the reductions to which will actually provide it with less opportunity to give proper supervision for accrediting courses and will mean that the minister, under these legislative changes, will have greater powers for personal direction.


All of this produces a very grave set of circumstances, particularly for regional universities. It is these universities and these students in the regions that will be amongst the biggest losers, as I have said, in this so-called brave new world of Minister Pyne's. They are already struggling to compete with the older, established universities that have benefited from in excess of 150 years of public investment. They are already losing students to these universities, which are able to lure students who can afford to move to the cities to study. Students who cannot easily afford to move have been attracted to regional universities, which do a very good job. As a result, regional universities have a much higher proportion of students from working class backgrounds. Poorer students tend to go to the regional universities. Almost one-third of the students from Central Queensland University, for example, are from low-income families, compared to only seven per cent at the University of Melbourne.


Regional universities do have a very special role in promoting equality of opportunity. They do create opportunities, and often for students who are the first in their families to receive a university education. So the proposals to increase the pressures on these universities is clearly something the Labor Party will reject. These are universities that do provide this nation with a capacity to increase its knowledge base, a capacity to be more responsive to local needs, and a capacity to ensure that we have high-skill, high-wage jobs in the regions themselves. Under the minister's deregulation system, they will not have a special role. The minister of course claims that they will be able to have access to Commonwealth supported places. That is, of course, one of the great Orwellian expressions of this package, because these are not Commonwealth supported scholarships that he is talking about; the Commonwealth supported places that they are proposing will have to be produced on the basis of 20 per cent less funding from the government. If the minister really does believe that the change will brighten the future for regional universities, then he clearly does not have an understanding of what actually happens within the higher education system itself.


We know that the smaller universities, the regional universities, with a higher proportion of students from low-income backgrounds, will have to raise their fees. They will be appealing to people who have less capacity to pay. They will, of course, therefore be under greater pressure. When they do raise their fees, they will have to make decisions about what they cut. They will not be able to meet the funding requirements that this government is imposing upon them, and it is simply not good enough to say that it is a matter of choice for them, because the universities will have to decide what they cut as well as how much they increase fees to compensate for the loss of government revenue.


They know that the real prospects for some regional universities may well be that they become teaching-only institutions. That would create a downward spiral in terms of their standing within the education system and would create a two-tiered system, because we know that the government is also considering cutting the amount of money that is available to teaching-only institutions. It is clear that, under these circumstances, regional universities would have extreme difficulty competing with metropolitan universities.


We also know that, for the private sector, the opportunities for competition come particularly at the regional level. That is something that the minister must surely have been advised by now but which he cannot publicly admit.


We already know what the consequences are for the TAFE system, because we have seen these experiences operating in Victoria where the older TAFE colleges have been under intense pressure as a result of deregulation brought about by the Liberal government in Victoria, which has seen profound challenges to the TAFE system. The TAFE colleges in Victoria are under enormous pressure, and many are actually facing financial ruin.



Senator McKenzie interjecting—




Senator KIM CARR:
  We do understand that the government in Victoria is now seeking to offer courses at less than $2 and $3 an hour, for TAFE provision in the state of Victoria, under their competition models. The minister, of course, pretends that it would be otherwise—and, I am sure, the National Party, which of course has demonstrated what incredible doormats they are when it comes to defending regional interests in this parliament. We understand that they are only too happy. They understand that not only were they duped in terms of changes in the budget on fuel and various other things but also they were duped on this question of education, because the big losers were the people that the National Party claims to represent here. They know that there is a great fantasy—the fantasy that regional universities will do better. We know that the complete opposite is the case.


In the deregulated environment the sandstone universities will have the most options, will decide what courses they will be able to operate, and will, of course, enjoy the maximum benefit of subsidising their research programs by being able to charge higher fees. This is the great irony here. The government says it is about increasing the universities' capacity in this country to compete internationally. But all the competitive indices are based on research. A university's ranking internationally is based on its research. This government, rather than funding research properly, is saying that you should slug students and transfer whatever surplus you get out of the teaching into research. Just imagine how students must feel in those circumstances—to know that their fees are going towards the funding of the research program. Just imagine how their parents must feel when they know that the cost of a $100,000 degree will mean that they may have to, if they want to help their kids, as we know many parents do—



Senator McKenzie interjecting—




Senator KIM CARR:
  I think we would all understand this, Senator McKenzie; I am sure even you would take this view. If you have to fund a $100,000 degree, then you will have to make a choice, and that choice may well be a second mortgage. Just when you think the circumstances are improving for you and your family, you have to take out a second mortgage to pay the kids' HECS debts. Or it could be that, on top of that, you have to choose which of your kids to help because you cannot afford to help them all. That is exactly what it was like under Menzies: middle-class families had to make a choice about which kid they helped. Degrees costing $100,000 mean you cannot necessarily expect all your kids to benefit. The government has not thought that through. Working-class people who have a view that they have got the right to get the very best opportunities in this country know that they cannot afford $100,000 degrees. The question will be: will that be a deterrent to them, particularly in regional and rural areas? Working people in regional areas will be saying they cannot afford that, so the universities become bastions of privilege.


We all understand the benefits of higher education—an improved income. We also know that people pay higher taxes. But we also say there is a benefit to the nation in ensuring that the country is highly educated in terms of quality jobs, productivity and social justice. But what we are seeing under this government is an end to those principles—the principle of the fair go is being ripped up. This is a government that simply wants to rip up the fundamental principles of equity when it comes to higher education.


We understand who the beneficiaries of this arrangement will be—the people with money, the people who are already privileged. And they will pass on their privilege to their kids. This is why Labor has remained so committed to ensuring we have an education system that is open and fair for everyone. That is why we had a target of ensuring 40 per cent of people under the age of 35 are able to go to university—and we are almost there. Under this government, you will not see that. We also said we wanted to see 20 per cent of our university system made up of people from a working-class background, from a poor background. This government has abandoned that target, let alone committed to seeing that opportunities are there. Under the illusion of competition, we have a government that has set out upon a magical mystery tour where it tries to copy the very worst aspects of the United Kingdom and the very worst experts of the United States. We have a situation where students in country areas will be profoundly disadvantaged in favour of wealthy students in the city.


What does the National Party say about all this? They just cop it sweet because they are the doormats of this government. This is a government that walks all over the National Party because the National Party has lost its way. The National Party has no understanding of what social injustice means. The government is now following in the footsteps of the United Kingdom and being chased by the National Party to go even harder in the process. The consequences will be that many graduates will now be faced with debts that they will never be able to repay—at the very time when they are trying to build a family, buy a house and get on with their life. Their parents will want to help them but they will not have the means to do so. The consequences are simple: Australia will become a much less fair place. Students, teachers, nurses and a whole lot of people on low incomes will have massive debts. (Time expired)

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2014-07-10,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (16:11):  It gives me much pleasure to rise today to speak to this motion about the effect of the government's higher education reforms on communities that I represent as a National Party senator—on regional students; on the universities, which play a significant role in the communities we represent; on our industries; and on our communities more generally. Senator Carr, we do not support an American style of higher education. That is a system borne out of the cultural experiences of the American state. That is very different from how universities in this nation were set up and, indeed, it is very different from the whole culture of our education system in Australia, which is based on egalitarian principles. The government is opening up the higher education system to an additional 80,000 young Australians by 2018. The great proportion of those students will be from low-socioeconomic families—first-generation students seeking to take advantage of all that a higher education degree can bring you as an individual and to contribute significantly to our economy and our communities. 


You would think the Labor Party would be celebrating the fact that we will be increasing the number of young Australians accessing higher education. Instead, they roll out Senator Carr, the man responsible for ripping out so much from our higher education system. And, I tell you, they do not want him back. Under Labor we saw the system opened up and increased without the subsequent changes that had to happen on the other side of the equation. The coalition government has committed to implementing the reforms from the Kemp-Norton review, which look at increasing the supply of university places throughout higher education. This includes not just bachelor degrees but sub-bachelor degrees, diplomas and associate diplomas—postsecondary qualifications.


The majority of young people in regional Australia do not go into higher education. I do not think it is because they are not as clever as their urban cousins and I do not think it is because they cannot get into university or do not want to. I think it is a combination of factors. Some of it, obviously, is the financial barriers that many families from regional areas face in ensuring that their young people can move away from home and access higher education in urban centres. These are things that we are addressing within our reforms.


It is quite disappointing that Senator Carr is not onboard to further develop and reform the higher education system. As a developed economy in the 21st century, with developing economies snapping at our heels, we need to be innovative and we need to be competitive in a global market. That only comes from an education system which is world class. We are not going to have world-class institutions operating on every street corner. That is just not possible, it is not sustainable and it should not be what we are aspiring to do.


But we need to create an environment where some institutions and some universities are able to go out and take it up to the best in the world and where others are able to meet our domestic requirements in terms of research, vocational supply of teachers, nurses et cetera and the professions more generally. That is the type of education system that we need in this country in order to be globally competitive going forward. That is the type of higher education system that our government seeks to create through these fundamental and historical reforms which, as a whole package, seek to strike a balance between equity of access and global competitiveness. To actually strike a balance is tricky. You cannot go to the lowest common denominator, as Senator Carr would seek to do. You have to have diversity within the system, which means that some will be better than others at different things. And that is okay.


Obviously, within a system like that we also need to ensure that student mobility is increased. One of the exciting things about our package is that not only will we be seeing regional students studying locally—and thanks to our Commonwealth Scholarships program, starting at the best universities in the nation and the best universities in the world—but we will see reverse migration where regional universities are able to compete against those urban universities, those 'sandstones', if you like, where they can actually say, 'Getting a quality education in this country is about a variety of criteria and you as a student have to make up your mind what matters to you.' That will mean different things for different students. We need to give people choice and we need to allow an environment where universities can decide what they are going to excel at.


It is our fourth largest export industry. We want to be the best. It is important. Our government has committed $274 million in regional loading over the next four years to support regional universities. I just want to briefly touch on some of the fabulous research that is occurring at our regional universities. A couple of weeks ago I was at Deakin University, in Geelong, where we celebrated the opening of the Carbon Nexus centre. We have world-class researchers who have created fibre that will change the way we communicate and the way we construct everything from racing cars and beyond. It is very exciting, particularly for that area in my home state, which is undergoing such challenges at the moment, to have such a fabulous research program going on at Deakin University.


Similarly, James Cook University, in North Queensland, is world renowned when it comes to marine biology. Thanks to the government's investment into that regional university it will now take on the world when it comes to tropical disease research.


La Trobe University, again in my home state of Victoria, is looking at the Murray-Darling Basin and how we can better use our water more efficiently. Those are fabulous things that regional universities can be good at. You can be a world-class regional university. Harvard University is not in a capital city. Oxford University is not in a capital city. This reform package as a whole, if taken with all the measures that the government has been able to put together, can actually result in regional universities taking on the world in their area of specialisation. I think it is very exciting.


I am quite disappointed, again, with Senator Carr's rhetoric. We heard it in estimates and I will not repeat it here because it was quite unparliamentary. But check it out in Hansard. Again, he talks about the biggest losers being the universities that my constituents attend and the universities whose research programs address the issues that my community needs addressed. He calls them the biggest losers. We have to stop the myth and stop the rhetoric. It is a bit like with agriculture: you have to stop talking it down. Let us start talking about the positives that are occurring in regional universities, the positives for regional students and regional communities rather than going on about being the biggest losers. It is absolutely incorrect.


Senator Carr talked about pressures being put on the university sector. I can tell you that the pressures under the previous government were horrendous. The ALP policy settings were the things that put pressure on our university system: extra students, no extra money. Anyway, we will not go into that at the moment, because there is too much good news in the coalition's higher education package for regional students, regional universities and regional communities.


If you had been listening to Senator Carr, you would have thought that all regional universities were against our changes and that there was a lack of understanding or collaboration. The minister has been touring throughout Australia over recent months, attending higher education universities in urban and rural areas. He has been getting firsthand experience of the type of education and research that you can undertake in a regional community. The Regional Universities Network fully supports the federal government's budget. The chair of the Regional Universities Network, Professor Peter Lee, is pleased that equal participation is such a high priority for the government. I quote Professor Lee:


We are particularly pleased that the Government has decided to keep the demand driven system for bachelor places and extended it to sub-bachelor places. This will assist in providing pathways and lift participation in higher education in regional Australia for less well prepared students.


I think that is exciting and that the government has actually listened to the concerns of regional universities in the construction of this package. Again, I turn to Professor Lee's comments:


We welcome the simplification of the Higher Education Participation and Partnerships Program, and look forward to working with the Government on the detail of its implementation.


Prior to that, regional universities were calling on us as a government to make the tough decisions, to go ahead with the reforms that the sector needs in order for us to become globally competitive and to ensure that access and equity of participation are balanced against our desire to be the very, very best in the world.


The Regional Universities Network called for the government to turn to lower socioeconomic background and regional students, who have been largely ignored by previous governments. The fact that we are debating this as a result of a motion by Senator Moore and Senator Carr is fabulous. If only they had paid a little more attention to regional students and regional higher education providers when they were in government we would not have seen the youth allowance debacle and the lack of access that that precipitated and the changing of rules every five minutes. That was absolutely deplorable. So to have you in here championing the interests of regional Australia is something I wish we could have more of, Senator Carr. 


We have listened to the regional universities when they called for us to be focusing on levers and initiatives that would actually increase participation for low socioeconomic students and regional students. To ensure that, we have extended the Higher Education Loan Program to encompass such things as sub-bachelor and associate diplomas. That is a positive thing for regional students because they are more likely to access those sorts of programs. I find it quite interesting that the Labor Party is making a very loud ruckus on the back of those parents who are unable to pay those fees up-front now. Is that the issue? Why should regional Australians, who typically earn less than anybody in urban Australia—




Senator Polley:
  Why are you taxing families?




Senator McKENZIE:
  Senator Polley, I love that you are looking incredulous. We earn less—our median income is lower in every single place right across regional Australia. Yet you expect taxpayers in regional Australia who earn less per capita than anyone you would represent, Senator Polley—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Gallacher
):  Senator McKenzie, please address your remarks through the chair.




Senator McKENZIE:
  The taxpayers from those communities, Mr Acting Deputy President, are expected to subsidise the philosophy degrees of middle-class Australians attending G8 universities. What about the taxpayers I represent?




Senator Polley:
  You've got your degree. 




Senator McKENZIE:
  The taxpayer dollars that the mums and dads in Burke or the mums and dads in Metung who are running a mechanics workshop contribute to the federal government are going to fund the majority of the degree of somebody who went to Melbourne Grammar and is attending Melbourne university studying philosophy. That is just not fair, I am sorry. They are happy to do it, but it is just not fair. I think and I am sure they would agree that part of our taxes should be going to subsidise the higher education of our young people, because that ensures that our community builds capacity. There is a public contribution from individuals completing higher education. However, there is also a significant private benefit. I do not know why my mechanic in Metung has to subsidise the son of a Toorak doctor doing their arts agree at a G8 university. It is not fair. That is why I think it is fair that he subsidises 50 per cent of the cost—not the majority of it, half of it. 




Senator Polley:
  They're going to come out with a debt.




Senator McKENZIE:
  If you go back to your membership, Senator Polley, in whatever union you represent here today I am sure your hardworking union members would back me up on this. They know that their taxpayer contribution should actually be a fair contribution. That is why I am so proud of our government for ensuring that we are providing a significant amount of support, a historic amount of support, to those young people who are going into the trades. I just paused there, Mr Acting Deputy President, because I was hoping I would get a clap for that one from the other side. We are actually supporting those going into trades with a historic amount of investment—yet nothing, no claps. There was silence.


One of the great things about our package as a whole is that it does address the parameters that affect potential first-generation graduates in families, those going into trades, those doing diplomas and associate diplomas. That is the important thing, that we have a suite of arrangements that does not just benefit the middle-class and entrench privilege, as Senator Carr said. It ensures that, no matter what you choose as a young person and no matter how you want to contribute and what future you see for yourself, you will have the opportunity to do that through post-secondary education in this country. It is not a bottomless pit.




Senator Polley:
  They'll all come out with a debt. It's out of reach for most young people.




Senator McKENZIE:
  Senator Polley, Universities Australia sees that there are issues and we are talking about that. The minister has set up working groups to work through the level of detail on what we do with the cluster arrangements, how we structure Commonwealth scholarships to ensure they meet our targeted goal of opening up equitable access to higher education so the very brightest students from regional Australia will not be held back by financial barriers anymore. We need to ensure that student mobility increases so that the communities I represent within regional Australia can benefit from an influx of young people from urban centres and right around the country who want to study at providers where the research specialisation is in their area and they are connected in a way you can only be on a regional university campus and in a regional town, so they can experience a world-class education in the regions with a low cost of living. What we are trying to do is ensure that the options available to young people right across Australia are transparent, open and flexible, because that is exactly what our higher education system needs. 


Australian universities are dropping in the world rankings—not that that would worry everybody who just wants a lowest-common-denominator approach to education: 'That doesn't matter; let's just make sure that everyone is on a C. We don't want anyone at an A; everyone is a special snowflake and everybody gets a prize.' That is actually not how the real world works. There are winners and there are losers globally, and I want to make sure—and I know that the minister wants to make sure and that our government wants to make sure—that there are more winners in Australia than not: that we are able to compete against the best in the world when it comes to research that is going to drive future innovation and competition, that is going to create the industries we will need to underpin our economic advancement going forward in the 21st century and that is local research.


We do not want to have to import our brains; we do not have to—we are such a creative, innovative people. We need to be able to have institutions available to our great thinkers in order to grow and compete. I just do not know why those opposite do not want to get onboard. I look at Senator Carr's decisions on terminating programs that he had in place: there were things like our fundamental research infrastructure. Senator Carr actually halted funding on that. We have stepped into that gap and funded that program so that our physicists can use the research infrastructure they need to do the world-class research they are currently doing. I commend the minister. (Time expired)

",Senate,<title>MOTIONS</title>,<title>Higher Education Funding</title>,MOTIONS,20,1,speech
"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2014-07-10,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (16:31):  The anger at the coalition's brutal higher education changes is growing. We can see very clearly why this is the case from the speech that we have just heard from Senator McKenzie.


The policies that came down in the budget with regard to higher education—the savage cuts, the increase in debt and public money going to private higher education institutions—you would expect from the Liberals. But the Nationals try to walk both sides of the road on this one. They are out there in their communities, saying that they are fighting for strong, well-represented and well-funded regional universities. But when you look at the policies that they have signed off on it is going to be very much the opposite.


We have just heard from Senator McKenzie about how she is out there for the mums and dads so that they can send their children to university. In fact, what she is signing off on—and again, we have the Nationals tailing behind the Liberals when it comes to higher education policies—is effectively working to end public higher education in this country. Entry into our universities will no longer be on one's academic ability but on one's ability to pay.


The budget uses the euphemism 'expanding opportunities'. In fact, what will happen under what Senator McKenzie and her colleagues in the National Party are backing when they just sign off with the Liberal Party on this policy is a range of budget measures that will suck money and resources out of our regional universities and make it harder for people in our regional areas to go to university because of these extreme changes.


Together, these changes are higher fees, sweeping cuts and more money for private for-profit education providers. We know that this is going to lead to much higher university fees—some as high as $100,000 to get a degree—and the burden for those costs is being shifted by the government onto students. This is a very savage way to run education policy and it will have an enormous impact on people deciding to go to university.


In many cases, universities—particularly regional universities—will have no choice but to increase fees, in many cases by at least 50 per cent. It is expected that most will increase fees by between 100 and 200 per cent or even more. Then there are these contingent HELP loans. They will accrue real interest from the moment students are granted the loan, and that will continue. This form of compound interest just becomes an enormous burden and that is why the Greens have identified this as a very sexist policy. I will detail the impact that it will have on women, particularly women who choose to take time out to have children.


Already, I find that people are telling me they are thinking about what they should do for their future. Do they take on higher education? Is that the path that they should take? Their thoughts are about whether they should take out a mortgage—should they get a mortgage on a house or get an education? These are issues that people are weighing up.


The University of Western Sydney is one of many campuses where students and staff, with community support, are coming together to raise their voices in opposition to what the government is doing. One open letter has come out of the University of Western Sydney, signed by 204 staff, with 113 community supporters. It is a very informative letter and very worrying. It has been circulated to many of us. For example, the University of Western Sydney has identified:


Many of our students already have families to support, and such levels of debt will represent an unmanageable burden.


Again, that is a message that I get from many of the regional university vice-chancellors and managers who I have met with: that so many of their students are mature-age students, usually with families and often with jobs, and that they are seriously considering whether they can continue with their education or whether they should even start it.


The University of Western Sydney letter goes on to say:


Many of our students come from families with no previous tertiary background and are usually unfamiliar with the nature of university education.


The concern that they then go on to raise is:


Many will opt for alternative sub-university providers who promise cheap qualifications but without the intellectual rigour and cultural capital that comes with the university environment.


Why is that? Because—and again, this is something that the Nationals have signed off on—under the coalition plan, if it is successful, public money will go for private higher education providers in the university sector for the first time.


It is also worth remembering that another very concerning aspect of this is that the standards regulator, TEQSA, will have reduced funding. So at a time when we actually need more oversight because there will be public money going to these private institutions—many of them with little or no experience in the education sector—we have a regulator that will have fewer resources and less ability to follow through on this.


The issue of private institutions being given access to federal funding has had limited coverage in the current debate. Understandably, much of the public debate about the government's cruel policy has concentrated on the issues of fees and debt, but we also need to examine the plan to put public money into private, for-profit institutions. This was one of the concerns raised by the people who signed the UWS letter. It said:


We at UWS will continue to strive to provide an excellent education; but we enter the market as a relatively new institution. With the system no longer geared to promoting high-performing research across all institutions, some of our best researchers may be drawn to the expanding elite. The great gains from public investment in UWS by successive governments risks being squandered as we are forced to compete on price with bottom-end private institutions that have no pretence to provide a true university education.


Education standards will be driven down and people will be conned—many people.


I can very much relate to this. I was the first in my family to have had the opportunity to go to university. I went to university not having very much knowledge about how such institutions worked, but I did have confidence that the university I went to, the University of New South Wales, had standards. This was in the 1970s. I can understand that many people would make the assumption—like the assumption I made then—that the institution they intended to go to was good. If I had been going to university or into higher education now, I could have ended up in one of these bottom-end private institutions who are out to make profits—and who put that pursuit of profit before teaching standards.


As I said in my opening remarks, anger is growing about what the government is trying to do. Awareness is building that this is wrong. Polling commissioned by the Greens into the coalition government's elitist changes to higher education has shown that those changes are opposed by the majority of the community. Two-thirds of the people polled oppose plans to remove the fee cap, to allow universities to set their own fees and to increase interest rates on HECS-HELP debts. Further, almost two-thirds of those polled opposed plans to give private, for-profit education providers access to federal government funding. 


What we are seeing here is the Americanisation of our universities. There are many excellent aspects of US universities, but the changes that have been put forward by the coalition would mimic the worst aspects of the US system. As we know—we hear this statement so often—US students are collectively more than $1 trillion in debt. The average US graduate comes out of university with a debt of $31,000. It is interesting to compare that with the situation in Australia. The Grattan Institute has produced an interesting study. It was undertaken by the higher education policy adviser to the coalition government. It establishes that student fees will be significantly higher under the coalition, with a teaching degree coming in at $49,000; a nursing degree, $38,000; and an engineering degree, $61,000. 


From the many meetings I have had since the May budget, I am picking up that, in regional areas, people are thinking twice about whether they will go to university. If they are thinking about universities, very often they are looking to go to city universities. That is really worrying their parents and their communities. When I speak to people on shire councils, they tell me how worried they are that the coming generation of young people will go to universities in the bigger cities, the capital cities. They tell me that their experience is that, very often, young people who go away to study do not come back to regional areas. They say that the best way for their region to have a future is for those students to study locally. That is another reason these developments are so serious.


In trying to advance their policy, the coalition's spokespeople have just created confusion. The Prime Minister and the education minister, Mr Pyne, have often contradicted each other—about when the changes would be implemented, for instance. Mr Abbott would not rule out the possibility that fees could double, and many experts in the area have been quite emphatic that it is very likely that they will. In the meantime, Mr Pyne, when interviewed, has not been able to decide whether fees would go up or down. He has contradicted not only the Prime Minister but what he himself has said at different times. 


I think it is important to look at the impact on different cohorts of students. I am very concerned about the impact that the fee increases and the changes to the debt arrangements will have on women, on people from disadvantaged backgrounds and on people who remain on low incomes after they graduate. This is because, if these changes go through, people with HECS-HELP debts will be facing the effects of compound interest. That means that people with less money will be paying off their debt for much longer and will have to pay back a greater amount of money. If women take time off to have children—and many women obviously do take time off to have children; it is very common—that will impact enormously on the amount they have to pay back. Again this demonstrates very clearly how wrong these policies are. 


These policy changes will also hit our postgraduate research students. I have received some very useful information from the Council of Australian Postgraduate Associations, CAPA, about the changes to the research training scheme that will come in if these budget measures are passed. It will be possible for the new fees to be imposed on all enrolled higher-degree-by-research students, not just on those who enrol after 1 January 2016. CAPA have had that confirmed. This is again something that Mr Pyne and Mr Abbott, when talking about this issue, have tried to gloss over—when these cost increases will actually hit. CAPA, in their letter, said that they have great concern regarding Australia's over 60,000 higher-degree-by-research students, and we believe that the changes will have a significant impact on Australia's future research workforce.


Here we have changes that will go to the heart not just of our higher education system but also of the type of society we are and, indeed, of our economic viability into the future, because our investment in higher education is an investment in our future and an investment in the economic development of the country. That money needs to be put into higher education so we have the very best higher education we can have in our country, because we cannot be an educated, innovative nation under what this government proposes to bring forward. We need to put the money into research. We need to put money into our universities.


CAPA have taken this issue up very strongly. They believe that the budget proposals will impact on decision making around undertaking research studies in Australia. They have recognised that a number of future students will, again, be assessing whether they can undertake research and whether they can undertake it in Australia. They have identified how we could, in fact, have another brain drain. That is a term that we have not heard for many years, but, from the work that they have undertaken, that is something that clearly is on the books, because students are often looking at whether they will undertake their research studies in Europe or in North America or whether it is possible to do it in Australia. They said that from some of the work they have undertaken there is an unwillingness to accept existing offers to commence research studies in 2015 because of the cost burden that now hangs over them. They have gone on to say that some students are indicating an unwillingness to sign up until their prospective university has indicated whether they will charge fees to domestic research training scheme students.


About 1,500 people have signed the CAPA online petition against changes to the Research Training Scheme. I do congratulate them for the work that they, along with the National Union of Students and the National Tertiary Education Union, have undertaken in this area. They have been providing the real facts on what will happen if these changes come in. As the government attempts to muddy the waters, these people are really getting into the details of how serious this will be. CAPA makes the point, and this is a quote from their letter: 'It seems especially contradictory to be promising funding for medical research while simultaneously proposing to charge higher-degree-by-research students in the medical sciences, our future medical researchers, higher fees than their peers in other research fields.'


That is taking up another aspect of the dishonest way the government is trying to sell their budget measures, and particularly higher education, by making out that they now have this huge bucket of money for medical research and trying to sidestep the damage that their policy will, in fact, do to research. We do know, and I would really like to put this on the record, that research students make an enormous contribution to our research output and our national knowledge base, and that is what we stand to lose if these changes go through. I would just like to emphasise that, because I think it is something that should really be very troubling to senators, particularly to Liberal and National senators. They need to realise what they are signing off on. I made the point earlier that we could face another generation of brain drain to our overseas competitors. Clearly, it is deeply wrong for us to head in that direction.


What we have here is a very sexist, a very cruel and a very brutal set of changes to how higher education would operate in this country. But the good news is that more people are becoming aware of it, people are working together across universities, between students, between staff and between supporters in a whole range of organisations. They realise that this is not about some individuals who may want to go to university; this is about how Australia develops into the future and that we should not be bringing forward a system that benefits just private education providers and the rich and wealthy. If these changes go through, they will bring a great divide to Australia. Our education system should operate to reduce the divisions and to bring benefits to our society, not to further inequality. Right now students and families have every reason to be concerned and to be upset. It is our responsibility to study these changes closely to ensure that where they are damaging to the very fabric of Australian society they are not allowed to go through. The students and staff who wish to benefit Australia and themselves through attending our regional universities and our city universities should not be allowed to suffer because of a government that is unwilling to bring forward a fair higher education policy.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2014-07-10,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (16:51):  I am very pleased to be able to speak on this issue of the vicious cuts to higher education and the devastating impact that this will have on regional students, families and universities. I regularly get accused of class warfare in this place. If you want to see an example of class warfare, have a look at the Abbott government's budget that drags billions of dollars out of the pockets of our pensioners, of our seniors and of our sick. It is just absolutely unbelievable that this type of class warfare can take place in this country in this day and age. To understand the scope of the class warfare being carried out by the coalition against the poor of this country you have to look at all aspects of the budget, not just at education. But on higher education in particular, the coalition have form. The coalition have done this before. There is a book called The Australian Moment, by George Megalogenis, one of the most praiseworthy and praised academic writers in this country. He looks at issues that are important for this country and in The Australian Moment he says, 'On 20 August 1996, Costello'—the then Treasurer of the coalition government; one of the worst Treasurers this country has ever seen—'announced $7.2 billion in savings, $800 million short of their original two-year target of $8 billion. The spending cuts were valued at $5.2 billion.'


It all sounds a bit 'here we go again'. He went on: 'The revenue measures were another $2 billion. The single largest cut was to tertiary education funding.' The cuts were to our universities. Mr Megalogenis continued: 'The savings were expected to secure a small surplus of $1 billion in 1998-99, but this time Treasury was being too pessimistic. The budget was balanced a year ahead of schedule and it went back to surplus, as Keating had said it would, jumping to $3.9 billion in 1998-99—almost four times above Costello's original estimate—and then to $13 billion in 1999-2000. Costello subsequently reversed many of the spending cuts, though not those to universities or to the public broadcaster, the ABC.'


So, it is in the DNA of the coalition to attack the ABC and higher education. Mr Megalogenis said: 'These choices were ideological. Howard and Costello agreed with the Hawke and Keating governments on the broad outline of the economic reform program to float financial deregulation, tariff cuts and surplus budgeting but they rejected Labor's cultural agenda and used the budget to wind back Hawke's ""clever country"" spending and Keating's funding for the arts. The savings from universities, for example, were not banked but used to promote private sector schools.' So if ever there has been a position of class warfare it was when the Howard-Costello government—picked up now by the Abbott government—attacked the fundamental issues that allow working-class people to get ahead: access to university. 


I am one of the few people here who have never been to university. I was a tradesperson. I left school at 15 and got an apprenticeship. My sister and my brother have university degrees. My two kids have university degrees. I know what it is like to try to assist two children from a working-class background to get through university. Most people know what that is like. My two kids—like many other kids—had to work hard. They had to take jobs to get themselves through university, because I could not afford to do it on one wage in my house. So I know what it is like, and I know how important it is to get to university. 


Getting through university now is a bit like getting through high school in the days when I went to school. In those days you had to get through high school to get a job; now you have to get through university to get some jobs. Even some engineering and trades jobs require people with degree qualifications. So it is different now, and to make it hard for young Australians to access university is a class warfare attack of some significance. 


This government came to power based on lies and deceit. There were going to be no cuts to health, no cuts to education, and no cuts to the pension. You cannot trust this mob one inch. And the impact of this budget on regional students, families and universities is absolutely huge. 


You have to ask yourself: what do they have against working-class people getting access to an education? Why do they constantly rip billions of dollars out of higher education so that it is only the rich and privileged who can get their kids a university education? Why do they do that? They have done it now and they did it back in 1996. So these people on the government benches have form. In my view it is ideological. It is as George Megalogenis said: it is an ideological obsession of this government. 


And this government are now trying to argue that universities will be better off with less funding. They argue that universities will be better because you can privatise and get more players coming in; there will be more competition. That really is a sort of social Darwinism from the coalition: the strong will survive and the weak can just die away. I have heard them say that this is not an Americanisation of the Australian university system. Rubbish! It is exactly all of the worst aspects of the United States university system being imposed on this country because of their ideological bent that it should be basically the rich and the well-off who can get their kids into university. What have they got against working-class kids getting into university? What is the problem here, other than their ideology? It is okay if you have gone to a private school. Megalogenis said that money was taken out of the universities, where working-class kids were getting access to a good education, and put into private schools. I just had a look at what the fees are in private schools. If you go to Canberra Grammar, it is $20,140 for a term. With what the government wants to do here—get the cleaners back on to $17 an hour—how many cleaners in Canberra will be sending their kids to Canberra Grammar? The answer is: none. If you go to SCEGGS in Darlinghurst in New South Wales, it is $32,179. 



An opposition senator:  How much?




Senator CAMERON:
  $32,179. If you go to Brisbane Grammar School, it is $23,345. In South Australia, if you go to Pulteney Grammar, $21,530. In Victoria, Geelong Grammar, $34,000. In Western Australia, Christ Church Grammar, $24,200. I am sorry, I cannot give you Tasmania's, because the figures are not there; they must be a secret.


The kids that go to these private schools get money that is taken out of the public school system and put into the private school system. Their parents can afford to spend 30-odd thousand dollars to put them into a private school. Will they have a problem like my kids had when they went to university? They will not have to worry about going out and getting a job. There will not have to worry about whether their parents can buy them a book. They will not have to worry about whether their parents can buy them a beemer to head off to university every day. They will do it easily. But working class kids in the western suburbs of Sydney will not be able to do it. 


When I get accused of class warfare, I say, 'Accuse me all you like, because if I am going to stand up for kids in the western suburbs of Sydney—I am a New South Wales senator after all—I am going to stand up for them.' The kids that go to SCEGGS, the kids that go to Sydney Grammar, the kids that go to Canberra Grammar and the kids that go to Brisbane Grammar do not really need me standing up for them here because they will do okay, thanks very much. Their parents will give them more than enough money to look after them and get them an education in university.


I have to say to you I am absolutely appalled the more I hear from the National Party. If anyone was here when Senator McKenzie gave her speech, and if you managed to go through the 20 minutes without falling asleep, you would have heard some interesting points. What she was saying was that you have to have these innovative universities that can match it with the best in the world. And for the rest, you have to have universities that can meet domestic demand. Now, 'meet domestic demand' is really code for 'going to second-class universities'. That is what that is about. And she says that, 'You want to bring everyone down to the same level.' Well, I have news for Senator McKenzie: I would like every university in the country to be at the same level as the best universities in the country. But I would like them to be supported financially to do that. The coalition certainly will not do it. 


She went on to say, 'You have to balance equity of access against global competition.' Well, 'equity of access' simply means that if you have plenty of money, you will get in. If you do not have a lot of money, you will not get in. And 'global competition' means that if you have plenty of money, you will go to the best universities. If you are a working class kid in the western suburbs of Sydney, you will go to the 'domestic demand' university—the second-class university. And she says that they are putting in $224 million to support regional universities. This is the debating trick that this mob over there use all the time. They look at the budget and say, 'We are spending $224 million in unis.' But they do not tell you how much they have pulled out. They have pulled $5.8 billion out of higher education in this country. That is what has come out from this mean-spirited, class-warfare-ridden coalition—$5.8 billion.


Going back to what Senator McKenzie said, she actually should get her facts right if she is coming in here and making these claims. She says that the great universities—and quotes Harvard and Oxford—are not universities that are in capital cities. Well, I have news for her: Boston is the capital city of Massachusetts, and that is where Harvard is. It is 12 minutes from the CBD of Boston. Oxford is one hour and 16 minutes from London. That is about the same time it takes for you to drive from Penrith to the CBD. 


On the other issue she raises, she said, 'We are going to help the tradespeople of this country; we are going to give them all this money in the Trade Support Loans.' What she does not say is that $914 million has been taken away from apprentices. The Labor government had the Tools For Your Trade program to help young working class kids get access to tools so that they could get their trade training. That was worth $914 million. If you go to the budget papers, you can see quite easily that $914 million was pulled out of that program. Guess how much they are going to spend on the trade support program in 2015-16: they are going to spend $2.7 million. So $914 million disappears and $2.7 million comes in.


Then we have the argument from the National Party that there are winners and losers. They say, 'You have to be in the real world.' That means that government should just step away and let the market rip. 'Government should just step away and let ordinary working people in this country just battle away without any government support.' This mob is all about small government. It is not about looking after people that need help. This budget epitomises that. This budget absolutely epitomises that. 


The National Party should hang their heads in shame because this budget will affect regional and rural Australia more than the CBDs—it will affect it much more than the cities. In rural and regional Australia, you are going to get hammered with more costs. In rural and regional Australia, that is where people depend on support through family tax benefit A and B. More people who depend on that support live in rural and regional Australia than in many of the capital cities. The electorate of Page, on the North Coast of New South Wales, is one of the biggest recipients of family tax benefit A and family tax benefit B. What has happened to that benefit? It is being cut. There are more pensioners up in that area. What has happened to their pensions? They are being cut. There are more seniors in those areas. What is happening there? Their benefits are being cut. These are the big problems that we have.


The Liberal Party are not the Liberal Party that people think they are. They are not the Liberal Party who are supposed to be standing up for a fair go for everyone. They want to Americanise our system, and that is just unacceptable. The problem for them is that, if you lie to the public and you come to power based on a lie, you will pay a price.




Senator Mason:
  Ahem! Hold on!




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Whish-Wilson
):  Order!




Senator CAMERON:
  I have to tell you: we know well what the public do when they reckon you have told lies. We know that well and that is what you have to accept. You have not only lied once; you have lied twice; you have lied three times; you have lied scores of times to the Australian public. The Australian public do not trust the coalition. They do not trust you because you said there would be no cuts to health, there would be no cuts to education and there would be no cuts to pensions. This budget is an absolute shock for the Australian public who voted for the coalition. They are rolling up, one after the other, saying to me, 'I don't want to tell anyone I voted for that mob. I did, but I'm not doing it again because they lied.'




Senator Mason:
  And they won't vote for you either!




Senator CAMERON:
  It does not matter whether they vote for us or not; they will not be voting for you. The coalition will pay a huge price because ordinary working people will not be able to get access to a decent education—and we heard Senator McKenzie talk about innovation and new jobs. If the working class of this country cannot get access to universities because it is $100,000 to get a degree, or you can only get in if you are pretty rich or your parents can help you, they will not vote for you. If you are going to end up with a $100,000 debt when you come out of university, how many working-class kids are going to get into that? How many parents are going to get into that?


I just do not accept the proposition that you can have a fair country and reduce inequality with a budget like we have seen—a budget that hammers working people, hammers the seniors of this country, hammers the pensioners and screws the sick. Every time you go to a doctor, it will cost $7. This is a disgrace. Do not ever accuse me of being a working-class warrior again— (Time expired)

Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (17:11):  I am absolutely delighted to contribute to this motion of Senator Carr's, regarding the Abbott government's impact on regional students, families and universities. I do so with the advantage of having had 11 years as a member of the faculty at Curtin University's regional campus at Muresk in Northam, and also a history of having been a visiting academic at the University of California, Davis in 1979-80 and the University of Kentucky in 1980.


Senator Cameron will not be surprised or disappointed to learn that I will not be dignifying anything that he has contributed this afternoon with a response, simply because the font of human knowledge has not been advanced by one drop as a result of Senator Cameron's discourse this afternoon. What I do want to comment on, if I may, are some statements made by Senator Carr in moving his motion. I was absolutely blown away that an otherwise intelligent person could have come out with the statement that there had been no support from the university sector for Minister Pyne and Prime Minister Abbott's initiatives. Let me commence my contribution with a couple of comments from people who might know what they are talking about. Let me start with the Labor member for Fraser here in the ACT, Dr Andrew Leigh, who said that Australian universities should:


… be free to set student fees according to the market value of their degrees. A deregulated or market-based HECS will make the student contribution … fairer, because the fees students pay will more closely approximate the value they receive …


You, with your distinguished career academically and in the world of finance, Mr Acting Deputy President Whish-Wilson, could relate to this.


I go to that luminary of Labor, Professor Gareth Evans, who said, along with the vice-chancellor of the ANU: 'The education reform package announced in the budget will allow the ANU to offer an education that is like no other in Australia, amongst the best in the world.' He went on to say that they were 'delighted to see that this government has heeded and included in the package the recommendation of ANU chancellor Gareth Evans' in the sense that the universities be required to put a proportion of their fee income 'towards equity scholarships'. So that is coming into my discourse. The Group of Eight universities are themselves fairly substantial in this country. I quote their president:


In particular we support: expanding the demand-driven system to non-university providers, with adequate quality controls; extending funding to sub-Bachelor Degree programs (e.g. Diploma and Associate Degrees);


That was the Group of Eight recently—in only May of this year—so where Senator Carr has been hiding I can only guess.


I now go to the Regional Universities Network, since that is the topic of our motion. What did they do in May of this year? They welcomed:


… the announcement in the Budget of an ambitious program of reform for higher education which recognises the importance of the sector to Australia—


one which I had the pleasure and pride to represent and to contribute to in those times. They went on to say:


The Treasurer and the Minister are to be congratulated for highlighting the important role Universities—


these are the regional universities—


play in Australia’s future.


I quote the Australian Council for Private Education and Training—again, from only a month ago:


The changes the government has announced tonight offer all students funding support …


Isn't it a shame that Senator Cameron is not here, so we could listen to him rant about people not having the opportunity to participate in higher education? If he had only done some research himself—if he had only looked at what the Australian Council for Private Education and Training has said:


They will support genuine student choice and competition among all of Australia's 173 higher education providers.


It gets better. I now go to Monash University's President and Vice-Chancellor, Professor Ed Byrne, from 14 May:


The approach in the budget lays out a series of steps for an ambitious deregulation of the sector. The future of universities will be more in their own hands than ever before.


I now come back to Western Australia and the Chancellor of UWA. Dr Michael Chaney said this as a result of the left-wing students all out there protesting:


I'm a bit bewildered to see left-wing students campaigning for lower fees on the basis that people who don't go to university should be funding their education … What they're saying is people who don't go to universities should through their taxation be funding university students who, in due course, earn higher incomes.


What a tragedy that Senator Cameron is not here to hear that.


Now I go to another quote if I may, very briefly, before I get into the text of my own contribution. This is from the retired Vice-Chancellor of the University of New England—itself a regional university—Professor Jim Barber. This is what he said in response to the commentary about fees going through the roof:


I have no doubt the big end of town in Australia will begin jacking up their prices in response to fee deregulation, but they will be doing so just as a range of new online, low-cost yet high-quality competitors are entering our domestic market.


Isn't it amazing what competition does, Mr Acting Deputy President? You have lived a life in the competitive world of finance and you know that as well as I do. But one moment: I now come to the last of my contributions. This is from the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Wollongong—itself a tremendously entrepreneurial university—Professor Paul Wellings. He commented that universities should anticipate changing behaviours from undergraduate students who—you would not believe this!—will want greater engagement in return for the changes to the funding model. Isn't that revolutionary? The students might actually get out there and make a cost-benefit analysis. They might get out there and say: 'Which course is most appropriate to me? Which one is best to invest my future funds in, because I want to make sure I get the best qualifications for the career I want to pursue?'


The only comment I will make to Senator Cameron, before he gets off his high horse, is that I too am the son of a man who started his working career in the Depression days on the wharf in Fremantle. My mother was a bank secretary because she had to leave school early to support the farm. So my own background matches that of many others in this place. I had to get to Queensland University on a cadetship fully paid for by the department of agriculture. Do you know what happened? I had to work to pay it off. That was in 1971. I should have worked for five years; I worked for 2½ of the five years under my bond. Then what did I have to do? Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, to Senator Ruston: I paid the other half back. There is nothing new about this.


Those are the comments that Senator Carr does not know about—what the university sector is saying and thinking. Allow me to comment for one second on the American system because I have, as I told you, worked in it on three occasions with a great degree of pleasure and pride. Unlike Australia, where every person starting up their career from diploma, to advanced diploma, to sub-degree, to degree, to master's degree, can walk in without paying a single, solitary penny and start their course—borrow that money and not pay a penny—in the United States, it is a very different situation. You either borrow within the family or you might receive some sort of city or parish based support. You might get some financial aid.


My own daughter-in-law went through university at the University of Louisiana. It was a three-year degree; she came out with a $40,000 debt. The interest rate is interesting. The bond rate in the United States at the moment would be one per cent—you would probably know that better than me, Mr Acting Deputy President; would it be about one per cent, the bond rate? She is paying four per cent on her debt. And do you know when she started repaying it? She started repaying it the day the loan was given to her—not when she earned $50,000, and not at 2.9 per cent when our bond rate is 3.75 per cent. It was none of that—it was four per cent. The American government is making money. Yet we are invited here, by the likes of Senator Carr, Senator Cameron and others, to vilify what Australia is doing when it comes to financial support.


Let me turn, if I may, to regional universities in particular. Remember this: you can start your course without putting up a penny. But it gets better, because a student could start a part-time course. They could be working and they could say, 'I want to do economics. I want to follow Senator Whish-Wilson'—at least, as far as your stock-broking; not as far as you have got, Senator Whish-Wilson. We will stop at that. That loan is available to that student from the day they enrolled in their course of study, be it at university, an advanced diploma or whatever.


It gets even better again for students, in regional universities in particular, but also students anywhere. My own experience at the Muresk Institute of Agriculture was that there are a lot of students from farming backgrounds. There would occasionally be a tragedy in the family. The father might have become very ill or whatever. That student would have to terminate their studies for a period of time. Do you know what you can do under this new scheme? You can suspend your studies—suspend your loan—and you still have not paid anything off. You have paid nothing. You can go away for that one or two year period, sort out whatever the issue is and come back and recommence your studies and your loan. How much better is it than that?


Previous speakers have spoken about cutbacks in funding. Let me tell you what the figures are. In Labor's last budget for 2013-14, higher education funding was $8.97 billion. Our budget shows that growing to $9.47 billion. Last time I was at school, probably even a school similar to Senator Cameron's, 8.97 was a lesser figure than 9.47. When it comes to the Commonwealth Grants Scheme, our funding is going up from $6.2 billion in 2013-14 to $6.7 billion in 2017-18. Those are the figures.


Let us talk about this new opportunity. It is now being extended to colleges and institutions that run higher degrees, advanced degrees and associate degrees, and this government is putting in $370 million over three years. Why is this so important? My experience at places like Muresk and others is that quite often young people were not of themselves at that time qualified to get to university. They might not have studied the right English subjects. Because of their limited academic or educational opportunities, particularly young boys and men, they may not have had that confidence to go to university. What they can now do is enter into a diploma course or an advanced diploma course and build up that confidence, build up that love of learning that they did not know they had, with the loan, without paying a cent, until they actually start earning $50,000, which, with CPI linkage, we know is going to be more than $50,000. But what they do is they learn to love to learn.


The opportunities that now exist with this new program, and we are seeing it already, are that colleges are talking with universities so that we can have that seamless movement. No longer these silos, these hierarchies, where that is a TAFE, that is a college of advanced education, this is a university. It is not like that any more. Break down those stupid silos and barriers and guess what we end up seeing? We see that happening. And in my own state of Western Australia it is already happening in country areas. In the City of Bunbury, Notre Dame University and UWA work very collaboratively in the health sector. In Bunbury! I asked those vice-chancellors, 'Why can't you do that in Perth?' 'That's the city, Senator; it's different'. In Geraldton we have a circumstance in which an eastern state based university, Charles Sturt University—which I wish to come to in a moment—is involved in a program with Western Australian institutions.


Further to that $370 million, we are putting $450 million over three years into Commonwealth funding for Australian higher education in the non-university institutions that do offer bachelor degrees. The third initiative is to open up Commonwealth funding for privately owned universities and privately owned non-university higher education providers—tremendous genuine competition. Eighty thousand new students by 2018, and who are a lot of them? They are the low-socioeconomic people that Senator Cameron seems to think do not have the capacity to realise an interest delayed loan, a nil upfront payment loan. Well I have a lot more confidence in young people in general, and particularly low-socioeconomic people.


I come to the point, from my own experience, that the big issue we have in Australia at the moment is non-completion of up to 50 per cent. All of us have been to university—Senator Mason, Senator Ruston; I do not know whether Senator Lundy, Senator Bilyk, Senator Moore or Senator Bullock may have this experience—and you may recall the tradition used to be that the vice-chancellor would line you up on day one, and in my case it was in Winthrop Hall in Perth, and he would say, 'Shake the hand of the person next to you because they're not going to be there next year.' There is a 50 per cent drop out. We will see far less dropping out when we see students have the opportunity to choose their own course, to choose a course that will be tailored by universities because in a deregulated environment they know they are going to have to sink or swim—and they cannot wait. They cannot wait to get out there and be part of it. So we are going to see higher completion rates, we are going to see greater choice for students and, in my view, we are going to see greater engagement of students. I have absolutely no doubt about that.


Let me turn for a moment to the current situation, as opposed to the new one. In fact, the comment was made earlier by one of the professors I have quoted. At the moment, and I do not know if people realise it, the Australian taxpayer pays 60 per cent of the education of a student. Now many Australian taxpayers are themselves not from university backgrounds, so therefore you have people who were not at uni paying for the course of somebody who does go to uni. And then you get the odd student who wants to spend a year or two in the library or at the local bar and never bothers graduating—and guess who helped to pay for their early efforts at university, where they did not see a lecture theatre or a tutorial or too many laboratories? What it will do is go from a 60 to 40 ratio to fifty-fifty. At the moment the HELP scheme, or the HEC Scheme, is at the interest rate of 2.9 per cent. The government borrows at the bond rate, which at the moment is about 3.75 per cent. Who picks up the difference, do you reckon, between the 2.9 and the 3.75? The taxpayer does. At the moment we have got a $6 billion or $7 billion unpaid HECS or HELP debt and, once again, you guessed it, it is the dear old taxpayer of Australia who picks up those figures. Surely we have got to see some more fairness and equity in that situation.


I come back to the comment I made earlier: remember, someone can do the course part time; be working and do the course part time. They could probably afford to borrow, but, no, they do not have to. They can take that low-interest loan—if they were to get a personal loan to buy a motor car, eight or nine per cent; if they were going to get a loan to travel overseas, 11 or 12 per cent possibly; even if they have a housing loan, 5½ to six per cent—and this particular loan has absolutely no repayment at the time. Put it in the bank and make some money out of it, but do not tell people that, Senator Bullock—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President. Those are the sorts of advantages.


When it comes to regional universities, let me tell you our own recent experience of cross-fertilisation, happening now as a result of this new deregulated world. Muresk started the first ever agribusiness degree course in the 1970s. For various reasons I will not go into, it no is longer operating. It has burgeoned around Australia. Probably one of the most excellent courses of this type at the moment is run by Charles Sturt University at Wagga. As of February this year, the Wagga course—yep, you would not believe it; across state boundaries—run by Charles Sturt University is now being run at the Muresk Institute for Western Australian agribusiness and agriculture students. That is the sort of process we are going to see with deregulation. Why wouldn't we have the merging of international universities? Online opportunities are going to expand. People say to me, 'Fees are going to go up!' If you are a vendor of shoes in Manuka, and there are other shoe shops in Manuka, and if you wandered down there and said, 'I'm going to go into this market selling the same brands and I'm going to double the price of everyone else', how long do you reckon you will stay in the marketplace? Not very long at all.


Regional universities, contrary to what Senator Carr said, and my own experience bears this out, have tremendous opportunities. For example, in my own state it is in agriculture and mining. I was in Kalgoorlie the other day—Senator Bullock would know the excellence of the WA School of Mines. It is already attracting international students from everywhere: Africa, Asia, South America. That will only expand in a deregulated world because they can set those prices, along with those for Australian students. So the opportunities are boundless.


The cost of living in country towns is often less. Then there is the enjoyment of living. I asked veterinary students at Wagga, when I went to give the occasional address for their first graduating group, 'Wouldn't you prefer to be in Sydney?' They looked at me as if I were mad: 'Why would you want to be in Sydney when you can be in Wagga? The cost of living is cheaper and the quality of life is much better.' As we all know—and it does reflect a little on Senator Cameron's observations—a graduate is likely to earn $1 million more in their career than a nongraduate. Is having a loan to put yourself through university, which you start paying back only when you earn $50,000 a year—and you are going to earn $1 million more than you otherwise would—too big of an impost on a person? I do not think it is, particularly if that is available to every family across the horizon, including low-socioeconomic families. It is available to every student—students getting diplomas, advanced diplomas, pre-university degrees and degrees. What we want to see in the future is a better scheme—and it will come—for those going on to masters and higher degrees.


I am delighted that Senator Carr raised this issue. I have loved the contributions.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2014-07-10,"



Senator LUNDY
 (Australian Capital Territory) (17:31):  I too rise to speak on the motion moved by Senator Carr:


That the Senate condemns the Abbott Government’s vicious cuts to higher education and the devastating impact they will have on regional students, families and universities.


The Australian Labor Party is the party for universal education. Like most Australians, we oppose the idea of having to pay $100,000 for a degree and we certainly oppose cutting funding for university courses. We believe that everyone should have the opportunity to receive higher education and we look forward to the prospect of our children and our grandchildren having the opportunity to achieve a higher education. We believe the system should be fair. The system should pursue excellence and help secure the future of the nation by ensuring as many people as possible have that opportunity. That is why the Australian Labor Party condemn the Abbott government's vicious cuts and will be doing all we can to stop this attack, including opposing the legislation when it comes before this place.


Labor's record speaks for itself. Back in 1973, under Gough Whitlam, the Labor government was the first government to put university education within the reach of ordinary Australians, people without wealth, by making it free. When the Hawke government sought to move higher education to a mass system so that many more Australians could obtain a degree, we kept it affordable and introduced HECS and set that at $1,800 for a full degree. Next time we were in government, the Rudd-Gillard government, Labor's support for higher education saw an additional 190,000 students in our universities. We had targets to increase the number of Australians from a disadvantaged background accessing higher education. The coalition has abandoned these targets and now it will be more difficult for people to go to university, particularly people from a disadvantaged background and particularly people from a lower socioeconomic background. We should not be surprised about this ideological attack on higher education and direct attack on aspiring students. The coalition has always had a different agenda. 


I was very interested to hear Senator Cameron refer very heavily to what occurred in the 1996 post-election mini-budget by the newly elected Howard government. Immediately they increased the cost of HECS by an average of 40 per cent and allowed wealthy full-fee-paying students unprecedented access to universities. It was described at the time as wealthy kids being able to jump the queue.


Senator Cameron was also correct to reflect on the writings of George Megalogenis in The Australian Moment. He made an observation of the magnitude of the Howard government cuts at the time. When seeking to make savings, within those budget cuts the highest single cohort was higher education. I remember it well. There was much distress because people, like now, had heard nothing foreshadowed in the election campaign of 1996, which lead to the election of the Howard government, of the magnitude of cuts and nothing of the depth of the cuts to our higher education system. And, on a related note, none of the cuts to research and development were forthcoming in that mini-budget, if you like, and the subsequent 1997 budget.


These things did combine to do a great deal of damage to Australia's capacity to innovate. We have smarts in our universities—that is, the human beings with great brains who go on to run businesses that contribute to the research effort. We did endure a brain drain during that period. There was a great deal of commentary and report after report talked about taking the high road rather than the low road, which was the road we were perceived to be on as a nation. A great number of reports reflected on the fact that we had to as a nation come back from this bleak place where the early Howard government had left us and reinvest in our clever people and our clever institutions and allow those institutions to work their magic, working closely with industry and so forth.


This is an area Labor is incredibly strong in. Each time we have been in government we have mapped out strong reform agendas and increased funding in a clever and efficient way. Most recently under the Rudd-Gillard government we were able to engineer, under the leadership of Senator Kim Carr, a funding regime for both our higher education system, investing in people, and our industry suite of policies, investing in our businesses' capacity to grow and improve exports. The two go together with our research and development investment and yet again under this coalition government we are seeing these things being specifically unpicked measure by measure in the most recent budget. Again, like in 1996-97, there is a budget that in no way reflected what the coalition government took to the election campaign preceding the budgets of their early period of government. It is a pattern of behaviour. Let's not be slow learners, Australia.


The Labor Party warned many people going into this election campaign that we could not trust the coalition. That is a truth that has come to pass, and I hope that, next time, as the cycle unfolds itself over the next couple decades or whatever, there are enough people who remember this pattern of behaviour and that they cannot be trusted—certainly not in the area of higher education, research and development, and industry program support.


The Howard government did a few more things. In 2005 they had their own effort to deregulate fees, allowing them to be charged at an additional 25 per cent, and then attempted to rebrand HECS as Commonwealth supported places in 2007, before the election, which meant that students could only undertake a maximum of seven years of full-time study under HECS. And now we see the Abbott government teaming up with the Group of Eight universities to push through what can only be described as an ideological, ill-thought-out and unfair attack on higher education. It is not a single-pronged attack—there are many spears to it—and it will see higher education become less accessible than it has been before.


I will go through the suite of measures that they are imposing. They are reducing funding to universities and driving that funding down in perpetuity. I will expand on these points shortly. They are deregulating university fees, which will drive up student costs, and at the same time they are increasing the interest on HECS and HELP debts and lowering that repayment threshold. It is the combination of these ideological measures that had University of Canberra Vice-Chancellor Professor Stephen Parker describing these changes as 'the worst piece of policy' he has seen in Australia—policy that he went on to explain in an address to students in June of this year at the ANU as being 'unfair, unethical, reckless, poor economic policy, contrary to international evidence and woefully explained'. In the same address, which I will reflect on extensively today, Professor Parker cited Simon Marginson, one of Australia's leading higher education scholars, when noting:


… no government anywhere in the world has introduced a full-blown capitalist market in higher education, despite three decades of talk, because they realise the public good component of education would be destroyed.


It does not seem that there was too much thought of the impact put into this raft of changes by those opposite—indeed, by the Abbott government.


The changes, as I mentioned earlier, certainly came as a surprise to the Australian public, considering that in the lead-up to last September's election Mr Abbott promised that he would—and this is a very important point to make—'ensure the continuation of the current arrangements of university funding'. Forgive me, but to me that is unequivocal. When you say that in an election campaign, people take that as being the party's policy, and yet we now find ourselves debating these significant measures, these substantive cuts to higher education. In vast contrast to this unequivocal statement—now demonstrated to be completely untrue—there will be around a 30 per cent cut to funding for universities. This will have the effect of slashing the government's contribution from 60 per cent to 40 per cent of course funding. At no point could any reasonable person consider this the continuation of the current arrangements of university funding.


I reflect again on Professor Parker's comments. He said:


On average universities will need to increase student contributions by about 30% from where they are now just to compensate for the Commonwealth reductions to course costs: that is, just to stand still. So expect about a 30% increase anyway.


Some universities like Sydney and Melbourne, the point has been made elsewhere, estimate that some course fees will have to rise by up to 60 per cent just to cover the cuts.


This immediate cut is not the only cut our universities are facing under the Abbott government. Commonwealth funding will be cut in perpetuity by the change in indexation. Linking indexation to CPI rather than the higher education grant index means that funding is on a downward trajectory and fees will inevitably go up again over and above what I have already described for students. Not just on the back of these cuts but also as the government pushes universities into a competitive, non-collaborative, user-pays environment through fee deregulation—and, make no mistake, when you hear the words 'fee deregulation', under a coalition government this is not some kind of red tape reduction. This is not about some kind of reform. With all due respect to you, Mr Acting Deputy President Back, it is certainly not about creating some student utopia of engagement and being able to demand the course one wants to study.


Fee deregulation means that universities will be able to charge essentially what they like for a university degree. The only upper limit is the international student fee level. This is an irrational concept in itself, being exposed to currency and world market considerations. In addition, as Professor Stephen Parker again points out:


… where a university models that it would gain more in domestic fees than it loses in international fees it will just put its international fees up to give it more headroom to gouge Australian students.


It is interesting to note, as Professor Parker has pointed out:


Fee deregulation is poor economic policy, particularly from a conservative government’s perspective.


He cites research from Penn State University that has found a significant negative correlation between the changes in student loan debt and the formation of small businesses. Professor Parker also suggests:


… if anyone had taken time to evaluate fee deregulation they would see alarming evidence elsewhere. In the UK, which in some ways now has a scheme more favourable to the student than Australia will have, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has recently found that an average school teacher who has no breaks in their career will still not have repaid their debt by their early 50s.


That is right: schoolteachers and, for that matter, nurses, with student debt until their early 50s. Is this the kind of Australia we want? Professor Parker goes on to say, as my colleagues have noted:


In the US, student debt has tripled in the last 8 years and now exceeds credit card debt.


That is an amazing piece of statistical information and it should put this government, which claims that it is so afraid of debt, on notice. This is the Australia that these policies will create.


The government did not stop at fee increases that will see students graduating with inordinate debt for their qualification. To compound the impact on students, their loans will be subject to a lower repayment threshold. This will subject the loan to a real interest rate, which will compound even when the student is not in graduate employment, further decreasing their ability to pay off their loan. They will essentially have to pay more off. This increase will hit all students, even those students who took out their loans under the condition that there was no interest on them and they were only indexed to reflect their present value. This is a fundamental breach of faith.


But what is possibly the most troubling about these ideological changes is that, with students paying up to six per cent compound interest on their debts, we will see people—for example, women and those who take career breaks or go overseas—unfairly disadvantaged.


It seems that those opposite just do not understand that not all students have the support of parents who can pay off or reduce their debts while they are studying. Not every student finds themselves in the high-paying job that the statistics that are used like to indicate. And not every person who undertakes study ends up in the field in which they studied. That is a good thing, to have an education system that is open and accessible and in which highly educated people move around in different careers, exploring their own abilities and their own aspirations.


This lack of understanding could come as a result of the free or low-fee education that the majority of the decision makers in cabinet perhaps received. I generally think one should avoid speculating on one's own education experience. I do not have a great depth of material to draw on myself and, in so doing, I think it is difficult to draw analogies about our individual experiences with respect to the policies that we are contemplating and debating. In this regard, our responsibility is to keep an eye on the future of Australia, to understand the current market conditions and to act out our responsibilities for the future of Australia. In this way whilst, again, I respect the commitment and perhaps the fees paid by many a senator past, it is not a relevant point to make in the context of a system that will sustain a nation of highly educated young Australians into the future.


Professor Stephen Parker notes that these changes are on the wrong track. I move to my conclusion by quoting him once again. He said the reforms:


… are on the wrong track because higher education is an investment in the economy, not a cost to it.


And they are on the wrong track because research should not be funded by students. If you want to engage in an arms race with the US and China over top-ranked universities—which this Government seems to want—then simply merge the Group of Eight into a single powerhouse institution that would shoot into the top 20. You could call it “The Australian National University”, save on 7 Vice-Chancellor salaries, and leave the rest of us alone.


That is what he purported. I should say that, importantly, that was said in a highly sarcastic tone, none of which is ever reflected in Hansard, which we subsequently read. It was a sarcastic comment but, nonetheless, a cutting one. He makes the point, I think very succinctly, that these policies are not the way to achieve excellence in the Australian university system; it is a race to the bottom. What we need to do is take care of our current conditions and remember that education is an investment, not a cost to the nation. We must ensure that our universities have the best capacity, the best ability to engage in and collaborate with the wider community, and that they respond to industry needs and work with the research community. We must allow that group of incredibly clever people to collaborate so that the new ideas that they are coming up with will filter through the whole community. We will be able to start new businesses, innovate existing businesses and keep our whole society up to date and at pace with the massive challenges that we are facing as we go forward.


Professor Parker speaks with authority on this issue. As the vice-chancellor of a leading university, the University of Canberra, he clearly thought deeply about this statement, given its provocative nature. I was proud of the points he made on behalf of the University of Canberra and I am pleased to be here today supporting Senator Carr's motion. (Time expired)

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (17:52):  The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority report for 2012-13 is a good indication of the work the authority does looking after one of Australia's and, indeed, the world's greatest natural assets. But, Mr Acting Deputy President, you would have seen in this chamber and elsewhere that many of the radical green groups are doing their very, very best to denigrate this wonderful natural asset that we have in the Great Barrier Reef. You will recall that the Wilderness Society and WWF and the Greens political party keep telling the world that the Barrier Reef is in real trouble. I have mentioned in other contributions I have made to the Senate how the science is showing that the Barrier Reef is able to regenerate.


I am continually concerned that these radical environmental groups denigrate the Barrier Reef principally with lies and the inability to use factual information. I have mentioned before how the Greens are selective in their concern about the Barrier Reef. When anyone else even suggests that they might conduct some commercial activity in the Barrier Reef you have the Greens jumping up and down. But when the Sea Shepherd vessel, operated by a group that former senator Bob Brown is in charge of, leaks oil into the Barrier Reef you do not hear a word from the Greens political party—not a word. I am delighted to hear that the court case which I have mentioned in this chamber before was concluded a couple of months ago and the people responsible for that leak into the Barrier Reef were fined $15,000 by the Cairns magistrates court. But have we heard anything of that from the Greens political party? Of course not.


The Joint Select Committee on Northern Australia recently held some hearings in Weipa and a Greens senator was there asking the representatives of Rio, the operators of the bauxite mine at Weipa, about the number of ships going through the Great Barrier Reef. That Greens senator was actually propagating the sort of dishonest campaign that the Greens and the Wilderness Society have been using for some time. The transcript of that joint committee hearing is in Hansard now and I would refer colleagues to that. The Greens senator could not understand that their rhetoric about the ships going through the Barrier Reef was factually incorrect.


The Hansard record clearly shows that with the expansion of mining activities at the bauxite mine at Weipa there will be no additional ships going through the Barrier Reef. Yet if you had listened to the Greens political party over the years you would have been led to believe that whereas in the past there were about 300 ship movements a year that was going to increase to 700, because that is the rhetoric they used. When they sought to ask the people who run the ships just how many ships were going through, the Rio person painstakingly and very patiently explained to the Greens senator that, whilst there was more bauxite going out of Weipa, a lot of it was going from Weipa direct to China and not going through the Barrier Reef. As the executive from Rio said very patiently to the Greens senator, there are no additional ships going through the Barrier Reef as a result of the expansion of the bauxite mine. Again, that is an indication of how the Greens will do anything to destroy this wonderful natural asset we have—an asset that is so well looked after by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. I commend their annual report to the Senate.


Question agreed to.

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2014-07-10,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (18:02):  I would like to take note of Auditor-General's report No. 52 of 2013-14. I would like to place on record my appreciation for an excellent report, yet again, from the Auditor-General and his staff, who have consistently provided very technically accurate and insightful reports into a number of Defence procurement activities. The comments in this report support many of the findings that the Senate review of Defence procurement in 2012 found, but they do not highlight some of the interactions between Defence, DMO and government that have shaped the outcomes that have been so accurately reported in the ANAO report. I would just like to go to a few of those, because if Australia is to learn from our past mistakes and make sure that we have successful Defence procurement in the future we do need to understand that no part of the Defence procurement system operates in isolation. Just as we apply systems engineering concepts to technical equipment, we do need to apply the same process to understanding all of the inputs and constituent parts of the process that guides and shapes the efficacy of Defence procurement.


I note that the report goes into quite some detail about the fact that the requirements definition was not as thorough as it could have been. Both the operational concepts document and the functional performance specification were identified as having significant gaps in areas, which then led to the Commonwealth having no contractual basis to require performance from the contractor. As highlighted in the Senate report of 2012, there were a number of reasons for this lack of knowledge. One of the clearest was that the people with the appropriate skill sets to identify risk, the people who are best qualified—and the ANAO report specifically looks at the degree of immaturity of the platform and the status of its development and certification—are people with developmental, test and evaluation expertise. In fact, the ADF for many years, across all three services, has funded the training of personnel and the maintenance of organisations to provide those skill sets to support exactly this kind of procurement activity.


The interaction, though, of government and the expectations around the outcomes of things like the Kinnaird and Mortimer reviews, where there is an emphasis on military off-the-shelf acquisition, means that a culture develops where people say, 'We no longer need those skill sets, because we are going to be buying things off the shelf.' The risk appetite of the government, of the media and of Defence is set around this expectation that everything is going to be off the shelf and therefore all the risk is carried by the contractor and the Commonwealth does not need to invest in understanding that.


And we saw with MRH—and again it was highlighted in the Senate report—that what is known as a preview evaluation was not conducted, which means that the people who were technically competent to identify the risk were not employed by the Commonwealth to go and do that activity, because it is supposed to be a military off-the-shelf acquisition. So the very people who would have been able to say, 'There are problems with maturity' were not tasked, because of the expectation that was set by government to Defence.


If you read the report you will find there is a table that looks at certain elements of capability that were fully defined. They highlight the fact that there was a pre-contract functional performance specification as well as a contract functional performance specification. My strong recollection, when I used to run the ADF's flight-test organisation—it is of some years ago, so I am happy to be corrected—was that some of the people who worked for me were working within the acquisition organisation, helping to create the functional performance specification pre-contract and faithfully following Defence's laid-down procedures of tracing requirements from the operational concept document to what that meant functionally for the platform. But the directive came through quite late in the process: 'This was a military, off-the-shelf aircraft. We're not going to be able to change anything, anyway, so take out all of those detailed requirements because we will live with what we are delivered.' 


The flaw in that process has now been shown, in that, whilst the government and Defence seek to minimise risk in the acquisition process, by going for an off-the-shelf acquisition the people who have to operate the aircraft—normally the service chief is the responsible person, the airworthiness authority, for that particular platform—are responsible for making sure that it is safe for the people who are using it. There are a number of standards that they need to meet in terms of things like crashworthiness or the ability of the aircraft to operate in a given environment—for example, by night. So things like crashworthy seating and the infrared searchlight that is used when operating by night were flagged ahead of the contract. Yet, because it was delivered as, 'We'll take what we get,' the service chief could not put his hand on his heart and send people into the field with that. So it has had to be rectified at some considerable cost.


So this interaction of government expectations drives deficient functional performance specification in the contract, which then drives further cost and delays in the actual program. So we need to step back collectively—as the executive on this side of the lake, with Defence on the other side of the lake and with industry—and be open about the fact that if we are going to acquire Defence capability that is modern, current, there is a good chance that there will be some technical risk. That is not always the case, but it often is. And if we pretend that we can transfer all the risk to industry, or if we pretend that risk does not exist, we will end up, again and again, being disappointed. 


Government, the media, industry, and Defence need to recognise that there will be risk. We need to retain the skill sets in the appropriate organisations within Defence so that they can be tasked to identify the risk, because only when it has been identified—when our systems are transparent enough that that is then elevated to the appropriate decision makers—can we manage the risk. 


And if that risk had been identified and managed earlier—we have seen the same things in the refuelling aircraft and the armed reconnaissance helicopter and other Defence projects—and if expectations had been managed, then both the schedule and the cost would have been managed so that that Defence got the capability it wanted and when it expected it and could have retired its legacy capabilities and had postings in place for its people, as opposed to having high expectations of a quick delivery, which did not result. 


It also results in particular types of aircraft being unfairly blamed. People are making the comment that European aircraft are dreadful and that we should never go there again, we should only buy aircraft from the US. They forget, perhaps, that in the early days of the Black Hawk fleet—again because of spare parts and other design issues—the availability of that fleet was very low, and it took some time for it to reach the mature capability that it has now demonstrated.


So I am sure that both ARH and MRH will, in time, develop to be very capable aircraft. There are still some inherent issues with the MRH in terms of things like the door gun and the fact that that impedes the roping device and the ability for people to get through the door while the gun is in place. That will be a lifelong issue that, again, could perhaps have been picked up had a preview evaluation been done. But the reality is that any capability is a system of systems. And we need to look at the role of government, Defence, industry and even the media, in terms of setting expectations and schedule pressures so that we work collaboratively to understand those elements. We need to work towards a system where we identify risk and manage it so that the taxpayer can be assured that their money is being used effectively and we can be assured that the men and women in our Defence Force have equipment that is safe and fit for purpose, so that they can achieve the tasks that we give them. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

"Smith, Sen Dean",LP,2014-07-10,"



Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (18:28):  I rise this evening to discuss a subject very close to my heart—namely, regional Western Australia, and the enormous opportunities that are now within the grasp of our regional communities. Specifically, I will focus on those parts of Western Australia that together comprise the federal electorate of Durack, which, as many Senators will be aware, is the largest electorate in Australia in geographic terms and indeed is the second largest single-member electorate in the world, bested only by the electoral riding of Nunavut in northern Canada.


In our last sitting period, we farewelled from our ranks Western Australian Liberal senator, Alan Eggleston, after a parliamentary career of 18 years. Eggy held a special affection for the communities across central and northern Western Australia. He had an affinity for those communities because, fundamentally, he was one of them, having served the people of Port Hedland and surrounding regions as a medical practitioner for over two decades before he embarked on a parliamentary career.


With now former senator Eggleston's retirement, I have agreed to step into the breach and help our Liberal member for Durack, Melissa Price, elected just last year, to provide a strong and effective voice within government for our north-west. It is an enormous challenge, but one I have accepted with great relish. While I cannot claim the long-standing residency in that part of the state that 'Eggy' could, like him I do have some personnel connection to the region. I, too, spent some years living in Port Hedland in the early 1970s, when my father served the community for a time as a local police officer. I was quite young at the time so I do not have perfect recall of everything. But I do remember some aspects of the challenges that come with living in regional communities that are so far removed from major metropolitan centres.


While there is no doubt that things have improved in the years that have elapsed since that time, I think it is fair to suggest that we still have quite some way to go. I have often said in this place that Western Australia is very different to the rest of Australia. That is doubly so in the case of the north-west, where local communities face a range of challenges that, frankly, would never occur to those living in suburban Sydney or Melbourne. There is the constant battle to attract and retain professional, qualified staff to provide the high-quality health and education services to which people living in regional and remote communities are entitled. There is the challenge that comes from Mother Nature—high temperatures, flooding and the occasional cyclone have always been a part of life in the north-west of Western Australia. But facing a flood in a small remote community where there is only one road in and out is a very different prospect from dealing with the issue in a metropolitan community. Those living in the north-west routinely have to plan for such contingencies.


Cost-of-living issues are especially significant for many people across the region. Food and other goods have to be transported long distances—all of which adds to the cost. Yes, the mining industry is a magnificent feature of the Pilbara and of Western Australia's north-west. But its strength has also produced externalities that are often the companions of strong economic growth—increased housing costs, additional pressure on limited local services and a pressing need for better infrastructure to meet the needs of growing communities.


I do not offer all this as a catalogue of complaint. But I think it is important to correct a perception that I think exists in some other parts of our nation—and that perception is that there are limitless rivers of money flowing throughout Western Australia, including the north-west. Sadly, there are not. While no sane person would seriously question the benefits that the mining and resources sector have brought to this part of Western Australia, I am mindful always of our obligation to look after the interests of those living across the region who are not directly working in mining and resources but who have every right to participate fully in their life in their local communities.


This is particularly true of the significant population of Indigenous Australians who live within the Durack electorate, for whom Alan Eggleston had the highest respect. He carried a determination to work with Durack's Indigenous communities to find ways to include them in the growth of the region, and, in particular, he worked with mining companies and industry bodies to provide apprenticeships and job opportunities for local Indigenous people. This is a commitment I am keen to carry forward.


As I said a few moments ago, the years ahead offer enormous potential for growth across the north-west of Western Australia. This is an exciting time to be living and working in the region, and I am particularly enthusiastic about several aspects of the Abbott coalition government's forward program that I think will be key to, at last, unlocking the potential we all know exists. Yesterday, we saw our own Prime Minister accompany the Prime Minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe, to the Pilbara region. While the focus of much of the commentary on that visit has been on mining, I think it is only part of the story. The historic trade agreement signed between our two countries yesterday will be a significant boost for the export of the high-quality produce of Australia's agricultural producers, of which there are a great many in the Durack electorate. 


I also think that the closer economic ties between our two countries will inevitably witness increasing levels of tourism from Japan to Australia. It is up to us to harness this by highlighting to the market the benefits of choosing Australia's north as a holiday destination—not least of all, the spectacular unspoiled beauty of the Kimberley. It is easy to imagine that time spent relaxing in a sparsely populated region would be a welcome break from the pace of some of Japan's hectic and crowded cities. In addition to the growth driven by increasing demand overseas, there is the question of what more can be done by ourselves—what more we can be doing to achieve the enormity of these tasks.


I am pleased that with the Senate changeover that occurred last week I have become a member of the Joint Select Committee on Northern Australia. The interim report that committee has already released amply demonstrates some of the challenges before us if we are to make the most of our opportunities. The report is complemented by the Abbott government's Green paper on developing Northern Australia, which is the first phase in the development of a comprehensive white paper that sets out a clear plan for development in the lead-up to 2030. Not all of this work will be done by government; in fact, much of it will not be. As the coalition has made clear, we believe our role is to create a policy and regulatory framework that allows businesses and communities to chart the course they believe best suits their own needs. 


Already in the last few months, I have visited many towns across the Durack electorate—among them Geraldton, Jurien Bay, Cervantes, Green Head, Moora, and, just last week, Derby and Broome. In each of these visits, which have involved talking with local residents, businesses and local government leaders, two things have struck me in particular. The first is that despite the hysterical claims from the government's political opponents, people do generally accept that Australia's budget position needs to be put back on a sustainable footing. People are imbued with a lot of common sense—they know that we cannot keep spending as we have been and that we need to provide the nation with a buffer to guard against our future economic shocks. The second is that there is a genuine excitement about the high priority this government is placing on the development of northern parts of Western Australia through developing better road and transport infrastructure, and through the white paper process and associated reviews of agricultural competitiveness, energy and, most importantly, the white paper on reform of the Federation, which will finally reverse the seemingly endless growth of Canberra control over our local regional communities.


But it is here I also want to inject a note of caution. The enthusiasm will only be sustained if we make genuine progress. The time for talking is over. My sense is that communities across Western Australia's Kimberley, north-west and Gascoyne regions have heard enough talk about the potential transformation of the region. They are now eager for words to be translated into action. I am confident that the Abbott coalition government is up to the task, and I look forward to playing an energetic and active role in that over the years immediately ahead.
