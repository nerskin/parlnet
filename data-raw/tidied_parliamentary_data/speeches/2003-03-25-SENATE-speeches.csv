"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2003-03-25,"—My question is directed to Senator Hill as the Minister representing the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Does the minister stand by his statement to the Senate yesterday when he said:
Turkish military forces as such had not entered Iraq but that a number of personnel who could be better described as having police type functions ... have entered Iraq ...
Is the minister now aware of the statements of the Turkish Prime Minister in a national TV address last Sunday that Turkey:
... wants to send troops into Kurdish controlled northern Iraq to provide security and stability in the region ...
And, further, that:
... any deployment of Turkish troops would be aimed at protecting Turkish security.
In light of this confirmation of Turkey's intention to deploy troops into Iraq, what is the Australian government's reaction to any such incursion?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,question
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2003-03-25,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. In light of this confirmation of Turkey's intention to deploy troops into Iraq, what action has the Australian government taken, or will the government take, to advise the Turkish government of our position in relation to any such incursion into Kurdish areas of Iraq? If Turkey does indeed deploy troops in the way set out by the Turkish Prime Minister, wouldn't that just parallel the action by the coalition of the willing? Is this the second very recent pre-emptive strike by a country on another in the name of self-defence and national interest?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,question
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-03-25,"—I am aware of that statement. I am also aware of subsequent statements of Turkish authorities to the effect that they had not sent troops across the border into Iraq. My advice of yesterday was as I relayed it to the Senate in answer to questions in this place. The advice of today is a little more ambiguous as to whether some forces might have crossed the border.
—You might not understand this, Senator, but it is very difficult to get authoritative information on these matters. The view of the Australian government is, of course, that it would be preferable if Turkish troops did not enter Iraq. It seems to us that it would simply add an extra complication. We can, nevertheless, understand the wishes of Turkey to protect its border, to deal with humanitarian issues, and we can also understand some concerns they might have in relation to the possibility of an independent Kurdish nation. It is a highly complex issue. I know that senators on the other side did not like this yesterday, but it is being dealt with principally between the United States and Turkey. The latest advice that I have is that it is being managed satisfactorily.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,answer
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-03-25,"—The simple answer to the latter part of the question is no. As I have stated, it would be of concern to us if a Turkish force of any number entered Iraq at this time, because we would see it as a complicating factor. I am sure that the Turkish authorities would be aware of our views.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,answer
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2003-03-25,"—My question is also to Senator Hill, the Minister for Defence, representing the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Does the minister recall that in the Senate yesterday, in answer to a question about the lack of electricity and water services in the city of Basra, he stated:
... every effort is being made to avoid suffering by innocent Iraqi people ...
He also stated:
I am sure every effort will be made to return those essential services as quickly as possible.
In light of these reassuring words from the minister and in light of the answer just given to Senator Brandis, can he now inform the Senate of precisely what efforts the government has made to ensure full restoration of power and water supplies to the residents of Basra? How has the Howard government brought pressure to bear to ensure that the Red Cross will gain immediate access to the pumping station to facilitate water supplies to these innocent people?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,question
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2003-03-25,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Perhaps when the minister is getting that information he can fulfil some of these particular points. Is the minister aware of the concerns expressed by UNICEF that:
... in Basra there is the very real possibility now of child deaths, from the conflict but also from diarrhoea and dehydration. We estimate that at least 100,000 children under the age of five are at risk ...
Does the Howard government recognise that it has a heightened humanitarian responsibility as one of only three members of the coalition of the willing to put troops on the ground of Iraq? How will the Howard government use this position to ensure the supply of essential food and ensure that water, power and medical supplies are provided as coalition forces continue to lay siege to every Iraqi city on their way to Baghdad?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,question
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-03-25,"—I understood that some of the essential services had been restored to Basra, but I will see if I can get an update before the end of question time. ",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,answer
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-03-25,"—There are a few points that I think could be made. The first is that the honourable senator obviously did not listen to my earlier answer, which was that there are now more than 50 countries committed to disarming Iraq.
—How many? The land forces in Iraq—50 countries?
—Fifty countries—in excess of 30 providing military assets to the combat phases of Operation Iraqi Freedom.
—She said troops. Don't mislead the Senate; that is not what the senator said. She said troops—that is what she said.
—Order! Senator Evans!
—The second point I want to make is that the implication within the question is that the humanitarian difficulties are as a result of the actions of the coalition.
—Who bombed them? Who bombed the water supply?
—Senator Carr!
—The humanitarian problems are as a result of Saddam Hussein for 12 years refusing to meet the reasonable demands of the international community that he disarm his weapons of mass destruction and thus leaving no alternative to disarm him other than using force.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! Senators on my left will come to order. Have you finished, Senator Hill?
—No, I will go on. Mr President, the Australian Labor Party still does not seem to realise that it is not our wish to exercise force. It was our wish to achieve this objective peacefully.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2003-03-25,"—Yesterday, Senator O'Brien asked me a question about some letters from the departmental secretary and the Chief Veterinary Officer. I have an answer that I will table and I seek leave to incorporate the answer in Hansard. 
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
Yesterday in the Senate, Senator O'Brien asked me to confirm if the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and the Chief Veterinary Officer had sent letters advising of an increased level of quarantine awareness concerning the occurrence of a highly contagious disease. Senator O'Brien also asked if the Government has significantly increased the level of preparedness for an outbreak of such a disease.
The Secretary of Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry wrote on 19 March 2003 to members of the National Management Group which he Chairs. The NMG comprises CEOs of State and Territory agricultural departments, CSIRO and industry leaders.
The Commonwealth Chief Veterinary Officer wrote to members of the Consultative Committee on Emergency Animal Diseases which he Chairs. The CCEAD comprises Chief Veterinary Officers from States and Territories, the Australian Animal Health Laboratory, as well as industry representatives who are technically qualified.
The letters made clear that there was no information which suggests any substantive threat exists. The letters encouraged the recipients to be particularly aware of any indications that could signal the occurrence of disease.
This has been the standard practice for the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry to collaborate with its animal health emergency networks on a regular basis to maintain awareness of disease risk and implications. For example regular consultations took place during the Olympics, East Timor and during the UK FMD outbreak.
This current opportunity was taken to reinforce the need for constant awareness and rapid reporting of any unusual circumstances—messages that have been given over the last few years.
The standard actions taken by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry are consistent with normal communication arrangements for emergency animal health preparedness and to ensure that vital networks are kept fully informed.
Senator O'Brien then asked a supplementary question relating to terminology contained in the letter and also if diseases relevant to animal health are a concern for humans.
The Department Secretary and the Office of Australian Chief Veterinary Officer have not been advised of any increased risk to Australia. The circulation of a note was purely precautionary and consistent with best practice.
There are over sixty animal diseases which are considered a threat to Australian agricultural industry. Some of these are zoonotic in nature.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2003-03-25,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked by opposition senators today.
Today in question time we heard an extraordinary response from Senator Ellison to the question I asked about our level of threat. For the sixth time—and a point of order was taken by Senator Faulkner—Senator Ellison has failed to explain to the Senate and the Australian people what our level of threat is. Either Senator Ellison is under strict instructions not to tell the Australian people what our level of threat is or he does not know. We can rule out the second of those; we can assume that Senator Ellison, as the Minister for Justice and Customs, would know what the level of threat in Australia is. Senator Ellison says that we do not use a colour-coded system. Senator Ellison is trying to avoid answering the question in relation to our level of threat. He clearly has the capacity, and I am sure the intellect, to say, using something other than a colour-coded system, what our level of threat is. There are a number of options by which Senator Ellison can articulate what our level of threat is, whether it is by colour—if he wishes to use that—by grade or by level.
Senator Ellison chooses to tell the Senate and the Australian people that our level of threat is heightened. He does not go on to explain what that means. Does it mean that it is heightened? If so, then heightened from what to where? Is it a level of threat that is only known to him? That would be the conclusion that people on this side of politics would come to very quickly. But it is not credible to accept the minister's answer that our threat level is apparently heightened without some understanding of what the base and the top levels are. But the minister has provided no information on the scale or level of threat that Australia faces. It is unbelievable that there are no graded levels in place to work out what the security threat is today. 
There is a reason that he does not want to come to this chamber and tell us. He does not want to have a comparison drawn between the threat level that exists in the United States and here, because the United States have had a sufficient reason to have a level of threat and to explain their level of threat to their citizens. They have a five-level system, and they are at the second-highest level in that system. Why hasn't Senator Ellison come to this chamber and told the Australian people and the Senate? It is because he does not want that comparison to be made, because we would ask the question: why is the US at a particular level—that is, at their second-highest level—and Australia is at X level? But he will not tell us what the X level is, so we cannot draw the comparison. The US and Britain have told their people but Senator Ellison has failed to tell the Senate and the Australian people what our threat level is.
Mr John Howard knows, but he cannot take the political risk of explaining to the Australian people what that level is. We would expect the minister for justice to do it, but he is in a straitjacket. He is in a straitjacket created by Mr John Howard and he is under strict instructions not to tell the Australian people what our threat level is. He and Mr Howard should come clean and tell the Australian public what we are facing— what the level of threat is and what his response to that level of threat will be. Senator Ellison's colleagues are astonished that he does not know what the level of threat is. In fact, they are not only astonished—I think that they agree with me. I think that they are embarrassed because he fumbled it. He was unable to explain what the level of threat is. We all know it was not because he did not know. He was embarrassed because he did know but he was under strict instructions and in a straitjacket. The government is sending mixed messages. You have, on the one hand, the defence facilities and the embassies on heightened security alert. They are responding to security threats but this government— (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Answers to Questions</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,speech
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2003-03-25,"—There is no inevitability about this war—none at all. The government has committed troops to military intervention in Iraq because it believes that this is the only way to get Saddam Hussein to disarm. The governments of Australia, the United States and the United Kingdom have no quarrel with the people of Iraq. Rather, we believe that the only way to force Saddam Hussein to disarm is to do it militarily. After 12 years of deceit, lying and hiding weapons, enough is enough.
Those on the other side seem to believe that Iraq used to be in a state of peace—that somehow containment, which is the policy implicitly endorsed on the other side, works. You know what UNICEF says? It says that every year for the last few years, under the policy of containment endorsed by the Labor Party, the Democrats and the Greens, 60,000 Iraqis have died, most of them under the age of five. And they call that peace! They call 60,000 Iraqis dying every year, under a policy of containment, peace. More people die each year under the regime of Saddam Hussein than died in the first Gulf War. More people, according to UNICEF figures, died in the 12 months before the recent conflict started than were killed in the first Gulf War. And they call that peace!
This is the peace that Senator Brown, Mr Crean, Ms Macklin, Senator Faulkner and the Labor Party talk about. They talk about peace in Iraq. More people died in the 12 months before the start of war than died in the first Gulf War. They call it peace. It is, of course: it is peace for Senator Faulkner, Senator Brown, Ms Macklin and Mr Crean. It is peace for them but it is a continuing hell for the people of Iraq, and we do not see much at all from the Labor Party by way of concern about the people of Iraq. Those people sitting opposite who are against Australia's military involvement in Iraq continue to condemn the Iraqi population to years and years more of oppression, murder and rape. Those people who believe the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and other forces should not go into Iraq condemn the Iraqi people to years more rape, murder and slaughter. They call it peace. 
There is nothing like those people who are recent converts. Those who have opened their eyes always have the greatest clarity of thought. There was an article by Daniel Pepper published in the Sunday Telegraph in England the other day. In the article, entitled `I was a naive fool to be a human shield for Saddam', he wrote:
Perhaps the most crushing thing we learned was that most ordinary Iraqis thought Saddam Hussein had paid us to come to protest in Iraq. Although we explained that this was categorically not the case, I don't think he—
that is, the taxi driver they were talking to—
believed us. Later he asked me: `Really, how much did Saddam pay you to come?'
That is what he said to one of the members of the human shield. Pepper writes:
It hit me on visceral and emotional levels: this was a real portrayal of Iraq life. After the first conversation, I completely rethought my view of the Iraqi situation. My understanding changed on intellectual, emotional, psychological levels. I remembered the experience of seeing Saddam's egomaniacal portraits everywhere for the past two weeks and tried to place myself in the shoes of someone—
an Iraqi—
who had been subjected to seeing them every day for the last 20 or so years.
Last Thursday night I went to photograph the anti-war rally in Parliament Square. Thousands of people were shouting `No war' but without thinking about the implications for Iraqis. Some of them were drinking, dancing to Samba music and sparring with the police. It was as if the protesters were talking about a different country where the ruling government is perfectly acceptable.

"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2003-03-25,"—I rise to support the motion moved by Senator Ludwig. We have a government that says it would like to the Australian population to be alert but not alarmed. You have to question whether or not that is the case when this government will not tell the people of Australia what the threats are that they are facing. This is a government that has refused to reveal the threat assessment level and is keeping Australians in the dark.
Yesterday we had Senator Ellison tell this chamber that the level of threat assessment is not classified. If that is the case, why won't he tell the people what sort of threat it is that we are facing? Why won't he tell the people what the heightened level of threat that Australia now confronts is? The Minister for Justice and Customs has stated that the threat assessment levels have been heightened, but he still will not tell us what level they have been heightened to. What is it he means by `the threat levels have been heightened'? What is the definition of a heightened threat level? What is the difference between the level now and what it was, for example, six months ago? Senator Ellison has not attempted to explain any of these questions that have been put to him or to even set the parameters for the Australian people in terms of the nature of the threats we may be facing.
One has to wonder, having listened to Senator Ian Macdonald's answer today and to Senator Ellison's answers, whether or not there is some confusion within the government, because Senator Ellison has said that the level of threat has heightened, yet Senator Macdonald said that there has been no change to the threat levels since 19 November 2002. When was the threat level heightened in Senator Ellison's eyes? Is he talking about a level that was established in November 2002, or has that changed from 2002 to now? Or is he talking about a different set of threats facing the Australian people from the set of threats that Senator Ian Macdonald is aware of? These are questions that obviously this chamber and the Australian people are entitled to answers to. We can only speculate that the reason this government will not tell the people what the threat assessment level is is that it would mean admitting that Australia has become a bigger target for terrorists as a result of the Prime Minister's rash and reckless decision to commit troops to the invasion of Iraq. 
The US government's statement that, as a result of the invasion of Iraq, there is a certainty that terrorists will try to launch multiple strikes against the US and its allies confirms this. They have put it foursquare on the table that, as a result of the activities now occurring in Iraq, there is a greater threat to the US and its allies, one of which is Australia. For example, in answers in this chamber over the past few days Minister Hill has admitted that defence facilities increased the level of security at their establishments once the war began. He has not told us to what extent they have increased them, but he has admitted there has been an increase in the security at defence establishments. You would expect that to occur. All these actions, in fact, contradict Prime Minister Howard's statement last month that he did not think Australia had become more of a terrorist target as a result of our commitment to the coalition of the willing.
However, the Leader of the House in the other place, Mr Abbott, has put the lie to all of that. He has admitted that our commitment to the war in Iraq would increase the risk of a terrorist attack, contradicting what the Prime Minister said in his statement. The refusal of the government to detail the threat level contrasts with the United States, who at least have made the threat level very clear and have implemented a homeland security plan known as Operation Liberty Shield— something that has not been done by this government. This government has not laid on the table the security plan it has drawn up to ensure the protection of the Australian people and the Australian homeland. It has not identified in this chamber what it believes to be the heightened threats, and it has not detailed the sorts of actions—(Time expired)",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Answers to Questions</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,speech
"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2003-03-25,"—You really have to wonder whether the Labor Party are slow listeners on this particular issue. They admitted today that they have asked this question six times. They have received the same answer six times: Australia is at a heightened level of alert following September 11. The Labor Party have criticised the government over the past few months for blindly following the United States. They think that we should not be doing everything the United States does. Now they say that, just because the United States has issued a heightened state of alert—or has changed its level of security rating—we should do the same. Perhaps they should make up their minds. Are we a country independent from the United States or aren't we? Are we a country independent from the United Kingdom or aren't we? You criticised us for following the United States blindly and now, because we have the capacity to make our own decisions, to follow our own security organisations and to follow the threat assessments that are set by those security organisations, we should be following the United States. That is something that is completely inconsistent in the Labor Party's arguments.
You have to wonder whether the Labor Party really want Australia to be a bigger target. They continue to talk it up. They continue to scaremonger and to try to frighten the Australian people, while the position of the government has been consistent, responsible and considered. The threat assessment is set by ASIO, not by the government. It is set based on intelligence provided by ASIO. Yet the Labor Party continue to argue, despite having had the answer given to them several times by the Prime Minister and by several other ministers that the overall threat in Australia has not changed since the beginning of the war in Iraq. It has been stated in just those simple terms on countless occasions by the government—by the Prime Minister, by ministers in the other place and by ministers in this chamber. As the government has indicated, some specific threat levels in respect of some defence facilities and foreign interests in Australia have been raised.
—There's always an exception!
—It is a bit like your policy on Iraq in the first place, isn't it? You always have an out, always have an excuse and always have a way to change your minds at the last minute. The Labor Party have been jumping around all over the place. Perhaps they need to read the publications that come out with the polls on Tuesday mornings and see what the results of those indicate. Obviously they are not getting any traction with their arguments in the media and obviously not getting any traction in the public eye. 
Australia's interests are being protected by this government on a consistent and common basis. The fact is that the government has been completely open with the Australian people all through this argument, since September 11, sharing on all occasions that it can information relevant to public safety. The government has done this even when the information is generalised and non-specific, which has opened us up to some criticism. The alert of 19 November is a case in point. It was in the same spirit of responsibility and openness that DFAT issued the warning about Surabaya on Saturday, 22 March. This government has consistently, over a period of time as I have said before, been responsible and considered in its responses to the security elements of Australia, and has taken heed of the advice given to it by its security organisations. It will continue to do so. It will not be pushed by the Labor Party, who continue to try and scaremonger and push us into making unfounded claims about the security elements and security risks in this country. It continues to maintain a reasonable, consistent, responsible and considered argument.

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2003-03-25,"—I do not blame Senator Colbeck for the weak and flaccid argument that he just put. He was speaking from the notes he has been given. But the big problem with that argument—the notes from the Prime Minister's office that have been handed to government backbenchers to speak from—is that the government of Australia has a duty of care to its citizens to keep them properly informed as to what the level of risk to ordinary Australians might be.
It has a duty of care. The concern from the Labor side is that the government is not paying any attention to that duty of care. It is trying to lull the Australian community into believing that we in Australia, somehow uniquely among all countries of the world, can have a safe war. The government wants Australians to believe that we can have a safe war and that we can be at war with a country which the government alleges sponsors international terrorism but the level of threat to ordinary Australians because of that war will not increase. Therefore it is safe and secure to make this war. That is nonsense, but that is what the government wants Australians to believe. It wants them to believe that nonsense. Only, Tony Abbott let the cat out of the bag by saying that there was a heightened level of terrorism in Australia.
It is well known that the first casualty of war is truth and we can take some of the things that the government has said about this conflict with a grain of salt. We can remember, for example, that the government reassured Australians that the troops were not being sent to war, they were simply being predeployed and no decision had been made as to whether they would fight. We remember that. That was transparently rubbish because they were being allocated to fight, yet the government maintained that fiction. It maintains that the security problems in Australia have not heightened by being at war, which is another example of the government trying to hoodwink the Australian people.
Let me give you a third example. The government said that we were not into regime change. Then, when it needed a convenient argument about the desecration of human rights by this tyrant in Baghdad, it suddenly discovered after 12 years the human rights infractions in that country and then declared that we are into regime change. The only reason for that change is the change in the rhetoric needed to sell this war to Australian people who are sceptical about its purpose. The change in rhetoric arises because the only way it could sustain the human rights argument was to change the tyrant and introduce a new regime which would not engage in that type of infraction.
We know about the children overboard. That is another classic example of the government being honest with the Australian people! Children were not thrown overboard. That is a proven fact, but so far the government has not admitted that that is true despite the photographic evidence and the findings of the Senate inquiry which proved that they were never thrown overboard. 
The government leaves these impressions. It wants you to draw from them that it is safe to make war internationally and the level of terrorism threat in Australia will not increase. In its private advice ASIO says that the level of terrorism has increased. We know that Senator Hill believes that to be the case because security has been tightened around military bases in Australia. We in this place know that it is true because the security of Parliament House has been tightened to protect us. In addition, we know that the Australian Federal Police have doubled their protection regime for foreign diplomats in this country and have upgraded their security checks everywhere else. We know that the United States is now at the second highest level of alert ever for internal terrorist threats. 
We know all those things, but what does Mr Howard say? Mr Howard says—and Senator Colbeck made a fair fist of repeating his remarks—that the level of security threat for Australia has not changed because of the war in Iraq. What nonsense. This war in Iraq is a war to disarm Saddam Hussein, we are told, of his weapons of mass destruction and to fight terrorism. Does anyone seriously believe that terrorist organisations do not target Australia? Why is the Prime Minister maintaining this fiction that the level of threat has not risen and that security is not endangered? He is doing that simply because he wants us all to believe that it is possible to have a safe war. It is not. The reality should be told honestly and openly to the Australian people. The government has a duty of care to its citizens to honestly tell them, in decent language, what the truth is. The fact that it hides behind this smokescreen is—(Time expired)

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-03-25,"—by leave—On behalf of the Greens, I oppose the cut-off proposal for the Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme Bill 2003, which is listed in the motion, but I am not going to insist on that. I will put forward our essential opposition when the bill comes before the Senate. The reason why we should not be dealing with this bill is that changes from the original Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme were introduced in 1999, as part of the GST package. Notably, they were to extend the rebate to road transport. The package, including GST rebates for business use of diesel and petrol, increased fossil fuel subsidies by $4.7 billion over three years. That compares with environmental expenditures of $1 billion over the same period, a five to one disproportion.  
At the time the government promised to introduce an energy credits scheme in 2002—last year—to give price incentives and funding to convert from the dirtiest and most inappropriate to the cleanest and most appropriate fuels. That was embodied in the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme Act 1999 and the Democrats produced a discussion paper in 2001. The Energy Grants Scheme in the new bill is, however, simply a slightly streamlined version of the existing legislation and there are no substantial or notable environmental benefits here whatsoever. The government should take this bill back and redraft it to do what it said it was going to do three or four years ago, instead of fostering the burning of fossil fuels.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2003-03-25,"— by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
This report was begun in 1998. It has been a long time coming, which is possibly due to intractable political problems that have beset both the program and the government when it comes to issues of nuclear waste. In his speech, the minister refers to three previous unsuccessful attempts to clean up Maralinga—this may well be the fourth. The minister also makes great play of the claim that this program achieved world's best practice. This is a claim that remains in dispute.
The importance of this claim to the minister is evident when, in the course of his statement, he attempts to explain away the dumping midstream of the preferred in situ vitrification, ISV, process of treating contaminated material for a cheaper reburial option. While he claims the decision was made due to safety reasons, a more convincing reason can be found buried on page 138 of the report—that is, the attraction of adopting an alternative approach that would save the government more than $5 million. That is a significant figure at a time when the program was over budget. In light of the number of versions of this report that I am aware of, I suspect that this report has been politically doctored in an attempt to disguise the government's parsimony as a concern for safety.
At the heart of the government's problem is its overriding concern with cost control at the expense of quality control. It is notable that even today the minister seeks to justify the cheaper alternative by reference to the national code of practice for the near surface disposal of radioactive waste. It sounds impressive, but is it in reality? When it is understood that this code of practice applies to low-level or short-lived waste and not to lethal long-lived plutonium, then government claims in regard to best practice appear increasingly fragile. This is even more evident when one considers that despite the minister's reliance on the certification by ARPANSA of the construction of the burial trenches, neither ARPANSA nor its CEO, Dr John Loy, can produce any report or certificate to substantiate the claim. As I have observed on previous occasions recently, the role of ARPANSA in regulatory matters requires closer scrutiny, especially to ensure that the independence of that agency is not compromised. 
One further issue that ARPANSA perhaps should consider is whether the burial of small quantities of longer-lived radioactive materials is, in fact, in accordance with the government's own paper Safe storage of radioactive waste—the national store project, which, among other things, states that such waste is not suitable for near surface burial. The treatment of contaminated debris on site by burial in shallow trenches leaves potentially hazardous material near the surface. The previous commitments by the minister never to opt out of Maralinga also need to be challenged in this context. The government, as we are well aware, is in the process of seeking a decommissioning licence from ARPANSA prior to handing over the land around the Maralinga site to the traditional owners. Labor believes that, instead, the minister should amend the ARPANS Act to provide an ongoing role for the Commonwealth after the handover.
Maralinga as a test site demonstrates the legacy of bids by conservative governments to seek out and win the approval of great and powerful friends and the lengths that they would go to secure these, irrespective of the social or human cost to the Australian community. In 1954, at the height of the Cold War, the then Prime Minister Robert Menzies agreed to a British request for a permanent site to test nuclear weapons. Seven A-bombs—atomic bombs—were detonated at Maralinga in the late 1950s, while over the next six years hundreds of smaller experiments, using plutonium, uranium and other radioactive materials, were conducted. It now appears that most of the contamination at the site is the result of these smaller, and often clandestine, trials rather than the A-bombs themselves.
The Maralinga Tjarutja Aboriginal people were prevented from entering these lands during the period of the tests and their aftermath. Steps are now in train to return the land to their control. Andrew Collett, the lawyer for the Indigenous people, said:
There's a very, very heavy burden on the community to weigh up how effective this clean-up will be, so the issues include how good is the clean-up, what does that mean in the future, will there be problems in the future, will the proposed burial of plutonium in a deep burial trench last a quarter-of-a-million years, what happens if it doesn't, who's going to meet the cost if it doesn't.
Those are statements he made on ABC Radio on 16 April 2000.
Despite three attempts, there was no effective clean-up conducted by the British nuclear authorities. In fact, the British only succeeded in worsening the problem, by spreading radioactive waste further around the site, as a result of their various botched attempts at a clean-up. Despite this, the British believed that they had signed off on the problems associated with the site. It took a very effective inquiry, initiated by the then Labor government, to demonstrate the ineffectiveness of the British and earlier Australian clean-up attempts, and the need to comprehensively deal with the problems associated with Maralinga.
The report of that inquiry, the Rehabilitation of former nuclear test sites in Australia, was produced by a government appointed technical assessment group, was published in 1990 and has become the benchmark for subsequent rehabilitation programs. As a result of this report and the efforts of the then Minister for Agriculture and Energy, Mr Simon Crean, in December 1993 the British government agreed to pay £20 million to settle Australia's claims and contribute to the rehabilitation of the Maralinga site. The British contribution was anticipated to meet approximately half the costs of site rehabilitation. The effectiveness of Labor's response stands in sharp contrast to the history of blunders that mark the current government's management—or, one should say, mismanagement—of the process. 
Clearly there is a problem in the way in which the government deals with the issue of nuclear waste and the storage and management of the low-level and intermediate level nuclear waste repositories. The selection of a site for a repository for low-level waste was set in train in 1992 under the previous Labor government. The crucial stages of the process of site selection have taken place under the current government. The parameters for the siting of a waste repository were set by the Labor government and included the twin principles of scientific evaluation and genuine community consultation. It is quite apparent that, in the case of the community consultation, this government has neglected its responsibilities to a woeful degree. We have seen the neglect of the Aboriginal community within the region. Now we see a situation in which the people of South Australia are told that they have to accept this new site, and a $300,000 propaganda campaign has been initiated by this government to persuade them that this government knows best.
In addition to its culpable neglect of community consultation, the government has mishandled the process in many other ways. The government has now backflipped on its commitment to release the 667 submissions that were provided to the consultative process the government did establish. This lack of transparency has triggered further problems. The defence department has said that they are not happy with the government's preferred site for a repository—next door to a missile testing range.
The problems with the Maralinga strategy include the government's preference for cost control over quality control. Take, for example, the retreat from the use of in situ vitrification—a process agreed in 1996 to be the best, preferred solution for the clean-up of the material within the various pits within the Maralinga precinct. In 1999, this was dumped in favour of simply reburying the plutonium. The reason was that the government felt that their adherence to the national code of practice for near surface burial was adequate. Quite clearly it was not. It was, in fact, driven by the desire to cost cut at a time when the project was overbudget. What has become patently clear is that the decision to abandon the preferred ISV methodology followed increasing pressure to modify or abandon the process as the costs of treating the contaminated material became larger than anticipated. We are left with a cheap and nasty solution which aimed to save money but which failed to meet the standards adopted at the outset of the rehabilitation process.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-03-25,"—In his statement accompanying this report the Minister for Science says that the Maralinga Rehabilitation Project is something the government can be proud of. I do not think so; at least, I do not think it ought to be proud of its record on this issue. The minister's statement and the 403 pages of this report by the Maralinga Rehabilitation Technical Advisory Committee have not persuaded the Democrats that the clean-up was anything but botched and inadequate. No matter how many reports are produced, the fact of the matter is that 22 kilograms of plutonium are buried in simple unlined earth trenches, some of it just a couple of metres below the surface. The government says, `That is not right—five metres of clean soil was put on top,' but those who were involved say that it was much more like two or three metres in some places.
The government has consistently said that these simple earth burials were constructed consistent with the national code of practice for near-surface disposal of radioactive waste. What it does not admit is that this code of practice is not suitable for—was never designed for, never written for—debris which is highly contaminated with plutonium. Why else would a government—Labor, as it happens—have decided in the first place to vitrify the debris before it was buried? After the explosion in 1999 in one of the pits, this government agreed to drop the process. The minister says that the explosion caused major damage to ISV equipment and the process was discontinued for safety reasons. It just so happens that that decision saved the contractor an enormous amount of money. 
Critics of this government—and there are plenty of them—argue that had the debris been properly sorted to make sure material that was likely to explode had been removed prior to vitrification there would have been no explosion. We still have no explanation about what caused that explosion. The only thing the government knows is that it was enough to stop that process. The minister's statement says the melt blocks were excavated and reburied at greater depth. This is simply not true; the blocks were cracked and broken up and, in so doing, the plutonium was exposed.
The minister says ARPANSA considers that a simple earth burial is a useful benchmark of scientifically acceptable standards for plutonium buried as radioactive waste. This is complete nonsense. The government says the amount of uranium, plutonium and americium buried in trenches at Maralinga is well below the levels allowed in the NHMRC code of practice. Here they have used the oldest trick in the book: they have averaged out the contaminated material and counted in the enormous amount of lightly and noncontaminated material—some 360,000 cubic metres of material, largely soil—that is in the pits.
I understand why the government would want to silence, denigrate and discredit its critics—they have been extremely critical of the government and this process. I am not talking here about conservation groups or the Democrats, who might not be expected to have inside knowledge about the detail of the clean-up or understand the complex technical nature of processes like ISV—vitrification. The people most critical of this botched clean-up are professional people—engineers and the like—who were intimately involved in the process but who can now speak openly and honestly, independent of government and independent of contractors who stood to gain so much from this change in process. The government—the minister in particular—has done its best to vilify these people. The most recent of them is Mr Dale Timmons, who this week was described as a loner by Minister McGauran. The minister said that Mr Timmons's motivation is different from that of the Australian government. Well, yes it is; it is different in respect of Mr Timmons wanting to see that the Australian public are properly informed about this botched clean-up. The minister went on to say:
Mr Timmons, I suspect, has launched a pre-emptive strike—
getting right with the language of the time—
so as to maintain the reputation of his technology and Mr Timmons has a certain motivation, I believe, because his technology exploded.
Wrong, Mr Minister. Mr Timmons has no financial interest in the vitrification process or technology nor in the company that offers this technology. He was a consultant hired to assist with the Maralinga project because of his expertise in high-temperature geochemistry and his experience with vitrification technology.
Mr Timmons thinks the Australian public should be aware of what actually went on at Maralinga. He thinks we have been left with anything but world's best practice. World's best practice is vitrification; it is said to encase and immobilise plutonium for a million years. Not even the United States would consider burying this kind of material in unlined earth pits, and it certainly would not describe it as world's best practice. Some members of MARTAC, the authors of this final report, held the view that the debris should not have been buried this way but, at the very least, should have been encased in concrete. The government says the problem with vitrification, apart from the explosion, was that the blocks were cracked. Mr Timmons, an expert in the field, points out that the blocks should have been allowed to cool naturally over a period of about 12 months but, instead, the contractors uncovered the blocks then drenched them with cold water so that they could take samples. It is little wonder they cracked.
The report is very lengthy at 403 pages, and it is not possible to do it justice in only two hours. However, it is useful to examine the minister's statement. We found it riddled with errors and misleading statements. I hope, in this respect at least, that his statement does not reflect the report itself. Let us go to the second paragraph. The minister says: 
The project achieved its goals and a world's best practice result.
One of the goals of the project was to treat the Taranaki pits by ISV; that was option 6(c). This was not done; therefore, the minister cannot claim that the project met its goals. It is interesting to talk about world's best practice because if you look at the ARPANSA web site, which was apparently written by Geoff Williams from ARPANSA, you will see that he says that terms such as `world's best practice' are `bureaucratese' and `the last resort of scoundrels'. So the minister himself is using this last resort of scoundrels. The minister misquotes the 1985 royal commission, saying it recommended that Maralinga and Emu should be cleaned up so that the land could be fit for habitation by the Aboriginal traditional owners. In fact, it recommended the clean-up be done so that the land could be fit for unrestricted access. This is not what we are left with. The minister says:
The implementation of option 6 (c) would permit unrestricted access to about 90% of the 3200 square kilometre Maralinga site and permit access ...
In fact, this is completely misleading because the area enclosed by the boundary markers is about 450 square kilometres out of a total of 3,200 square kilometres. That is not 90 per cent which is available to unrestricted access—it is more like 86 per cent. Also, the only land that has been added that is suitable for unrestricted access is that cleaned at the TM sites and Wewak, and that area is 0.5 square kilometres. The 1.6 square kilometre cleaned area at Taranaki is within the boundary markers and the Indigenous people have been advised that access is restricted. In other words, very little has actually been added to the land available for unrestricted access. The minister indicates:
The Maralinga Rehabilitation Project was oversighted by the Commonwealth Department of Education, Science and Training ...
Then, two paragraphs down, he says that it was oversighted by ARPANSA. This is just another example of getting it wrong. In fact, ARPANSA was responsible for the regulation, not for the oversighting at all. 
The minister says that one of the problems was that the vitrification process did not melt the steel. It was not meant to melt the steel; in fact, it was meant to encase the plutonium which was coated on that steel. The minister says that it was the 11th melt of the series which exploded. Again, that is wrong; it was the 13th. The minister says no worker received any measurable take-up of plutonium during the clean-up. The draft report said otherwise. It said that two workers received a measurable uptake of uranium.

"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,2003-03-25,"—The Maralinga Rehabilitation Technical Advisory Committee report, Rehabilitation of the former nuclear test sites at Emu and Maralinga (Australia), which has been tabled today, is an extremely comprehensive and detailed document. It runs to some 400 pages. It also contains a compact disc of some additional 6,500 pages of attached documents. The report describes in detail the $108 million clean-up of the former British nuclear test sites in my home state of South Australia. Contrary to everything that Senator Allison has just said, it is important to realise that, as this report very clearly documents, the project did achieve the goals that were set for it and indeed it has been conducted on the basis of the best known technology and best results achievable in the world.
The background to this clean-up is that between 1953 and 1957 the British government conducted nuclear weapons testing at both Maralinga and Emu. Between those four years it conducted what were termed `major trials'; between 1955 and 1963 some additional `minor trials' were conducted, which left the sites contaminated. The British government made three attempts to clean up Maralinga, all of which were unsuccessful. As a consequence of that there was continuing public concern and in 1984 a royal commission was convened by the then federal government into the British nuclear tests in Australia.
Among the terms of reference for that royal commission was a request to make recommendations for the future management and use of the test sites. The royal commission reported in 1985 and recommended that Maralinga and Emu should be cleaned up so that the land could be fit for habitation by the Aboriginal traditional owners and that all costs should be borne by the British government. As a consequence, the Australian government convened the technical assessment group, which consisted of Australian, American and British scientists, to undertake further studies and quantify the health risks posed by the contamination, particularly the health risks posed to the Indigenous population, and to develop different clean-up options for the government to consider. 
The major risk at Maralinga was determined to be the inhalation or ingestion of plutonium-contaminated dust by Aboriginal children living an out-station lifestyle. The technical assessment group developed criteria for the safe rehabilitation of the site, which included that the post-rehabilitation annual dose for individuals would not exceed five millisieverts of radiation. Various rehabilitation options were devised by the technical advisory group to achieve this five-millisievert limit and that report was presented to the government in 1990.
The option among those presented by the technical advisory group that was adopted by the government was that called 6(c) which, as I have already mentioned, was costed at some $104 million in 1994 values and involved a program of scraping up contaminated surface soil and burying it in trenches and treating a number of plutonium-contaminated debris burial pits by in situ vitrification. The British government committed a full and final amount of 20 million towards the rehabilitation of the site. I must say that that is less than might have been expected given the cost of $104 million, given the recommendations of the royal commission and given the fact that this was a British project. Nevertheless, that 20 million went towards that cost of $104 million. In 1994 the government formed the Maralinga Rehabilitation Technical Advisory Committee to provide expert and independent advice to the minister and the department on the main aspects of the project.
From the start the project was inconvenienced by inadequate records from the British tests and the subsequent clean-ups. It is significant that, as a consequence of the inadequate records the advisory committee found at that time, they determined the situation would not persist in relation to their work and they determined to bring together within one document their own report, the final reports from the project main contractors and all relevant supporting papers. That is what we have presented today in this very comprehensive document which runs to some 400 pages and some 6,500 pages in the attached CD of additional documents.
We have here a complete record in relation to the site and the clean-up process that has occurred. That can be drawn on in any future situation in other areas, particularly in clean-ups of a like manner that other countries overseas might need to undertake. It is important that this record is available because the Australian experience will be beneficial internationally in that circumstance. The report describes the state and nature of the contamination, the rehabilitation measures applied, the measured outcomes and future land and environment management issues.
The Maralinga legacy from the British had two major components that required intervention. These were plutonium-contaminated surface soils and plutonium-contaminated debris burial pits. The first stage of the rehabilitation work was the removal of contaminated surface soil from a combined area of more than 2.25 square kilometres, which resulted in the burial of a total of some 360,000 cubic metres of contaminated material in trenches 10-15 metres deep under a capping of at least five metres of clean soil.
The second stage was the treatment of debris burial pits by excavation and burial and by in situ vitrification, a process that involved passing an electric current through electrodes in the ground to melt debris and incorporate the material into a vitrified monolith or glass/ceramic block. Unfortunately, difficulties were encountered applying the in situ vitrification technology at Maralinga and it was decided not to continue with the application of that technology due to safety reasons coupled with the particular difficulties of applying the technology in an isolated area such as Maralinga.  
An important part of the clean-up was worker protection, and it is significant that no workers received any measurable plutonium uptake during the clean-up. The 120-square-kilometre area of lightly contaminated land around the soil removal area was surrounded by boundary markers, signifying to the traditional owners that the land is available for hunting but not for permanent habitation. This has proven to be very conservative. It is important to note that the Maralinga Rehabilitation Project was completed successfully at the major test sites in 2000. In that year the Commonwealth's independent regulator, the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency, confirmed that the clean-up of the major test sites met the standards agreed at the start of the project by the Commonwealth, the South Australian government and the traditional owners— standards which are consistent with international guidelines. ARPANSA has provided a further assessment of the outcomes of the clean-up and, as a consequence of the combined effects of revised dosimetry and a better than expected level of clean-up of residual contamination, the estimated dosage is mostly about one millisievert rather than the five millisieverts which was the original target.
So when Senator Allison says that this clean-up has not been successful, she needs to remember that it has been more than successful. It has achieved levels of one millisievert compared with the five millisieverts which were set as the goal. The rehabilitation has surpassed the standards set at the start of the project, and ARPANSA has found that possible radiation doses are well below those anticipated. As a result, a restricted land use zone is not strictly required. Even though it is kept in place as a conservative measure, ARPANSA has concluded that restriction on permanent occupancy within the restricted land use boundary is purely a precautionary measure. ARPANSA also certified that the burial trenches were constructed consistent with the national code of practice for the near surface disposal of radioactive waste. The project has been successful. As a consequence of that it is hoped that the site will be handed back to the Maralinga Tjarutja traditional owners this year. The contaminated site has been effectively cleaned up. Undoubtedly there will be a need in other parts of the world to similarly clean plutonium-contaminated sites, which will benefit from this experience. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,2003-03-25,"—by leave—I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to Canada and China, which took place from 17 to 30 November 2002. I seek leave to move a motion to take note of the document.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I do so with a great deal of pleasure. I have been on some delegations in the past but I must say that this was one of the outstanding delegations that I had the opportunity to be a part of and to lead. I want to compliment the other members of the delegation: Senator Lees, who was a very earnest and good member of that delegation; together with Mr Lindsay Tanner, who was the deputy leader of the delegation; the Hon. Graham Edwards from Western Australia, the member for Cowan; Mr Gary Nairn, the member for Eden-Monaro; and Mr John Forrest, the member for Mallee. Certainly, they were a wonderful group to travel with and we had a very harmonious visit. All in all, the visit that took place over the period of two weeks to these very important countries was one which was beneficial to all of us as members of the delegation and beneficial to the relationship between those two countries and the Australian parliament and the Australian people.
It was a very hectic program and was designed as such. There were many things that the members of the delegation wanted to do and they had to be fitted into a very short time. We commenced our visit in Ottawa, Canada. From the outset I want to place on record our appreciation of the efforts of the Australian High Commission in Ottawa— High Commissioner Tony Hely, protocol officer Mary Gleeson, and particularly Third Secretary Stacey Morgan, who travelled with us for a considerable portion of that trip. The fact that they were so close by and that they helped us so much with all of the arrangements—which were very well done—to provide us with a varied program and to look after the interests of the people who were travelling I think does them great credit. I want to place on record our appreciation of their efforts. 
It is very difficult to describe just how much we managed to pack into our time in Ottawa and on the rest of the visit. The meetings that we held in a couple of days included one with the Secretary of State (Asia-Pacific), the Hon. David Kilgour, and one with the House of Commons Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade. We had meetings with the Speaker of the House of Commons and visited question time. We met with the National Research Council of Canada and we also had a long meeting in the morning with Health Canada, which I know was of interest to all of us on the committee but particularly to Senator Lees. We had a very extensive briefing which could have gone on longer. We also had briefings by the Aboriginal affairs secretariat.
At the conclusion of our meetings in Ottawa, amongst the other meetings we had, was a great meeting with our counterparts in the Canada-Australia-New Zealand Parliamentary Friendship Group, which was extremely well attended. I cannot remember the exact duration of the meeting, but it was probably an hour and a half. We covered an enormous range of subjects. It brought home to me the importance of parliamentary friendship groups for people with a particular interest in a country. Those members who were there discussed with us a wide range of topics. I think the way that you can have a frank discussion with members of other parliaments in the environment of the parliamentary friendship group is wonderful. So we had a very extensive program in Ottawa itself.
For the final three days of our time, we decided to get some idea of the culture of Canada by visiting Quebec City and the parliament of Quebec province. I think that all members of the delegation would agree that Quebec City was a wonderful highlight of our visit. You may be interested to know that the day before we arrived in Canada they had their first heavy winter snow, so there was snow on the ground all the time that we were in Canada. The train trip from Ottawa through Montreal to Quebec City gave us an idea of the vastness of the countryside. To see it all covered in snow was a particular pleasure to many of us in Australia who rarely have the opportunity to ever see snow, let alone experience the wintry conditions.
Quebec City and Quebec province, because of their uniqueness and French culture, gave us an insight into how the two cultures live together in Canada and some of the difficulties that arise because of it. The expense of having two languages on every single item of produce or the fact that every document that is produced in Canada must be in two languages must be enormous. To see the ancient city of Quebec—where there was first a European civilisation in 1608—and to feel the history, walking the streets of the old French quarter in Quebec City, was a delight. We were hosted by the Quebec provincial parliament. We listened to their question time and they hosted us at lunch. We were able to talk to them about some of the particular problems that they have in dealing with their indigenous people. That was a very productive afternoon. We had a discussion which made us realise that many of the problems that exist in Australia are mirrored in the Canadian situation amongst their indigenous peoples. All in all, it was an outstanding visit to Canada.
The second half of our delegation visit was to China. Once again, I would like to place on record our appreciation of the contribution of the embassy in Beijing and also of Sam Gerovich, the Consul-General in Shanghai, for the final couple of days of our visit. I particularly want to thank Second Secretary Larissa Ashwin, who, with her Mandarin-speaking abilities, made life very much easier for us. She travelled with us to Chonqing and while we were in Beijing. In spite of the fact that it was her daughter's first birthday while we were travelling, she showed tremendous commitment to the delegation. We were very pleased with all of the help that we received from the embassy in Beijing and from the consulate. 
China was a totally different scene from what we had seen in Canada. We went from a country where the people are probably more like us than any other country in the world that I have been to—with the exception, perhaps, of New Zealand—to China, where the culture and customs are totally different. We were fortunate that when we first arrived our program was structured so that we went to Chonqing first. That was one of the highlights of our trip. Apart from the fact that it was where the first Australian diplomat was appointed to China, Sir Frederick Eggleston, who was appointed by the Menzies government in 1941—the embassy was then in Chonqing, which was the capital of old China—Australia has a tremendous amount of aid money flowing into Chonqing, particularly in the area of vocational education and training.
We had a chance to see some of that aid money being put to work. We went to the school where vocational education and training was done and we were treated to a presentation probably unlike any I have ever seen before: students showed us their skills in floral art; some students were training to be hotel staff; and there were people there who were involved in accountancy. There were people there doing all sorts of work, which was a delight to see. I think it is probably fair to say that they were very pleased that we had come to see them, to see just what sort of good work was being done with the aid money that we are pouring into that area of China particularly. That was a chance for us to see China as it was, although it is quite modernised in some areas.
We then moved to Beijing, which has been the capital now for over 50 years. The impression of Beijing that I had in my mind was one of bicycles clogging every roadway, which was all I had ever been taught when I was younger. Those same thoroughfares are now clogged with motor cars and bicycles. We had some wonderful meetings in Beijing, including what finished up being close to a four-hour meeting with the chairman of their foreign affairs committee. That committee had visited Australia last year and we had met a number of them. We were able to freely and frankly discuss anything with them that we wished to.
My time is running short, so I must say briefly that our final visit was to Shanghai. I was staggered by Shanghai, as I think everybody who went would be. Shanghai almost looks like China's equivalent of New York, with its many skyscrapers. In the Pudong district one of our members said that he counted 132 skyscrapers from his hotel window, yet there was nothing there 10 years ago—it was farmland. It was a wonderful delegation, one which I think will give great benefit not only to the members of the delegation who were fortunate to visit those countries and our parliaments but particularly to the people of both nations. All of these delegations are undertaken to promote goodwill and understanding between our countries and, from that perspective, I do think that it was a success.",SENATE,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,<title>Parliamentary Delegation to Canada and China</title>,Delegation Reports,17,1,speech
"Lees, Sen Meg",IND,2003-03-25,"—I rise also to speak on an outstanding report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to Canada and China. At the beginning I must compliment Mr Michael McLean, the secretary to this delegation, who worked extremely long hours. Anyone who reads through this report can see that he has put an enormous amount of detail into the official side of the program. This was the first time that I have been a formal member of a parliamentary delegation and I found it to be a very informative and certainly very worthwhile experience. The delegates themselves were a tremendous group of people. They were very cooperative and supportive when some of us wished to move outside the delegation. For example, I thank Senator Ferguson, as the leader of the delegation, for his support in facilitating my visit to a large hospital when we were in old Quebec city. This gave me quite a good understanding of some of the issues facing them. Indeed, many of the issues facing them are the same ones that we face. But it is always interesting to spend some time looking at how other countries are doing things. I think we can safely say that we are managing the cost of our medications a lot better with our PBS. But, as far as some of the concerns for elderly Canadian citizens, they can teach us a few things. In particular, they have a program which is basically a mentoring system where elderly folk are looked after before they actually need crisis attention. A system of contacts is made if any help is needed. It is taking considerable pressure off their public hospitals as well as being of great benefit to elderly Canadians, who feel far more secure that they will be looked after should they need any urgent or long-term support. 
I will not go through many of the issues that Senator Ferguson has already dealt with. I found the briefings very thorough. Indeed, I do not think there was a briefing where the committee was ready to pack up and leave. Usually we ran over time. The information was certainly very helpful. I found the health briefings—particularly those in Canada but also the information we gained in China on a number of issues—will be of benefit as I move on in my parliamentary career. The extensive travel involved was tiring, to say the least. We flew directly from Australia through the US into Ottawa, where we immediately started our meetings. We travelled on by rail to Quebec and then to Toronto. We then flew to Chicago, straight to Beijing and then on to Chongqing. So we flew from Toronto to Chongqing basically in one hit, with only a few hours stopover here and there. I think that taxed all of us.
Certainly the visit to Chongqing was very useful. I find that it is always useful when travelling to visit some of the aid projects that Australia is involved in. I would recommend to all members and senators that, whenever they travel, whatever delegation they are on, official visit they are making or even perhaps in their own time, they talk to AusAID before they go and take some time to visit some of the particular projects where Australian money is being spent. In Chongqing one project is certainly reaping huge rewards. Young people are being trained for China's growing tourism industry. They took great pride in showing us their many skills and what they were doing. I found the trip to the Three Gorges Dam project very useful. It has been discussed quite a lot here in Australia, particularly some of its environmental impacts. It was very good to hear first-hand why they are undertaking the project, what it will mean and where they are heading.
Perhaps one of the most useful meetings we had in Canada was the meeting with other parliamentarians. We had an hour and a half or more to talk with the Canada-Australia-New Zealand Parliamentary Friendship Group. Many of the issues facing them were rural issues facing us, from land degradation and issues relating to water rights to salinity. Indeed, the book that I was given on land-clearing issues could just as easily have been on western New South Wales or Queensland if you changed a few place names.
In China, the visits to Chongqing and the Three Gorges Dam were very useful, as I said, and so was the briefing that we had with their foreign affairs committee. It probably went on for about four hours in all. A lot of that was confidential, but it was very interesting to discuss with them some of the current issues facing the world, some of the conflicts facing the world and the problems in bodies such as the United Nations. It was interesting to have a first-hand and very frank debate with some of the people at the highest levels of decision-making processes in China. 
I thank the other members of the delegation for their friendship and for a very worthwhile visit, made very pleasant by the very cooperative, supportive and harmonious manner in which everybody worked. I will finish by saying to senators that, if you do get the opportunity to be part of a delegation, I can certainly recommend it. I found it very informative and certainly very worth while.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2003-03-25,"—I rise to continue my remarks from yesterday evening and to remind the Senate that Labor are opposing the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002, which the coalition has brought forward to vary the media ownership laws of this country. We do so knowing that this bill would only further concentrate media ownership in this country, thereby bringing about less diversity and a far lower quality of media content available to Australians.
There are a couple of points I would like to take the opportunity to make today. The first is the issue of localism and its impact on urban or regional areas. There is a growing clamour around the world as regions really yearn to see themselves reflected in both creative content and current affairs content in their news bulletins and their comedy shows. People need to see themselves reflected: it helps our culture develop and it helps us take a healthy attitude towards how people not only see themselves but relate to other cultures. More than anything else what we are observing is a growing demand for local content produced and seen by the audiences in those regions. This is not a backward step in growing parochialism; rather it is about finding the right balance and responding to an imbalance. Many people, particularly in Australia but also around the world, are seeing media content that is far more concentrated, networked and aggregated, and I think there comes a point where people are just uncomfortable about that. 
With this push for greater local content, we are now effectively experiencing a backlash to the distance that is between many in our community and what the networks choose to push out to them in the point to multipoint broadcast method of the traditional media. This issue was the focus of many of the submissions to the Senate inquiry on this bill. Many of those making submissions—in fact, all of the smaller independent broadcasters, radio stations, suppliers of local content—argued vehemently that they felt they would become far more vulnerable to takeover or consolidation or, in fact, going broke if this bill passed, thereby reducing that diversity in their particular community. These issues played a significant role in forming our view, but there were many other issues.
I would like to move to the broader question of why the government persists with these issues. I would like to draw the Senate's attention to an article that was published in Monday's Financial Review by Toni O'Loughlin, which reflected on a leaked cabinet submission that dealt with the issue of digital TV last year. This issue is I think coming to haunt the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts and the coalition on a consistent basis. We have a legacy of cross-media ownership and media policy that has gone from bad to worse under the coalition. Clearly the coalition has been unable to grasp the implications of convergence and learn the lessons in the international market of pay TV, digitisation and terrestrial television as well as the opportunities that exist with datacasting and interactive content as a means by which we increase diversity. Every step of the way the government has effectively locked down behind incumbent media companies in this country and created a regime that preserves their interests in the existing market. I am not saying that these challenges of managing convergence and how the media market is now crossing many more forms of media than it used to are not huge, but there has to be a better way than just throwing your weight behind the incumbent interests.
Australia has a very proud history in the production of quite extraordinary content—I suppose that is the driest description of the wonderful, creative works that we see on our television sets, our movie screens, the Internet and our web sites and hear on the radio and so forth—but that content is something that Australia has even greater potential to develop and grow and take to the world. We already know that Australian produced content, these creative works, are incredibly popular around the world, yet the policies at home stifle that diversity. So you cannot on one hand say that we have these policies to try to stimulate the production of creative content but then create an environment in Australia where it is actually stifled—where there are so few chances for new companies to emerge and actually break into that market with a viable business model, where they can actually make money and go on to grow their own business. And that is exactly where we find ourselves. Indeed, Labor's analysis shows that this bill will create an environment for further consolidation of content and media ownership in this country. In drawing that analysis, we have been informed by many organisations and individuals who made submissions to this inquiry—indeed, the first-hand testimony of some of the smaller independent producers of content, the media organisations—who feel that this bill would make them extremely vulnerable.
I would like to conclude by saying that I understand we are now in a situation where this debate will be adjourned following the second reading. I presume that will give Senator Alston the opportunity to try and woo the votes necessary to salvage something from this bill. But we will conclude on the note that Labor think this bill does not have a future, and we will certainly be expressing that view by voting against the second reading. We will be very interested to watch how the government tries to salvage something of it. ",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (MEDIA OWNERSHIP) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2003-03-25,"—The Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002 would change the regulation of a particularly complex area of legislation. It would change the boundaries we place on Australian media, and specifically television, radio and newspapers. I have found the questions involved in thinking through this legislation particularly challenging. I acknowledge that I have been assisted by the Senate processes, submissions made to the committee and the committee's report. I also want to place on record my thanks to the delegations that have made representations to me both for and against the bill. I thank them for the time and work they put into informing me of their views.
Other senators in this place have similar views to mine on the general outcomes we want from this legislation. I think it would be fair to say that many of us would like to have a simpler and clearer system of regulation which would prevent further media concentration but allow the media industry to expand for the benefit of the general community. Achieving legislation which meets those objectives is the difficult part.
When considering this bill there is a very important question to be asked. It is one that was posed by the Communications Law Centre: what does this bill do to benefit the Australian public? I recognise that it is generally in the commercial interest of media companies to expand, but is it generally in the public interest? I come to this debate with a particular aim in mind and that is to ensure that we have an equitable system of media regulation which enhances the diversity of news services by both protecting against a concentration of resources in fewer hands and ensuring that the market is more open so that new providers can enter and provide other voices. My particular focus is on news because I see the provision of news services as the most important function of media organisations.
I am particularly concerned about how this legislation will impact on my own state—Tasmania. Media organisations are central components of local communities around Australia. Earlier this month I reflected, in a piece that I wrote for the Launceston Examiner, on the importance of media to these communities. I said:
News coverage of local issues and events, in simple community newsletters and newspapers, on radio and commercial television, builds awareness of issues important to all Tasmanians. We rely on news from a variety of sources to be able to participate fully in our community. Local media not only informs and builds awareness—it binds and strengthens a sense of community.
The media is also very important to the operation of a democracy. Without a range of opinions through television, radio, newspapers and other sources, it is hard for us to make an informed judgement about what is happening in our local, state or federal governments. It is also harder for the media to play its role in helping to keep governments accountable to the people.
Because of the important role media organisations play in public debate and in our daily lives, owning a media company is a significant privilege which comes with significant obligations to the community. But, having said that, I have always had a strong interest in television broadcasting standards, quality and content. Television in particular has a very big impact on community standards and more broadly on Australian culture.
In a debate on an earlier broadcasting bill back in 1987, I referred to a second reading speech made in 1956 by Mr Davidson, the then Postmaster-General—I was actually working with the engineering division of the Postmaster-General's Department at the time—who said:
Television stations are in a position to exercise a constant and cumulative effect on public taste and standards of conduct, and, because of the influence they can bring to bear on the community, the business interests of licensees must at all times be subordinated to the overriding principle that the possession of a licence is, indeed, as the Royal Commission said, a public trust for the benefit of all members of our society. 
Forty-seven years after the then Postmaster-General made those comments, I think this is still a central point. Those who own or run media organisations are in a position of privilege and influence. They are members of an unelected elite which is not effectively accountable to the Australian people. It is our job as elected legislators to ensure not only that there are reasonable parameters set for the running of successful media businesses but, much more importantly, that these parameters serve the Australian people.
I have a number of concerns with the bill as it stands. These include the likelihood of a further concentration of media ownership resulting from the legislation, particularly mergers of large media groups; the delegation of decisions on cross-media ownership to a regulatory body, where interpretation of parliament's intentions will become an issue and where monitoring and enforcement of decisions with large media companies would be difficult; and the lack of cross-media ownership restrictions for other media such as pay TV and Internet based media.
It seems to me that under this bill a number of the largest media organisations in Australia would be able to merge and establish substantial cross-media companies. I cannot see how such mergers would be in the public interest when the largest media organisations already have a very large reach in Australia. For example, there is a company in Australia which has almost 70 per cent of the circulation of newspapers in the capital city and national newspaper market. There is a television network which has a potential audience reach of more than 70 per cent of the population. These are very influential organisations, and I would be concerned if they were to become yet more influential by purchasing ownership of other media from other sectors in the same audience areas.
To protect the public interest we need to ensure there is a diversity of media views in local and national markets, and to protect that diversity we need a diversity of owners. I take my thoughts on this point from the Productivity Commission. That commission is best known for its free-market views, so some may be surprised that in its broadcasting inquiry report it takes a bit of a different tack on media ownership. The Productivity Commission found that `the likelihood that a proprietor's business and editorial interests will influence the content and opinion of their media outlets is of major significance' and there is `a strong preference for more media proprietors rather than fewer'. The report concluded that ownership does matter. It stated:
... diversity of opinion and information is more likely to be encouraged by greater rather than less diversity in the ownership and control of the main media.
As I have said, I am also cautious about the delegation of decisions on cross-media ownership to a regulatory body. This is because I am conscious of the difficult role that Public Service agencies play as regulators. Parliamentary intentions can get lost in the journey from the Senate chamber to the regulator's decision. This is not because of bad faith on the regulator's part but because parliamentary policy decisions tend to be implemented by turning them into a procedure or process. If people or companies jump through the right hoops to meet the requirements of the process they then get their licence or approval, and the full implications of what is happening can get lost in the paperwork. I suppose that is where a public interest test can help to focus attention on the full implications.
In addition, I do have my doubts about the ability of already stretched regulators to find adequate resources to properly monitor the restrictions on media companies that are proposed in this bill. In particular, the monitoring of `separate and distinct processes for editorial decision making' seems to me to be a particularly difficult task, which if done properly would involve regular checks on the internal workings of newsrooms.
We have moved in Australia, for one reason or another, to a situation where one dominant provider has almost monopoly control of pay television. I agree that pay television includes a range of news views from content providers like Sky, the BBC and CNN, but I return to the Postmaster-General's comments: 
Television stations are in a position to exercise a constant and cumulative effect on public taste and standards of conduct, and, because of the influence they can bring to bear on the community—
a broadcasting licence is—
... a public trust for the benefit of all members of our society.
I think the influence of pay television—an influence that is expected to grow over time as it competes more successfully with free-to-air television—should also be subject to regulation in this bill. I note it is proposed that there be a review of the operation of the legislation after three years, but by that time the Australian media landscape may have changed irrevocably.
This is not to say that the current legislative framework is without problem. Under the current arrangements, newspaper groups are increasingly sharing resources between their masthead papers. I saw the other day that the wrong masthead was in a particular newspaper—we know what paper it was; it has a number of papers throughout the country. It had the masthead of the originator paper and not of the receiver of the general information.
Under the current arrangements, newspaper groups are increasingly sharing resources between their masthead papers while radio stations in some regions are taking syndicated programming. Media organisations may be restricted in owning too big a slice of media operations in particular markets or licence areas, but in some cases they have a very big reach across Australia as a whole. I would like to be able to support an equitable new approach to regulating the Australian media to fix up some of the problems that have emerged under the current system. I would like to support a system that would allow the Australian media to expand their businesses, without reducing what I consider to be the vital factor of diversity of ownership.
One part of this bill which has not had as much attention as the regulatory mechanisms for media ownership is the foreign ownership issue. I must say that I am not very comfortable with reducing foreign ownership restrictions. Australian media is a very important cultural commodity and I would be concerned to see further foreign ownership of organisations which are so central to the depiction, support and development of Australian culture. However, my decision on this issue depends very much on how I respond to the cross-media ownership aspect of the bill. These two aspects of the bill could have very different effects if they are accepted by themselves or as a package. I would like to consider further the question of the foreign ownership aspect of the legislation when I have come closer to a final position on the cross-media laws.
A range of amendments and alternative proposals have been circulated in the Senate over the past month. Though many of these have very good and attractive aspects, I am yet to be fully convinced by any of the various regulatory schemes that have been floated. I am also not aware of the government's position on some of the proposals that have been put forward. I imagine that the communications minister, Senator Alston, will use his second reading speech to put forward the government's position on these and to detail any proposal that the government may have for amendments. I will consider this new information before deciding how I vote.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (MEDIA OWNERSHIP) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2003-03-25,"—In speaking to the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002 I want to confine my comments to the potential impact of the legislation on regional media markets and the resultant effect on those regional communities. But in doing so, I need to outline the reasons that Labor has for not supporting this legislation. In my view, this legislation is not about regulating cross-media ownership; it is about abandoning government involvement in media regulation. It fits perfectly with the ideology of the government to withdraw from regulation and intervention and to leave markets to their own making. The bill, if enacted, would lead to greatly increased concentration of media ownership in Australia. It would see our media markets subject to an even greater degree of domination by two or three mass media companies and it would threaten the current level of media diversity in Australia, which is a critical element of a vibrant and flourishing democracy. The current cross-media ownership laws were developed by the former Labor government and ensure that no single proprietor can control any more than one major newspaper, television station or radio station in the one location. These current laws have provided a level of media diversity that will be threatened if this bill is passed. 
The government argues, firstly, that the bill is required because pay TV and the Internet have opened up a whole new layer of media diversity. That is certainly so and, speaking again from a regional perspective, the take-up rate of pay TV in regional Australia is certainly higher than that in the city, but that is more to do with the lack of access to free-to-air television than anything else. Pay TV is a luxury. It is only available to those in the higher income brackets. It is also a fact that there is no locally produced content available on pay TV to serve the regional communities that access it. Internet use, too, is essentially national in nature and is produced by existing providers. There are some regional Internet news and content providers, but their influence, to this point, has been very small and in all reality the likelihood of them making a significant impact in the future is limited.
Secondly, the government argues that it is the journalists, not the media proprietors, who determine the flavour of the news. There is little or, I believe, no evidence to support that position. The Australian Broadcasting Authority has produced research which has shown that the ownership of the media outlet is central to determining the viewpoint of the organisation. We all know this as politicians. It is silly for the government to continue to suggest that media owners do not greatly influence the culture and content of a media organisation. The fact is that media owners do influence news and opinion in their media outlet. To legislate on the basis that owners do not shape the news and opinion making output of the media they control is, I believe, both wrong and dangerous.
The government also argues that the Trade Practices Act would exist as an arbiter in ensuring that undue market concentration could not occur. Professor Fels, Chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, has said repeatedly that, for the purposes of the Trade Practices Act, newspapers, television and radio are separate markets. According to Professor Fels, the ACCC would not be alarmed at the notion of a television owner, for example, taking over a local newspaper. If this bill were to be carried, we would see our media environment, which currently consists of six or seven major commercial players, contract to three. Most commentators suggest that these operators would be based around the current three commercial television licences, and media diversity would effectively be halved.
The bill repeals cross-media ownership restrictions in major metropolitan markets. It allows an individual to control a major newspaper, television station and radio station in that same metropolitan market, provided they obtain cross-media ownership exemption certificates from the ABA. These certificates will be granted if the holder of the certificate can demonstrate separate editorial policies, appropriate organisational charts and separate editorial news management, news compilation processes, and news gathering and interpretation capabilities. These so-called editorial separation provisions, I believe, are simply a bureaucratic construct that provides no comfort for the community that true editorial separation could or would occur.
In the committee's report to the Senate, government senators recommended that a version of cross-media ownership be retained in regional areas. They recommended that cross-media ownership in regional areas be limited to no more than two of the three media of television, radio and print. This recommendation has been picked up by the government in respect of regional media markets. The legislation allows media companies to own two out of three of either television, newspapers or radio stations in regional licence areas. By doing so, the government is recognising that the principles of editorial separation will not be an effective policy in regional areas. I would be interested to know why the government thinks that editorial separation will not work in regional areas but will in the city. It recognises that cross-media ownership needs to be limited in regional Australia to maintain diversity, but somehow that principle is not relevant to the city market. The consistency of that argument is lost on me. 
I want to take the opportunity to advise the Senate of what occurred in North Queensland when Southern Cross Broadcasting ceased to broadcast its half-hour weeknight news service in the subregions of Townsville and Cairns, amongst other places in Australia. Southern Cross Broadcasting announced the closure of its newsrooms in Townsville and Cairns on 22 November 2001, citing costs of digital conversion and closed captioning as contributing to the decision and saying that subsidisation of the local news service was disproportionate to the revenue potential in the market. The loss of these two newsrooms resulted in the immediate loss of 20 jobs in Townsville and 12 in Cairns; the loss of the only free-to-air locally produced news service for the area previously serviced by Seven Central, which sourced its news service from Southern Cross Broadcasting; and the loss of the only competitor to WIN news in the coastal region from the area from just south of Townsville to the north of Cairns.
We saw the loss of any alternative to WIN in those two submarkets, but the loss of Southern Cross Broadcasting has left vast areas of northern and western Queensland receiving absolutely no local content at all. Those areas include all of Cape York Peninsula and the Torres Strait, the region extending to Mount Isa and Cloncurry, and most areas south to the New South Wales border. This left WIN as the only provider of local news in North Queensland. As I said, its broadcast footprint is limited to Cairns and Townsville and surrounding communities along the east coast. As a result of community pressure and political pressure, the Australian Broadcasting Authority established an inquiry into the impact of the loss of Southern Cross Broadcasting in our region. In my submission to the inquiry, I said:
There is a very real risk that the quality of the remaining WIN news service will decline with no locally based competition. Competition is a key motivator for the provision of quality services in a market driven economy.
I also said:
Prior to the closure of the newsrooms, there was a healthy rivalry between the WIN and SCB newsrooms in both Cairns and Townsville that I believe drove both networks to deliver a quality local news service.
Sadly, my prediction that we would have a loss of quality in the WIN service has been seen to be true. Constituents contacting my office and also recent letters to the editor in the local paper have noted that WIN television is increasingly producing a news service sourcing stories from areas as far apart as Toowoomba, Rockhampton, the central Queensland area, and Townsville and Cairns and is compiling those stories into one broadcast which they define as a local broadcast. Local people in North Queensland see their regions as being quite separate, and news emanating from somewhere like Toowoomba and viewed in Townsville is certainly not seen as local news in Queensland. It begs the question: what is local?
The Australian Broadcasting Authority responded to the range of submissions and presentations that were made to it as part of its inquiry and has recommended the introduction of an additional licence condition that requires a minimum level of local content and locally produced matters, which have the interesting definition of being `of local significance'. These locally produced documents have to be broadcast into the submarkets, which are not clearly defined in the publication but which I take to mean the current submarkets of, in my case, Townsville and Cairns. These recommendations are not yet in effect, but, given the changed behaviour of the current licensee in the market in producing an increasingly amalgamated news service, it will be interesting—and we will monitor this—to see how the ABA intends to monitor compliance with the new licence conditions. As I said, the ABA response dealt only with the coastal strip and has left the western region for a subsequent report. That matter is still not resolved, and people in western Queensland do not have any local content in news or current affairs at all at this point in time. 
My reason for raising this case study is to underline the need for competition to be maintained in any market, but especially a regional market, to ensure that diversity of views can be delivered to a community. This legislation would allow the amalgamation of, say, WIN television with the Cairns Post or the Townsville Bulletin. It would permit Channel 7 to take over the Mackay Mercury. It is reasonable to predict that, as well as the loss of diversity of opinion, in these regional centres there would be a loss of jobs in media management and for the journalists who work in those outlets. We would also see, of course, a compression of editorial opinion, only to the detriment of our communities.
James Cook University has recently established its journalism degree at the Cairns campus of the university. I can say that our community has seen great benefit from the establishment of this course in the region. One of these benefits was the publication of a supplement in the Cairns Post, entitled `Endeavour news' which, in itself, provided some diversity in the standard print media in the city of Cairns. It is hoped by many that `Endeavour news' will reappear in some form in the future as part of the Cairns media environment. Certainly it would be sad to see less opportunity for the graduates of James Cook University's journalism course to remain in the north and start their careers in journalism. We have seen many local journalists and presenters who have started their careers in regional places like North Queensland and now have significant positions in the national media. Surely it is good for developing an understanding of regional differences in our country when we have people from regional and remote locations joining major bureaux in the capitals.
It is unusual—and I say that it is unfortunate—for the local coalition members and me to ever have an identical view on matters in the north. But, in the instance of the loss of Southern Cross Broadcasting Mr Entsch, the member for Leichhardt, Mr Lindsay, the member for Herbert and I were as one. We all spoke of the loss of jobs and the loss of intellectual capital to our region. We all reinforced the need for competition to remain to encourage the diversity of views in our region. Importantly, we all recognised that the loss of Southern Cross Broadcasting's news service would be of detriment to our constituents. That is why I was quite surprised that neither Mr Lindsay nor Mr Entsch participated in the debate on this legislation in the other place. If enacted, this legislation will deliver exactly the same result as the loss of Southern Cross Broadcasting did: loss of jobs, loss of competition and loss of diversity. I reiterate, though, my reservations about the ability of the Australian Broadcasting Authority to reinstate competitive news services truly based on subregions.
During the debate surrounding the loss of Southern Cross Broadcasting, Mr Lindsay announced that the ABC would reinstate its local news service. According to the Townsville Bulletin in January 2002:
he is confident the ABC will restore a North Queensland television news service at Townsville this year.
It is now 2003 and that has not happened but, be that as it may, it is true that the ABC has bid for the restoration of a regional news service in the north in its triennial funding submission of 2003-06. The costs are not huge—$1.667 million this coming financial year moving up to $2.652 million in 2005-06. It is proposed to be based in Townsville with a footprint north to Mossman, west to Atherton and south to Bowen, and reaching about 400,000 people in North Queensland. It is modelled on the local Canberra based ABC production, but I note the objections from the member for Dawson, Mrs De-Anne Kelly, who said she would only back the submission if it included Proserpine, the Whitsundays, Mackay and Sarina. I understand her desire to have an ABC produced broadcast into that region. It once again reiterates the need for an understanding of the question of what is local.
I congratulate the ABC for recognising the need for diversity in the television market in North Queensland. I support the submission from the ABC and encourage the government to provide the funding in this coming budget. I note the change of tune, however, from Mr Lindsay. From initially advising us that we would have the production in 2002, in January 2003—earlier this year—the Townsville Bulletin stated: 
... the timing of the submission was exactly right as “the real budget process” was about to start.
But then it was intimated that the government would potentially not be able to fund the ABC request, the article noting:
But he said there were many pressures on the budget, including Prime Minister John Howard's fight against terrorism.
Sadly, North Queenslanders are used to Mr Lindsay changing his position on a whole range of matters.
I understand that independent senators have been in discussion with the government about a range of potential amendments to the bill. I urge caution in proceeding along this path, as the negotiations and agreements made may overlook or even deal out regional needs. I especially encourage Senator Harris, who, as he is based in North Queensland and took an interest in the events, witnessed the demise of Southern Cross Broadcasting's news service and the consequent loss of jobs, competition and diversity. I ask him to look carefully at the intent of the bill as it stands and to acknowledge that any amount of amendment will not change the fundamental premise of the bill—that is, increased concentration of media ownership in regional Australia will ultimately lead to less diversity of views to the absolute detriment of those communities. This legislation is not good public policy. It is not good for those who live in the cities and, despite the changes, it is not good for regional Australia. I encourage all senators to defeat this legislation at the second reading stage so as not to open the door even a crack to the loss of competition and diversity in our media environment.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (MEDIA OWNERSHIP) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2003-03-25,"—I would like to say a few words about the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002 tonight, with particular reference to the findings of the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee's inquiry into the bill, which I chaired. Most importantly, I would like to say that, in the light of all the evidence put before it, the government members of the committee came to the view that the actual impact of the changes proposed in the bill to the regulation of cross-media ownership will not be great given the likelihood that around 90 per cent of Australians will continue to have access to three commercial television channels plus the national broadcasters. Also, there will continue to be a diversity of press and radio.
As I said, that would be the case for 90 per cent of the Australian population, so it is reasonable to say that the changes will not be great if the bill is passed. The most important change will be to allow foreign investment in the Australian media industry. The government members of the committee were persuaded of the benefits that would result from lifting restrictions on foreign ownership for media companies, advertisers and consumers, bearing in mind that foreign investment in the media will still be regulated under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 and Australia's general foreign investment policy. The repeal of restrictions on foreign investment will, in the view of the committee, provide opportunities for access to global capital, resources and expertise for Australian companies, as well as possibilities for Australian expertise to be promoted and advanced internationally.
As for fears that an increase in foreign ownership will lead to less local content, it is important to bear in mind that Australian audiences have been shown consistently to have a marked preference for locally produced programs. One could therefore say that there is a commercial imperative for broadcasters to include Australian content in their programming. In relation to that, it is crucial to note that this bill will in no way alter the existing Australian content rules. Any concerns about a diminution of locally produced programming as a result of this bill are unfounded.
Senator McLucas made the rather broad statement that the bill would end the cross-media rules. However, that is not actually the case. Schedule 2 of the bill relates to the cross-media rules. The bill does not abolish the cross-media rules but instead proposes the granting of exemption certificates, subject to the application of a public interest test administered by the Australian Broadcasting Authority. The government members of the committee came to the conclusion that reforming cross-media ownership in this manner will permit the generation of synergies, allowing for a more efficient media industry with enhanced economies of scale which will ensure better quality and more diversity of content for consumers. 
An issue raised in this debate, in particular by Senator Lees, is the question of a broad based public interest test, which was something the committee considered. In considering the need for a broad based media specific public interest test, the government members of the committee posed the question of what such a test would, if introduced, seek to achieve. It was concluded that such a test would firstly need to maintain diversity of ownership and opinion in the media, as well as preserve Australian content at levels acceptable to the community. Having established these objectives, consideration was then given to what the situation in the media would be if this bill became law, and whether or not there was any specific threat to the protection of the public interest in terms of these objectives. The government members concluded that the public interest is protected by the editorial separation requirements administered by the Australian Broadcasting Authority, the preservation of the concentration rules and the retention of the rules regarding Australian content and that a broad, media specific public interest test is therefore not required. 
The A.T. Kearney study into media ownership restrictions in Australia found that, even in the extreme case of consolidation of ownership into a single company of the dominant newspaper, television and radio groups currently owned by News Limited, Publishing and Broadcasting Limited— PBL—and Austereo, the estimated relative influence of such a company, as measured by the market share of national metropolitan consumption of daily news would, when averaged, be relatively unchanged. Moreover, such a scenario would see the maintenance of at least three other major media groups, in addition to the national broadcasters, and the percentage reach likely to be achieved by the consolidated company would still be less than the total of that achieved by all other companies. From the Kearney study it is quite obvious that these proposals are not going to result in a great concentration and consolidation of Australian media ownership.
However, the government members of the committee came to the view that it would further protect the public interest if there were a requirement that a commercial interest be disclosed in the context of any article or editorial comment where co-ownership exists under a cross-media exemption, when one co-owned media outlet made editorial comment about another in the same locality. That is another means of protecting diversity and identifying vested interests.
Some organisations raised concerns about the editorial separation requirements of the bill, especially that they would allow for undue intrusion into the operations of media companies by the Australian Broadcasting Authority and facilitate government intrusion into the freedom of the media. The government members of the committee felt that these fears were quite unfounded and were convinced that the ABA would act both responsibly and appropriately in administering the editorial separation requirements, and rejected the view that these requirements would be the `thin edge of the wedge' in facilitating government intrusion into the freedom of the media. It should be remembered that the Commonwealth, of course, already has the power to regulate newspaper organisations under the Corporations Law.
Senator McLucas has just raised the issue of the regional media and its requirements. The government members of the committee addressed the problems of the regional media in their report and acknowledged the special problems faced by regional media, particularly their higher operating costs and lower revenue base in comparison with their metropolitan counterparts. Regional media companies, for example, often have to operate over large, sparsely populated areas. On top of their higher operating costs, regional media have to contend with lower advertising revenue than metropolitan media.
In relation to cross-media holdings of regional media and concerns that undue concentration of ownership could occur in regional Australia, the government members recommended that the bill be amended so that cross-media exemptions in regional markets could only be allowed for proposals that could result in a media company having cross-ownership in only two of the three generic categories of newspapers, radio and television in their area. 
I believe that the concerns that have been expressed about the impact of this bill have been very largely unfounded. I have no doubt in my mind that the conclusions of the Senate legislation committee that the changes proposed by the government are only modest and will not have a great impact are quite justified. These proposals would not only protect and preserve editorial independence and media diversity in both metropolitan and regional areas but also protect and preserve the public interest through the retention of the concentration rules and the Australian content rules. The chief impact, as I said, would be to permit foreign investment in the Australian media, which would have the beneficial effect of injection of new capital and players into our media scene. I trust that the Senate will pay due regard to the benefits that this bill proposes and permit its passage.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (MEDIA OWNERSHIP) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2003-03-25,"—The Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002 is a very important piece of legislation. The purpose of the bill is to amend the Broadcasting Services Act to remove controls on foreign ownership of television—both for free-to-air and pay TV—and newspapers, to provide for exemptions to the cross-media rules in certain circumstances and, with some of the suggested changes, to try and maintain media services, particularly newspapers and radio in rural or regional areas, by applying a two-out-of-three ownership requirement. The current cross-media ownership rules are governed by both the Broadcasting Services Act and the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act. I will take a few moments to quote from the objects of the Broadcasting Services Act, which are under section 3. Section 3(1) says:
(a) To promote the availability to audiences throughout Australia of a diverse range of radio and television services offering entertainment, education and information; and
(aa) to promote the availability to audiences and users throughout Australia of a diverse range of datacasting services; and 
(b) to provide a regulatory environment that will facilitate the development of a broadcasting industry in Australia that is efficient, competitive and responsive to audience needs; and
(c) to encourage diversity in control of the more influential broadcasting services; and 
(d) to ensure that Australians have effective control of the more influential broadcasting services; and
(e) to promote the role of broadcasting services in developing and reflecting a sense of Australian identity, character and cultural diversity; and
(f) to promote the provision of high quality and innovative programming by providers of broadcasting services ...
It goes on to say:
(g) to encourage providers of commercial and community broadcasting services to be responsive to the need for a fair and accurate coverage of matters of public interest and for an appropriate coverage of matters of local significance; and
(h) to encourage providers of broadcasting services to respect community standards in the provision of program material; and
(i) to encourage the provision of means for addressing complaints about broadcasting services ...
I have serious concerns that the bill, if allowed to pass in its current form, along with some amendments that the government has proposed, would not in any respect seek to achieve the objects as set out in the Broadcasting Services Act. We have to very seriously consider what we are proposing to do with regard to this piece of legislation. The potential for a further significant concentration of media ownership in this country worries me deeply. I am not going to entertain that proposition. I believe in what the Broadcasting Services Act says and I believe that we can change the media governing rules, in terms of the cross-media rules of this particular act, to the extent that it will allow some flexibility for existing players in the field and, indeed, encourage new players to come into the game without allowing a significant concentration. 
I also have grave concerns about the Trade Practices Act and its application in respect of not only cross-media or media ownership but also its general application. I make it quite clear here and now that the Trade Practices Act, particularly sections 46, 50 and 4, has to be addressed. I am not saying that those sections have to be addressed within this bill, but the government must put down a program for addressing these issues. If and when—maybe it is just `if' at this point in time—this bill does proceed in a way that members of the Senate can agree upon then the operational date for the bill, from my point of view at least, will be governed by the government's action with respect to the Trade Practices Act in particular.
One of the issues that I have concerns about is that, if we see a further concentration of ownership, we stand to lose diversity, services, jobs and plurality of ownership, which really goes without saying. I have had some discussions with the government, which I am grateful for, about some of the concerns I have had. We are continuing to discuss those, but I make it very clear that they are very serious concerns. I have pursued the issue of what constitutes a platform or a medium within media with regard to pay TV because I believe pay TV should be included in the mix and that, rather than having three mediums of media delivery in this country, we in fact have four. 
I will go briefly to the pay TV issue and why I have the view that it ought to be included in the mix. The penetration rate of pay TV within the Australian market currently stands at about 21 per cent. It generates about $1.2 billion in revenue. If we look at what has happened elsewhere in the world with the growth in pay television and its capacity to have influence within the media market, we see that in the UK it is around 41 per cent. It is estimated that it will be about 42½ per cent by the end of this year and that it will grow to 55 per cent during the course of the next 10 years. There is regulation of pay TV in the UK and it falls under the Office of Fair Trading.
But I believe that here, because of the circumstances particularly as to the players involved, we have to look at how we can manage a program where we will just not see one of the two major players now in the media game in this country. We know that News, through Murdoch, is essentially the biggest news media player in the world. I do not see why we need, in what is a relatively small market in Australia, to give Rupert Murdoch and News an even greater say. If there were a public interest in doing that, yes you would consider it. But there is the fundamental question: what is the public interest in allowing that to happen? Nobody has yet told me what that public interest is. I believe there is a public interest in looking at the current media laws with a view to changing them to actually seek out the objectives of the Broadcasting Services Act. We have had some discussion about how that might occur. I have the view that pay TV should be included in the mix. I also have a view as to the minimum number of commercial voices. If you take account of including pay TV in the mix and if you then have a regulation that says no single media owner could own more than two of four mediums, there would be six minimum commercial voices in the marketplace. That would exclude a newspaper that would fall outside the Broadcasting Services Act definition of a newspaper.
Radio and smaller newspapers are of particular importance to regional areas of this country. We have the concentration rules that remain in place essentially as they are, even if you pass the bill as it currently stands— that is, there will continue to be a requirement for there to be three separately owned TV networks. But that does not mean that you will continue to have three TV networks, because in the world of competition, as has been the UK experience, if some TV networks get significantly stronger than others, the others wither and die; the question of ownership becomes irrelevant. So it is important, as I said at the outset, that whatever we do here is right. Pay TV is particularly important because we know that News owns essentially the only pay TV channel in Australia. 
What is also very worrying is the issue that goes to third party access to the platform, because we have Telstra and Foxtel involved and there is a serious question of whether or not Telstra ought to be involved in that deal at all. I have heard people say that it is too difficult to unscramble the eggs now—maybe, maybe not. We have the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission actually looking at some of these issues, yet we are not aware of what they might be suggesting. That also worries me a little bit because we may be in a process of putting down laws that could in some part be redundant when we get a report from the ACCC. 
If you look at the potential influence that can have, being in a position of control, particularly when it comes to bidding for sports programs and movies et cetera, is an important part of competition in this game. It is important that, if we are to have three television networks, we at least try to ensure that they can compete somewhat equally for these things and that one or two do not end up with a significant advantage over the third. I think they are fundamentally important points.
Pay TV in Canada is interesting from the point of view of competition. No matter what we do with these cross-media ownership rules, the market remains the same. There will not necessarily be more advertising dollars with pay TV. We are not going to increase the market. The market remains the same. When we are talking about new entrants, we have to look at all these things such as the capacity of one player versus another being in a much stronger position and the issue of anticompetitive behaviour. Canada is interesting because in part it tells the story of the effect of pay TV on competition. In 1992, the viewership of conventional free-to-air TV in Canada was 65 per cent, and it fell to 50 per cent by 2001 with the advent of pay TV. It is clear that it experienced change. It is obvious that when you change viewership from free-to-air TV that will affect the capacity to attract advertising. We need to move very cautiously in this area.
I have also pursued the issue of the public interest test. I noted with interest Senator Eggleston's comments with respect to the majority committee findings and views that he expressed in his speech. If you look at the situation that currently applies under the Trade Practices Act and under the Broadcasting Services Act in respect of markets, and the application of the definition of a market that is applied by the ACCC—I hope I do not misrepresent what they are saying— the ACCC view radio, television and newspaper markets as separate markets for the purposes of competition. They indicated to the committee—I think Senator Eggleston chairs that committee—that, if you remove the cross-media ownership rules, that may not stop greater concentration of media assets. The fact that the public regulator is raising concern in that way is something that needs to be noted.
What is the public interest if we allow News, Murdoch or Packer to consolidate significant assets in Australia? Where is the public interest in that? It is difficult for me to see it. But I think there is a public interest in the changing nature of media delivery, in the technology associated with media, in the laws that govern it and in the new laws that will enable the delivery of better services, more services and more diverse services. That is important from the point of view of the public and I think this is a very important piece of public policy legislation. I will continue to try and work through the issues. I believe that it may be possible to get to a point where agreement can be reached in regard to legislation that will work towards the objectives of the Broadcasting Services Act.
Of fundamental importance are the two points with regard to the Trade Practices Act and what constitutes a media form. I have a very strong view at this point in time that pay TV is a player in the game. I understand the points that have been made to me with regard to the influence of pay TV but, if you look at what has happened in other countries, you will see that they do have an influence. I understand that with regard to news, which I suppose is the opinion-forming aspect of a media service provider, they often purchase their news programming from elsewhere. That is fine but, at the end of the day, they can still have an influence and they do not have to buy their news from anyone they do not particularly like. Insofar as this bill is concerned, we are a long way from reaching agreement but that is not to say that agreement cannot be reached. I hope that, if we do have a bill to debate in this parliament, it is one that will deliver the sorts of outcomes that I believe are in the public interest and in the interest of media consumers in this country.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2003-03-25,"—I rise to make some brief comments on the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002 and, in particular, to finish some of the comments that Senator Conroy sought to make last night. I want to consider in greater detail the Senate inquiry into the bill. There has been a lot said about the background to this bill and the implications of it, but I want to focus particularly on the Senate inquiry and what happened there. I think it is worth recalling that inquiry because it was particularly damaging for the government. What emerged from the inquiry was that the only people who support this bill are the media proprietors themselves. The consumer groups, journalists, unions and independent observers who appeared before the inquiry all canned the bill. Derek Wilding from the Communications Law Centre submitted that the editorial separation provisions represented a de facto repeal of the cross-media ownership provisions. The general consensus was that the bill would lead to a reduction in media diversity to the detriment of the Australian community.
Despite the absolute canning the bill received in the Senate inquiry, the government majority on the committee breathtakingly decided to persist with the bill. But there was one important recommendation—a recommendation which ultimately blew out of the water the whole rationale for the bill we are debating this evening. Government senators recommended that a version of cross-media ownership be retained in regional areas. They recommended that cross-media ownership in regional areas be limited to no more than two of the three versions of television, radio and newspapers. 
This was a major embarrassment for the government. This was effectively a tacit admission by government senators of the enduring importance of cross-media ownership laws. It was also an admission that the editorial separation provisions of the bill provide no real protection from the effects of a more heavily concentrated media ownership. The fact that the government incorporated this recommendation into the bill as amended shows what a farcical exercise the passage of the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002 has become. Labor says that, if regional Australia warrants a degree of special protection from the deleterious effects of this bill, so does urban Australia. The Senate can now protect all Australians from the effects of this bill, not just regional Australians.
Last month, there was a letter to all independent senators from the Australian Centre for Independent Journalism, the Australian Consumers Association, the Friends of Fairfax, the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance, the Communications Law Centre and leading academics in media and law throughout Australia. The letter urged independent senators to block this bill. These people of serious repute have grave reservations about the effects of this bill on media diversity. Their considered view is that the bill encourages concentration rather than diversity and is at odds with the diversity objectives of the Broadcasting Services Act.
Labor is opposed to this bill. This bill is bad for media diversity and ultimately bad for our democracy. If enacted it will lead to a massive concentration of media ownership in Australia. It will see the emergence of three dominant media players based around our three commercial television licences. This bill is bad public policy. It undermines one of the key objectives of the act it seeks to amend—media diversity. The editorial separation regime effectively repeals the cross-media ownership provisions, has sinister connotations with regard to the freedom of the press and is quite possibly unconstitutional. 
The vote on this bill is of the utmost importance to the future of the media in Australia. This vote cannot, and should not, be taken lightly. Passing this bill will see momentous changes in media ownership in this country. It will see fewer owners and less diversity. Senators must ask themselves: is this a good thing for Australian democracy? Any reasonably minded senator would have to answer no to that question. Labor implores the Senate to act in the interests of all Australians and defeat this bill. Our democracy deserves a diverse media. ",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (MEDIA OWNERSHIP) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2003-03-25,"—I rise to comment on the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002. The issues relating to cross-media ownership and the laws that govern it have in the past led to heated public and political debate. If we look at the current structure of the industry within Australia, we see that PBL owns the top ranking television network, Channel 9, as well as a large stable of news, women's and other magazines. The Murdoch companies own our country's only daily national newspaper—the Australian— plus dailies in nearly every capital city which are, in some cases, the only daily newspaper. Companies run by the two media barons and their sons, James Packer and Lachlan Murdoch, are also equal shareholders in the pay TV group Foxtel. 
To have a balanced overview of the position of the Australian media enterprise, we need to take a few things into account. If we start by looking at PBL and its associations, we see that PBL through a 100 per cent owned company White Whale Pty Ltd owns 50 per cent of ninemsn. If we look the other way, PBL owns 50 per cent of Sky Cable. Sky Cable itself is also 50 per cent owned by News Limited. If we look at the relationship between Sky Cable and Foxtel, we find that Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd and News Limited, through owning Sky Cable, also own 50 per cent of Foxtel. If we look at Telstra's influence in our media industry—and this is one entity that, to a large degree, tends to be overlooked in respect of the importance of their place in the market—Telstra owns 50 per cent of Foxtel. Telstra also owns 100 per cent of BigPond, and there is an alliance between BigPond and ninemsn. So there is this interactivity between the players in the marketplace.
Apart from those entities, we have the two government run TV and radio outlets—that is, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and the Special Broadcasting Service, SBS. The only significant media company not in the grip of PBL or Murdoch is Fairfax Holdings. That company are the publishers of the Sydney Morning Herald, the Melbourne Age, the Australian Financial Review and a few remaining regional newspapers.
So why did we need to maintain restrictions on media ownership in the past? They were necessary to ensure that Australians had access to a choice of voices and opinions. It was critical that there was diversity in what was available for us to read, hear or see in the media. Many Australians share the view that the present concentration of media ownership is already too high and some propose that it should be further restricted. I believe that there is another aspect that is more important than the diversity of ownership, and that is the diversity of content. Because what we interested in? Are we really interested in the ownership of these entities, or are we to focus on what I believe is the real issue, and that is the content in our newspapers and on our radios and pay TV? The concern is for plurality: we need to focus on the diversity of the content that comes out of these media entities.
Australia introduced cross-media rules in 1987. Rules restricting cross-media ownership also exist in other countries. However, in 1986 both the UK and the United States made substantive changes to their cross-media laws which resulted in less diversity and a greater concentration of ownership. It would appear that the government is also looking at similar proposals. Rapid advances in communications technology in recent years have seen technical conversion of separate forms of the media. This conversion also makes it desirable for major players in the media industry to implement a strategy that ensures they have relative interests across the various forms of the media. There is an increasing trend for players in the media industry to develop and invest in multimedia integration. In addition, the globalisation of telecommunications has seen a move towards the establishment of global media empires. Globalisation of communications is therefore the main rationale for changes to cross-media ownership laws. 
Australia's foreign ownership restrictions are found in the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 and in government policy announcements on permitted levels of foreign ownership. Foreign ownership in television broadcasting is regulated separately under the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. While there are no media specific regulations of foreign investment in radio and newspapers, television ownership is far more restricted. At present a foreign person must not have control of an Australian television broadcasting licence nor hold company interests exceeding 15 per cent. Two or more foreign persons must not have company interests exceeding 20 per cent. These limits of 15 and 20 per cent relate to control in the conventional corporate sense of voting shares or directorship. A foreign person is a foreign citizen who is not ordinarily resident in Australia unless that person has been in Australia for 200 days in the previous 12 months, but there is no legal requirement for that person to remain in Australia. The cross-media rules and specific issues of foreign investment in television are also matters for the Australian Broadcasting Authority.
The Foreign Investment Review Board advises the Treasurer and, apart from the publication of broad statistics and guidelines, the deliberations of the board are confidential. This system has been highly criticised and called to public account on many occasions. The Senate Select Committee on Certain Aspects of Foreign Ownership Decisions in Relation to the Print Media said of the Foreign Investment Review Board in 1994:
It may not surprise that the committee did not discover an accountable, open body which consults widely on foreign investment matters. Instead, it found an informally constituted group with an excessive preoccupation with secrecy in its dealings with applicants and parliamentary committees.
If we look at what the government is proposing, it is unlikely that the government wishes to retain the status quo with foreign ownership, given the changes that have happened in the US and the UK.
Three areas of concern that I have in relation to the legislation emanate from an issue that Senator Murphy raised recently, that is that a finite amount of money is spent in the media industry within Australia. I believe acquisitions would create the greatest problems in relation to this issue, because if you have an acquisition it has to be funded from within the existing industry budgetary constraints. Therefore, one of the only ways that could be achieved would be through the centralisation of services.
I believe centralisation of services would ultimately lead to loss of employment—and we are not talking just about rural or regional areas; this would happen in the major city areas as well. The other danger is the loss of local content that would come as a result of that centralising of services. There is an interesting way in which the United States radio broadcasting industry has addressed this issue and that is as a licence condition. The licensee is required to provide to the broadcasting commission evidence of how it has raised funds for local entities within the footprint of its broadcasting area. Requiring that as a licence condition means that that radio station needs to maintain direct contact within the area that it broadcasts through. I believe that if the industry does require centralising of services for economic benefit then that would be one way within Australia that we could guarantee that we would retain local content and local contact with those entities.
One Nation believes that pay TV should be an assessable sector when the ACCC is required to look at either a purchase or merger situation. It would be preferable that that be contained within the legislation; however, I am mindful that that may not be achievable and we may need to rely on some form of regulation or departmental instruction. If an acquisition or merger triggered a national interest test then One Nation believes that the ACCC should be required to look at the impact of that merger or acquisition on all aspects of the industry, including that of pay TV. Because of the interests I mentioned earlier of Telstra—I did not mention Microsoft but they are involved in that as well—with BigPond, I also think that it would be ideal for the ACCC to take into consideration the influence of the Internet in relation to that assessment. 
Regarding the rationale for the inclusion of pay TV in the cross-media rules, the regulation of media in the Broadcasting Services Act is based on power to influence, so the more influential the medium the greater the degree of regulation required to protect the public interest. The more pervasive, the more prominent, the entity is, then—according to the Broadcast Services Act—the greater the degree of regulation required to protect public interest. Looking back to 1992, pay TV did not exist when the Broadcasting Services Act was legislated. Eleven years later it is as pervasive and persuasive as most radio stations and newspapers in Australia. We need to focus on that aspect.
The way to control market dominance in pay TV is through the carriage of the platform, that is, the ownership of the satellites, the cable or the set-top box, and through the control of the content, that is, the programming. Pay TV has in excess of 1.5 million subscribers. It generates $1.2 billion annually. That is more revenue than a single TV station. Pay TV is viewed by one in four Australian households, and it is interesting to note that that is 10 times the penetration factor of the Australian or the Australian Financial Review newspapers. Pay TV has a greater ability to influence and be pervasive in the market than the Australian or the Australian Financial Review. Foxtel is the dominant pay TV operator in Australia. Optus is gradually exiting the industry following its recent programming deal with Foxtel, and Austar has been acquired by CHAMP, a venture capital company that recent media reports speculate is linked to Foxtel or News Corp. So, again, we have this concentration back into these entities.
Other issues have been raised by other players in the media industry. The Australian Association of Independent Regional Radio Broadcasters in a letter to me and, I would assume, all other senators state:
The members of this association, comprising 53 regional commercial radio services spread over States, the ACT and the Northern Territory, are strongly opposed to any relaxation of the cross-media ownership restrictions which currently apply in regional areas.
They go on to say:
While it might be argued that the government's new proposals for cross-media ownership in regional areas are an improvement on its earlier proposals, they still fail to offer any improvement over the existing regime. Instead, they pose a threat to the public interest and to private interests of small, independent media such as are represented by our members.
The procedures set out in the Bill with a view to preserving editorial separation and independence are a tacit admission of the risks which are inherent in any relaxation of the cross-media ownership restrictions, and the complexity of those procedures raises serious questions about their efficacy. 
So there has been a diverse number of entities throughout the industry who have raised issues in relation to the legislation. When looking at the controls and regulations, particularly if they are to remain with the ACCC, they need to look at the actual impacts of mergers not just in one sector but in relation to the ability to influence or compound decentralisation in other sectors of the media.
I would like to briefly speak about the communication bill that is now before the United Kingdom's upper house. The bill itself has 399 sections plus 19 schedules. It comprises 559 pages of legislation that will bring together the legislation that at present is contained in about eight different acts. If it is passed in this form, the legislation will bring into existence a new government department called the office of communications. I believe that is where the improvement lies in the proposed English model— not the model that is there now but what they are proposing. They are proposing to bring the entire media, telecommunications and their gambling industry under one entity, one piece of legislation, administered and overseen by that department. I believe that would be an improvement. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (MEDIA OWNERSHIP) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2003-03-25,"—I heard Senator Murphy's contribution on the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002 and I thought he put his finger on the critical issue that confronts the Senate—and indeed anyone interested in debating these issues—and that is to identify the public interest in these proposals. In order to properly do that, you have to have regard for the way in which the media has evolved in Australia in recent years and how it is evolving internationally.  
At the moment the media in Australia operates within a legislative straitjacket. It was introduced in 1987 and, if anyone has followed the history of that cross-media debate, they will know that it was conceived in malice by the Prime Minister of the day, who had very specific political objectives and it had very little, if anything, to do with seeking to promote diversity. I thought Senator McLucas actually gave a very good example of how the current straitjacket is operating. She told us how Southern Cross had withdrawn its television news services shortly after the last election. Those who are following the game would know that some six months earlier Prime Television had done the same in a number of regional markets. 
You ask yourself: how is that happening? The first thing to be said is that it is happening under the current regime. Why is it happening? It is happening because the opportunities to expand are very constricted by the current regime. What we really want in this country is a system that is sufficiently flexible to encourage new investment, to attract new players and to provide greater opportunities for the existing players. It might be fashionable to think of two or three major players, but in fact in this country you have quite a significant number of different operators, whether it is APN, Austereo, Village Roadshow, who have significant interest in that company, or whether it is Rural Press, Cumberland Press, News, PBL, Channel 7, Channel 9, Channel 10, DMG, RG Capital— the list goes on. There are a very significant number of media players in this country already. 
If you compare it to a place like the UK, we have a much healthier media regime. In fact what they are looking at in the UK at the moment, given that the BBC has a bit under 50 per cent of the audience reach in terms of terrestrial free-to-air, is a commercial player, a single commercial operator, that is pretty much on its knees and yet has the commercial sector pretty much to itself. That is a very unhealthy outcome of their approach.
Whereas in this country we have laws that of course would remain in place that say you cannot own more than one television station in a market, you cannot own more than two radio stations in a market and you cannot exceed the 75 per cent audience reach limitation. That means by definition that you will continue to have multiple players in all markets. It will vary from place to place. Obviously in some regional areas you will have maybe only one commercial radio station. Whereas in the larger capital cities you will have maybe six or eight commercial players. So it is hard to have a one-size-fits-all approach. But you can have minimum guarantees put in place, and that is what Senator Murphy was referring to when he talked about the minimum number of voices, which is the model the UK is in a process of adopting. 
They are adopting that because they have decided to discard their former—what we might call—media specific public interest test, which they found was overwhelmingly subjective. It had any number of criteria, which left it up to the regulator of the day to come to whatever decision it chose and then to rely on any one of those criteria to justify the outcome. I think they quite rightly said that that is not a transparent regime; you have no certainty in advance; it is largely a matter of whim. You are much better to look at what you are trying to achieve to ensure that you have a minimum number of voices in a market. That is a country that has three times our population, but it regards three plus the BBC as being a sufficient number of voices in the market.
I think we can do a lot better in this country. For a start, we have two national broadcasters. We should also remember that you cannot force commercial players to invest or expand. It is always said: `We haven't got enough media proprietors. We haven't got enough newspapers. We should have more; we've got less.' None of that is within the control or gift of government. If newspapers are not prospering, they go to the wall. There is no way you can force someone to set up a media company. But if you relax the foreign ownership rules on print, for example, there is every prospect that you might get a significant degree of interest from a number of players. 
One media proprietor from Spain has been looking at this market for some years but will not come in under a rule that says you cannot own more than 25 per cent. That is perfectly understandable. If you are making, in some instances, multibillion dollar investments, the last thing you want is not to have full control over your asset. There is every prospect that you will get companies like Pearson, which owns the Financial Times and the Economist. You may well get a number of companies from the US that would have a much renewed interest in media activities in this country. That in itself provides competition and the prospect of new players.
So it is important to remember that what we might want on the one hand and what is commercially achievable on the other are determined very much by the regime you put in place. That is why I thought Senator McLucas's example was a classic—because these people have been withdrawing services because they have nowhere else to go. They cannot expand their businesses because of the constraints of cross-media ownership rules, so what do they do? They focus on cost cutting. Cost cutting is not a sign of an industry that is prospering; it is a sign of an industry in decline. That is why public interest is critically important in introducing flexibility into the system, in enabling new players to enter and in enabling existing players to expand their operations. That is all within the context of the objects of the Broadcasting Services Act. That remains the governing charter at all times.
I think it is also fair to say that some people have talked about pay television having an increasing influence on the shape of the media landscape. But the first point to make is that pay television is overwhelmingly an entertainment medium. However, in this country, where Foxtel is effectively providing services as an operator to telecoms and other carriers, there are some six news channels. That in itself is a sign of great diversity. We did not have any of that in 1987 when these rules were introduced. So ask yourself: do we want to constrict that? Do we want to somehow say that if you own a television station and a stake in a pay TV channel you cannot go any further? That would take out most of the major players in this country. Take Channel 7, for example. It has a one-third interest in Sky News, which is one of those six I referred to. That is not a healthy outcome, because you are treating pay TV as something that ought to restrict expansion.
Cross media in its original form identified three areas and said, `You can't have cross holdings.' The idea of expanding it to include telecoms or magazines or other things is clearly a retrograde step. However, I think it is very important, as Senator Murphy put it, to ensure that when public interest is addressed by the regulators—and that includes the ACCC, because I think there is a way of ensuring that the ACCC has the jurisdiction to scrutinise any cross-media takeovers—in the course of doing that they ought to have regard for other media interests, be they magazines, pay TV or, as Senator Harris said, the Internet. The Internet in all its manifestations is a moving game, as we know. There are content providers, content carriers and ISPs. All of those elements can and should be taken into account by a competition regulator concerned to ensure that there is not a significant reduction in competition or a substantial lessening of competition. That is why I think it is certainly feasible to ensure that the ACCC has that jurisdiction— which at the moment it does not really have. If someone approaches it and asks it to make a judgment on a particular activity then it gets involved, but it is pretty ad hoc at the present time. I think there is certainly a need for more certainty in that regard.
It is also important to remember that, when you are trying to ensure that you have addressed these issues, you focus on what is fundamentally important. It is not the provision of more entertainment services. Senator Harris said it is diversity of content rather than simply more ownership. I would be more specific than that, although I agree with him as far as he goes. It is all about news and current affairs, because that is where the legitimate interest of the parliament lies. Governments and regulators have a very important role to play in community standards, but apart from censorship, and assuming reasonably wholesome material, whether there are five soaps or 25 soaps, whether there are any number of channels available on pay television—and in a digital environment you could get anything up to 500 channels—or whether you have 60 now or 250 in 12 months time is a matter for the market. It is a matter for consumers. The more they demand, the more, presumably, they will be accommodated. 
I think the parliament has a legitimate concern relating to the public interest to ensure that there is diversity of opinion. That means ensuring that all voices and all different points of view can be heard, whatever the issue of the day might be. We certainly have one before us right now. I am sure every citizen in this democratic society wants to know that there is no single stone unturned nor a single view unexplored that might be brought to bear in the debate. In order to ensure that you have that diversity of opinion, you need to remove any obstacles. At the same time, you need to protect those arrangements so that you have minimum standards in place or, in some instances, editorial separation and diversity to ensure that there is no improper interference in that decision making process, whether it is news selection, news prioritising or news collection.
But the fact remains that, if you look at what has happened since 1987, there has been a veritable explosion of new sources of news. Whether I like it or not, there are a lot of kids these days who do not go to the front page of the newspaper for their news. They go straight online. When they go into the office or even before they leave home they will be surfing the Internet. They will get their news from wherever they want to get it. They will decide what news they get and then they will access it. They might update themselves a number of times during the day. For those who were brought up in a good old newspaper world, this is hardly recognisable. You did not have pay television, you did not have the Internet, SBS was hardly rolled out and you did not have anything like the number of services that the ABC now provides to all parts of Australia. The quality and quantity of opinion and, therefore, content has exploded dramatically.
This bill provides a unique opportunity to modernise the media arrangements. Some reference was made to the Productivity Commission, but it is worth remembering that, when the Productivity Commission talked about an approach that involved subjectivity, they were talking about the UK model which the UK is now in the process of discarding. A view of the Productivity Commission in 2000 may well not be the view of the Productivity Commission in 2003; nor is it the view of many others around the world. The reason that the US and the UK are doing what they are doing in terms of overhauling their media laws is precisely the same. It is not because they want to constrict. I heard what Senator Harris said about the US in 1996: they allowed people to own more radio and television stations in a market at a time when they had a huge telecommunications bill—the first one since 1994—but they also recognised that you cannot artificially constrain without paying the consequences. As long as you protect those legitimate public interests, you are able to achieve all that the objectives of the act require.
In terms of local content, again it is critically important that we ensure that matters of local significance are available in regional areas. You do that through the point system that the ABA have already identified. They are ultimately the only ones in a position to make these judgments, because you have to strike a balance between insisting on minimum standards in the provision of news, current affairs and local information in prime time and not making it so onerous that players vacate the market. Clearly, that is not a task for government or for those who might be debating a bill. It is the responsibility, cloaked in law, of a regulator to conform with those requirements. It is also necessary to have the legislation require the ABA to do that, not just as a matter of grace and favour—and hope that they will express a view that others will adhere to—but to actually insist upon it. 
For the first time, this bill provides minimum requirements for matters of local significance and local news in regional areas that simply have not been there until now. It is building on all those existing arrangements: a market for television, a market for radio and audience reach limits, and now minimum levels of local content. At the same time, with the two out of three provision which you could extend to metropolitan areas as well, you are providing an additional safety net. If you add to that a minimum number of voices, you are not looking at wholesale change. The real revolution would be to simply discard cross-media and foreign ownership, and leave it to the market. We are light-years away from that. That is not what this is all about. It is quite the opposite. It is about giving exemptions in certain defined situations. By doing it that way, you are able to ensure that you get a very healthy outcome whilst protecting the legitimate concerns that have been expressed by a number of senators this evening. In view of the time, I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
Leave granted; debate adjourned.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (MEDIA OWNERSHIP) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2003-03-25,"—Labor support the Transport Safety Investigation Bill 2002 and the Transport Safety Investigation (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2002 and we foreshadow our support for the supplementary government amendments and those to be moved by Senator Lees. The Transport Safety Investigation Bill 2002 creates a single legislative framework for the Commonwealth's investigation of rail, shipping and aviation accidents and incidents. In doing so, the roles and responsibilities of the ATSB are clarified, along with the actual objectives and administrative arrangements for investigations and reporting arrangements. In clarifying the roles and responsibilities of the ATSB, Labor note that these are based on important principles that have bipartisan support. The principles include, firstly, independence. This is critical. The independence and professionalism of the ATSB has been and will continue to be fiercely defended from this side of the chamber.
Secondly, there is the `no blame' approach to safety investigation. This principle is sometimes one that the community grapples with. When loved ones are lost, there is a natural human reaction to ensure that any individual who is responsible is identified and made to pay for their negligence or oversight. However, there are other justifications and mechanisms to hold those responsible accountable for their actions. This bill reinforces the no blame approach to investigating incidents and accidents, and there is no doubt that this principle is critical in ensuring that the reason for an accident is uncovered. The connection is that this approach encourages the necessary operational reporting required for an objective and critical study of an accident.
Thirdly, there is openness in transport investigations—that is, the widespread dissemination of the findings and the fair treatment of all those directly involved. The opposition contends that these principles combine to ensure that the ATSB and their experts can find out what happened and, most importantly, make recommendations for action that may prevent the same or similar accidents recurring in the future. These are all-important principles for Labor and have long been the principles guiding air safety accident investigations. These were commenced under the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation, established by Labor and later renamed the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. 
This bill consolidates and sets out a framework for the use of on-board recordings in accident investigations. It is important to state the important principle that these recordings, such as cockpit voice recordings in aircraft, are only used for accident investigations and prevention, and the amendments that will be moved later with Labor's support will put further measures in place to protect the use of these recordings. All parties and senators have been reminded of this in recent months by the AIPA and the AFAP—the Australian Federation of Air Pilots—organisations that represent pilots. The bill before us also extends the scope of the Commonwealth's reach on rail safety investigations. I note that some of the details are still being resolved with the states and territories but the opposition was assured in a departmental briefing attended by representatives from the minister's office that agreement would soon be forthcoming. Perhaps the minister's representative can, today or subsequently, provide an update on this matter.
I would also like to remind senators that the genesis of the policy being enacted today was during the Labor Party's years in government. The 1993 standing committee on transport report was entitled A national approach to rail safety regulation. The findings of this report were reflected in the 1996 intergovernmental agreement in relation to national rail safety. The groundwork was all laid out for the Howard government ministers on transport, but they did very little about it. The Howard government has an abysmal record on transport reform. We all know that there has long been a call for a national rail safety investigation body and more uniform national standards, in the same vein as the road transport reform process that also commenced under Labor in the early 1990s. At last we have a framework for that body and the opposition therefore welcomes it, although its gestation has been protracted.
Implementing the rail components of this bill when enacted will require at least three-quarters of a million dollars. As I understand it, the government has not yet appropriated those funds. Labor has previously raised issues about the adequacy of ATSB funding. If the ATSB is to do the job and retain its independence, credibility and professionalism, it must be given the resources to do so. In the past six months Australia has witnessed the horrible and tragic rail accidents at Waterfall and in South Australia. It is critical that the ATSB is resourced to respond to such accidents appropriately.
As I said at the outset, the opposition support the bill and we foreshadow our support for amendments to be moved. This bill has had a rocky passage, largely because not enough care was taken to ensure proper consultation with industry. The department assumed that the changes to aviation were insignificant and therefore did not pay adequate attention to that consultation process. Because of the lack of consultation, the specific provisions of the bill and what it did through testing were achieved through information, ideas and experience sharing. At the end of the day, the bill will get there, but this could have happened more smoothly and quickly, with more attention to process. The opposition trust that this has been a lesson well learnt and that it will not be repeated. It is a classic example of a stitch in time saving nine. Had that approach been taken earlier, this bill would have been through this process and enacted into law.",SENATE,<title>TRANSPORT SAFETY INVESTIGATION BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Lees, Sen Meg",IND,2003-03-25,"—When I was made aware of the Transport Safety Investigation Bill 2002 and the problems within it, it was in fact on the non-controversial list for the following Thursday. I thank those pilots—one pilot in particular—in rural South Australia who brought to my attention the issues for pilots within this legislation. I duly referred the bill, and I thank the Senate for agreeing to the usual right of any senator to refer any bill to committee. The bill was dealt with very efficiently by the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee. Recommendations were also made to this bill by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, and I particularly thank Senator Murray for his work on this committee and on the issues pertaining just to pilots. 
As has already been said, it was not so much of an issue for rail transport, for example; but for pilots there were some very specific issues. Now that we have the government amendments, which I am presuming will be accepted, and my amendments that the government has agreed to—and I thank my staff for the work that they have done on this legislation—the international pilots association believes that it is a satisfactory compromise. It is not exactly what was wanted but, at the end of the day, it is certainly a satisfactory compromise.
Pilots agreed in the early seventies to allow cockpit voice recorders on the basis that they would never be used in criminal or civil proceedings. In other words, they would be used for the purposes of air safety. They would be used, for example, to track the cause of accidents. They would be needed in the case of an emergency to find out what went wrong, perhaps mechanically with the plane, and comments made by the pilot would obviously be essential as they monitor various on-board equipment.
However, given these amendments, the pilots have agreed that we do live in different times from the days when they originally agreed to the voice recorders going in. Therefore, they have accepted the need for some extra surveillance, and that is certainly going to be the case. I particularly note the work that has been done by a number of my Senate colleagues, including Senator Allison and Senator Heffernan and, of course, the staff of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee. It is now at least six months since this bill was originally before us. As was said before by Senator O'Brien, if the pilots had had the opportunity to really see in detail what was happening, I think we probably could have gone through this a lot quicker. But, hopefully, with the government amendments and my amendments we will have a satisfactory compromise, and this legislation can take effect.",SENATE,<title>TRANSPORT SAFETY INVESTIGATION BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-03-25,"—I wish to indicate the Democrats' support for this legislation. The Transport Safety Investigation Bill 2002 and the Transport Safety Investigation (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2002 will introduce a national framework for the investigation of transport safety incidents—a move that is welcomed by us. The Senate referred this bill to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee, and a number of concerns were raised in the committee's report. A number of amendments have since been proposed by the government and by Senator Lees, whom I thank for her efforts in relation to this bill. Some of these amendments result from concerns also raised by us during discussions with the government, and they were raised by pilots: the lack of protection afforded to cockpit voice recorders and cockpit voice recordings from admission as evidence in civil and criminal proceedings before a court.
The concern was that pilots could potentially face criminal prosecution as a result of evidence on cockpit voice recordings, and that was not in line with the original intention of cockpit voice recordings, which was a no-blame safety approach to investigations. Since criminal manslaughter proceedings were instigated against two pilots in New Zealand based on evidence from those recorders, pilots had reportedly begun disabling cockpit voice recorders, thereby compromising future safety investigations. But, under the amendments proposed by the government and negotiated with Senator Lees and us, evidence may only be admitted in very serious cases, punishable by a penalty of imprisonment of greater than two years and only where a court is satisfied that the public interest outweighs any adverse domestic and international impact that the disclosure of the information might have on future investigations. We expect these amendments will allay concerns raised by pilots in evidence presented to the committee, and will protect the integrity and reliability of cockpit voice recorders in providing evidence in no-blame investigations, thereby contributing to the future safety of the travelling public. Therefore, I indicate our support for the amendments moved by Senator Lees and the government.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-03-25,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
The Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs report entitled 2002 Access and equity annual report: progress in implementing the charter of Public Service in a culturally diverse society is specifically aimed at ensuring that the culturally diverse aspect of our society and the changing nature of our society are dealt with by the Public Service in a way that maximises the performance of their role. It is the second year that all Commonwealth agencies have been asked to report against the performance management framework of the Public Service charter in a culturally diverse society. All portfolio agencies that were required to report did so.
The report indicates that the quality of responses has improved. In last year's report a major gap in reporting was identified. The report provides analysis regarding the strategies aimed at meeting the performance indicators. This is an important area. It relates not just to reports from agencies but also to community feedback about the adequacy of access to translating and interpreting services—particularly for small and newly arrived communities—and whether or not the quality and nature of Public Service delivery is adequately meeting the needs of the very diverse and wide-ranging number of ethnic communities that make up our society. It is pleasing to note that, of the agencies that met the performance indicators, there was a large number that met them 100 per cent. At the top of the list is the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, along with the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs itself. I guess it would be a major concern if that department were not adequately meeting needs.
I will not go into the full detail of the report, but the report's broader context is particularly important to note. Still only 16 of the 32 agencies had data collection systems consistent with the standards for statistics on cultural language diversity or were taking steps to make their systems comply. So there is still only 50 per cent compliance there on something as basic as the data collection systems. A lot of departments are still falling short of the mark in various aspects of the required performance indicators.
The report contains a lot of technical language because it relates to performance indicators under the Public Service charter. In that sense, the report might seem to be a bit dry, but the basic thrust behind it needs to be recognised and the government deserves to be congratulated on producing this report. I note some of the positive actions in the immigration area, about which I have often been very critical of the government. Specific agendas like this are important.
In relation to the broader issue, I take the opportunity to say that it is more crucial than ever that all government agencies, community agencies and business organisations work as hard as they can to ensure that they are operating in a way that maximises the opportunity for connection with, and input from, all people from all sections of our community. I very firmly believe, and the Democrats strongly believe, that our cultural diversity is a massive strength for Australia. If we can maintain and build on that, we will have an enormous advantage over many other nations in the world, particularly as we get more and more globalised. It is something we must protect and foster in all areas, particularly at the basic levels of ensuring support for some of the more vulnerable members of our community. At the moment the Muslim community in particular needs strong and open support from community leaders. We also need to ensure that we address our ignorance about the different needs of the different parts of our community. This report addresses one aspect of that and I commend it and encourage this parliament and the community to look for other ways that we can further prosper the area of diversity. (Time expired)
Question agreed to. ",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs</title>,Documents,24,1,speech
"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2003-03-25,"—At this time of trial for our country and our institutions, we are all duty bound to be tolerant of different political views, divergent social precepts and the complex cultural issues in our midst. This is a time when our mettle as Australians is being tested anew by very powerful forces. In recent times there have been a number of instances nationwide in which, in my view, we have fallen from the heights of tolerance to which we should aspire and which we have generally occupied. It would be invidious to cite particular instances in this context. To do so would be to risk reopening wounds and causing more pain. Suffice it to say that such events have been a nationwide experience; that lately, because of the crisis in the Middle East, they have become more prevalent; and that, to my great discomfort, they have been present in Queensland.
Australia is a land of immense cultural diversity. We have made it so. Immigration has been the consistent pattern and practice of Australian settlement since 1788. It is immigration that has made us what we are. Let us pause for a moment to consider exactly what it is that we are. We are a tolerant, democratic society, with our parliamentary system of government derived from Britain—appropriately with an American modification, which we see in our Constitution and in the very fact of this chamber.
I said in this place only last week that a full 23 per cent of the Australian population is overseas born—an outstanding and extraordinary statistic in a country such as this where the rule of law is universal and parliamentary representation is a ubiquitous feature of our political life. Those who assert that the government has taken the wrong track over Iraq are perfectly entitled to hold that view and argue for it strenuously. I believe they are wrong, but, in this context, that is beside the point. The point is that, in a liberal democracy, disputation is moderated by convention. It is moderated, or it should be, by a general willingness on the part of all participants to hear other views and by a willingness on all sides, even when rejecting contrary opinion, to do so with impeccable grace, good manners and a perfect appreciation of the pluralistic nature of views in a free society. I do not think that is a tall order. It is, or it should be, second nature to Australians who go to the ballot box—not to the barricades—to effect the changes they wish to see in government and policy. 
We have just celebrated Harmony Day. It would be a shame if the discord we have seen within this parliamentary precinct this week—rank bad manners, quite frankly— brought about disharmony in its wake. We have an argument among ourselves as Australians about the war we are waging in Iraq. The final remedy for that political question, if a remedy turns out to be a public requirement, is at the ballot box. That is the very point the Prime Minister has made consistently and frequently with moral force and great candour: the remedy is at the ballot box. It will not be found in raised voices in the public gallery of the House of Representatives; it will not be found in the heated salvos of emailed letters, such as those I am sure all senators in this place have received; it will not be found in the hateful and disastrously misinformed—and usually anonymous—telephone calls all of us get at our electorate offices; and it certainly will not be found in descent into ill-judged or intemperate commentary, such as that in which Senator Bartlett has recently indulged, on the vexed issue of how to treat prisoners of war.
Senator Bartlett claimed that the United States was hypocritical for complaining that the Iraqis had paraded American POWs before the television cameras when the Americans had done exactly the same thing. That is the sort of doublespeak that gets individuals who will never have the responsibility of government—because they lead parties that will never be in government—into trouble. Perhaps Senator Bartlett believes on reflection that he said something that he should never have said. I sincerely hope that that is the case. But he said it and, if it is left unchallenged— 
—I didn't say that.
—I take the interjection from Senator Bartlett. He says that he didn't say it. I have a transcript from ABC Radio two days ago that very strongly suggests that that is in fact what he said. If he did not say it, undoubtedly during this debate he will have the opportunity to correct the record. But, if what he said is left unchallenged, it will risk inflaming Australia's domestic political environment purely so that the man who uttered the words in question could score a cheap political point. I am sure that Senator Bartlett does not genuinely think that there is any parallel between the sort of treatment we know the Iraqis routinely hand out to prisoners of war, or any other variety, and that which is mandated by the American armed forces. That is not to say that there will never be abuses of the rules by Americans or, for that matter, Australians. It is to say that an American or an Australian abuser is far more likely to be punished for his offences than he is to be given a medal or a promotion.
Torture or mistreatment is not state policy in a liberal democracy. That is one of the reasons it is disturbing to find in 2003 that crude stereotyping of ethnic and cultural groups is still part of the picture here in Australia among a very small minority of people. There are many Australian Muslims, people either directly from the Muslim world or descendants—in many cases, by several generations—of long ago immigrants. There are many Muslims who are new Australians. In the land of the fair go, they deserve just that: a fair go.
Liberal democracy, and specifically parliamentary democracy, is a European tradition. We are the heirs to the British branch of that tradition and our democracy directly derives from it. There is no place for stereotyping ethnicity or culture. There is absolutely no place for race based humiliation, nor can there be sanction for material that suggests, even if only subliminally, superiority on the basis of race. In the same way, there is no place in the ever broadening expanse of Australia's democracy for people who, invariably claiming to be partisans for freedom, injure or ignore the civic system by which we as a people elect to govern ourselves.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Adjournment,25,1,speech

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2003-03-25,"—The Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
(1)	The programs and/or grants administered by the Department providing assistance to people living in the federal electorate of Gippsland are:
	i.	the Adult Migrant English Program (AMEP)
	ii.	the Community Settlement Services Scheme (CSSS);
	iii.	the Living in Harmony (LIH) Initiative; and
	iv.	the Migrant Resource Centre (MRC) and Migrant Service Agency (MSA) core funding.
·	The Immigration Advice and Application Assistance Scheme (IAAAS) and the Asylum Seekers Assistance (ASA) scheme, while not targeted specifically to residents of Gippsland, can be accessed by any eligible asylum seekers and others seeking immigration advice who might reside in that electorate.
(2)	The details of program and/or grant commencement dates are as follows:
·	The AMEP program commenced in 1948.
·	The CSSS program replaced the Grant in Aid Scheme and Migrant Access Projects Scheme and commenced in 1997.
·	The delivery of IAAAS commenced in 1997, and the delivery of ASA commenced in 1992.
·	The LIH initiative commenced in 1998. 
·	The MRC/MSA core funding program began in 1978 and funding has been provided to the Gippsland Migrant Resource Centre since its establishment in 1984.
(3)	The level of funding provided through AMEP, CSSS, LIH and MRC/MSA programs and/or grants for each financial year in the electorate of Gippsland is: 

1999-2000
$178,457
2000-2001
$219,255
2001-2002
$212,056
·	In addition, CSSS funding is provided to three organisations in Victoria to provide, among other things, outreach services to the Gippsland electorate. However, because the grants relate to a range of activities, details of the funding amounts have not been included in the above table.
·	As IAAAS community services are delivered by contracted service providers at a State/Territory level, and the ASA scheme is delivered by the Australian Red Cross on a national basis, funding for these programs cannot be broken down by electorate. 
(4)	The total funding appropriated for the AMEP, CSSS, LIH and MRC/MSA programs in the 2002-2003 financial year is $134.812m. This figure comprises $104.522m for AMEP, $26.79m for CSSS/MRC/MSA, $3.5m for LIH Initiative funding (of which $1.5m is available for community grants). The national allocation for IAAAS is $864,000 and $12.406m for ASA.
