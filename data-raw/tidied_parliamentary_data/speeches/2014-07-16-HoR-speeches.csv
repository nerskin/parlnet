Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney—The Treasurer) (09:04):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


The Labor 2013-14 Budget Savings (Measures No. 1) Bill 2014 repeals the second round of carbon tax-related personal income tax cuts that are due to start on 1 July 2015 because that is what the Labor Party promised prior to the last election as a budget savings measure to help to repair the budget; but since the election they have failed to keep their promise to the Australian people. We are now introducing legislation to allow the Labor Party to keep its promise to the Australian people to fix the budget.


This measure has been introduced to the parliament twice under the Clean Energy (Income Tax Rates and Other Amendments) Bill 2013 as part of the package of carbon tax repeal bills.


The Senate has now twice voted down this budget repair measure put forward by the Labor Party prior to the last election as part of their so-called budget repair strategy. But since coming into opposition, the Labor Party is not only voting against the coalition keeping its election commitments—the Labor Party is voting against its own election commitments. We want them to keep their election commitments. We want the Labor Party to stick with what they promised to the Australian people before the last election.


In its final budget handed down on 14 May last year, the former government deferred a second round of personal income tax cuts, resulting in a $1.5 billion saving over the then forward estimates.


But the former government never followed through by unwinding legislation they put through the parliament that implemented those tax changes.


The 1 July 2015 round of tax changes were originally introduced to provide additional assistance to households following an expected increase in the carbon price from a fixed price of $25.40 in this financial year to a floating price of $29 next financial year.


In their final budget, the former Labor government revised their carbon price estimates for the next financial year to around $12—less than half of what was originally expected.


Subsequently they announced they would defer the second round of personal income tax cuts due to take effect on 1 July 2015, banking $1.5 billion to the budget bottom line over the then forward estimates. So what they were doing is making announcements and putting them into the budget as a savings measure—claiming it was necessary to repair the budget—but they actually never introduced the legislation. They never actually did it. So they promised to do it, and they took it to the election as a promise to do it; now, after the election, the Labor Party is opposing not only their last budget, but they are opposing the promises they took to the last election.


This bill facilitates the Labor Party keeping their election promises. That is what we are doing. We are giving them the opportunity to keep their election promise, because they did not reverse the decision to defer the second round of personal income tax cuts in the 2013 Economic Statement or in their document outlining their costings for the 2013 federal election. Since the election, they have been saying—claiming, incorrectly—that we have deepened the budget deficit. In fact, they are the ones—by their own actions they are deepening the budget deficit. There is no sense of embarrassment about it. They are just opposing what they took to the last election.


This is important because since coming to opposition, they have now twice voted against legislation which implements this particular budget repair measure, without outlining an alternative plan for the measure they are now choosing to keep.


The cost to the budget for the second round of personal income tax cuts has increased from $1.5 billion to $2.2 billion over the current forward estimates period to 30 June 2018.


The government inherited an unsustainable budget position from the previous Labor government.


The deficits inherited from the former government that were outlined in the 2013-14 MYEFO totalled $123 billion.


Government debt, if left unchecked would increase to $667 billion at the end of the medium term.


Without action, the budget outlook is deficits and rising debt for at least another decade. The budget would never get to surplus and the debt would never start to be repaid. Of course, the interest bill on that debt would rise to $3 billion a month. That is the equivalent of the construction of three brand-new teaching hospitals in Australia every month, and we are just spending it on interest unless we address this issue.


Of course, 70 per cent of that interest goes overseas, because the people we are borrowing money from to fund the current deficit and to fund Labor's debt have lent it to us from overseas. So we have to pay interest to them overseas because Australia fails to fund itself.


So it is hugely important to fix the budget so that we can get to the point where the government lives within its means. There have been a number of authorities on that. The financial systems inquiry, the Murray review, released the initial report yesterday and identified that, if we continue with budget deficits, it weakens our ability to respond to a potential financial crisis. If there is a bank that, God forbid, is in distress or a financial institution is in distress, our ability to respond is weakened if the fiscal position of the Commonwealth is in a disadvantaged and weakened state.


Therefore, if our banks, which rely overwhelmingly on domestic deposits but also wholesale international funding, are in a position where there is some risk, that risk is automatically transferred to the Commonwealth balance sheet, because we are as a nation a net importer of capital. So the stronger the Commonwealth government balance sheet the stronger the credit rating we have and the better the Australian economy will perform. There is no doubt about that because as a nation we import money. We have to bring in money from the rest of the world to fund our growth.


There are many nations that have much greater government debt, but they fund it from within their own economy, because they have a huge pool of domestic savings—Japan being a classic example where the government has an enormous debt as a percentage of GDP, but it is the Japanese families, the Japanese housewives, as they were previously called years ago, who saved the money and they can fund government debt. They can fund it within their economy. Even Italy has the capacity to fund its own needs, and it is an exporter of capital.


But Australia is not an exporter of capital; Australia is an importer of capital. Therefore it is so important, as an importer of capital, that we have a government that lives within its means, so that money becomes more accessible and more affordable for the private sector, which then uses that capital to develop the big projects in the big land that helped to drive our economy.


I do not have any great insight into the thinking of the Labor Party—I suspect that would be a task well beyond the capacity of any individual—but I do refer to the former Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister, the member for Lilley. In his budget speech in 2011 he said:


… meandering back to surplus—would compound the pressures in our economy and push up the cost of living for pensioners and working people.


That is what he said. At this dispatch box, in the budget speech in 2011, the member for Lilley said:


… meandering back to surplus—would compound the pressures in our economy and push up the cost of living for pensioners and working people.


So why on God's earth don't the Labor Party in opposition heed the words that at this dispatch box they promulgated in government? The problem is they are inconsistent. They have no fundamental principles.


It was not a one-off in a budget speech. On 8 May 2012, the member for Lilley also said:


… importantly by coming back to surplus we give the Reserve Bank maximum flexibility to cut interest rates, should they decide to do so independently of the Government.


… coming back to surplus is about making sure we help those people sitting around the kitchen table when they're figuring out how they will make ends meet.


That was the member for Lilley.


The opposition, the Labor Party, have 25 senators—and the Greens are part of the opposition; they do not believe in anything—and the Greens have another 10 senators. They might not agree with our budget measures. They might not agree with what I announced on behalf of the government at this dispatch box only a few weeks ago, but surely they agree with themselves from a year ago. Don't agree with me today but, I say to the Labor Party, agree with yourselves a year ago. I do not want to go too far. I do not want to put too great a burden on your shoulders that are already weighed down by the great burden of opposition, but I would say to the Labor Party: if you truly believe that Australia should live within its means as you did just 12 months ago, as you did nine months ago, as even the member for McMahon went out and said at the doors today—'We are about fiscal responsibility.' I mean, seriously; if the Labor Party truly believed it at one point in time, I would beg them to put in place actions that back their words just on this one occasion.


We are facilitating in this bill the chance for Labor simply to keep faith with what it said a year ago, simply to keep faith with what it promised the Australian people to do. There are $5 billion of savings that Labor announced prior to the election in order to fix the budget that they are now opposing. They developed the policies. They came up with these proposals. They went out and campaigned for these savings initiatives. This is what they did before the election, and we are just giving them the opportunity to keep their word with the Australian people. That is all. I am not introducing this bill again in order to facilitate my budget; I am asking them to facilitate their budget. That is all I am asking them to do.


They had a pretty ordinary record in relation to budget management. We know that. We know that the former Treasurer stood up and said, 'Tonight I announce four years of surpluses.' I have been looking everywhere. I must say I looked in the dispatch box—'Where's that surplus?' I looked under the table! We have been looking everywhere. We cannot find those surpluses. They do not exist. They never did. And the Leader of the Opposition too said, 'We've delivered a surplus.' In fact they all went out and told their electorates at expense to the Australian taxpayer that they had delivered a surplus. The problem was they never did.


You know what? They knew it was important to have a surplus. They knew it was important to fix the budget. That is why they wanted to convince the Australian people. That is why they wanted to convince you that they were getting on with the job of fixing the budget. They were getting on with the job of delivering a surplus. They went out there and they said to you to your face, 'We are fixing the budget,' and that is why we have measures like the one I am bringing before the House today. We have got to make these decisions, and they are difficult decisions. We are doing this because we have to fix the budget. That is what they said to you, and now the Labor Party has completely changed its tune.


So I want to remind them that it is important that we fix the budget and fix it now. And why? There is Governor Stevens, the head of the Reserve Bank of Australia, who served the opposition when they were in government, served us previously in government and serves us in government again. He warned just a few days ago in Hobart, Tasmania:


… the fact that the real issues with public finances are medium-term ones is not a reason to put off taking decisions to address them. On the contrary, as experience in so many other countries demonstrates, by the time these sorts of problems have gone from being out on the horizon to on our doorstep, they have usually become a lot more difficult to tackle. Early, measured actions that have effects that build up over time are a much better approach than the much tougher response that might be required if decisions were delayed.


That is the Governor of the Reserve Bank.


The Labor Party boasts how it was there during the GFC. If there is a single lesson to be learned out of the global financial crisis it must be this: do not delay decisions about repairing government budgets until it is too late. Go and ask the Greeks and the Italians and the Spaniards; go and ask a whole range of different countries and governments whether they would like to wind back the clock to pre-GFC days and try and undertake that fiscal repair. Australia was able to come through the global financial crisis because we had a strong budget going into it. That was because in 1996, when we inherited $96 billion of debt—a lot of money in those days—we actually took the remedial action in 1996 to fix the budget to inoculate us, so far as we could, for the dark days ahead—and there were dark days. There was the Asian financial crisis, when seven out of our top 10 trading partners were in recession or depression. We came through that. We came through the tech boom and bust. We came through an Aussie dollar that was sub 50c to the US dollar which created enormous dislocation in our economy. We came through all those things and we came through the global financial crisis because we had the financial capacity to do it.


As I learnt as a child, and as many other people here who have worked in small business would know, when you have money in your pocket you have choices, but when you do not have money in your pocket, when you are totally beholden to someone that lends you money, there are no choices—they call the shots. From our perspective it is hugely important that a strong, independent, vibrant Australian economy can stand on its own two feet and not only withstand the pressures that come from domestic change but, importantly, withstand the pressures that come from global change. For a nation that imports money from the rest of the world it is vitally important that we do everything we can to strengthen ourselves rather than to weaken ourselves.


It was not just Dr Stevens; it was Dr Parkinson, the Secretary to the Treasury. Dr Parkinson, who served the Labor Party loyally in government, said—and I did not put him up to it; he said this in a speech only a few days ago as well:


… it is quite another thing to exhort vague notions of fairness to oppose any form of reform. If you do that, if you use such an argument to defend what is an unsustainable status quo, what you are doing is consigning Australia to a deteriorating future.


Labor's argument publicly is that we need to fix the budget—that is what they say and that is what they have been saying—but their actions are: 'She'll be right, you don't need to do anything.' Well, 'she'll be right' is unacceptable in the 21st century. 'She'll be right' is unacceptable in a world where commerce occurs in the flick of a second and at the touch of a computer. 'She'll be right' is unacceptable with the movement of money around global capital markets on a scale the world has never seen and where governments can be beholden to markets on a scale that has never previously occurred. 'She'll be right' is unacceptable.


If it isn't Governor Glenn Stevens, if it isn't the Secretary to the Treasury, then go to Phil Bowen, the Parliamentary Budget Officer, who said:


It is time to start coming out [of debt and deficit], otherwise the longer you leave it the more exposed you become and the harder it is to wind it back ... 


Sure we're currently at a very low level relative to the rest of the developed world, but frankly we don't want to find ourselves where the rest of the world is ...


You've got to have a buffer. One of the reasons we came through the global financial crisis so well was because we started with assets ... 


If the rate of the increase [in debt], if allowed to go unchecked, would mean that net debt would increase quite rapidly to the point where that fiscal buffer ... would not be available.


That is the independent Parliamentary Budget Officer. So we have the Governor of the Reserve Bank, the Secretary of the Treasury and the independent Parliamentary Budget Officer. There is also Angel Gurria, the head of the OECD, where there are former Labor staffers. In fact, a former Labor minister, David Bradbury, now works at the OECD, so maybe Angel Gurria spoke to the former Assistant Treasurer in the Labor Party. These are the people that held values in opposition, in government and now in opposition again. Angel Gurria said: 


We have seen with very great interest, and I think really with great expectations, that they are dealing very directly and decisively with the budget deficit.


So when we go to the G20 and say we need to fix our budget, we are doing it ourselves. Why? Because we want a world with more jobs. We want an Australia with more jobs and greater prosperity. We want a stronger economy where families have choices and where families have job security.


The only way to do that is to undertake the necessary budget repair. We do not do it out of any ideological satisfaction, I can tell you. We do it because we know it is right—that if the government lives within its means, families have the capacity to live within their means. But if the government does not live within its means, then it comes with a baseball bat in the middle of the night and hits families for more and more. It hits their budgets for more and more. It creates an unpredictable government—and God, we have had six years of that unpredictable government.


Those days are over. We promised the Australian people we would fix the budget and we will. We will because we must. That is the solemn commitment we gave the Australian people at the last election. There will be individual members of the House of Representatives and individual members of the Senate who will not agree with individual initiatives. That is fine, but I thought there was a collective approach—a collective approach that understands we need to have fiscal repair; that the pensioners of Australia and the families of Australia will be worse off—as Wayne Swan said in the budget speech—if we do not fix the budget. He was right. They will be worse off if we do not fix the budget.


So now is the time to fix it. Now is the time. You plough the fields and you sow the seeds before the heavy rains come, and when you do that—and if you are ready—then you will get the benefit down the track. But as it stands we are saying: 'Let's get on with the job of fixing the budget.' Let us do it now. We have put on the table the best policy options for the medium and long term. We have put them on the table. We have offered them to the Australian people.


The critics will always be there. I say to those critics: give us an alternative. Tell us what you would do. If you have no alternative to what we are offering the Australian people, then at least stick with what you said you would put down as an alternative in the past. So what we are going to do with every single initiative that the Labor Party announced prior to the election or in previous budgets—that they have now chosen to oppose—is reintroduce them to this place as a separate bill; as a Labor budget savings measure bill. And we are going to give them the chance to, very publicly, vote in favour of their election promises. That is what we are going to do: we are going to give them a unique chance to keep their promises to the Australian people. And we are going to support them in doing so because ultimately there has to be a partnership here. There has to be a partnership that says that ultimately we are both committed—we are all committed—to fixing the budget. We are all committed to a nation that lives within its means. We are all committed to a stronger and more prosperous economy. We are all committed to more and better-paying jobs. This is how we are going to do it.


I commend this bill to the House. I feel as though I should not have to urge the Labor Party to keep its election commitments, but I am urging them to commit to their election commitments. I am urging them to honour their promises. I am urging them to get on with the job of helping us to fix the budget.


They can say whatever they want—go out the doors and talk about fiscal repair. Bill Shorten can speak to individual businesspeople and give them a wink and a nod and say: 'Don't worry. The carbon tax is going to go.' He can go to the mining council, as he did, and say: 'Don't worry. The mining tax will be gone by July.' Well, it is not going to be gone if, at the end of the day, they want to keep all the expenditure but they do not want to get rid of the tax. That is not getting rid of the mining tax.


We have been to two elections on the mining tax. We opposed it. We opposed the packages. We have been entirely consistent. We are delivering what we promised to the Australian people. The idea of salami-slicing this and that—forget it. Why? Because at the end of the day they want to take 90 per cent of the salami and leave us with a slice. The problem is: that does not fix the budget. It does not actually help.


So I would say to the Labor Party, to the Greens, to the Palmer United Party and to the honourable Independent senators: you may not agree with individual items in the budget, you may not agree with individual policy announcements, but if you truly believe that the nation needs to live within its means, if you truly believe that we need to get the budget under control, then give us your policy proposal that will carry the day, because if we do not fix the budget now the pain and impact on the Australian people in the days, months and years ahead will be far greater. It is always best in this situation to repair the roof whilst the sun is shining than to be in a situation where, in the middle of a cyclone, everything starts to come apart.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) (09:45):  I move:


That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: AIR 6000 Phase 2A/B New Air Combat Capability Facilities.


The Department of Defence is proposing to provide new and refurbished facilities at Royal Australian Air Force Bases Williamtown, Tindal, Townsville, Darwin, Curtin, Scherger, Learmonth, Pearce and Edinburgh, as well as additional explosive ordnance and flare storage facilities at Defence Establishment Myambat.


The facilities will be used by No. 3 Squadron, No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit and No. 77 Squadron located at RAAF Base Williamtown, and No. 75 Squadron located at RAAF Base Tindal. Facilities located at all other RAAF bases and Defence Establishment Myambat, which is near Denman in the New South Wales Upper Hunter, will be used for logistical support for training and operational purposes. The facilities project will provide new and upgraded facilities and infrastructure essential to the operation of the new joint strike fighter aircraft and includes new working accommodation, maintenance hangars, storage, workshop facilities, training facilities, aircraft runway and pavement works.


The project is valued at around $1.477 billion, excluding GST. This investment will bring economic benefits for the local industry across the country, predominantly in the Newcastle and Katherine regions, over the next seven years. Subject to parliamentary approval, the main construction is expected to commence in early 2015 at RAAF Base Williamtown and mid-2017 for RAAF Base Tindal, with completion by 2022. I commend the motion to the House.

"Robert, Stuart, MP",LP,2014-07-16,"



Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden—Assistant Minister for Defence) (09:55):  I present an explanatory memorandum to the bill and move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


The Defence Legislation Amendment (Woomera Prohibited Area) Bill 2014 gives effect to the recommendations of the Hawke review of the Woomera Prohibited Area. The review was established in response to increasing demand for access to the Woomera Prohibited Area by the resources sector and the challenge this posed to Defence activity.


The Hawke review consulted extensively to obtain the views of individuals and groups that had an interest in the future use of the Woomera Prohibited Area. The final review report was released on 4 February 2011 and made a number of recommendations aimed at improving the coexistence of the various parties that had an interest in the Woomera Prohibited Area, the WPA. The focus of the recommendations was to improve the management of the WPA in a way that would meet Defence's testing requirements while creating conditions to make it commercially viable for other sectors, particularly resources, to invest in operations in the WPA.


The WPA is Australia's most important military testing range. It is used for the testing of war materiel under the control of the Royal Australian Air Force. It covers almost 124,000 square kilometres in South Australia, approximately 450 kilometres north-north-west of Adelaide. It is the largest land range in the world, with a centre line of over 600 kilometres, and is comparable in size to England.


At the same time, the WPA overlaps a major part of South Australia's potential for significant minerals and energy resources, including 30 per cent of the Gawler Craton, one of the world's major mineral domains, and the Arckaringa, Officer and Eromanga basins for hydrocarbons and coal. Olympic Dam is adjacent to the WPA and is part of the same geological formations. In fact, the minerals that are known to be found in the area include copper, gold and iron ore. There is high potential for oil, gas and uranium to also be found in the area.


The South Australian government has assessed that over the next decade about $35 billion worth of iron ore, gold and other mineral resources are potentially exploitable from within the WPA.


The Hawke review considered how to use the WPA in a way that ensured that both its full national security and economic potential was realised. The review proposed a system to maximise the coexistence between Defence and non-Defence users of the area.


The review recommended that Defence remain the primary user of the area, but acknowledged that exploitation of the WPA's considerable mineral resources would bring significant economic benefit to South Australia in particular and Australia in general.


And this bill will assist doing just that. There are four mines currently operating within the WPA and the government looks forward to additional mining operations commencing in the near future. Furthermore, the government believes the certainty and clarity of the exclusion periods will assist new operators to appropriately plan around Defence activities.


The review proposed that the WPA be opened up for resources exploration to the maximum extent possible, but within the confines of its primary use for Defence purposes. This will allow companies to take advantage of the resources potential in the WPA while ensuring its future viability as the most important test and evaluation range that supports the Australian Defence Force.


The bill implements existing administrative procedures for non-Defence users to access the WPA in legislation. This regulatory change provides non-Defence users with long-term certainty around their ability to access the WPA and the conditions attached to that access. It also represents an estimated saving of around $690,000 in administrative costs for individual applicants in the resources sector to access the WPA over the next 10 years.


So, as well as providing certainty, this bill is cutting red tape—consistent with this government's drive to rid business of unnecessary impediments to expand, to invest and to employ Australians.


The bill establishes a framework that provides all non-Defence users within the WPA a greater level of certainty over Defence activity in the area and greater certainty over access arrangements.


It allows users to make commercial decisions with some assurance as to when they will be required to leave the area because of Defence activity.


The framework maintains the primacy of the WPA as a national security and defence asset and sets up a coexistence scheme that allows access by non-Defence users subject to conditions that protect the safety of all users in the WPA and ensure the appropriate national security protections for an area used to test Defence capability.


Existing users of the Woomera Prohibited Area, including Indigenous groups, pastoralists, the Tarcoola-Darwin railway owners and operator and existing mining operations, will continue to access and operate under their current arrangements. The coexistence scheme established by the bill will apply to new users of the WPA only.


This means that for non-Defence users, the permit system will allow access to the WPA on a conditional basis (noting that existing users will continue to gain access under their current permissions). The permit conditions put limits on permit holders' access to allow Defence to conduct its testing activities in a manner that is safe and secure.


In order to obtain a permit, individuals must complete a permit application form in order to undertake the activity for which they require access to the WPA. The Woomera Prohibited Area Coordination Office will process the form and issue a permit within the time frames set out in the draft Woomera Prohibited Area rules. Local staff of the Woomera Test Range may also be able to approve some permits for purposes, including emergency access. There are different types of permits—resources exploration and production, opal mining, research, environmental and other (including tourism activities). Once the rules are finalised, the forms will be accessible on the Woomera Prohibited Area Coordination Office website. The forms are likely to be very similar to the forms currently used for access during the transition period.


While the bill provides the overarching framework for the legislative scheme, the detail of the proposed regime is to be included in the WPA rules, to be agreed by the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Industry.


The Woomera Prohibited Area Advisory Board has been established to oversee the Woomera Prohibited Area access system and foster relationships amongst WPA stakeholder groups.


The board's ex-officio members are senior representatives from the Australian government departments of Defence, Industry, and Finance, and the South Australian Department for Manufacturing, Innovation, Trade, Resources and Energy and Defence SA.


The board was established to ensure:


that the balance between economic interests and national security is maintained;


the effectiveness of the access system in safeguarding Defence activities; and


Indigenous and environmental interests are properly accounted for.


The WPA Advisory Board meets on a regular basis to undertake these functions. The roles and functions of the board are to: monitor and recommend amendments to coexistence policies and procedures; develop high-level relationships between Defence and the resources sector; resolve disputes between Defence and non-Defence users; report annually on the balance of interests in the WPA; and conduct a review every seven years of the balance of interests in the WPA.


The board will work with Defence in an endeavour to resolve all reasonable impediments to Defence authorising a permit, and the chair of the advisory board should have the power to refer Defence access conditions to the secretaries of Defence and Industry to seek their review by Defence where necessary.


In broad terms, the bill will authorise the Minister for Defence, with the agreement of the minister responsible for energy and resources, to make the Woomera Prohibited Area rules prescribe certain matters, including defining the Woomera Prohibited Area and the zones to be demarcated within that area. It will create a permit system for access and use by future non-Defence users of the WPA. It will introduce offences and penalties for entering the WPA without permission and for failing to comply with a condition of a permit. An infringement notice scheme and demerit point system will apply to the offence for failing to comply with a permit condition. The details of these schemes will be included in the rules.


There are provisions for compensation for acquisition of property from a person otherwise than on just terms, although the rules may limit the amounts of compensation payable by the Commonwealth. The bill provides that any declaration or action taken under regulation 35 of the Defence Force Regulations 1952 in relation to the WPA is taken to have always been valid. It provides that the rules may limit the amounts of compensation payable by the Commonwealth for loss or damage in the WPA arising from a breach of common law or statutory duty of care in relation to the use of the area for the testing of war materiel.


This bill takes previous attempts to deal with the various interests and stakeholders even further—and does so in a manner that is fair, transparent and predictable.


The bill is an improvement on recent Woomera bills for a number of reasons. For example, in October 2013 the South Australian government raised concerns about potential unintended consequences of the legislation for their land management and economic objectives regarding pastoral leases in the WPA. In particular, it noted that the way the bill was drafted would have the consequential effect that any new holder of an existing pastoral lease would be subject to the new legislation and rules. This was especially relevant in the area designated as the red zone, in which the previous bill stated no new permits will be granted.


Such an approach would have effectively precluded the sale or transfer of pastoral leases in the red zone, to the detriment of both economic activity and the important land management services provided by pastoralists. That, of course, includes maintenance of access roads, water infrastructure and fences, weed control, culling of feral animals, and monitoring and fighting fires.


The government determined that existing pastoral leases could be maintained under current arrangements as 'existing users', including in cases where a pastoral lease is acquired or extended.


The Northern Territory government has raised concerns about the potential for long disruptions to the railway and the impact of that for tourism and freight delivery to the Northern Territory. Current arrangements (under the Defence Force Regulations 1952) allow the minister to suspend permission to access the railway and the Stuart Highway for safety or security for the testing of war materiel—at any time and with no time limit specified. These arrangements have existed in their current form since 1989.


That said, today, rail and road closures occur only for as long as is required to conduct the test and ensure safety or security. This will continue to be the case under the proposed new arrangements. For example, a recent long-range missile test required the suspension of rail traffic through the WPA for a period of three hours on three occasions over a 21-day period. This was done in close cooperation with the rail operator and did not impact on their schedule.


The Tarcoola-Darwin railway owners and operator had raised concerns about their status as 'existing users' of the Woomera Prohibited Area under the Defence Force Regulations 1952 and that the scope of their existing use includes the railway and all associated infrastructure.


The status of the owner and operators of the Tarcoola-Darwin railway as existing users of the Woomera Prohibited Area has been clarified in this bill in section 72TB.


Continuing positive engagement with the rail owners and operators, including the development of a working level agreement, will minimise the effect that any testing activity may have on rail operations and schedules.


This version of the bill includes a technical provision that provides that any declaration or action taken under regulation 35 of the Defence Force Regulations 1952 in relation to the Woomera Prohibited Area is taken to have always been valid.


This provision ensures that any declaration or past act taken under regulation 35 of the Defence Force Regulations 1952 in relation to the Woomera Prohibited Area is taken to have always been valid. This section is inserted to avoid any doubt on the past applicability of the Defence Force Regulations to the Woomera Prohibited Area which may arise as a result of the establishment of the new access regime by the bill.


In order to meet the constitutional requirements to provide just terms compensation, the provision provides that where the declaration or past act would be invalid because of an acquisition of property other than on just terms; the Commonwealth is liable to pay reasonable compensation.


Certainly it has taken some time for this bill to be forthcoming. Developing a policy approach across the Commonwealth and South Australian governments to facilitate non-Defence access to the WPA is a complex task.


The Hawke review of the Woomera Prohibited Area recognised that the passage of legislation can be a lengthy process and consequently identified transitional arrangements to support the introduction of the coexistence model.


Adopting a phased approach to admitting new non-Defence users enabled Defence, in conjunction with the South Australian government, to acquire the capabilities and build the expertise required to manage the complex access control arrangements of the Woomera Prohibited Area.


A moratorium on new users accessing the WPA was put in place from 3 May 2011 through to 5 October 2012, when the transitional phase commenced.


During the moratorium phase, Defence established the joint WPA Coordination Office, and developed the protocols necessary to enable greater access by the resource and energy sectors. Defence consultation and negotiation with industry on the transitional deeds of access allowed for access during the transition phase, and provided the foundation for the future legislative model.


Following the end of the moratorium in October 2012, implementation of the review's recommendations moved into the transition phase. During this time the coordination office progressed the development of draft legislation in support of the coexistence framework.


This important legislation:


establishes a framework that provides non-Defence users within the Woomera Prohibited Area, in particular industry, with a level of certainty over Defence activity in the area;


allows users to make commercial decisions with some assurance as to when they will be requested to leave the area because of Defence activity; and


protects the safety of all users in the Woomera Prohibited Area and to ensure the appropriate national security protections for an area used to test Defence capability.


I commend the bill to the House.

"Feeney, David, MP",ALP,2014-07-16,"



Mr FEENEY
 (Batman) (10:10):  I rise to speak on the Defence Legislation Amendment (Woomera Prohibited Area) Bill 2014. While the content of the bill may be uncontroversial it is nonetheless very important, especially to those in the state of South Australia. I begin my remarks by reiterating the statement made by former Labor senator Don Farrell, who until recently had custody of this bill. He thanked the government for finally introducing this legislation, which is 'better late than never'.


The Woomera Prohibited Area is Australia's most important military testing range. It is used for the testing of war materiel under the control of the Royal Australian Air Force. The 127,000-kilometre expanse of northern South Australia, known as the Woomera Prohibited Area, is the world's largest overland long-range weapons testing facility and has been operational since 1947. However, from the 1980s onwards, areas of the land were made increasingly available to non-Defence users, including the resources sector. Local Indigenous groups and pastoral leaseholders also have an enduring presence across much of the WPA.


At the same time, the Woomera Prohibited Area overlaps a major part of South Australia's potential for significant mineral and energy resources, including 30 per cent of the Gawler Craton, one of the world's major mineral domains, and the Arckaringa, Officer and Eromanga basins for hydrocarbons and coal. Olympic Dam is adjacent to the Woomera Prohibited Area and is part of the same geological formations. The South Australian government has assessed that over the next decade some $35 billion worth of iron ore, gold and other minerals resources are potentially exploitable from within the Woomera Prohibited Area. So, clearly, we are talking here about a very significant resource indeed.


In order to assess the most effective use of the WPA for both Defence and non-Defence interests, on 17 May 2010 the then Minister for Defence, Senator John Faulkner, called for a review 'to make recommendations about the best use of the WPA in the national interest'. What ensued was the review of the Woomera Prohibited Area, which was led by Dr Allan Hawke. Its final report was published on 4 February 2011, and, critically for our purposes, it made 65 recommendations. Within its numerous recommendations, the Hawke review outlines a 'coexistence model' whereby Defence maintains primacy of the WPA, but non-Defence users have clarity and certainty regarding their access to specified areas of operation, incorporating both the available location and time of use.


In particular, recommendation 14 suggests the division of the WPA into three zones; a red zone for exclusive Defence use, an amber zone for regular Defence use, and a green zone for occasional Defence use. By implementing this zonal time-share arrangement, Defence is allocated exclusion windows throughout the year that limit the non-Defence use of the WPA. This ranges from new non-Defence users' total exclusion within the red zone, to up to 56 exclusion days in the green zone, pending notice. The excluded red zone comprises approximately eight per cent of the WPA, while the vast majority—some 75 per cent of the WPA area—is designated as the most accessible green zone. Importantly, the Hawke review recommended:


… that existing mining operations, environmental organisations, Indigenous groups and pastoralists with an extant presence on the WPA, should continue to operate under their current access arrangements unless they choose to be administered under the proposed coexistence model.


The provisions of the current bill give effect to that recommendation.


The Woomera Prohibited Area is larger than Tasmania and, indeed, larger than many states in Europe. Because it was used for very good, sensible defence purposes, it meant that a large portion of the state of South Australia was not open to mining. The Hawke review considered how to use the Woomera Prohibited Area in a way that ensured both its full national security and economic potential were realised. The review proposed a system to maximise the coexistence between Defence and non-Defence users of the area. Critically for the purposes of government—indeed, the previous government—the review recommended that Defence remain the primary user of the area but acknowledged that exploitation of the Woomera Prohibited Area's considerable minerals resources would bring significant economic benefit to South Australia in particular and of course the nation in general.


The review proposed that the Woomera Prohibited Area be opened up for resources exploration to the maximum extent possible but within the confines of its primary use for defence purposes. This will allow Australians to take advantage of the resources potential of the area while ensuring its future viability as the most important test and evaluation range that supports the Australian Defence Force remains preserved and intact.


The bill establishes a framework that provides all non-Defence users within the Woomera Prohibited Area with a greater level of certainty over Defence activity in the area and a greater certainty over access arrangements. It allows users to make commercial decisions with some assurance as to when they will be required to leave the area because of defence activity. The framework maintains the primacy of the Woomera Prohibited Area as a national security and Defence asset and sets up a coexistence scheme that allows access by non-Defence users, subject to conditions that protect the safety of all users in the Woomera Prohibited Area, and ensures the appropriate national security protections for an area used to test defence capability.


As recommended by the review, Indigenous landholders, pastoralists with an already established presence and existing mining operations in the Woomera Prohibited Area will continue to access and operate under their current arrangements. The coexistence scheme established by the bill will apply to new users of the Woomera Prohibited Area. Existing users of the area have the option of voluntarily joining the coexistence scheme established by these legislative measures if they so choose.


The Woomera Prohibited Area contains recognised traditional owners and significant Indigenous sites. Under the bill, permit holders who gain access to the Woomera Prohibited Area will be required to protect these sites and comply with all relevant native title and Aboriginal heritage laws. Indigenous groups with current statutory and access rights expressly retain these rights. They will not need to apply for permission under this legislation, which does not disturb existing rights.


Extensive consultation was undertaken by the former Labor government during the review process, which has given rise to this legislation and its various predecessor bills. Submissions were received from interested stakeholders, including the resources industry, Indigenous groups, pastoralists and environmental groups. Consultation on the bill included the release of an information paper on the proposed legislative framework for the Woomera Prohibited Area. The paper provided a general overview of the proposed policy framework proposed for implementation in the legislative package.


On 8 May 2013, an exposure draft of the previous bill introduced by Labor was released for stakeholder feedback. The South Australian government hosted a consultation workshop in Adelaide on 10 May 2013, chaired by the Woomera Prohibited Area Coordination Office, to discuss the bill. Stakeholders provided feedback through the workshop and by written submission. Feedback was considered and, where appropriate, the exposure bill was amended to take concerns into account. Amendments which occurred as a result of stakeholder feedback included express and specific recognition of the existing authorities for existing users, including Indigenous groups.


As the minister touched upon in his remarks, the government of South Australia raised concerns, in its submission to the committee and in the course of consultation, that the bill amendment to regulation 36 of the Defence Force Regulations 1952 will limit an individual's ability to claim compensation for loss or damage caused by Defence testing in the Woomera Prohibited Area. The committee report tabled on 13 May 2014 acknowledged the concerns expressed by the South Australian government and noted that the bill amendment to regulation 36:


… appears limited compared to the existing regulation 36 which provides a broader scope of compensation to those persons who 'suffer loss or damage' as a result of the use of regulation 34 and 35. 


The committee recommended that schedule 1, part 2, item 5 of the bill be removed from the bill or amended to maintain existing rights to compensation under regulation 36 of the Defence Force Regulations 1952. This amendment addresses the committee's recommendation and confirms that compensation will be available in the event that loss or damage is caused by Defence testing, or where there is an acquisition of property.


I congratulate the government on introducing this bill. As Don Farrell said previously: better late than never. Two previous versions of the current bill have been introduced into this parliament. The first was introduced by the former Labor government on 30 May 2013. That bill sadly lapsed when the 43rd Parliament was prorogued on 5 August 2013. Undeterred, however, a second version of the bill was put forward—which was in equivalent terms to the first version—introduced as a private senator's bill on 12 December 2013 by former Labor senator Don Farrell. That bill failed, tragically, because it was a Labor idea, and that excluded it from serious consideration by this government. But the government have now come forward with a bill essentially in precisely the same terms so that they can claim ownership of what is a very fine piece of work and a very important step forward for South Australia. There were a couple of minor changes in the legislation, and they have been spoken of. But, fundamentally, this is a very important bill for Australia.


Given the announcement earlier this year that Holden is going to close and many jobs will be lost in South Australia, I know that former senator Don Farrell was very keen for this bill to pass and for the economic opportunities that it unlocks to be realised in the state of South Australia. As discussed, there is estimated to be some $35 billion worth of resources able to be exploited, and the mining potential of South Australia is a very important part of that state's future. For that reason, I congratulate the government on bringing this idea forward. It is always a welcome thing when the policy vacuum of those opposite is filled with good Labor ideas. So, to have them come into this place and move Labor legislation is a welcome and happy circumstance. Indeed, this must be something that the honourable member for Fadden is getting used to in his Defence portfolio. I note that he is busy implementing Plan Suakin—a very important Labor initiative in the defence space—busy at the moment making sure that the budget settings in Defence that were established by Labor are carefully nurtured by this government and now of course busy making sure that fine Labor legislation passes this House. So to those extents I wish him the very best.

Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden—Assistant Minister for Defence) (09:55):  I present an explanatory memorandum to the bill and move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


The Defence Legislation Amendment (Woomera Prohibited Area) Bill 2014 gives effect to the recommendations of the Hawke review of the Woomera Prohibited Area. The review was established in response to increasing demand for access to the Woomera Prohibited Area by the resources sector and the challenge this posed to Defence activity.


The Hawke review consulted extensively to obtain the views of individuals and groups that had an interest in the future use of the Woomera Prohibited Area. The final review report was released on 4 February 2011 and made a number of recommendations aimed at improving the coexistence of the various parties that had an interest in the Woomera Prohibited Area, the WPA. The focus of the recommendations was to improve the management of the WPA in a way that would meet Defence's testing requirements while creating conditions to make it commercially viable for other sectors, particularly resources, to invest in operations in the WPA.


The WPA is Australia's most important military testing range. It is used for the testing of war materiel under the control of the Royal Australian Air Force. It covers almost 124,000 square kilometres in South Australia, approximately 450 kilometres north-north-west of Adelaide. It is the largest land range in the world, with a centre line of over 600 kilometres, and is comparable in size to England.


At the same time, the WPA overlaps a major part of South Australia's potential for significant minerals and energy resources, including 30 per cent of the Gawler Craton, one of the world's major mineral domains, and the Arckaringa, Officer and Eromanga basins for hydrocarbons and coal. Olympic Dam is adjacent to the WPA and is part of the same geological formations. In fact, the minerals that are known to be found in the area include copper, gold and iron ore. There is high potential for oil, gas and uranium to also be found in the area.


The South Australian government has assessed that over the next decade about $35 billion worth of iron ore, gold and other mineral resources are potentially exploitable from within the WPA.


The Hawke review considered how to use the WPA in a way that ensured that both its full national security and economic potential was realised. The review proposed a system to maximise the coexistence between Defence and non-Defence users of the area.


The review recommended that Defence remain the primary user of the area, but acknowledged that exploitation of the WPA's considerable mineral resources would bring significant economic benefit to South Australia in particular and Australia in general.


And this bill will assist doing just that. There are four mines currently operating within the WPA and the government looks forward to additional mining operations commencing in the near future. Furthermore, the government believes the certainty and clarity of the exclusion periods will assist new operators to appropriately plan around Defence activities.


The review proposed that the WPA be opened up for resources exploration to the maximum extent possible, but within the confines of its primary use for Defence purposes. This will allow companies to take advantage of the resources potential in the WPA while ensuring its future viability as the most important test and evaluation range that supports the Australian Defence Force.


The bill implements existing administrative procedures for non-Defence users to access the WPA in legislation. This regulatory change provides non-Defence users with long-term certainty around their ability to access the WPA and the conditions attached to that access. It also represents an estimated saving of around $690,000 in administrative costs for individual applicants in the resources sector to access the WPA over the next 10 years.


So, as well as providing certainty, this bill is cutting red tape—consistent with this government's drive to rid business of unnecessary impediments to expand, to invest and to employ Australians.


The bill establishes a framework that provides all non-Defence users within the WPA a greater level of certainty over Defence activity in the area and greater certainty over access arrangements.


It allows users to make commercial decisions with some assurance as to when they will be required to leave the area because of Defence activity.


The framework maintains the primacy of the WPA as a national security and defence asset and sets up a coexistence scheme that allows access by non-Defence users subject to conditions that protect the safety of all users in the WPA and ensure the appropriate national security protections for an area used to test Defence capability.


Existing users of the Woomera Prohibited Area, including Indigenous groups, pastoralists, the Tarcoola-Darwin railway owners and operator and existing mining operations, will continue to access and operate under their current arrangements. The coexistence scheme established by the bill will apply to new users of the WPA only.


This means that for non-Defence users, the permit system will allow access to the WPA on a conditional basis (noting that existing users will continue to gain access under their current permissions). The permit conditions put limits on permit holders' access to allow Defence to conduct its testing activities in a manner that is safe and secure.


In order to obtain a permit, individuals must complete a permit application form in order to undertake the activity for which they require access to the WPA. The Woomera Prohibited Area Coordination Office will process the form and issue a permit within the time frames set out in the draft Woomera Prohibited Area rules. Local staff of the Woomera Test Range may also be able to approve some permits for purposes, including emergency access. There are different types of permits—resources exploration and production, opal mining, research, environmental and other (including tourism activities). Once the rules are finalised, the forms will be accessible on the Woomera Prohibited Area Coordination Office website. The forms are likely to be very similar to the forms currently used for access during the transition period.


While the bill provides the overarching framework for the legislative scheme, the detail of the proposed regime is to be included in the WPA rules, to be agreed by the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Industry.


The Woomera Prohibited Area Advisory Board has been established to oversee the Woomera Prohibited Area access system and foster relationships amongst WPA stakeholder groups.


The board's ex-officio members are senior representatives from the Australian government departments of Defence, Industry, and Finance, and the South Australian Department for Manufacturing, Innovation, Trade, Resources and Energy and Defence SA.


The board was established to ensure:


that the balance between economic interests and national security is maintained;


the effectiveness of the access system in safeguarding Defence activities; and


Indigenous and environmental interests are properly accounted for.


The WPA Advisory Board meets on a regular basis to undertake these functions. The roles and functions of the board are to: monitor and recommend amendments to coexistence policies and procedures; develop high-level relationships between Defence and the resources sector; resolve disputes between Defence and non-Defence users; report annually on the balance of interests in the WPA; and conduct a review every seven years of the balance of interests in the WPA.


The board will work with Defence in an endeavour to resolve all reasonable impediments to Defence authorising a permit, and the chair of the advisory board should have the power to refer Defence access conditions to the secretaries of Defence and Industry to seek their review by Defence where necessary.


In broad terms, the bill will authorise the Minister for Defence, with the agreement of the minister responsible for energy and resources, to make the Woomera Prohibited Area rules prescribe certain matters, including defining the Woomera Prohibited Area and the zones to be demarcated within that area. It will create a permit system for access and use by future non-Defence users of the WPA. It will introduce offences and penalties for entering the WPA without permission and for failing to comply with a condition of a permit. An infringement notice scheme and demerit point system will apply to the offence for failing to comply with a permit condition. The details of these schemes will be included in the rules.


There are provisions for compensation for acquisition of property from a person otherwise than on just terms, although the rules may limit the amounts of compensation payable by the Commonwealth. The bill provides that any declaration or action taken under regulation 35 of the Defence Force Regulations 1952 in relation to the WPA is taken to have always been valid. It provides that the rules may limit the amounts of compensation payable by the Commonwealth for loss or damage in the WPA arising from a breach of common law or statutory duty of care in relation to the use of the area for the testing of war materiel.


This bill takes previous attempts to deal with the various interests and stakeholders even further—and does so in a manner that is fair, transparent and predictable.


The bill is an improvement on recent Woomera bills for a number of reasons. For example, in October 2013 the South Australian government raised concerns about potential unintended consequences of the legislation for their land management and economic objectives regarding pastoral leases in the WPA. In particular, it noted that the way the bill was drafted would have the consequential effect that any new holder of an existing pastoral lease would be subject to the new legislation and rules. This was especially relevant in the area designated as the red zone, in which the previous bill stated no new permits will be granted.


Such an approach would have effectively precluded the sale or transfer of pastoral leases in the red zone, to the detriment of both economic activity and the important land management services provided by pastoralists. That, of course, includes maintenance of access roads, water infrastructure and fences, weed control, culling of feral animals, and monitoring and fighting fires.


The government determined that existing pastoral leases could be maintained under current arrangements as 'existing users', including in cases where a pastoral lease is acquired or extended.


The Northern Territory government has raised concerns about the potential for long disruptions to the railway and the impact of that for tourism and freight delivery to the Northern Territory. Current arrangements (under the Defence Force Regulations 1952) allow the minister to suspend permission to access the railway and the Stuart Highway for safety or security for the testing of war materiel—at any time and with no time limit specified. These arrangements have existed in their current form since 1989.


That said, today, rail and road closures occur only for as long as is required to conduct the test and ensure safety or security. This will continue to be the case under the proposed new arrangements. For example, a recent long-range missile test required the suspension of rail traffic through the WPA for a period of three hours on three occasions over a 21-day period. This was done in close cooperation with the rail operator and did not impact on their schedule.


The Tarcoola-Darwin railway owners and operator had raised concerns about their status as 'existing users' of the Woomera Prohibited Area under the Defence Force Regulations 1952 and that the scope of their existing use includes the railway and all associated infrastructure.


The status of the owner and operators of the Tarcoola-Darwin railway as existing users of the Woomera Prohibited Area has been clarified in this bill in section 72TB.


Continuing positive engagement with the rail owners and operators, including the development of a working level agreement, will minimise the effect that any testing activity may have on rail operations and schedules.


This version of the bill includes a technical provision that provides that any declaration or action taken under regulation 35 of the Defence Force Regulations 1952 in relation to the Woomera Prohibited Area is taken to have always been valid.


This provision ensures that any declaration or past act taken under regulation 35 of the Defence Force Regulations 1952 in relation to the Woomera Prohibited Area is taken to have always been valid. This section is inserted to avoid any doubt on the past applicability of the Defence Force Regulations to the Woomera Prohibited Area which may arise as a result of the establishment of the new access regime by the bill.


In order to meet the constitutional requirements to provide just terms compensation, the provision provides that where the declaration or past act would be invalid because of an acquisition of property other than on just terms; the Commonwealth is liable to pay reasonable compensation.


Certainly it has taken some time for this bill to be forthcoming. Developing a policy approach across the Commonwealth and South Australian governments to facilitate non-Defence access to the WPA is a complex task.


The Hawke review of the Woomera Prohibited Area recognised that the passage of legislation can be a lengthy process and consequently identified transitional arrangements to support the introduction of the coexistence model.


Adopting a phased approach to admitting new non-Defence users enabled Defence, in conjunction with the South Australian government, to acquire the capabilities and build the expertise required to manage the complex access control arrangements of the Woomera Prohibited Area.


A moratorium on new users accessing the WPA was put in place from 3 May 2011 through to 5 October 2012, when the transitional phase commenced.


During the moratorium phase, Defence established the joint WPA Coordination Office, and developed the protocols necessary to enable greater access by the resource and energy sectors. Defence consultation and negotiation with industry on the transitional deeds of access allowed for access during the transition phase, and provided the foundation for the future legislative model.


Following the end of the moratorium in October 2012, implementation of the review's recommendations moved into the transition phase. During this time the coordination office progressed the development of draft legislation in support of the coexistence framework.


This important legislation:


establishes a framework that provides non-Defence users within the Woomera Prohibited Area, in particular industry, with a level of certainty over Defence activity in the area;


allows users to make commercial decisions with some assurance as to when they will be requested to leave the area because of Defence activity; and


protects the safety of all users in the Woomera Prohibited Area and to ensure the appropriate national security protections for an area used to test Defence capability.


I commend the bill to the House.

Mr FEENEY
 (Batman) (10:10):  I rise to speak on the Defence Legislation Amendment (Woomera Prohibited Area) Bill 2014. While the content of the bill may be uncontroversial it is nonetheless very important, especially to those in the state of South Australia. I begin my remarks by reiterating the statement made by former Labor senator Don Farrell, who until recently had custody of this bill.

Indigenous groups with current statutory and access rights expressly retain these rights. They will not need to apply for permission under this legislation, which does not disturb existing rights.


Extensive consultation was undertaken by the former Labor government during the review process, which has given rise to this legislation and its various predecessor bills. Submissions were received from interested stakeholders, including the resources industry, Indigenous groups, pastoralists and environmental groups. Consultation on the bill included the release of an information paper on the proposed legislative framework for the Woomera Prohibited Area. The paper provided a general overview of the proposed policy framework proposed for implementation in the legislative package.


On 8 May 2013, an exposure draft of the previous bill introduced by Labor was released for stakeholder feedback. The South Australian government hosted a consultation workshop in Adelaide on 10 May 2013, chaired by the Woomera Prohibited Area Coordination Office, to discuss the bill. Stakeholders provided feedback through the workshop and by written submission. Feedback was considered and, where appropriate, the exposure bill was amended to take concerns into account. Amendments which occurred as a result of stakeholder feedback included express and specific recognition of the existing authorities for existing users, including Indigenous groups.


As the minister touched upon in his remarks, the government of South Australia raised concerns, in its submission to the committee and in the course of consultation, that the bill amendment to regulation 36 of the Defence Force Regulations 1952 will limit an individual's ability to claim compensation for loss or damage caused by Defence testing in the Woomera Prohibited Area. The committee report tabled on 13 May 2014 acknowledged the concerns expressed by the South Australian government and noted that the bill amendment to regulation 36:


… appears limited compared to the existing regulation 36 which provides a broader scope of compensation to those persons who 'suffer loss or damage' as a result of the use of regulation 34 and 35. 


The committee recommended that schedule 1, part 2, item 5 of the bill be removed from the bill or amended to maintain existing rights to compensation under regulation 36 of the Defence Force Regulations 1952. This amendment addresses the committee's recommendation and confirms that compensation will be available in the event that loss or damage is caused by Defence testing, or where there is an acquisition of property.


I congratulate the government on introducing this bill. As Don Farrell said previously: better late than never. Two previous versions of the current bill have been introduced into this parliament. The first was introduced by the former Labor government on 30 May 2013. That bill sadly lapsed when the 43rd Parliament was prorogued on 5 August 2013. Undeterred, however, a second version of the bill was put forward—which was in equivalent terms to the first version—introduced as a private senator's bill on 12 December 2013 by former Labor senator Don Farrell. That bill failed, tragically, because it was a Labor idea, and that excluded it from serious consideration by this government. But the government have now come forward with a bill essentially in precisely the same terms so that they can claim ownership of what is a very fine piece of work and a very important step forward for South Australia. There were a couple of minor changes in the legislation, and they have been spoken of. But, fundamentally, this is a very important bill for Australia.


Given the announcement earlier this year that Holden is going to close and many jobs will be lost in South Australia, I know that former senator Don Farrell was very keen for this bill to pass and for the economic opportunities that it unlocks to be realised in the state of South Australia. As discussed, there is estimated to be some $35 billion worth of resources able to be exploited, and the mining potential of South Australia is a very important part of that state's future. For that reason, I congratulate the government on bringing this idea forward. It is always a welcome thing when the policy vacuum of those opposite is filled with good Labor ideas. So, to have them come into this place and move Labor legislation is a welcome and happy circumstance. Indeed, this must be something that the honourable member for Fadden is getting used to in his Defence portfolio. I note that he is busy implementing Plan Suakin—a very important Labor initiative in the defence space—busy at the moment making sure that the budget settings in Defence that were established by Labor are carefully nurtured by this government and now of course busy making sure that fine Labor legislation passes this House. So to those extents I wish him the very best.

Ms VAMVAKINOU
 (Calwell) (13:30):  This July marks 10 years since the International Court of Justice handed down its advisory opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of Israel's wall in the occupied Palestinian territory. The court determined that the wall and all Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem and the West Bank are illegal, and that the fourth Geneva Convention applies to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in full.


The Parliamentary Friends of Palestine hosted a forum yesterday commemorating the 10th anniversary of the ICJ, and our guest speaker was Professor Ben Saul from the University of Sydney. This event was timely, given the tragic situation in Gaza at the moment. It is devastating that Israel has decided to resume air strikes in the Gaza Strip following the collapse of the very short-lived ceasefire. Tragically for the people in Gaza, the eight-day conflict has already killed almost 200 Palestinians, 100 of whom were civilians, amongst them 31 children. With Hamas militants defying Arab and Western calls to cease rocket attacks, and with Israel threatening to step up an offensive that could include an invasion of this most densely populated enclave, it is imperative that both sides now show restraint in what is a devastating blow to peace prospects and what is also a predictable, disproportionate and cruel attack on the Palestinians in Gaza.


We as a parliament should all be very concerned about this situation. I also believe that we as a parliament should be speaking up and voicing our concern about a situation in the Middle East that could have tragic and dire consequences if it does not come to some sort of end.

Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (19:30):  On 3 July our Prime Minister stated:


I guess our country owes its existence to a form of foreign investment by the British Government in the then unsettled or scarcely settled great south land.


Tonight I wish to explain why the Prime Minister's comments are wrong, are out of touch and are disrespectful to Aboriginal people in my community and throughout Australia.


Kingsford-Smith is blessed with some magnificent coastline and some of Australia's most famous beaches. One of those is the beautiful Coogee Beach. The name Coogee is said to derive from the Aboriginal word 'Koojah', which means the smell of the seaweed drying in Bidgigal language. It is a reference to decaying seaweed and kelp that throughout history and still to this day regularly washes up onto Coogee Beach. The place name of this beautiful little beach, and the suburb that surrounds it, indicates a settled Aboriginal term for this place—a name or a reference that clearly pre-dates English colonisation and is evidence of a well-established language in the area.


If you travel down the coast of my electorate, the next beach you encounter is Maroubra with its powerful surf and at times dangerous rips. The name Maroubra is believed to derive from 'Moorooberah', the name of the leader of the Aboriginal community who lived at a beach a few miles south of Koojah at the time of colonisation. Indeed, the bay in which the English first set foot on the Great South Land to establish a colony, and which remarkably the French entered a matter of days later—Botany Bay—has a local Aboriginal name, 'Kamay'. The wonderful suburb surrounding it of La Perouse, in the south of my electorate, is known as 'Curiwal' in local Aboriginal language.


These were, and in some cases still are, settled, customary, locally known terms to describe places in our community in a language that is older than the English language. How dare the Prime Minister deny that custom, that heritage, that culture and that language which have existed in our community for thousands of years and have been passed through generations—accepted, respected and adopted as the names of our communities' suburbs, beaches and bays. I recognise that Australia was settled prior to English colonisation and that Aboriginal culture, language and heritage is proof of this. We have the longest continuing culture in the world. We should be proud of this, and not deny it.


I was fortunate to be born and bred in Maroubra, as was my father, my grandfather and my great grandfather. Four generations of family connection make it my home, but that is not a patch on the family connections of local Aboriginal families, whose relatives have been living in our community for 7,000 years. Countless generations of people developed, nurtured, passed on customs, language, laws and heritage that importantly still exist today and which our community celebrated last week as part of NAIDOC Week.


These are principles that not only still exist today but have also been recognised by the High Court of Australia through the Mabo decision; have been enshrined in Australia's native title laws; and should be recognised in the Australian Constitution. This is why our Prime Minister was wrong when he stated that our land was not settled prior to English investment.


I pay tribute to the Aboriginal people of our community whose ancestors have called our area their home for thousands of years, whose language has given us our cherished suburb names and whose heritage and customs we respect. You deserve more from our nation's Prime Minister.

Ms KATE ELLIS
 (Adelaide) (09:30):  I rise today to share with the parliament the experience of a recent visit that I undertook to Roma Mitchell Secondary College, a school in the inner northern part of Adelaide which is doing a remarkable job educating many of the students from my electorate. Earlier this year, I had the chance to visit with Bill Shorten as well as with the member for Makin, Tony Zappia, and see what incredible results this school was returning in just its fourth year since it opened. We know that this school has incredibly excellent facilities at three campuses—a co-ed campus, a girl's campus and a campus for students with disabilities. But we also know that since it opened in 2011, the team of dedicated leaders at the school, the passionate teachers at the school and the broader school community have been able to bring about some hugely impressive improvements. For example, in 2013, the SACE completion at the co-ed and the girls' campuses of Roma Mitchell Secondary College was 91.48 per cent. To put this into context, this is an improvement of 34.3 per cent over just three years, something which I would imagine would be unrivalled by schools around Australia.


In 2013, 12 of the students received an ATAR score in the 90s, and over 80 students received offers to university and TAFE. They offer specialist sport programs in cycling, in hockey and in soccer, an Aboriginal sports training academy, a gifted and talented program, international programs, vocational education and training programs and a range of other specialist services.


Last year a team made up of three year 8 and four year 9 students from the gifted and talented classes won the Tournament of the Minds engineering challenge that was held at Flinders University. They were the first public school students to win this challenge since 1994, something they should be absolutely congratulated for. We also know that this year they started to deliver the International Baccalaureate middle-years program to the year 8s. Within the next three years, all students in years 8 to 10 will be studying this program. This is a result of incredibly dedicated teachers and the school community.


I would like to thank principal, Sandy Richardson, and deputy principal, Karen Fitzpatrick, for hosting Bill Shorten, myself and Tony Zappia. I note the added challenges I gave them by having a freshly broken leg at the time and hobbling around on crutches and I thank them for their kindness. But even more so, I thank them for the incredible job that they are doing educating the students of our Adelaide community. These results speak of their dedication and their passion. They should be congratulated, and I wish them all the very best for continued success into the future.

"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2014-07-16,"



Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari) (10:00):  It is with great sadness that I stand in this parliament today to express my, and I know the parliament's, condolences to the family, friends and comrades of Lance Corporal Todd Chidgey. Lance Corporal Todd Chidgey's service to the Australian Army included six tours to Afghanistan from 2008 through to this year. These were Operation Slipper, Afghanistan, May to July 2014; Operation Slipper, Afghanistan, March 2014; Operation Slipper, Afghanistan, October to November 2013; Operation Slipper, July to December 2012; Operation Slipper, February to July 2010; and Operation Slipper, June to November 2008.


I have spoken in this place many times now, sadly, about the death of Australian soldiers while on service overseas, and I do not think we should underestimate the work which this man has done. He was from the 2nd Commando Regiment, a special forces unit which does great and special work for us. Unfortunately, the broader Australian community have no real idea—and dare I say most members of this parliament have no real idea either. I am fortunate to have had an insight into the work of the commandos and other special forces units, as well as all of our men and women in uniform overseas, during the period in which I was a minister in the defence portfolio in the previous government. I have the utmost respect for these men and women who wear this uniform on our behalf, and particularly these men and women of the special forces who do such difficult, dangerous and often tragic work.


Can I express my condolences—and I know my family's and I am sure the parliament's—to Todd's family: his mum, Kerrie Baker; his dad, Wayne Chidgey; his partner, Karla Hosie; his brothers, Paul and Adam; and his niece, Kayla. Of course, I also express my deep condolences to his comrades in the 2nd Commando Regiment. That regiment, sadly, has had many losses during this war in the Middle East Area of Operations—in this case in Afghanistan—over what is now some years.


We know that Lance Corporal Todd Chidgey is now peaceful and at rest. He was farewelled by his mates during a private memorial service held at Kabul International Airport, and he is now being laid to rest at home on the Central Coast. The Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, attended the funeral representing us and the people of Australia.


Everyone who knew Todd talks about his loyalty. His family have written a wonderful statement about their love for this brave young man. He was a loyal son; he was a loyal brother; he was an absolutely loyal teammate, a professional soldier from 2 Commando Regiment.


I know, having observed the reaction of 2nd Commando and other units across the Defence Force when one of their members is lost, they will continue to swing behind and give support to Lance Corporal Chidgey's family. He was a man who was very highly respected by his colleagues. They described him as:


… a brilliant bloke to know and work with, who was loyal to the core and would do anything for his mates. He was a consummate professional and a dedicated soldier. Lance Corporal Chidgey was one of the hardest working members of the Regiment, who never sought recognition or reward.


It may be true he never sought recognition or reward but it is worth stating what he was awarded because it says a lot about what he dedicated himself to and the service he gave.


Lance Corporal Chidgey was awarded: Australian Active Service Medal with Clasp International Coalition Against Terrorism; Afghanistan Campaign Medal; Australian Service Medal with Clasp Counter Terrorism/Special Recovery; Australian Defence Medal; NATO non-article 5 Medal with Clasp ISAF; Multiple Tour Indicator 3 North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, International Security Assistance Force; Soldiers Medallion; Infantry Combat Badge; and the Returned from Active Service Badge.


I think it is worth reflecting that as we approach the centenary of Anzac, we are now paying homage, giving our respect to and saying goodbye to another man who will join the great pantheon of those who have been lost to us while serving overseas proudly wearing an Australian uniform in the cause of peace and justice and in the knowledge that they are fighting to safeguard our national security. Todd, you have now returned to us from active service. We thank you for your service. Rest in peace.

Mrs WICKS
 (Robertson) (10:07):  I share the member for Lingiari's sentiments and I join with him today to express the gratitude of the Central Coast and indeed of our nation to Lance Corporal Todd Chidgey. We express our deep sadness and sorrow at the death of a fine soldier, who died in Afghanistan on 1 July. I take this opportunity to express my deep condolence to Lance Corporal Chidgey's parents, to his brothers and to his partner. All Australians share their grief and our hearts go out to them.


There is no greater sacrifice an Australian can make than to give his life in the service of his country. Lance Corporal Chidgey was held in high regard by his unit in Afghanistan and by his mates. His loss will be deeply felt by all who knew him, as a loyal mate and as a talented and professional soldier. His colleagues have described him as a brilliant bloke to know and work with, loyal to the core and someone who would do anything for his mates.


Serving as part of the Protective Security Detachment, he was considered a consummate professional and a hardworking, dedicated soldier. Lance Corporal Chidgey deployed on six tours to Afghanistan ranging from two weeks to six months, and he never sought recognition or reward. Yet, since joining the Australian Army in 2006, Lance Corporal Chidgey received a number of honours and awards.


We have indeed lost one of our finest. In the words of Special Operations Commander Australia, Brigadier Dan McDaniel, at a solemn ceremony at the Royal Australian Air Force Base in Richmond last week, Lance Corporal Chidgey was loyal, diligent and committed to the service of his country, his mates and his family. Brigadier McDaniel said he will be missed but never forgotten by the 2nd Commando Regiment and wider Special Operations Command community. May I add that he will also never be forgotten by the people of my electorate of Robertson, by the people the Central Coast, who know and respect the contribution of soldiers past and present.


Twenty-nine-year-old Lance Corporal Chidgey was born in Gosford. The funeral took place yesterday on the Central Coast. I understand there were around 450 mourners in attendance, including the Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, and the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten. These moments remind us all of the great bravery, courage and dedication of the men and women of the Australian Defence Force. All operational deaths are a tragedy. Today my deepest condolences are extended to Lance Corporal Chidgey's family, friends and fellow soldiers at this very difficult time. His colleagues in Afghanistan are also in my thoughts. Their contribution to peace and to our national security will forever be remembered. May he rest in peace.

Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (10:10):  It is with great sadness I join with my colleagues today to pay tribute to the late Lance Corporal Todd Chidgey of the 2nd Commando Regiment, who died in Afghanistan on 1 July this year, just 29 years old. In doing so, I thank him for the service and the sacrifice he has made for Australia in helping to secure our nation and in preserving democracy throughout the world.


Lance Corporal Chidgey was born in Gosford, New South Wales, in 1985. He joined the Australian Army in March 2006 under the Special Forces Direct Recruiting Scheme. On completion of his initial employment training he was posted to the then 4th Battalion Commando, the Royal Australian Regiment, now the 2nd Commando Regiment, in September 2006. Lance Corporal Chidgey deployed on six tours to Afghanistan ranging from two weeks to six months. 


Lance Corporal Chidgey's colleagues in the 2nd Commando Regiment have described him as a brilliant bloke to know and work with, who was loyal to the core and would do anything for his mates. A consummate professional and a dedicated soldier, Lance Corporal Chidgey was one of the hardest working members of the regiment who never sought recognition or reward. The commanding officer of the 2nd Commando Regiment, whose identity is protected, spoke of Lance Corporal Chidgey as a dedicated commando and loyal friend to his mates at the regiment. He said: 


Todd was the kind of soldier and person who would do anything for his mates.


Todd was a dedicated and committed Commando, who served his country, his unit and the Australian community. We should celebrate his service, his life and his contribution to ensure a better world and keep this in our minds as we mourn his passing.


It is the nature of commandos that aspects of their work, their actions and often their identities must not be disclosed. Many times before in this place I have spoken about the special bond that exists within commando regiments. When a soldier joins the commandos, he and his family are commandos for life. The commandos are more like a brotherhood than any other regiment I know, so when one of their fellow commandos dies in action it is like losing a brother. Today I would like to pass on my sympathies to the 2nd Commando Regiment. I know that you have lost a brother and I also know that Lance Corporal Chidgey's family will take comfort from the ongoing support they will receive from you—I know they will continue to provide ongoing support; I have seen it in the past—and the love and respect that you have shown their son.


Lance Corporal Chidgey's family have said that they will remember Todd as the consummate gentleman, a son and a brother who was well mannered, who was loyal and always there for his family. They have said he never forgot a birthday and he was extremely generous. If you were his friend, he would stick by you. He was a champion of the underdog. My deepest sympathies and respect go to Lance Corporal Todd Chidgey's mother, his father, his brothers, his partner, his extended family and friends and his fellow commandos. Australia will never forget his sacrifice. May he rest in peace.

Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden—Assistant Minister for Defence) (10:14):  I thank the good member here to my right for allowing me to jump ahead of him on this important condolence motion for a fine Australian soldier, Lance Corporal Todd Chidgey. As President John F Kennedy once said, 'A nation reveals itself not only by the men it produces but also by the men it honours and the men it remembers.' So today I stand here on behalf of the government with a sense of pride and a sense of solemn sadness to pay tribute to and to remember a man who has revealed the very best of us—the very best of our country. We pay tribute to Lance Corporal Todd Chidgey—the 41st Australian to die in Afghanistan in the service of us, the people of Australia. I pass on the government's sincere and heartfelt sympathy and support to his family—his mother, Kerrie, his older brother, Paul, and his younger brother, Adam.


Todd was 29 years old. He was born in Gosford, New South Wales. On Remembrance Day this year, Todd will join the thousands of other Australian soldiers, sailors and airmen and women to have their names inscribed on the honour roll of the Australian War Memorial. His name will join the many other names in that place; his name will join a company of heroes—men and women whose lives were shortened because of a call for patriotic duty. His name will forever be enshrined on a bronze panel so that generations will know that brave men stood and fought against tyranny.


As people walk beside those bronze panels, it is instructive that we all remember that behind every name is a story of patriotism and bravery, is a story of grief and loss, is a story of communities that have lost their men and their women, is a story of brothers and sisters alone, is a story of families that have lost a part of them. Australia does not forget those who fight and serve; we remember them—not because we glorify war but because we commemorate those who have fought in the pursuit of peace.


Lance Corporal Todd Chidgey joined the Australian Army in March 2006, apparently to the surprise of his family. He joined under the Special Forces Direct Recruiting Scheme. On completion of his IET—initial employment training—he was posted to the 4th Battalion, the Royal Australian Regiment, of which I am an honorary member and which is now called the 2nd Commando Regiment, in September the same year. Lance Corporal Chidgey deployed on six tours in Afghanistan, and colleagues from the 2nd Commando Regiment have described him as 'a brilliant bloke to know and to work with, who was loyal to the core and would do anything for his mates'. His mother and brother remember him as a 'consummate gentleman', a man who loved his work and enjoyed the discipline, structure and camaraderie of life in the Army.


In terms of his service, Todd was awarded: the Australian Active Service Medal with the ICAT clasp; the Afghanistan Campaign Medal; the Australian Service Medal with the Counter-Terrorism and Special Recovery clasp; the Australia Defence Medal; the NATO Medal with International Security Assistance Force, or ISAF, clasp; the multiple tour indicator for the NATO International Security Assistance Force; the Soldiers Medallion; the ICB; and, of course, the Returned from Active Service Badge. He was a well-decorated soldier, a great junior leader.


He, and others like him, are ordinary men and ordinary women, but they rise to meet face on the extraordinary danger our nation puts them in and they rise to meet the challenge. They are ordinary men and women rising to do extraordinary things. This House will never forget that they have mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, sons and daughters. They voluntarily leave the safety and comfort of their homes to serve on our behalf, to fight tyranny, to ensure justice and to fulfil a long-held dream of citizens of the world that a promise of safety and security is not abstract but can be tangibly real. I am sure I speak for many in this place, and so many who are within its wider walls outside of our parliamentary colleagues, when I say we are immensely proud of this young digger, Lance Corporal Chidgey. We thank his family for their sacrifice of a son and their sacrifice of a brother. Lance Corporal Chidgey died in the service of his country—be under no doubt of that. With six tours in eight years, that man knew what it meant to serve. He will be remembered as much for being a servant of our nation as a warrior for the cause of peace. We will remember him.

Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (10:19):  I rise to contribute to the debate on the Prime Minister's condolence motion on the passing of Lance Corporal Todd Chidgey. Lance Corporal Chidgey was a respected and professional soldier serving his sixth tour of duty in Afghanistan. He served with the 2nd Commando Regiment, based in Holsworthy, in the electorate that I proudly represent here in the federal parliament, as well as with its previous incarnation, 4RAR. The 2nd Commandos are the elite of the elite—a professional team who serve on the front line and beyond; a unit which carries above its weight in combat duties due to exceptional skill, professionalism and courage, for which it is internationally known and respected. The 2nd Commando Regiment has correspondingly suffered a large share of casualties, and with each of those we feel deeply as a community. 


Lance Corporal Chidgey lived a life dedicated to serving our nation with distinction. Our thoughts go to his family back in Gosford, who have our deepest sympathies for the loss of their beloved son and brother. Lance Corporal Chidgey was deeply respected by his colleagues who described him as 'a brilliant bloke to know and to work with'. He was someone who was loyal to the core, and someone who I think would do anything for his mates. To my mind, he seemed the kind of man who wanted to make the world a better place. His six tours of Afghanistan will have contributed greatly to that goal.


When the final soldier departs Afghanistan we should look back at what we have achieved, and I believe the greatest achievement concerns the education of young girls. We know that in 2001 there were only one million children in Afghanistan in school, and almost none of them were girls. We know today there are over three million young girls receiving an education in Afghanistan. This not only brings benefits to those people individually; that education benefits Afghanistan's society. What those kids get from being educated will be passed on for years and years down the track. That is perhaps our greatest achievement—something we all should be proud of, just as we should be proud of the sacrifice of Lance Corporal Todd Chidgey.

 (Ryan) (10:22):  I rise to pay tribute to a man who has served his nation proudly since first enlisting in the Army on 8 March 2006. As the Prime Minister said in the House on Monday, Lance Corporal Todd Chidgey died on 1 July while on his sixth tour of Afghanistan. Lance Corporal Chidgey is Australia's 41st soldier lost in 13 years of involvement in Afghanistan.


Twenty-nine-year-old Lance Corporal Chidgey was born in Gosford, New South Wales, in 1985. He joined the Australian Army in March 2006 under the Special Forces Direct Recruiting Scheme, and they only take the best of the best. On completion of his initial employment training he was posted to the then 4th Battalion Commando, the Royal Australian Regiment, now the 2nd Commando Regiment, in September 2006. Lance Corporal Chidgey deployed on six tours to Afghanistan, ranging from two weeks to six months. During the ceremony, Army chief, Lieutenant General David Morrison, said:


Lance Corporal Chidgey died while in the service of our nation in an operational theatre, and today we are honouring this service as we grieve his passing … Chidgey's mates now mourn his loss alongside his mother, father, brothers and partner. He will be missed but never forgotten by the 2nd Commando Regiment, and wider Special Operations command community.


Chidgey had dedicated his life to serving Australia, and was described by his comrades as a fine Australian soldier who had dedicated his life to serving his country and one of the hardest-working members of the regiment. Lance Corporal Chidgey will be remembered as a brilliant bloke to know and work with, who was loyal to the core and would do anything for his mates. Others who knew him will remember him for his professionalism and his strong work ethic and composure under fire. I would like to express my profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. Chidgey's family described him as a true gentleman and champion of the underdog; a man for whom family was everything.


Those who risk their lives for our nation deserve a special mention in our history books. Our greatest sympathies must go to those families who lose their loved ones to war. Lance Corporal Todd Chidgey will always be remembered and our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends. Lest we forget.

I never knew the man but we have covered his career and people's perceptions of him from around the place. He had completed six tours of Afghanistan ranging from two weeks to anything up to six months, and he was still only 29 years old. We have lost one of our very best soldiers, but we have also lost a great person.


I would like to assure his family that his child will be looked after by Legacy. I think it is appropriate at this time that we pause to reflect on the role that Legacy plays in our community, because people coming through today will deflect the importance of Legacy. We have lost our 41st soldier and the role of Legacy in our community will ensure that his child has a great life, remembers and respects his or her dad, and is given every opportunity, because Lance Corporal Todd Chidgey has lost his life in service to Australia. I think we should always remember the role of Legacy. 


My condolences go to Lance Corporal Todd Chidgey's family. To all who serve: those of us in this place have seen the worst of it but we have also seen and heard the best of it. I have a nephew who has just signed up to join the Army. He is doing it with great pride and he is looking forward to it. I think to serve your nation is a great role. But we have lost one of our best. To Lance Corporal Todd Chidgey: you will not be forgotten. You will always be revered. You will have a place in our hearts forever. And to his family, again, my personal condolences and those of everyone in this House. May he rest in peace. Lest we forget.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) (10:28):  The body of fallen commando Lance Corporal Todd Chidgey has been paid its last respects. He has returned home and he was buried yesterday with full honours, as he should be. When he passed away, Chief of Army, Lieutenant General David Morrison, said that Lance Corporal Chidgey was a loyal mate and a talented and professional soldier, and his loss would be deeply felt by all who knew him. He said:


He died while in the service of our nation in an operational theatre, and today we are honouring this service as we grieve his passing.


Lance Corporal Chidgey died in a non-combat related incident in Kabul, Afghanistan, on 1 July 2014. He was a member of the Australian Defence Force headquarters in Kabul serving as part of the protective security detachment providing protection for a senior Australian officer. He was from the 2nd Commando Regiment. He was born in Gosford, New South Wales, and he was 29 years young.


I just heard the eloquent speech given by the previous speaker, the member for Herbert, who talked about the great dedication of this fine soldier, and also the fine work that Legacy does in helping families in the grieving process and many years after the passing of any of our brave warriors. Certainly, Legacy will be there in the hours of need in the days, the weeks, the months and the years ahead.


Lance Corporal Chidgey joined the Australian Army in March 2006 under the Special Forces Direct Recruiting Scheme following initial training at Army Recruit Training Centre Kapooka. I am joined in the chamber by a former commandant of that fine establishment, the now member for Bass, Andrew Nikolic. He was the head of the ARTC at Kapooka in 2004 and 2005. He knows full well the dedication, the service, the sacrifice—all the attributes that make fine soldiers and which are passed on to those men and women who pass through Blamey Barracks at Kapooka. He knows because he saw it in the eyes of those recruits as they marched out proudly, the sun gleaming on the bright buttons on their wonderful khaki uniforms at those great passing out parades. Certainly, there are no finer people in this nation than those who don a khaki uniform, those who don any military uniform, in the service of our great nation.


Lance Corporal Chidgey's postings included the 4th Battalion Commando, the Royal Australian Regiment and the 2nd Commando Regiment. He also received a number of honours and awards since joining the Australian Army, such was his dedication, such was his great service.


At the time of his death—as I said, 29 years young—he was enlisted on his sixth tour of Afghanistan. We should just reflect on that: 29 years young; six tours of that strife-torn, war-torn country. His death in Kabul brings the total number of Australian soldiers who have died in Afghanistan to 41 since 2002: 41 families left to grieve, 41 sets of friends left to grieve, and the Australian Army, a family in itself, mourning the loss of those fine warriors.


He was a fine Australian soldier, who dedicated his adult life to serving our country. He was regarded for his professionalism, his strong work ethic and his composure under fire. He was farewelled yesterday at a service on the Central Coast, his home district, where his commanding officer described him very appropriately as a dedicated commando and as a loyal friend, the kind of person who would do anything for his mates. 'We should celebrate his service, his life and his contribution to ensure a better world and keep this in our minds as we mourn his passing,' his commanding officer said. Mateship, honour, service, sacrifice—they all embody the spirit of Anzac. They all encompass what those fine recruits from Kapooka do when they pull on the khaki uniform.


Lance Corporal Chidgey's family described him as a man who put his family first. He would often be found enjoying time with his brothers or cheering on his favourite National Rugby League side, the Canterbury Bulldogs, with his family and friends. That is what he loved doing. He also loved being beside his mates in the Army. He loved doing what he could to make this world a better place. Lest we forget.

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari) (10:39):  I am pleased to be able to make a contribution to this debate. I want to thank the people in the Library for their Bills Digest which gives us all the information we need to be able to make a meaningful contribution. It is a technical piece of legislation which opens up for other uses the Woomera Prohibited Area. The bill provides for the making of the Woomera Prohibited Area rules by the minister which will include, amongst other things, zones which are to be demarcated within that area. It creates a permit system for access to and use by non-Defence users of the Woomera Prohibited Area. It introduces offences and penalties for entering the Woomera Prohibited Area without permission, for failing to comply with the conditions of a permit, and provides for compensation for acquisition of property from a person otherwise than on just terms that results from the operation of the new part VIB of the Defence Act 1903.


I want to talk about an example of what the Woomera Prohibited Area can actually facilitate. I was sadly and very unfortunately given my marching orders out of this place by the people of the Northern Territory in 1996 for a relatively short period of time. I was back again in 1998. During the intervening period, one of the jobs I had was working with a legal firm and a company called Kistler Aerospace, negotiating native title over Woomera on their behalf so that they could launch rockets from Woomera. The idea was to have rockets which would be returned to earth. Sadly, it never eventuated, but it demonstrated to me the enormous value of this property in terms of defence and other interests, and there was its special location in terms of space programs. As a former minister in the defence portfolio, I am aware of the use of the Woomera Prohibited Area for research purposes. I could name a number of research programs that have been held there. A very important capacity for the Australian nation is provided by this Woomera Prohibited Area.


This bill is designed to open up the capacity of the area to be used by other users and to facilitate, potentially, access to its mineral wealth most particularly. But I think the people of Australia need to understand that here we have a real jewel in developing our defence capacity and our national security. I do not think it is commonly understood. I want to pay tribute to the people in Defence who have the responsibility of managing and administering this particular area.


As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, I live in Alice Springs, which is a little bit up the road. It is common ground, in a sense. As you know, if you fire rockets out of Woomera and they head north, they will come across, potentially, south-east Queensland or the Northern Territory. What happens at Woomera could eventually impact upon communities right across northern Australia, but most particularly, in my case, in the Northern Territory.


There has been a long history of engagement with the community by defence over this Woomera Prohibited Area. It is the largest overland, long-range weapons testing facility in the world, having been operational since 1947, and it covers 127,000 square kilometres of northern South Australia. It is no small bit of property, but, like other parts of Australia which are being used for defence purposes—and I speak of ranges in the Northern Territory used principally for the Army, but also for the Air Force and potentially for the Navy—these areas are of great value to us. I think that, when we are having discussions around our national security and the development of options for our national security, we need to understand the importance of these areas of land and the need to look after them properly in the first instance, to make sure we are good environmental guardians, to make sure we are good neighbours to and partners with Aboriginal people who might be the traditional owners or the native title holders for those areas, and to make sure that we facilitate the use of those areas in a way which is in line with our national interest. I note that this piece of legislation does precisely that.


So I think it is a pleasing piece of legislation. I note that it was prepared during the course of the last parliament, and was developed largely in response to work which had been initiated by the former defence minister John Faulkner, who called for a review to make recommendations about the best use of the Woomera Prohibited Area in the national interest. The final report of that review of the prohibited area—which was undertaken by Dr Allan Hawke, a former very senior public servant and adviser to former governments out of the Defence portfolio—was published on 4 February 2011 and made 65 recommendations. Within its numerous recommendations it outlined a coexistence model so that, whilst Defence maintained primacy over the WPA, non-Defence users would have clarity regarding their access to specified areas of operation incorporating both the available location and time of use.


Recommendation 14 suggested the division of the WPA into three zones: a red zone for exclusive Defence use, an amber zone for regular defence use and a green zone for occasional defence use. By implementing a zonal timeshare arrangement, Defence was able to allocate exclusion windows throughout the year limiting the non-Defence use of the prohibited area. And that makes sense because, as I say, it is 127,000 square kilometres—it is a large area of land—and, whilst there are parts of that property which could not be and should not be used by other users, there are other parts of the property where people should be able to have access to that use.


I go back to the issue of Woomera being used as a rocket-launching facility, for example. Had that proceeded, it would have meant Australia getting access to technology for rocket launching which it currently does not have. It would have meant Australia getting access to technology, via the United States, in terms of a launch facility that would have been unique to us. Sadly it did not proceed but, nevertheless, it just shows that this property is of great intrinsic value and that we need to make sure that it is used for the purpose for which the Commonwealth acquired it in 1947 and has used it since then. But at the same time we need to understand that there is not necessarily any essential conflict between that primary purpose and the objectives of providing other people with the capacity to use it.


I note that the shadow minister and his contribution in the main chamber talked about Woomera Prohibited Area overlapping a major part of South Australia's potential for significant minerals and energy resources, including 30 per cent of the Gawler Craton, one of the world's major mineral domains; and the Arckaringa, Officer, and Eromanga basins for hydrocarbons and coal. And, of course, we know that Olympic Dam is adjacent to the Woomera Prohibited Area and is part of the same geological formations. The South Australian government has assessed that over the next decade about $35 billion worth of iron ore, gold, and other mineral resources are potentially exploitable from within the Woomera Prohibited Area.


That is all well and good and I hope that they are able to develop some of those resources and are able to get the value out of them. But I just want to re-emphasise the importance of this place for science and as a property to use for the development of new ways of doing business. I want to commend the work that is being done there on a continuing basis by the Defence Science and Technology Organisation. The work they do is so vital for our national interest but goes below the radar, if I might put it like that in this context. It is often and mostly unrecognised by the general community but vital to developing our national defence capacity and looking after our national security interests. This gives me an opportunity to say to those wonderful people at the Defence Science and Technology Organisation how much we value your work, how much we know that you do on our behalf through dint of your brains and by working collaboratively with people from other nations in developing new ways of doing business, exploiting new technologies and using Woomera as an integral part of that space for testing, for demonstrations and the like. I could speak on this for a long time; I know it would bore many. It does not bore me—though perhaps I could put myself to sleep, and people say I often should. Nevertheless, I do want to applaud the government for bringing forward this legislation and putting it through the parliament. It is an important piece of legislation, but I do want to make sure that we emphasise the vital national interests that we have in this Woomera Prohibited Area.

"Nikolic, Andrew, MP",LP,2014-07-16,"



Mr NIKOLIC
 (Bass) (10:50):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Defence Legislation Amendment (Woomera Prohibited Area) Bill 2013. Like the member for Lingiari, I have personal and practical experience with this area. I know the Woomera defence range facilities and the surrounding region very well. As the member for Lingiari quite rightly points out, Woomera offers a world-class live range facility, particularly for rockets and associated large propellant weapons. But it is equally and increasingly attractive to a range of diverse stakeholders. For obvious reasons, this means that the legislation, rules and protocols that delineate its use must be made lawful, clear and relevant to changing circumstances, particularly for the protection of competing and multiple users.


This amendment bill gives effect to the recommendations of the 2011 Hawke review of the Woomera Prohibited Area. Regrettably, this was followed by two years of inaction; no bill was produced and I think it is fair to say there was less than adequate consultation. So this bill is very welcome indeed and is about finding a sensible middle ground in relation to the current and future use of Woomera by both military and non-military users. Achieving this will improve the management of the Woomera Prohibited Area in a way that meets defence's equipment testing requirements while also giving greater certainty of access, particularly for the resources sector.


Accordingly, the purpose of this bill is to amend the Defence Act to establish a framework which allows access to the Woomera Prohibited Area by non-defence users on a controlled, conditional basis. The general purpose of the bill can be reduced to four key objectives: first, to provide for the making of the Woomera Prohibited Area rules by the minister which will include, amongst other things, zones that are demarcated within the area; second, to create a permit system by which non-Defence users can access the WPA; third, the introduction of offences and penalties for entering the WPA without permission and for failing to comply with the conditions of permit; and, fourth, to provide compensation for an acquisition of property for a person otherwise than on just terms that results from the operation of the amended Defence Act 1903.


The lineage of this bill includes two previous versions. The first was introduced by the former Labor government on 30 May 2013 and that bill lapsed when the 43rd Parliament was prorogued on 5 August 2013. The second version, effectively an equivalent mirror iteration of the first, was introduced by ALP Senator Don Farrell as a private senator's bill on 12 December 2013 and that second version of the bill does not appear to be proceeding. This current bill differs from those earlier versions, most particularly in proposing and elaborating in detail on the Commonwealth's intended adoption and regulation of a coexistence model of intended future use.


For those who are unfamiliar with Woomera, I would like to briefly provide some key background and links to the provisions in this bill. The 127,000 kilometre expanse of northern South Australia which is known as the Woomera Prohibited Area is the world's largest overland long-range weapons testing facility and has been operating since 1947. However, since the 1980s, areas have been made increasingly available to non-defence users, including the resources sector. Local Indigenous groups and pastoral lease holders also have an enduring presence across much of the WPA, and clearly this competition between diverse and legitimate interest groups for land at Woomera could not continue unchecked. To this end, on 17 May 2010, the then Minister for Defence, Senator John Faulkner, called for a review to 'make recommendations about the best use of the WPA in the national interest'.


This brings us to the present day and this amendment bill: the latest iteration of an extensive process of consultation and review which is aimed ultimately at providing fair access to Commonwealth land at Woomera by diverse parties for disparate purposes, both civil and military alike. In short, Woomera is big, but so is business at Woomera, both civil and military, and this amendment bill seeks to make it more productive, efficient and safer.


In particular, three additional issues warrant the chamber's attention. They are, first, the actual review process itself and its outcomes leading up to this bill; second, future administrative arrangements that complement these outcomes; and, third, the financial implications of proposed action, including compensation for the acquisition of private land by the government. I will talk first about the review process. As the member for Lingiari said, the most recent review was lead by Dr Allan Hawke who, as a former secretary of the Department of Defence, was eminently placed to do so. His report, The review of the Woomera Prohibited Area—final report, was published on 4 February 2011, made 65 recommendations, including perhaps most importantly the common sense and practical benefits of moving to a model of coexistence, whereby Defence continues to retain primacy of the WPA but non-Defence users are provided greater clarity regarding access.


Dr Hawke's work proposed the division of the WPA into three zones: a red zone, which is for exclusive defence use only, an amber zone for regular defence use, and a green zone for occasional defence use. By effectively implementing a zonal time share arrangement, Defence is allocated exclusive windows throughout the year, thereby limiting the non-Defence use of the WPA. Let me reiterate that the new framework maintains the primacy of the Woomera Prohibited Area as a national security and Defence asset.


Access by non-Defence users would be allowed in a number of ways. For new non-Defence users, total exclusion within the red zone, to up to 56 exclusion days in the green zone, pending appropriate notice. The excluded red zone comprises only about eight per cent of the WPA, while the vast majority, some 75 per cent, is in fact designated as the most accessible green zone. Importantly, the Hawke review further recommended that 'existing mining operations, environmental organisations, Indigenous groups and pastoralists with an extant presence on the WPA should continue to operate under their current access arrangements unless they choose to be administered under the proposed coexistence model'.


This bill also protects existing Woomera Prohibited Area users, including Indigenous groups, pastoralists, the Tarcoola-Darwin railway operators and owners, and existing mining operations. The practical administrative arrangement proposed to complement stakeholder coexistence is equally sensible and straightforward. This bill creates a system for the administration of access via a permit system for the different types of non-Defence users and this will require increased management and coordination by Defence. Furthermore, the bill provides that the Woomera Prohibited Area rules may provide for the introduction of a cost recovery model at some point in the future so that Defence can recover costs incurred in managing non-Defence access to the WPA. In at least the short term, the estimated $5 million annual cost associated with the new administrative arrangements will continue to be borne by Defence.


Finally, when the issue of compensation is concerned under proposed section 72TK of the Defence Act, the Commonwealth is liable to pay a reasonable amount of compensation in the event of an acquisition of property other than on just terms. This is consistent with section 51 of the Constitution. In addition, proposed section 72TL of the Defence Act provides that the rules may limit amounts payable by the Commonwealth for loss or damage in the WPA which may arise from a breach of duty of care in or during the testing of war materiel at this location. These proposed compensation stipulations are reasonable and sensible and are in keeping with longstanding Commonwealth convention and precedent.


To conclude, Woomera is, and will remain, an important location that is unique in Australia—not least because of its long-standing contribution to national and regional security and stability—but Woomera is increasingly under threat of overuse by competing interest groups. This amendment bill seeks to make such access and use—and the rules, regulations and policy which underpin it—in equal parts fair, transparent and clear. Doing so will make a strong contribution to deconflicting the future use of Woomera, and make the conduct of diverse activities there inherently more productive, efficient and, above all, safe for all parties and stakeholders. On this note, I commend the Defence Legislation Amendment (Woomera Prohibited Area) Bill 2014 to this chamber.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2014-07-16,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (11:00):  This bill gives effect to the recommendations made in the government review of the Woomera Prohibited Area, which was conducted by Dr Allan Hawke between 2010 and 2011, to investigate how to use the area in a way that ensured that its full national security and economic potential was realised. The review recommended that a system be established to improve the coexistence of Defence and non-Defence users of the area, including miners, pastoralists and traditional owners.


The Woomera Prohibited Area is 127,000 square kilometres. It is an enormous expanse of northern South Australia. It is larger than Tasmania and is, in fact, larger than many states in Europe. As we all know, the area is incredibly important for the Australian Defence Force. It supports defence's testing and evaluation requirements and Australia's national security needs. It is, in fact, the world's largest overland long-range weapons testing facility and has been operational since 1947.


This bill will maintain this important role for defence. Defence will remain the primary user of the area, but it will also allow users to access this land, opening it up to numerous possible future uses. The bill will authorise the Minister for Defence, with the agreement of the Minister for Resources and Energy, to make the area rules prescribing certain matters, including defining the Woomera Prohibited Area and the zones to be demarcated within that area. It will create a permit system for access and use by non-Defence users of the Woomera Prohibited Area. It will introduce offences and penalties for entering the area without permission and for failing to comply with the condition of a permit. An infringement notice scheme and demerit points system will apply to the offence of failing to comply with a permit condition. It would allow appropriately trained and qualified Defence security officials to apply the security powers of the Defence Act 1903 to ensure the safety of all users of the area.


The history of this piece of legislation goes back to the inquiry chaired by Dr Allan Hawke. The inquiry was called for by the former Minister for Defence Senator John Faulkner. The Hawke report examined the impediments to changing the rules regarding Woomera so that it could have dual use. The Hawke review was published on 4 February 2011 and made 65 recommendations. The Hawke review outlines a coexistence model, whereby Defence maintains primacy of the area, but non-Defence users have clarity regarding their access to a specified area of operation, incorporating both the available location and time of use. Recommendation 14 suggests the division of the area into three zones: a red zone for exclusive Defence use, an amber zone for regular Defence use and a green zone for occasional Defence use. By implementing a zonal timeshare arrangement, Defence is allocated exclusion windows throughout the year, limiting the non-Defence use of the area. This ranges from new non-Defence users' total exclusion within the red zone to up to 56 exclusion days in the green zone, pending notice.


The excluded red zone comprises about eight per cent of the area while the vast majority, some 75 per cent of the area, is designated as the most accessible, green zone. Importantly, the Hawke review recommended that existing mining operations, environmental organisations, Indigenous groups and pastoralists with an extant presence in the area should continue to operate under the current access arrangements unless they choose to be administered under the proposed coexistence model.


I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Senator Farrell, not just for this piece of legislation, but for his service to parliament, to Labor, to South Australia and to the nation. He has made a significant contribution in a range of areas, particularly in the defence area and in the veterans area. I pay tribute to that and acknowledge his incredible achievements. I also wish him and Nimfa and his family the best for the next phase of his career.


This bill was first introduced by Labor while we were in government, and it was then referred to a committee, and so did not pass through the previous parliament before the last election. After the change of government, Senator Farrell reintroduced this bill as a private members' bill, and he worked hard to ensure it had support from the government and the opposition, as well as the South Australian government. 


The introduction of the bill by Labor while in government reflected our desire to improve coexistence in the area. The coexistence model provides greater certainty of access to the area for non-Defence users, including the resources sector, traditional owners and pastoralists. The bill gives the resources sector greater confidence and certainty in an area that is highly prospective, with a potential for an estimated $35 billion of resource developments possible over the next decade. As we all know, this future resource development will be incredibly important for South Australia and South Australia's future. The closure of Holden, the postponing of the expansion of Olympic Dam and the uncertainty over the future of South Australia's shipbuilding industry have left a cloud over South Australia's employment and economic prospects. It is why this bill is so welcome; it provides part of the solution. It will provide the opportunity for further exploration, and it will provide the opportunity for South Australia to replace declining economic interests with new ones.


A key feature of the new legislation is the new management framework, which includes a timeshare model based on exclusion zones, determined according to defence requirements. The legislation also contains provisions relating to non-Defence user access rights, an access permit scheme, compensation and cost recovery arrangements, enforcement provisions and appeals processes. 


Importantly, this bill recognises that the area contains significant Indigenous sites, and that Indigenous groups have native title rights and interests in most of the area. All permit holders under this legislation will be required to respect the rights of Indigenous groups and comply with all relevant laws pertaining to native title and the protection of significant Indigenous sites. Indigenous groups will retain their current access arrangements, and will not require separate permission under this proposed legislation. The coexistence scheme established by this bill will only apply to new users of the area.


I also want to acknowledge that there have been many parties involved in the development of this bill. I have mentioned, of course, my former colleague Senator Farrell, who has been a driving force, and Defence has also consulted extensively with the Department of Resources Energy and Tourism. Consultation was also undertaken with the Department of Finance and Deregulation; Treasury; Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet; Department of Families, Housing, Community Services, as it was then; Indigenous Affairs; and the Attorney-General's Department. An extensive consultation was also conducted with the South Australian Department of Manufacturing, Innovation, Trade, Resources and Energy and Defence SA. Of course, we now also have bipartisan support for this bill.


This bill is an example of how state and federal governments and opposition can work together to achieve a result. It is also a bill that demonstrates that Defence can work with other groups—with farmers, with traditional owners, with resources developers—while looking after our national interests, and I commend the bill to the chamber.

"Randall, Don, MP",LP,2014-07-16,"



Mr RANDALL
 (Canning) (11:09):  It is my pleasure today to speak on the Defence Legislation (Woomera Prohibited Area) Amendment Bill 2014. I would like to concur with the member for Canberra's speech. This is an important bill, and she has essentially fleshed out the reasons for this bill as a coexistence model. But I need to say at the outset it has taken some time for this bill to eventually reach this parliament, and for that reason, I want to say that Senator David Johnston, the defence minister, should be applauded for bringing this forward and making it a priority.


I also concur with the member for Canberra about former Senator Don Farrell. He was a driving force. As a South Australian, he should be congratulated on making sure that this bill and this inquiry did not die. I hope that Senator Farrell, as a private citizen in South Australia now, will be able to continue his interest in this particular issue by being involved and working with the South Australian government to see that both federal and state governments pursue this bill in a way that will see it come to fruition as soon as possible for the benefit of South Australians in particular. South Australia is an economy that is under some stress so it does need to be prioritised.


This bill—I am obviously going to repeat some of the things that others have said—is a result of the investigation by the Hawke review. This Woomera Prohibited Area is in the national interest, as has been explained in the Hawke review. Let me just put it in context. Here I am, a Western Australian member of parliament, speaking about an area in South Australia. I note on the speakers list that there is not one South Australian speaking on this bill, which is quite strange when it is for the benefit of South Australians in particular. It is in the national interest, but for South Australia this project is massive.


We have already been told that $35 billion worth of potential mineral wealth will be uncovered in this Woomera Prohibited Area. Yet on either side—and I do not want to reflect badly on our colleagues—I find it passing strange that no South Australian member in this House is speaking on this bill today. I hope there is more interest shown when it gets to the Senate. I hope there is more interest shown when it eventually arrives at the feet of the South Australian government because it is particularly in their interests. In putting that on the table, I want to alert people to the fact that this is a national parliament but you would have thought a South Australian would be involved.


Ever since I was a child I have been aware of this huge area of South Australia that had been a no-go zone for everybody except Indigenous people. In some respects it was made a no-go zone for the Indigenous people of South Australia when we had the atomic testing at Maralinga. Australia has been the place that has been used by the British in particular for testing some of their weapons. The atomic testing done at Maralinga certainly degraded the area in terms of its atomic fallout. The Montebello Islands is an area that was a no-go zone for Australians for a long period. I noticed an article not so long ago which says that people are now going back to the Montebello Islands. Coral is growing back again after this area of Australia was also used for atomic testing by the British some time ago.


The half-life of uranium does not go off in 60-odd years, but it certainly makes it easier for us to re-enter those areas for short periods of time. Because of the long-term effect of the use of uranium in its weapons testing, this area is being sectioned off. I know that even the Indigenous landowners were not allowed near that degraded area, for obvious reasons. There were reports about Indigenous people who went back there and were having certain health issues—burns et cetera. That needs to be put into context here. The green zone, as the member for Canberra pointed out, is 75 per cent of this massive area, which is now going to be made available to a whole range of people, whether it be for tourism or other land use, but particularly for mining. 


We will not know what particular wealth is in this area until it has been drilled, but we do know that it is next door to the Olympic Dam area. The Olympic Dam is one of the treasure troves of minerals in Australia. Casey Gavin and Ted Mayman once wrote a book called The Mile That Midas Touched in terms of Kalgoorlie. It is a golden mile. There is Broken Hill, founded by a stockmen rounding up cattle, which turned into one of the other great mineral towns of this country. It is still going after all this time. Mount Isa is the other town. Potentially, this area of South Australia could be another one of those massive minerals deposits, which will benefit the South Australians of this nation in particular.


We know that South Australia has suffered some setbacks economically. One of the setbacks was the GFC and other factors saw the Olympic Dam expansion not go ahead. That was going to be worth billions of dollars, particularly to the South Australian economy. I notice that the member for Brand is here, so I will have to be a little bit gentle in relation to my comments about the mining tax. That is because there is no doubt in our minds that that was a negative factor for any expansion of mining ventures anywhere in Australia. As much as it has been denied and counterdenied, the expansion of Olympic Dam would have been a factor.


We have moved on since then and we hope to get rid of that tax in this parliament probably not this week but shortly, thanks to the changes in the Senate make-up. It is unfortunate that the Labor Party did not see the error of their ways and the error of having a mining tax that did not really collect any money and actually was a disincentive for people to be involved in this sector. Exploration was one of those areas. That is one of the downsides at the moment. This parliament needs to address it through such things as flowthrough shares or some other mechanism, because at the moment exploration in Australia has come to a sudden halt. We have seen today on the stock exchange that Boart, a mining services company, is under pressure because there is a lack of work for them. Drilling rigs lie idle and those involved in exploration need an incentive, because the lag time between finding a resource and producing it could be decades. I understand that Century zinc is called Century zinc because it took 100 years to bring it on. What we are doing in parliament today, in terms of this Woomera Prohibited Area, is trying to bring on a resource that could take years to develop. We will only know what is there once they start doing exploration work.


Other areas that have been mentioned, and I will just reconfirm them, are that there are going to be a lot of checks and balances which allow people to access this area. There will be penalties for those who access the area without permission, but the permission will be made far easier to access. The area contains recognised traditional owners, recognised areas for traditional owners and significant Indigenous sites. Under the bill, permit holders who gain access to the Woomera Prohibited Area will be required to protect these sites and comply with all relevant Native Title and Aboriginal heritage laws. Indigenous groups with current statutory access rights expressly retain these rights. They will not need to apply for access permission under this legislation, which does not disturb existing rights.


Section 400 is part of Maralinga Tjarutja lands. It was the site of atomic testing, as I said before, in the fifties and the sixties. In other words, access for the traditional owners—the Maralinga Tjarutja people—will not only be maintained but also will be enhanced. As I said, Defence has made it quite clear that the access through this area will come under the Minister for Defence and his department. They will take the necessary steps to excise section 400. Once completed, it will no longer be subject to the access restrictions that have applied under Defence Force Regulations 1952.


There is no point in repeating a whole lot of material that has been said by others. It is a very good coexistence model. This is jointly sponsored: it is a bipartisan piece of legislation that, as I have said, will enhance not only the South Australian and Australian economies but will also protect the rights of land owners. There will be a compensation regime in place for other land users. It will give miners greater surety to go in and spend the massive number of dollars to do exploration, which will be in the national interest.


As I said before the member for Grey came in and I will say it again, because the composure of this chamber has not changed, I find it passing strange that there is no South Australian here speaking on this bill. You would have thought that this was something exciting for those in South Australia. However, I understand that the member the Brand was born in South Australia, so there is some link there. It is a long bow, but I congratulate all those that are involved in supporting this bill and I recommend the bill to the House.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I was going to add to the member for Canning that my parents met in Woomera. My grandfather was in the Army and my father was there working at Maralinga.

"Gray, Gary, MP",ALP,2014-07-16,"



Mr GRAY
 (Brand) (11:21):  I am tempted to suggest that if you parents met at Woomera, that must have been on the occasion that the various rockets were taking off and sparks were flying through the air!



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  That is exactly right!




Mr GRAY:
  As the member for Canning reflects, I did grow up at Whyalla. I still remember evenings in the 1960s when we would go out, look into the horizon and know that a Skylark rocket was taking off. It was the original testing bed for those British-Australian cooperative rocketry research programs through the 1960s and 1970s. I also recall the great importance of the original discovery in the early 1970s of the Olympic Dam uranium find, which is one of the great finds that demonstrate the quality of Australian geophysical survey work and also shows the massive contribution to our economy—and in particular the South Australian economy—of that wonderful and innovative enterprise of Western Mining, which was under the leadership of Arvi Parbo. It found resources in remote parts of our country and helped build the magnificent, robust, reliable and innovative resources economy that we have today.


This piece of legislation, which opens the Woomera Prohibited Area for further minerals exploration and then potentially exploitation, is particularly important. It is particularly important in Adelaide but it is also important to our economy, as the mineralisation that we know exists through the Gawler Craton—which is expressed at what we now know as Roxby Downs, which is sometimes referred to as Olympic Dam—and those finds like the Carrapateena discovery in 2006 are all significant finds. They are all believed to be richly embedded in a uranium environment and all potentially highly productive for the South Australian economy and for our national economy.


This legislation saw its roots in a substantial piece of work commissioned by my predecessor, Martin Ferguson, and by the former Minister for Defence, Stephen Smith, in cooperation with the South Australian government. If I can just advise, I will speak for a short period of time to allow the member for Grey to speak on his own backyard. The work which had been done cooperatively and jointly in order to best utilise the highly prospective ground that formed the WPA is work that saw collaboration between the Department of Defence, the department of finance and the then Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism.


It is unfortunate that the final passage of that legislation through the Senate did not take place in the previous parliament. As we have been learning in recent weeks, and as I fear we will discover over the course of the next couple of years, the Senate can be a difficult place. This legislation was deliberately held up in the Senate in the previous parliament for no good purpose. We now see it here today and it is the fervent desire of the opposition to see this legislation enacted and receive royal assent as soon as possible in order for the best framework to be put in place cooperatively with the Department of Defence, the South Australian government, traditional owners and communities in this area of northern South Australia so that its mineral potential can be realised, so that that mineral potential can be understood and so that future companies can make decisions to extract those minerals and export them through the ports of South Australia.


It is highly likely that the minerals that will be discovered in this area will be metalliferous, it is highly likely that there will be uranium based metals, it is highly likely that there will be a lot of copper and it is a near certainty that there will be a lot of iron ore. But what is also certain is that the importance of this economic development to South Australia underwrites future generations of South Australians in employment and in wealth generation. So I commend this bill to the House. The opposition wholeheartedly supports this bill.


I will conclude by making one final point. All Australians were disappointed in 2012 when BHP announced that it would not be progressing with its then scheduled expansion of Roxby Downs. It was argued at the time that the overheated construction economy and the Japanese response to Fukushima had reduced the spot price of uranium to very low levels—and the uranium price today is less than half of what it was in those days of 2012. The reasons that were given were the high cap ex, the decisions in Japan on nuclear fuels demand and the overheated resource economy. It is our fervent hope that, at a time when the resources construction economy has substantially cooled, it will be possible to seek an expansion of Roxby Downs, further extraction of copper and uranium ores, further employment and further wealth creation. The Woomera Prohibited Area, the WPA, being brought into the exploration environment is a good thing for South Australia and a good thing for our nation. I commend this bill to the House.

"Ramsey, Rowan, MP",LP,2014-07-16,"



Mr RAMSEY
 (Grey) (11:28):  I thank the member for Brand for his comments and welcome the fact that this bill, the Defence Legislation Amendment (Woomera Prohibited Area) Bill 2014, has bipartisanship support. I would suggest that perhaps the member for Brand might read Senator Fawcett's speech on the hitches to the progress of this bill in the Senate. I do not think you will find they were of a partisan nature; in fact, it was more about Senate mechanisms than about any particular intent to hold this legislation up—because you are right, Member for Brand, this is very important for South Australia.


Unfortunately, South Australia leads the charge as the worst-performing state economically in the Commonwealth at the moment. As a South Australian, that is a great concern to me. I remember well when a number of the top 20 companies in Australia had their headquarters in South Australia. There was a time when South Australia was looked to for innovation and leadership throughout the nation. Unfortunately, our population growth has declined—and, in fact, in 2004 we lost another federal electorate. We went from 12 to 11. Unless population predictions change, we will lose another one in the next 15 years. That is not because our population is not growing; it is just not growing as fast as the rest of Australia.


You have to ask yourself why this is. Largely, we had industry based around manufacturing, where it is increasingly difficult for us to compete around the world—and when I say 'us' I mean Australia generally—and we relied on our agricultural products. Our agricultural industries are going well and still expanding and I think they offer great opportunity for the future. But it is in the mineral industries where South Australia, until relatively recent times, remained an unknown quantity. The geologists tell us now that the bulk of South Australia is covered by about 500 feet of sand and that has made it rather difficult to see what lies below. With the advent of magnetic surveys and other modern mineral detection methods we have found that in fact South Australia has a large number of very important resources. Quite often they are difficult to mine and expensive to get to because we have that overburden. The member for Brand mentioned the shelving of the expansion at Roxby Downs as an example of the impact that has had on South Australia and the disappointment it has caused, and that is true. Part of the reason for that is we have the best part of a kilometre of dirt to shift before we get to the ore body at Roxby Downs and that makes it a very expensive operation.


Roxby Downs is adjacent to the Woomera Prohibited Area—it is very close indeed. All the geologists believe there will be another Roxby Downs within the confines of the Woomera Prohibited Area. Already we have successfully mined Prominent Hill and three other iron ore mines with a significant upgrade at the moment of Southern Iron's, or Arrium's, northern province. About six million tonnes a year is currently being mined there and shifted by rail to Whyalla, where it is placed on barges and taken out to Cape-size vessels, adding to the six million tonnes that Arrium currently mines out of the Middleback Ranges.


I was very pleased when Dr Allan Hawke came to me, as the local member for the Woomera area, about two years ago and asked my advice on how we should open up this area for exploration and mining. I had met him and spoken to him about the review. He was very thankful that I was able to bring to the table, for the first time, the concerns and operations of the local pastoralists. We think about mining and sometimes forget about the people who are already making a living out of the land. In fact, he said some of the best advice he had came from the local pastoralists, who were able to tell him things about the land usage that others had not. So I was very pleased to be able to get their side of the argument into the equation.


The review sets up three different areas, which I think is a civilised and responsible way to give us an opportunity to open up new wealth for South Australia. As I said, we certainly need them. It seems that Defence has reached a very comfortable position in this area. There will, of course, be ongoing negotiation between those that choose to first explore the resource and then mine the resource, but we have a working paper from which we can launch ourselves forward. I hope it is going to lead definitely to more iron ore, because this is one of the keys to South Australia's future. I have mentioned the Arrium barging operation at Whyalla, but what we really need in South Australia is a genuine deep-sea port and we do not have one. Currently there is a large proposal on the Eyre Peninsula which has the ability to produce 20 million tonnes of ore a year and there is a proposal to build a port there. The rail system already runs past the Woomera region and the Braemar region, which is back up towards Broken Hill, all on the standard rail. If we can hook that back down to a new port development on the southern Eyre Peninsula we may have an iron ore industry in South Australia capable of producing between 60 million and 80 million tonnes a year. That is not the Pilbara, but let me tell you it is a seriously big pile of iron ore.


The opening up of the Woomera area actually feeds into that greater possibility for South Australia. As I said right at opening, it is difficult to see where South Australia is going to expand its economy if it is not going to come from the resources sector. Certainly we will continue to grow our aquaculture and agricultural sectors and we will learn to make more money out of what we already do. In fact, we will be able to downstream process and further add value to our agricultural products, but there is no doubt that the resources sector will play a very important part in South Australia's future. It is my belief the Woomera Prohibited Area will play a very important part within that.

"Robert, Stuart, MP",LP,2014-07-16,"



Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden—Assistant Minister for Defence) (11:35):  In summing up the debate on the Defence Legislation Amendment (Woomera Prohibited Area) Bill 2014 I thank the members for their contributions today, especially the member for Grey—the only South Australian to have spoken here today about one of the major areas for expansion of the South Australian economy. It is great to see South Australia being so ably represented by my good friend and colleague the member for Grey, Rowan Ramsey.


The Defence Legislation Amendment (Woomera Prohibited Area) Bill 2014 gives effect to the recommendations of the Hawke review. The aim of course was to investigate the best use of the world's greatest rocket range in the national interest and how two parties, Defence and non-Defence users, can coexist. I think the bill has arrived at a sensible, negotiated outcome. It is an outcome where defence can continue to operate a rocket range longer than the British Isles—the biggest one in the world—in support of the work that we do.


This legislation recognises existing users and it preserves existing users' right, which is important for those who already have a stake in the area. It establishes a framework for those non-Defence users to actually come within the WPA and gives a level of certainty over what we in Defence will do and how the non-Defence users can work within that so that they can account for sensibly in a commercial manner the restrictions that will be provided—and the restrictions are small and they are not onerous. It allows users to make sensible commercial decisions with assurance of when we will ask them to leave the area—because, frankly, defence is using it to test weapons. Lastly, it protects the safety of all users in the WPA and ensures that the appropriate national security protections for an area that is used to test defence capability are indeed in place.


It is a good, negotiated outcome between Defence and non-Defence users. I think it will be good for South Australia. I thank the member for Grey for his astute comments in terms of the South Australian economy and his continual work in improving the South Australian economy and what it is doing. I hope this bill will go some way to assist him with the great task that he has ahead. I therefore commend the bill to the House.

"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2014-07-16,"



Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari) (10:39):  I am pleased to be able to make a contribution to this debate. I want to thank the people in the Library for their Bills Digest which gives us all the information we need to be able to make a meaningful contribution. It is a technical piece of legislation which opens up for other uses the Woomera Prohibited Area. The bill provides for the making of the Woomera Prohibited Area rules by the minister which will include, amongst other things, zones which are to be demarcated within that area. It creates a permit system for access to and use by non-Defence users of the Woomera Prohibited Area. It introduces offences and penalties for entering the Woomera Prohibited Area without permission, for failing to comply with the conditions of a permit, and provides for compensation for acquisition of property from a person otherwise than on just terms that results from the operation of the new part VIB of the Defence Act 1903.


I want to talk about an example of what the Woomera Prohibited Area can actually facilitate. I was sadly and very unfortunately given my marching orders out of this place by the people of the Northern Territory in 1996 for a relatively short period of time. I was back again in 1998. During the intervening period, one of the jobs I had was working with a legal firm and a company called Kistler Aerospace, negotiating native title over Woomera on their behalf so that they could launch rockets from Woomera. The idea was to have rockets which would be returned to earth. Sadly, it never eventuated, but it demonstrated to me the enormous value of this property in terms of defence and other interests, and there was its special location in terms of space programs. As a former minister in the defence portfolio, I am aware of the use of the Woomera Prohibited Area for research purposes. I could name a number of research programs that have been held there. A very important capacity for the Australian nation is provided by this Woomera Prohibited Area.


This bill is designed to open up the capacity of the area to be used by other users and to facilitate, potentially, access to its mineral wealth most particularly. But I think the people of Australia need to understand that here we have a real jewel in developing our defence capacity and our national security. I do not think it is commonly understood. I want to pay tribute to the people in Defence who have the responsibility of managing and administering this particular area.


As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, I live in Alice Springs, which is a little bit up the road. It is common ground, in a sense. As you know, if you fire rockets out of Woomera and they head north, they will come across, potentially, south-east Queensland or the Northern Territory. What happens at Woomera could eventually impact upon communities right across northern Australia, but most particularly, in my case, in the Northern Territory.


There has been a long history of engagement with the community by defence over this Woomera Prohibited Area. It is the largest overland, long-range weapons testing facility in the world, having been operational since 1947, and it covers 127,000 square kilometres of northern South Australia. It is no small bit of property, but, like other parts of Australia which are being used for defence purposes—and I speak of ranges in the Northern Territory used principally for the Army, but also for the Air Force and potentially for the Navy—these areas are of great value to us. I think that, when we are having discussions around our national security and the development of options for our national security, we need to understand the importance of these areas of land and the need to look after them properly in the first instance, to make sure we are good environmental guardians, to make sure we are good neighbours to and partners with Aboriginal people who might be the traditional owners or the native title holders for those areas, and to make sure that we facilitate the use of those areas in a way which is in line with our national interest. I note that this piece of legislation does precisely that.


So I think it is a pleasing piece of legislation. I note that it was prepared during the course of the last parliament, and was developed largely in response to work which had been initiated by the former defence minister John Faulkner, who called for a review to make recommendations about the best use of the Woomera Prohibited Area in the national interest. The final report of that review of the prohibited area—which was undertaken by Dr Allan Hawke, a former very senior public servant and adviser to former governments out of the Defence portfolio—was published on 4 February 2011 and made 65 recommendations. Within its numerous recommendations it outlined a coexistence model so that, whilst Defence maintained primacy over the WPA, non-Defence users would have clarity regarding their access to specified areas of operation incorporating both the available location and time of use.


Recommendation 14 suggested the division of the WPA into three zones: a red zone for exclusive Defence use, an amber zone for regular defence use and a green zone for occasional defence use. By implementing a zonal timeshare arrangement, Defence was able to allocate exclusion windows throughout the year limiting the non-Defence use of the prohibited area. And that makes sense because, as I say, it is 127,000 square kilometres—it is a large area of land—and, whilst there are parts of that property which could not be and should not be used by other users, there are other parts of the property where people should be able to have access to that use.


I go back to the issue of Woomera being used as a rocket-launching facility, for example. Had that proceeded, it would have meant Australia getting access to technology for rocket launching which it currently does not have. It would have meant Australia getting access to technology, via the United States, in terms of a launch facility that would have been unique to us. Sadly it did not proceed but, nevertheless, it just shows that this property is of great intrinsic value and that we need to make sure that it is used for the purpose for which the Commonwealth acquired it in 1947 and has used it since then. But at the same time we need to understand that there is not necessarily any essential conflict between that primary purpose and the objectives of providing other people with the capacity to use it.


I note that the shadow minister and his contribution in the main chamber talked about Woomera Prohibited Area overlapping a major part of South Australia's potential for significant minerals and energy resources, including 30 per cent of the Gawler Craton, one of the world's major mineral domains; and the Arckaringa, Officer, and Eromanga basins for hydrocarbons and coal. And, of course, we know that Olympic Dam is adjacent to the Woomera Prohibited Area and is part of the same geological formations. The South Australian government has assessed that over the next decade about $35 billion worth of iron ore, gold, and other mineral resources are potentially exploitable from within the Woomera Prohibited Area.


That is all well and good and I hope that they are able to develop some of those resources and are able to get the value out of them. But I just want to re-emphasise the importance of this place for science and as a property to use for the development of new ways of doing business. I want to commend the work that is being done there on a continuing basis by the Defence Science and Technology Organisation. The work they do is so vital for our national interest but goes below the radar, if I might put it like that in this context. It is often and mostly unrecognised by the general community but vital to developing our national defence capacity and looking after our national security interests. This gives me an opportunity to say to those wonderful people at the Defence Science and Technology Organisation how much we value your work, how much we know that you do on our behalf through dint of your brains and by working collaboratively with people from other nations in developing new ways of doing business, exploiting new technologies and using Woomera as an integral part of that space for testing, for demonstrations and the like. I could speak on this for a long time; I know it would bore many. It does not bore me—though perhaps I could put myself to sleep, and people say I often should. Nevertheless, I do want to applaud the government for bringing forward this legislation and putting it through the parliament. It is an important piece of legislation, but I do want to make sure that we emphasise the vital national interests that we have in this Woomera Prohibited Area.

"Nikolic, Andrew, MP",LP,2014-07-16,"



Mr NIKOLIC
 (Bass) (10:50):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Defence Legislation Amendment (Woomera Prohibited Area) Bill 2013. Like the member for Lingiari, I have personal and practical experience with this area. I know the Woomera defence range facilities and the surrounding region very well. As the member for Lingiari quite rightly points out, Woomera offers a world-class live range facility, particularly for rockets and associated large propellant weapons. But it is equally and increasingly attractive to a range of diverse stakeholders. For obvious reasons, this means that the legislation, rules and protocols that delineate its use must be made lawful, clear and relevant to changing circumstances, particularly for the protection of competing and multiple users.


This amendment bill gives effect to the recommendations of the 2011 Hawke review of the Woomera Prohibited Area. Regrettably, this was followed by two years of inaction; no bill was produced and I think it is fair to say there was less than adequate consultation. So this bill is very welcome indeed and is about finding a sensible middle ground in relation to the current and future use of Woomera by both military and non-military users. Achieving this will improve the management of the Woomera Prohibited Area in a way that meets defence's equipment testing requirements while also giving greater certainty of access, particularly for the resources sector.


Accordingly, the purpose of this bill is to amend the Defence Act to establish a framework which allows access to the Woomera Prohibited Area by non-defence users on a controlled, conditional basis. The general purpose of the bill can be reduced to four key objectives: first, to provide for the making of the Woomera Prohibited Area rules by the minister which will include, amongst other things, zones that are demarcated within the area; second, to create a permit system by which non-Defence users can access the WPA; third, the introduction of offences and penalties for entering the WPA without permission and for failing to comply with the conditions of permit; and, fourth, to provide compensation for an acquisition of property for a person otherwise than on just terms that results from the operation of the amended Defence Act 1903.


The lineage of this bill includes two previous versions. The first was introduced by the former Labor government on 30 May 2013 and that bill lapsed when the 43rd Parliament was prorogued on 5 August 2013. The second version, effectively an equivalent mirror iteration of the first, was introduced by ALP Senator Don Farrell as a private senator's bill on 12 December 2013 and that second version of the bill does not appear to be proceeding. This current bill differs from those earlier versions, most particularly in proposing and elaborating in detail on the Commonwealth's intended adoption and regulation of a coexistence model of intended future use.


For those who are unfamiliar with Woomera, I would like to briefly provide some key background and links to the provisions in this bill. The 127,000 kilometre expanse of northern South Australia which is known as the Woomera Prohibited Area is the world's largest overland long-range weapons testing facility and has been operating since 1947. However, since the 1980s, areas have been made increasingly available to non-defence users, including the resources sector. Local Indigenous groups and pastoral lease holders also have an enduring presence across much of the WPA, and clearly this competition between diverse and legitimate interest groups for land at Woomera could not continue unchecked. To this end, on 17 May 2010, the then Minister for Defence, Senator John Faulkner, called for a review to 'make recommendations about the best use of the WPA in the national interest'.


This brings us to the present day and this amendment bill: the latest iteration of an extensive process of consultation and review which is aimed ultimately at providing fair access to Commonwealth land at Woomera by diverse parties for disparate purposes, both civil and military alike. In short, Woomera is big, but so is business at Woomera, both civil and military, and this amendment bill seeks to make it more productive, efficient and safer.


In particular, three additional issues warrant the chamber's attention. They are, first, the actual review process itself and its outcomes leading up to this bill; second, future administrative arrangements that complement these outcomes; and, third, the financial implications of proposed action, including compensation for the acquisition of private land by the government. I will talk first about the review process. As the member for Lingiari said, the most recent review was lead by Dr Allan Hawke who, as a former secretary of the Department of Defence, was eminently placed to do so. His report, The review of the Woomera Prohibited Area—final report, was published on 4 February 2011, made 65 recommendations, including perhaps most importantly the common sense and practical benefits of moving to a model of coexistence, whereby Defence continues to retain primacy of the WPA but non-Defence users are provided greater clarity regarding access.


Dr Hawke's work proposed the division of the WPA into three zones: a red zone, which is for exclusive defence use only, an amber zone for regular defence use, and a green zone for occasional defence use. By effectively implementing a zonal time share arrangement, Defence is allocated exclusive windows throughout the year, thereby limiting the non-Defence use of the WPA. Let me reiterate that the new framework maintains the primacy of the Woomera Prohibited Area as a national security and Defence asset.


Access by non-Defence users would be allowed in a number of ways. For new non-Defence users, total exclusion within the red zone, to up to 56 exclusion days in the green zone, pending appropriate notice. The excluded red zone comprises only about eight per cent of the WPA, while the vast majority, some 75 per cent, is in fact designated as the most accessible green zone. Importantly, the Hawke review further recommended that 'existing mining operations, environmental organisations, Indigenous groups and pastoralists with an extant presence on the WPA should continue to operate under their current access arrangements unless they choose to be administered under the proposed coexistence model'.


This bill also protects existing Woomera Prohibited Area users, including Indigenous groups, pastoralists, the Tarcoola-Darwin railway operators and owners, and existing mining operations. The practical administrative arrangement proposed to complement stakeholder coexistence is equally sensible and straightforward. This bill creates a system for the administration of access via a permit system for the different types of non-Defence users and this will require increased management and coordination by Defence. Furthermore, the bill provides that the Woomera Prohibited Area rules may provide for the introduction of a cost recovery model at some point in the future so that Defence can recover costs incurred in managing non-Defence access to the WPA. In at least the short term, the estimated $5 million annual cost associated with the new administrative arrangements will continue to be borne by Defence.


Finally, when the issue of compensation is concerned under proposed section 72TK of the Defence Act, the Commonwealth is liable to pay a reasonable amount of compensation in the event of an acquisition of property other than on just terms. This is consistent with section 51 of the Constitution. In addition, proposed section 72TL of the Defence Act provides that the rules may limit amounts payable by the Commonwealth for loss or damage in the WPA which may arise from a breach of duty of care in or during the testing of war materiel at this location. These proposed compensation stipulations are reasonable and sensible and are in keeping with longstanding Commonwealth convention and precedent.


To conclude, Woomera is, and will remain, an important location that is unique in Australia—not least because of its long-standing contribution to national and regional security and stability—but Woomera is increasingly under threat of overuse by competing interest groups. This amendment bill seeks to make such access and use—and the rules, regulations and policy which underpin it—in equal parts fair, transparent and clear. Doing so will make a strong contribution to deconflicting the future use of Woomera, and make the conduct of diverse activities there inherently more productive, efficient and, above all, safe for all parties and stakeholders. On this note, I commend the Defence Legislation Amendment (Woomera Prohibited Area) Bill 2014 to this chamber.

Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (11:00):  This bill gives effect to the recommendations made in the government review of the Woomera Prohibited Area, which was conducted by Dr Allan Hawke between 2010 and 2011, to investigate how to use the area in a way that ensured that its full national security and economic potential was realised. The review recommended that a system be established to improve the coexistence of Defence and non-Defence users of the area, including miners, pastoralists and traditional owners.


The Woomera Prohibited Area is 127,000 square kilometres. It is an enormous expanse of northern South Australia. It is larger than Tasmania and is, in fact, larger than many states in Europe. As we all know, the area is incredibly important for the Australian Defence Force. It supports defence's testing and evaluation requirements and Australia's national security needs. It is, in fact, the world's largest overland long-range weapons testing facility and has been operational since 1947.


This bill will maintain this important role for defence. Defence will remain the primary user of the area, but it will also allow users to access this land, opening it up to numerous possible future uses. The bill will authorise the Minister for Defence, with the agreement of the Minister for Resources and Energy, to make the area rules prescribing certain matters, including defining the Woomera Prohibited Area and the zones to be demarcated within that area. It will create a permit system for access and use by non-Defence users of the Woomera Prohibited Area. It will introduce offences and penalties for entering the area without permission and for failing to comply with the condition of a permit. An infringement notice scheme and demerit points system will apply to the offence of failing to comply with a permit condition. It would allow appropriately trained and qualified Defence security officials to apply the security powers of the Defence Act 1903 to ensure the safety of all users of the area.


The history of this piece of legislation goes back to the inquiry chaired by Dr Allan Hawke. The inquiry was called for by the former Minister for Defence Senator John Faulkner. The Hawke report examined the impediments to changing the rules regarding Woomera so that it could have dual use. The Hawke review was published on 4 February 2011 and made 65 recommendations. The Hawke review outlines a coexistence model, whereby Defence maintains primacy of the area, but non-Defence users have clarity regarding their access to a specified area of operation, incorporating both the available location and time of use. Recommendation 14 suggests the division of the area into three zones: a red zone for exclusive Defence use, an amber zone for regular Defence use and a green zone for occasional Defence use. By implementing a zonal timeshare arrangement, Defence is allocated exclusion windows throughout the year, limiting the non-Defence use of the area. This ranges from new non-Defence users' total exclusion within the red zone to up to 56 exclusion days in the green zone, pending notice.


The excluded red zone comprises about eight per cent of the area while the vast majority, some 75 per cent of the area, is designated as the most accessible, green zone. Importantly, the Hawke review recommended that existing mining operations, environmental organisations, Indigenous groups and pastoralists with an extant presence in the area should continue to operate under the current access arrangements unless they choose to be administered under the proposed coexistence model.


I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Senator Farrell, not just for this piece of legislation, but for his service to parliament, to Labor, to South Australia and to the nation. He has made a significant contribution in a range of areas, particularly in the defence area and in the veterans area. I pay tribute to that and acknowledge his incredible achievements. I also wish him and Nimfa and his family the best for the next phase of his career.


This bill was first introduced by Labor while we were in government, and it was then referred to a committee, and so did not pass through the previous parliament before the last election. After the change of government, Senator Farrell reintroduced this bill as a private members' bill, and he worked hard to ensure it had support from the government and the opposition, as well as the South Australian government. 


The introduction of the bill by Labor while in government reflected our desire to improve coexistence in the area. The coexistence model provides greater certainty of access to the area for non-Defence users, including the resources sector, traditional owners and pastoralists. The bill gives the resources sector greater confidence and certainty in an area that is highly prospective, with a potential for an estimated $35 billion of resource developments possible over the next decade. As we all know, this future resource development will be incredibly important for South Australia and South Australia's future. The closure of Holden, the postponing of the expansion of Olympic Dam and the uncertainty over the future of South Australia's shipbuilding industry have left a cloud over South Australia's employment and economic prospects. It is why this bill is so welcome; it provides part of the solution. It will provide the opportunity for further exploration, and it will provide the opportunity for South Australia to replace declining economic interests with new ones.


A key feature of the new legislation is the new management framework, which includes a timeshare model based on exclusion zones, determined according to defence requirements. The legislation also contains provisions relating to non-Defence user access rights, an access permit scheme, compensation and cost recovery arrangements, enforcement provisions and appeals processes. 


Importantly, this bill recognises that the area contains significant Indigenous sites, and that Indigenous groups have native title rights and interests in most of the area. All permit holders under this legislation will be required to respect the rights of Indigenous groups and comply with all relevant laws pertaining to native title and the protection of significant Indigenous sites. Indigenous groups will retain their current access arrangements, and will not require separate permission under this proposed legislation. The coexistence scheme established by this bill will only apply to new users of the area.


I also want to acknowledge that there have been many parties involved in the development of this bill. I have mentioned, of course, my former colleague Senator Farrell, who has been a driving force, and Defence has also consulted extensively with the Department of Resources Energy and Tourism. Consultation was also undertaken with the Department of Finance and Deregulation; Treasury; Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet; Department of Families, Housing, Community Services, as it was then; Indigenous Affairs; and the Attorney-General's Department. An extensive consultation was also conducted with the South Australian Department of Manufacturing, Innovation, Trade, Resources and Energy and Defence SA. Of course, we now also have bipartisan support for this bill.


This bill is an example of how state and federal governments and opposition can work together to achieve a result. It is also a bill that demonstrates that Defence can work with other groups—with farmers, with traditional owners, with resources developers—while looking after our national interests, and I commend the bill to the chamber.

"Randall, Don, MP",LP,2014-07-16,"



Mr RANDALL
 (Canning) (11:09):  It is my pleasure today to speak on the Defence Legislation (Woomera Prohibited Area) Amendment Bill 2014. I would like to concur with the member for Canberra's speech. This is an important bill, and she has essentially fleshed out the reasons for this bill as a coexistence model. But I need to say at the outset it has taken some time for this bill to eventually reach this parliament, and for that reason, I want to say that Senator David Johnston, the defence minister, should be applauded for bringing this forward and making it a priority.


I also concur with the member for Canberra about former Senator Don Farrell. He was a driving force. As a South Australian, he should be congratulated on making sure that this bill and this inquiry did not die. I hope that Senator Farrell, as a private citizen in South Australia now, will be able to continue his interest in this particular issue by being involved and working with the South Australian government to see that both federal and state governments pursue this bill in a way that will see it come to fruition as soon as possible for the benefit of South Australians in particular. South Australia is an economy that is under some stress so it does need to be prioritised.


This bill—I am obviously going to repeat some of the things that others have said—is a result of the investigation by the Hawke review. This Woomera Prohibited Area is in the national interest, as has been explained in the Hawke review. Let me just put it in context. Here I am, a Western Australian member of parliament, speaking about an area in South Australia. I note on the speakers list that there is not one South Australian speaking on this bill, which is quite strange when it is for the benefit of South Australians in particular. It is in the national interest, but for South Australia this project is massive.


We have already been told that $35 billion worth of potential mineral wealth will be uncovered in this Woomera Prohibited Area. Yet on either side—and I do not want to reflect badly on our colleagues—I find it passing strange that no South Australian member in this House is speaking on this bill today. I hope there is more interest shown when it gets to the Senate. I hope there is more interest shown when it eventually arrives at the feet of the South Australian government because it is particularly in their interests. In putting that on the table, I want to alert people to the fact that this is a national parliament but you would have thought a South Australian would be involved.


Ever since I was a child I have been aware of this huge area of South Australia that had been a no-go zone for everybody except Indigenous people. In some respects it was made a no-go zone for the Indigenous people of South Australia when we had the atomic testing at Maralinga. Australia has been the place that has been used by the British in particular for testing some of their weapons. The atomic testing done at Maralinga certainly degraded the area in terms of its atomic fallout. The Montebello Islands is an area that was a no-go zone for Australians for a long period. I noticed an article not so long ago which says that people are now going back to the Montebello Islands. Coral is growing back again after this area of Australia was also used for atomic testing by the British some time ago.


The half-life of uranium does not go off in 60-odd years, but it certainly makes it easier for us to re-enter those areas for short periods of time. Because of the long-term effect of the use of uranium in its weapons testing, this area is being sectioned off. I know that even the Indigenous landowners were not allowed near that degraded area, for obvious reasons. There were reports about Indigenous people who went back there and were having certain health issues—burns et cetera. That needs to be put into context here. The green zone, as the member for Canberra pointed out, is 75 per cent of this massive area, which is now going to be made available to a whole range of people, whether it be for tourism or other land use, but particularly for mining. 


We will not know what particular wealth is in this area until it has been drilled, but we do know that it is next door to the Olympic Dam area. The Olympic Dam is one of the treasure troves of minerals in Australia. Casey Gavin and Ted Mayman once wrote a book called The Mile That Midas Touched in terms of Kalgoorlie. It is a golden mile. There is Broken Hill, founded by a stockmen rounding up cattle, which turned into one of the other great mineral towns of this country. It is still going after all this time. Mount Isa is the other town. Potentially, this area of South Australia could be another one of those massive minerals deposits, which will benefit the South Australians of this nation in particular.


We know that South Australia has suffered some setbacks economically. One of the setbacks was the GFC and other factors saw the Olympic Dam expansion not go ahead. That was going to be worth billions of dollars, particularly to the South Australian economy. I notice that the member for Brand is here, so I will have to be a little bit gentle in relation to my comments about the mining tax. That is because there is no doubt in our minds that that was a negative factor for any expansion of mining ventures anywhere in Australia. As much as it has been denied and counterdenied, the expansion of Olympic Dam would have been a factor.


We have moved on since then and we hope to get rid of that tax in this parliament probably not this week but shortly, thanks to the changes in the Senate make-up. It is unfortunate that the Labor Party did not see the error of their ways and the error of having a mining tax that did not really collect any money and actually was a disincentive for people to be involved in this sector. Exploration was one of those areas. That is one of the downsides at the moment. This parliament needs to address it through such things as flowthrough shares or some other mechanism, because at the moment exploration in Australia has come to a sudden halt. We have seen today on the stock exchange that Boart, a mining services company, is under pressure because there is a lack of work for them. Drilling rigs lie idle and those involved in exploration need an incentive, because the lag time between finding a resource and producing it could be decades. I understand that Century zinc is called Century zinc because it took 100 years to bring it on. What we are doing in parliament today, in terms of this Woomera Prohibited Area, is trying to bring on a resource that could take years to develop. We will only know what is there once they start doing exploration work.


Other areas that have been mentioned, and I will just reconfirm them, are that there are going to be a lot of checks and balances which allow people to access this area. There will be penalties for those who access the area without permission, but the permission will be made far easier to access. The area contains recognised traditional owners, recognised areas for traditional owners and significant Indigenous sites. Under the bill, permit holders who gain access to the Woomera Prohibited Area will be required to protect these sites and comply with all relevant Native Title and Aboriginal heritage laws. Indigenous groups with current statutory access rights expressly retain these rights. They will not need to apply for access permission under this legislation, which does not disturb existing rights.


Section 400 is part of Maralinga Tjarutja lands. It was the site of atomic testing, as I said before, in the fifties and the sixties. In other words, access for the traditional owners—the Maralinga Tjarutja people—will not only be maintained but also will be enhanced. As I said, Defence has made it quite clear that the access through this area will come under the Minister for Defence and his department. They will take the necessary steps to excise section 400. Once completed, it will no longer be subject to the access restrictions that have applied under Defence Force Regulations 1952.


There is no point in repeating a whole lot of material that has been said by others. It is a very good coexistence model. This is jointly sponsored: it is a bipartisan piece of legislation that, as I have said, will enhance not only the South Australian and Australian economies but will also protect the rights of land owners. There will be a compensation regime in place for other land users. It will give miners greater surety to go in and spend the massive number of dollars to do exploration, which will be in the national interest.


As I said before the member for Grey came in and I will say it again, because the composure of this chamber has not changed, I find it passing strange that there is no South Australian here speaking on this bill. You would have thought that this was something exciting for those in South Australia. However, I understand that the member the Brand was born in South Australia, so there is some link there. It is a long bow, but I congratulate all those that are involved in supporting this bill and I recommend the bill to the House.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I was going to add to the member for Canning that my parents met in Woomera. My grandfather was in the Army and my father was there working at Maralinga.

"Gray, Gary, MP",ALP,2014-07-16,"



Mr GRAY
 (Brand) (11:21):  I am tempted to suggest that if you parents met at Woomera, that must have been on the occasion that the various rockets were taking off and sparks were flying through the air!



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  That is exactly right!




Mr GRAY:
  As the member for Canning reflects, I did grow up at Whyalla. I still remember evenings in the 1960s when we would go out, look into the horizon and know that a Skylark rocket was taking off. It was the original testing bed for those British-Australian cooperative rocketry research programs through the 1960s and 1970s. I also recall the great importance of the original discovery in the early 1970s of the Olympic Dam uranium find, which is one of the great finds that demonstrate the quality of Australian geophysical survey work and also shows the massive contribution to our economy—and in particular the South Australian economy—of that wonderful and innovative enterprise of Western Mining, which was under the leadership of Arvi Parbo. It found resources in remote parts of our country and helped build the magnificent, robust, reliable and innovative resources economy that we have today.


This piece of legislation, which opens the Woomera Prohibited Area for further minerals exploration and then potentially exploitation, is particularly important. It is particularly important in Adelaide but it is also important to our economy, as the mineralisation that we know exists through the Gawler Craton—which is expressed at what we now know as Roxby Downs, which is sometimes referred to as Olympic Dam—and those finds like the Carrapateena discovery in 2006 are all significant finds. They are all believed to be richly embedded in a uranium environment and all potentially highly productive for the South Australian economy and for our national economy.


This legislation saw its roots in a substantial piece of work commissioned by my predecessor, Martin Ferguson, and by the former Minister for Defence, Stephen Smith, in cooperation with the South Australian government. If I can just advise, I will speak for a short period of time to allow the member for Grey to speak on his own backyard. The work which had been done cooperatively and jointly in order to best utilise the highly prospective ground that formed the WPA is work that saw collaboration between the Department of Defence, the department of finance and the then Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism.


It is unfortunate that the final passage of that legislation through the Senate did not take place in the previous parliament. As we have been learning in recent weeks, and as I fear we will discover over the course of the next couple of years, the Senate can be a difficult place. This legislation was deliberately held up in the Senate in the previous parliament for no good purpose. We now see it here today and it is the fervent desire of the opposition to see this legislation enacted and receive royal assent as soon as possible in order for the best framework to be put in place cooperatively with the Department of Defence, the South Australian government, traditional owners and communities in this area of northern South Australia so that its mineral potential can be realised, so that that mineral potential can be understood and so that future companies can make decisions to extract those minerals and export them through the ports of South Australia.


It is highly likely that the minerals that will be discovered in this area will be metalliferous, it is highly likely that there will be uranium based metals, it is highly likely that there will be a lot of copper and it is a near certainty that there will be a lot of iron ore. But what is also certain is that the importance of this economic development to South Australia underwrites future generations of South Australians in employment and in wealth generation. So I commend this bill to the House. The opposition wholeheartedly supports this bill.


I will conclude by making one final point. All Australians were disappointed in 2012 when BHP announced that it would not be progressing with its then scheduled expansion of Roxby Downs. It was argued at the time that the overheated construction economy and the Japanese response to Fukushima had reduced the spot price of uranium to very low levels—and the uranium price today is less than half of what it was in those days of 2012. The reasons that were given were the high cap ex, the decisions in Japan on nuclear fuels demand and the overheated resource economy. It is our fervent hope that, at a time when the resources construction economy has substantially cooled, it will be possible to seek an expansion of Roxby Downs, further extraction of copper and uranium ores, further employment and further wealth creation. The Woomera Prohibited Area, the WPA, being brought into the exploration environment is a good thing for South Australia and a good thing for our nation. I commend this bill to the House.

"Ramsey, Rowan, MP",LP,2014-07-16,"



Mr RAMSEY
 (Grey) (11:28):  I thank the member for Brand for his comments and welcome the fact that this bill, the Defence Legislation Amendment (Woomera Prohibited Area) Bill 2014, has bipartisanship support. I would suggest that perhaps the member for Brand might read Senator Fawcett's speech on the hitches to the progress of this bill in the Senate. I do not think you will find they were of a partisan nature; in fact, it was more about Senate mechanisms than about any particular intent to hold this legislation up—because you are right, Member for Brand, this is very important for South Australia.


Unfortunately, South Australia leads the charge as the worst-performing state economically in the Commonwealth at the moment. As a South Australian, that is a great concern to me. I remember well when a number of the top 20 companies in Australia had their headquarters in South Australia. There was a time when South Australia was looked to for innovation and leadership throughout the nation. Unfortunately, our population growth has declined—and, in fact, in 2004 we lost another federal electorate. We went from 12 to 11. Unless population predictions change, we will lose another one in the next 15 years. That is not because our population is not growing; it is just not growing as fast as the rest of Australia.


You have to ask yourself why this is. Largely, we had industry based around manufacturing, where it is increasingly difficult for us to compete around the world—and when I say 'us' I mean Australia generally—and we relied on our agricultural products. Our agricultural industries are going well and still expanding and I think they offer great opportunity for the future. But it is in the mineral industries where South Australia, until relatively recent times, remained an unknown quantity. The geologists tell us now that the bulk of South Australia is covered by about 500 feet of sand and that has made it rather difficult to see what lies below. With the advent of magnetic surveys and other modern mineral detection methods we have found that in fact South Australia has a large number of very important resources. Quite often they are difficult to mine and expensive to get to because we have that overburden. The member for Brand mentioned the shelving of the expansion at Roxby Downs as an example of the impact that has had on South Australia and the disappointment it has caused, and that is true. Part of the reason for that is we have the best part of a kilometre of dirt to shift before we get to the ore body at Roxby Downs and that makes it a very expensive operation.


Roxby Downs is adjacent to the Woomera Prohibited Area—it is very close indeed. All the geologists believe there will be another Roxby Downs within the confines of the Woomera Prohibited Area. Already we have successfully mined Prominent Hill and three other iron ore mines with a significant upgrade at the moment of Southern Iron's, or Arrium's, northern province. About six million tonnes a year is currently being mined there and shifted by rail to Whyalla, where it is placed on barges and taken out to Cape-size vessels, adding to the six million tonnes that Arrium currently mines out of the Middleback Ranges.


I was very pleased when Dr Allan Hawke came to me, as the local member for the Woomera area, about two years ago and asked my advice on how we should open up this area for exploration and mining. I had met him and spoken to him about the review. He was very thankful that I was able to bring to the table, for the first time, the concerns and operations of the local pastoralists. We think about mining and sometimes forget about the people who are already making a living out of the land. In fact, he said some of the best advice he had came from the local pastoralists, who were able to tell him things about the land usage that others had not. So I was very pleased to be able to get their side of the argument into the equation.


The review sets up three different areas, which I think is a civilised and responsible way to give us an opportunity to open up new wealth for South Australia. As I said, we certainly need them. It seems that Defence has reached a very comfortable position in this area. There will, of course, be ongoing negotiation between those that choose to first explore the resource and then mine the resource, but we have a working paper from which we can launch ourselves forward. I hope it is going to lead definitely to more iron ore, because this is one of the keys to South Australia's future. I have mentioned the Arrium barging operation at Whyalla, but what we really need in South Australia is a genuine deep-sea port and we do not have one. Currently there is a large proposal on the Eyre Peninsula which has the ability to produce 20 million tonnes of ore a year and there is a proposal to build a port there. The rail system already runs past the Woomera region and the Braemar region, which is back up towards Broken Hill, all on the standard rail. If we can hook that back down to a new port development on the southern Eyre Peninsula we may have an iron ore industry in South Australia capable of producing between 60 million and 80 million tonnes a year. That is not the Pilbara, but let me tell you it is a seriously big pile of iron ore.


The opening up of the Woomera area actually feeds into that greater possibility for South Australia. As I said right at opening, it is difficult to see where South Australia is going to expand its economy if it is not going to come from the resources sector. Certainly we will continue to grow our aquaculture and agricultural sectors and we will learn to make more money out of what we already do. In fact, we will be able to downstream process and further add value to our agricultural products, but there is no doubt that the resources sector will play a very important part in South Australia's future. It is my belief the Woomera Prohibited Area will play a very important part within that.

Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden—Assistant Minister for Defence) (11:35):  In summing up the debate on the Defence Legislation Amendment (Woomera Prohibited Area) Bill 2014 I thank the members for their contributions today, especially the member for Grey—the only South Australian to have spoken here today about one of the major areas for expansion of the South Australian economy. It is great to see South Australia being so ably represented by my good friend and colleague the member for Grey, Rowan Ramsey.


The Defence Legislation Amendment (Woomera Prohibited Area) Bill 2014 gives effect to the recommendations of the Hawke review. The aim of course was to investigate the best use of the world's greatest rocket range in the national interest and how two parties, Defence and non-Defence users, can coexist. I think the bill has arrived at a sensible, negotiated outcome. It is an outcome where defence can continue to operate a rocket range longer than the British Isles—the biggest one in the world—in support of the work that we do.


This legislation recognises existing users and it preserves existing users' right, which is important for those who already have a stake in the area. It establishes a framework for those non-Defence users to actually come within the WPA and gives a level of certainty over what we in Defence will do and how the non-Defence users can work within that so that they can account for sensibly in a commercial manner the restrictions that will be provided—and the restrictions are small and they are not onerous. It allows users to make sensible commercial decisions with assurance of when we will ask them to leave the area—because, frankly, defence is using it to test weapons. Lastly, it protects the safety of all users in the WPA and ensures that the appropriate national security protections for an area that is used to test defence capability are indeed in place.


It is a good, negotiated outcome between Defence and non-Defence users. I think it will be good for South Australia. I thank the member for Grey for his astute comments in terms of the South Australian economy and his continual work in improving the South Australian economy and what it is doing. I hope this bill will go some way to assist him with the great task that he has ahead. I therefore commend the bill to the House.
