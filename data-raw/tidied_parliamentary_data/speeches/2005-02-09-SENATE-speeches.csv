"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2005-02-09,"—Last night when I spoke to this bill I made the point that, while I support the government’s introduction of new standards and its taking the lead in that regard, I express profound disappointment that it has taken so long for an agreement to have been reached between the Commonwealth and the states on this issue. It is a dispute that I note is now well over 10 years old, and it is yet another example of the difficulties that we face in building an education system based on equality and justice. Nonetheless, I strongly take exception to the proposition that the Commonwealth has now put to this parliament. I support the measure, but it has not provided the resources to back up the changes that it is now proposing to introduce.
As a consequence, the simple proposition is advanced by the opposition that the Commonwealth ought to put their money where their mouth is. They ought to be saying, ‘Yes, we support justice for all our citizens, particularly with regard to their educational opportunities.’ We ought to be able to provide opportunities for all students in this country to maximise their skills and to make sure that they take full advantage of all of their capacities. On the other hand, we should not say that this is entirely a matter for the states to deal with and that the cost should be shared for these high standards. With that in mind, I argued last night that the Commonwealth ought to put their money where their mouth is.
The other proposition that needs to be highlighted in this debate is that, while it is all very well for the Commonwealth to move advances in setting a framework for higher standards and definitions—something I strongly support—the fundamental problem comes back to attitude. It is not just a question of money; it is also a question of attitude. The principal source of discrimination in education is often attitude. It is the view that some people are not entitled to equal treatment, are not entitled to enjoy the full benefits of the education system. So, with that in mind, I am very concerned that some of the measures in this bill to extend the principles of undue hardship may well be taken advantage of by some education authorities where they have failed to meet their commitments in the past. We know that is the case because there are legal precedents for it, whereby some particular school authorities have taken the view that some students should not be enrolled in a school because it would place an undue hardship on that school. The measures in this bill extend the right of schools to take an attitude that says that undue hardship may be inflicted after a student is enrolled. I am concerned that that may cause a problem where the attitude of some school authorities is fundamentally based on discrimination.
This is particularly important, given that the state education systems are obliged to take all comers. That is one of the fundamental principles of our public education system in this country. That is not to say that some school authorities are without blame in this matter. I know that some state authorities have sought in the past to avoid their responsibilities. Nonetheless, the fundamental principle remains that it is more difficult for public education authorities to deny enrolment opportunities to students with disabilities. The same cannot be said for the private system, which is much more able to act in a discriminatory way in its new enrolments and continuing enrolments of students with disabilities. With that in mind, I strongly urge the Commonwealth to take the opportunity with this particular disability standard to develop a new, enlightened approach to professional development for teachers, lecturers, school principals and those who make decisions with regard to the requirements placed on them by these new standards. It is important that the theory of educational equality is matched with the practice of educational equality.
There could be no more fundamental human right with regard to a social democratic society than the capacity of each and every citizen to share in the resources of that society, particularly when it comes to education. So I take the view that if we are to be serious about removing discrimination towards people with disabilities then we have to make sure that the education system is genuinely inclusive. In that context we take the view that the government have a particular responsibility at the Commonwealth level to support professional development, and I am disappointed that that opportunity has not been seized by the government. I urge them to change their attitude in that regard and to make it the case that this government are able to ensure that human rights and equality of opportunity for all Australians, particularly our disadvantaged citizens, are able to be exercised. Labor support the Disability Discrimination Amendment (Education Standards) Bill 2004 [2005]. We strongly believe that the Commonwealth must immediately undertake negotiations with the states, territories and education authorities about improving the resource base to support these new standards.

",SENATE,<title>DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT (EDUCATION STANDARDS) BILL 2004 [2005]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2005-02-09,"—It is a very rare event that a bill seeking to constructively and positively address the imbalance experienced by people with disabilities comes before the Senate. We are much more used to seeing the government, particularly in recent years, introducing legislation in this place that tends to limit the income, reduce the support and add to the overall disadvantage faced by many people with a disability and by their carers. Sadly, we are likely to see more of that in coming months.
Rather than focusing on discrimination and other systemic barriers, the government continues to pursue a policy direction that can only punish those with a disability by effectively blaming them for their predicament. By restricting access to the disability support pension and forcing people with disabilities into the Job Network, and by limiting income and using coercion, the government seems to feel that it can ‘fix’ the people it sees as ‘bludgers with bad backs’—that is the perception. Never mind that many people with a disability and their carers are less competitive in the open market because of discriminatory employment practices, inflexible workplaces, restricted access to quality education, and particular needs which are often viewed by employers as little more than added hassle or extra cost. This is the approach we have come to recognise and expect from the government, and that is why, when a bill of this nature comes before the Senate, we should warmly welcome it and embrace it enthusiastically.
The education standards have taken a very long time to reach this threshold. It is well over 10 years since the Disability Discrimination Act came into effect and almost 10 years since the then Attorney-General requested that a range of standards be developed—the education standards being amongst them. In that time, only one group of standards—that relating to accessible public transport—has come into effect. Understandably, the repeated delays have been the subject of some criticism, and we Democrats have shared that frustration to some small extent. Nine years is a very long time in anyone’s estimation. This is especially so for people who have lacked suitable information about what their right to an accessible education actually means and for education providers who, uncertain about their obligations, have faced the possibility of discrimination complaints being made against them.
While it has taken some time to get to this point, the standards development process has facilitated a great deal of fruitful discussion about accessible education for people with disabilities, and we have moved forward as a community. Along with the Senate inquiry into the education of students with a disability, the report having been tabled in 2002, and the Productivity Commission’s review of the DDA, the report having been tabled in 2004, we now have a much clearer picture of education access issues for people with a disability than at any previous time. As a result, there have been many improvements in the education experience of people with disabilities in the years since the DDA was introduced. According to the Productivity Commission’s report, the number of students with a disability who are attending mainstream government, Catholic and other non-government schools has increased, and more are participating in higher education. These same students are also attaining higher levels of education, with more completing secondary school and further education. However, these improvements have not been uniform across all education sectors or for people with different and multiple disabilities.
While many students with disabilities are staying in education longer, they are still not up to the levels of students without a disability. They are far less likely, for example, to complete year 12, postgraduate degrees or higher level TAFE accreditation than their able-bodied peers. Additionally, students with a disability in higher education also tend to be located within specific fields, such as the arts and humanities, and are far less likely to undertake careers, for example, in accounting or engineering. Clearly we still have some way to go before we can confidently claim that students with disabilities are receiving the same quality education and results as their peers. Students with disabilities seeking to enter higher education have also been disadvantaged by the same funding cuts, reduced and withdrawn income supports, and increasing fees that have plagued all higher education students. When we consider the other barriers faced by students with a disability it can be argued that these policies have had a disproportionately harder effect on them.
The Senate inquiry report further highlighted significant issues in relation to the delivery of primary and secondary education programs. These issues are underpinned by an overall lack of funding, inappropriate and inconsistent targeting of existing funds, and poor staff training and development in some areas. These problems have left many teachers ill-equipped to cope with the diverse learning needs of their pupils. The result is that many students with disabilities, their parents and, in many instances, their teachers, feel poorly supported. Many also face the double disadvantage arising from multiple disabilities and/or economic disadvantage. According to the HILDA survey of 2002-03, families caring for a child with a disability have a net worth of up to 42 per cent less than comparable families, pushing many well below the poverty line. Many families caring for children with a disability face enormous hardship in maintaining adequate and stable incomes, with carers being far less likely to be employed and, for those who are, far more likely to be working part-time. Meeting regular daily costs, let alone any costs associated with a child’s disability, is a major difficulty for many families. These difficulties have been made worse by a history of reduced access to carers payments that have failed to keep up with the rising costs of ordinary living.
There can be little doubt, though, that all of these factors make accessing quality education and staying in it much harder for many people with disabilities. While the disability standards for education will not directly resolve many of these broader issues or have any impact on the harsh, unnecessary and unfair policy directions taken in that regard, they will assist to remedy and reduce at least some of the barriers to education that people with a disability encounter in their contact with schools, universities, TAFEs and other training providers. The standards clarify and elaborate on what education providers must do in order to meet the requirements of the DDA, thereby assisting them to eliminate discrimination and maximise opportunity, access and engagement of students with a disability in a learning environment.
According to the explanatory memorandum, the bill prepares the DDA for the subsequent introduction of the disability standards for education by, firstly, defining the term ‘education provider’; secondly, extending the unjustifiable hardship provisions of the act; thirdly, making discrimination in the development or accreditation of curricula or training courses unlawful; fourthly, requiring education providers to develop strategies and programs to prevent harassment and victimisation; and, finally, clarifying that reasonable adjustments may be required. While we Democrats fully support the principle of the bill and are really keen to see the standards pass quickly, we have also been concerned to ensure that this process occurs with full and proper consideration. This is why we referred the bill to a quick inquiry at the end of last year.
Although the process for developing the standards has been a lengthy one and the subject of much consultation, there were and continue to be a number of outstanding issues. While there is broad agreement about the principles underpinning the standards, state and territory education ministers have been unable to agree about what costs might be associated with their implementation. Throughout the course of the standards’ development, the states and territories provided widely divergent estimates as to how much the standards might cost to implement, ranging from that of the ACT and Tasmania, which believed costs would be negligible, to that of New South Wales, which cited costs in the order of $1.8 billion. As a consequence of these concerns, conditional support was given by the states in July 2003, provided the Commonwealth committed to providing new, non-recurrent funding for all professional development costs and the sharing of unforeseen costs arising from the standards. Cost estimates are not uniform across sectors either. The higher education sector believes it is already a long way towards ensuring that it meets the requirements of the DDA and does not expect substantial additional cost, while the non-government primary and secondary education sector have aired concerns about a disproportionate impact on their sector because, as they argue, the number of students within their systems is increasing at a rate far greater than funding growth.
The flip side of those arguments, however, has come from a range of organisations within the disability sector as well as the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and others. They are of the view that the standards do not create any additional requirements for education providers but, rather, describe existing obligations in greater detail. Therefore, they argue, there should be no additional costs attributable to the standards’ introduction. Independent consultants engaged by DEST as part of the regulation impact statement process agreed with this position and dramatically revised and reduced cost estimates. They did acknowledge, however, that costs associated with professional development were legitimate. They recommended one-off and new funding to help meet those costs. We Democrats have sympathy for that view.
As a matter of basic principle, we do not accept that the provision of accessible education to students with a disability should boil down to an argument about funding. Accessible education ought to be a fundamental right. It should be freely available and non-discriminatory in its approach. Additionally, we agree that the standards only clarify existing obligations on education providers, so they should have no real cost impact. We do, however, support the need for an education program accompanying their introduction. Such a program should not be financed by schools already starved of program and professional development funding. We welcome the government’s stated commitment to continuing the development of professional development materials, but we call on it to quantify this commitment and ensure that funding is also provided to make sure that these materials are comprehensively delivered in an appropriate professional development training environment.
Another area of significant concern to the Democrats at the time of the inquiry referral was the extension of unjustifiable hardship provisions within the act to all post-enrolment situations. The Attorney-General asserted quite correctly that this extension is consistent with recommendations contained in the Productivity Commission’s review of the DDA, but he failed to mention that this was conditional on the inclusion in the act of the concept of reasonable adjustment. Such an inclusion would act as a check and balance by expressly requiring education providers to ensure that all reasonable adjustments are made to the point of unjustifiable hardship to remedy discrimination on the grounds of disability. In effect, the government proposes in this bill to dramatically extend the circumstances in which education providers can claim a defence to discrimination and, in the process, severely restrict the rights of students, without providing the corresponding check and balance of reasonable adjustment as recommended by the Productivity Commission.
Disability groups, it must be said, were split on this issue. Although unanimous in their philosophical opposition to such a move, many had come to a position that the extension was a concession they were willing to make for the greater comparative benefit of the standards. Many others, especially disability law experts such as the Public Interest Advocacy Centre, People With Disability Australia, Australian Lawyers for Human Rights and Family Advocacy, maintained their concern. They argued that, while the concept of reasonable adjustment is referred to in the amending bill, it is not defined. Also, while it is referred to in the draft standards, it is not expressly linked to unjustifiable hardship provisions. The failure to include and link the concept of reasonable adjustment to unjustifiable hardship is further compounded, they argue, because the amending bill does not expressly require that any avoidance of discrimination must necessarily impose an unjustifiable hardship. It is simply enough to demonstrate that unjustifiable hardship is present, without exploration of alternative methods that might avoid that hardship. We Democrats share these concerns and believe these issues represent serious limitations in the bill.
Since these issues were raised late last year, however, the government has released its response to the recommendations of the Productivity Commission review of the DDA. In part, it has accepted the commission’s recommendation that a definition of ‘reasonable adjustment’ be included in the substantive act. The government’s commitment to a broader review of the DDA, especially in this regard, has been accepted by disability advocates and satisfied their immediate concerns relating to this bill. To that end, we Democrats will not seek to amend the current bill to deal with these limitations but join with the disability sector in calling on the government to ensure the Productivity Commission’s recommendations for improvement to the DDA are a matter of priority.
We commend the introduction of this bill. It is an important and positive step towards dramatically improving the experience of many students with a disability in education, by improving their access and reducing the discrimination they may suffer. The bill and subsequent standards represent the culmination of many years of work by a great number of people across disability, education and training, and government and non-government sectors, whose input cannot be underestimated. Having noted our concerns for improvement to the DDA and the need for additional funding for the standards’ introduction, we look forward to the passage of this bill and the speedy introduction of the disability standards for education.",SENATE,<title>DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT (EDUCATION STANDARDS) BILL 2004 [2005]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2005-02-09,"—I am very pleased to speak on the Disability Discrimination Amendment (Education Standards) Bill 2004 [2005]. As a former teacher and former member of the Senate Employment, Education and Training References Committee, it is always a subject in which I have taken a great interest. This bill amends the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 in minor ways to ensure that the draft disability standards for education are fully supported by the act. The standards will provide greater certainty and clarity for education providers as to their obligations under the act. The development of these standards has involved ongoing and extensive consultation with key education, training and disability stakeholders. Indeed, I note that the instigation of the work on the development of the standards was a request in 1995—10 years ago—from the then Attorney-General to the then Minister for Employment, Education and Training, seeking advice on the creation of disability standards which would make rights and responsibilities in the field of education and training easier to understand.
In December 1995, the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs agreed to establish a task force to oversee this task. Accordingly, in 1996, a task force led by the Australian government and comprising representatives of state and territory and non-government education and training authorities and providers, as well as the university sector and the DDA standards project representing the disability sector, commenced work on the development of a discussion paper that canvassed the feasibility and desirability of disability standards for education. This paper was endorsed by the ministerial council as the basis for consultation in 1997 with education, training and disability stakeholders. Importantly, the consultations found that 80 per cent of respondents favoured the production of standards but wished to be consulted on any standards produced.
Work on drafting the disability standards for education commenced in 1998. Their development involved an iterative process to define essential concepts, operational principles and performance measures. In 2000, the ministerial council agreed that the draft standards as then developed should be used as the basis for broad consultation with education, training and disability stakeholders. Twelve thousand copies of the standards and guidance notes, as then drafted, accompanied by a consultation paper, were released for comment in August 2000. Following those consultations, the draft standards were further amended to take account of the feedback received.
In July 2001, the ministerial council referred the standards to its senior officials committee, the Australian Education Systems Officials Committee, for agreement on amendments and clarifications to the standards and development of a regulation impact statement. A working group, which was established to assist the senior officials committee and covered the stakeholder groups, produced further drafts of the standards. At its meeting in July 2002, the ministerial council expressed concern over the delay in finalising the draft standards and requested resolution of remaining legal and financial issues. Legal issues raised by education providers and other stakeholders were systematically addressed by Australian government officials, in consultation with the Australian Government Solicitor.
In July 2003, the ministerial council considered the outcomes of this analysis and the final draft of the standards. While the ministerial council endorsed the form and content of the standards, the states, other than Tasmania and the ACT, indicated that their endorsement was subject to Australian government agreement to provide new, non-recurrent funding for professional development transition costs and to share unforeseen costs arising from the standards. The Minister for Education, Science and Training offered to make a contribution to the development of professional development materials to support the implementation of the standards.
As the meeting did not collaboratively endorse the standards, and consistent with the Australian government’s position, Minister Nelson announced that, having exhausted all options for collaborative endorsement of the standards, the Australian government would move unilaterally to implement the standards, and the minister issued a media release to this effect. The decision was also consistent with the recommendation of the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Committee when it released its unanimous report, Education of students with disabilities, in December 2002. The committee was strongly critical of the failure of ministerial council to reach agreement on the standards and urged the Commonwealth to act unilaterally to bring the standards into force.
We may well ask: to whom will the standards apply and how will they operate? The disability standards for education will apply to government and non-government providers in all education sectors—preschool, school, vocational education and training, higher education, and adult and community education—as well as to organisations whose purpose is to develop and accredit curricula and courses. The standards clarify and elaborate on the existing obligations of education providers under the DDA in five key areas: enrolment; participation; curriculum development, accreditation and delivery; student support services; and the elimination of harassment and victimisation. They also set out the rights or entitlements of students with disabilities, consistent with those of the rest of the community, to access and participate in education and training. The standards are accompanied by guidance notes, which provide additional explanatory material to assist the reader in interpreting and complying with the standards.
The standards recognise that, to overcome the disadvantage arising from their disability, students with a disability need to be treated differently in order to remove or reduce barriers to their participation in education. This is achieved through an adjustment, a measure or action that enables the student to enrol and participate in education on the same basis as students without disabilities. To identify and make an adjustment appropriate to a student’s disability, providers are required to consult with the student or their associate. The consultation may also involve an independent expert opinion.
An adjustment is only required to be ‘reasonable’—that is, to balance the interests of all parties affected, including the student with the disability, the education provider, the staff and other students. In addition, an education provider will not be required to comply with the standards if, and to the extent that, compliance would cause it ‘unjustifiable hardship’. Through the concepts of ‘reasonable adjustments’ and ‘unjustifiable hardship’ the standards seek to balance the needs of students with a disability against the obligations on providers. At present, it is only possible for an education provider to claim unjustifiable hardship at the point of enrolment of a student with a disability. The Disability Discrimination Amendment (Education Standards) Bill 2004 [2005] includes an amendment to extend the defence of unjustifiable hardship beyond the point of enrolment to also apply to the areas of participation, curriculum development, accreditation and delivery, and student support services.
Now that this long process has come to an end, the government has publicly stated its commitment to formulating and tabling the education standards when the bill has passed both houses. Once the amendments contained in the bill are passed, the Attorney-General will formulate the standards, which will trigger the statutory process in section 31 of the act. Subject to a notice of motion to amend the standards being given in either house of parliament, the date of commencement of the education standards is not less than 15 sitting days after they are tabled by the Attorney-General. Clause 2 of the bill provides that the amendments to the act will commence on a date to be fixed by proclamation. This will allow the commencement of the amendments and the education standards to be coordinated.
Beyond the parliamentary process, of course, the general public need to know what the education standards entail. The standards particularise positive steps that education providers will have to take, but implementation is a matter for individual education providers. To assist education providers to understand their obligations under the standards, plain English guidance notes have also been developed. As noted earlier, the draft education standards were negotiated with education providers and the disability sector in great detail over many years. Their development has been a collaborative effort involving representatives of state and territory governments and stakeholder groups within the education and training sector, including non-government education and training providers, universities and the disability sector.
Following formulation of the education standards, the Minister for Education, Science and Training will write to all schools across the country, informing them of the education standards and providing them with copies of the standards and accompanying guidance notes. Letters will also be sent to disability organisations to inform them about the education standards. The education standards and guidance notes will be made electronically available to the public by publishing them on relevant web sites, including those of the Attorney-General’s Department, the Department of Education, Science and Training, and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. In line with his offer at the 2003 ministerial meeting, the Minister for Education, Science and Training will contribute to the development of professional development materials to support the implementation of the standards. This has taken a very long time, and I am simply delighted that it has now happened.
On a more parochial note, I would like to note in this morning’s press an article by the education editor of the Age, which notes:
The—
Victorian—
State Government has backed down on effective education funding cuts for children with disabilities by preparing to spend an extra $7 million per year.
The article continues that last December:
... two days before school ended, eligibility rules for new students with disabilities were altered—
by the Victorian state government—
so that those entering specialist or mainstream schools this year would receive $6000 to $12000 less than they would have received last year.
This is an absolute outrage. The article continued:
Less funding meant fewer teachers and therapists and also threatened the viability of some specialist schools.
Yesterday, apparently, the Victorian Minister for Education Services announced that extra money would be made available. This is a notable backflip and one that I am delighted to note. The Department of Education and Training in Victoria is to contact every school with students who have been affected to make arrangements to adjust their budget as necessary. Although the education department in Victoria reckons an extra $7 million will be needed, some estimates have put the funding shortfall at $14 million, and it will be extremely interesting to note what, if any, further measures the Victorian education department and minister are going to take to rectify this situation.
The Association for Children with a Disability and its Chief Executive Officer, Mr Michael Gourlay, cautiously welcomed this change, but Mr Gourlay also said:
We will need to see the detailed workings of the formula, and the department’s costings, before we’re reassured that $7 million is enough to achieve the objectives the Government has stated.
So it is interesting that it has taken a great deal of outcry by those groups affected to make this change, and in response the government has, some three months later, made a change which will at least restore some funding to students with disabilities, although it remains to be seen whether this is enough.
It is significant that the article notes that until yesterday the government’s solution was to tinker with eligibility rules rather than to increase funding because, although in the last four years the state government has increased funding in the area by $111 million, this has failed to match the growth in the number of students diagnosed with a disability. Now that the Commonwealth government has at last brought down the disability standards, it will be interesting to see if the state government proceeds to match those in moneys provided for students with disabilities.",SENATE,<title>DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT (EDUCATION STANDARDS) BILL 2004 [2005]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2005-02-09,"—I would like to thank senators for their contributions to the debate on the Disability Discrimination Amendment (Education Standards) Bill 2004 [2005]. At the outset, can I say that the government is strongly committed to ensuring that all students are able to enjoy the benefits of education and training. The bill makes minor amendments to the Disability Discrimination Act that will ensure that the disability standards for education are fully supported.
This bill was referred for inquiry and report to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee, which reported on 8 December last year. A majority of the committee recommended that the bill be passed without amendment and urged the government to introduce the final education standards into parliament as soon as practicable after the passage of the bill. The support for the passage of this bill is very positive.
The primary benefits of the disability standards for education will be the clarification and elaboration of the obligations of education and training providers in relation to students with disabilities under the Disability Discrimination Act and the provision of guidance on how to meet these obligations. Secondly, education providers will have increased certainty in knowing that compliance with the disability standards for education is a defence to a complaint made under the act’s general provisions. Thirdly, persons with disabilities will benefit from clearer procedures in relation to the obligations upon an education provider to make reasonable adjustments and the need to consult with the student or his or her associate.
When adopted, the disability standards for education will clarify when and how a school needs to consult with a student with a disability. For example, a parent might accompany a child with a disability to school, and the school might need to assess with the parent what, if any, adjustment would be necessary in order for the student to participate in the school and its programs on the same basis as other students. I have seen examples of this on visits to schools, such as the installation of ramps, or signs for those who have visual impairments. These are practical issues which really can address a student’s disability.
It is important that there is a process of consultation with the student or the student’s associate to decide whether any adjustments are necessary. This consultation would include an assessment of the likely effectiveness of the adjustment for the student with a disability as well as its impact on other students. The student’s associate may not be a parent. In some cases, an associate might be a foster-parent, guardian, partner or another person with a genuine relationship, as set out in the act. Examples of the types of adjustments that might be appropriate include a student with a communication or learning disability being allowed extra time to complete an examination or providing assisting computer technology for a student with visual impairment, as I mentioned before.
Of course, most providers already make adjustments to meet the needs of students with disabilities. By clarifying the obligations of providers and how they can be met, the standards will ensure that all students with disabilities are able to participate in education on the same basis as other students. Given the importance of the disability standards for education to people with disabilities, it is important that this bill be passed as soon as possible. Passage in the Senate today is important to demonstrate support for these standards. It is an important milestone which will be well received by education providers and the disability sector. The standards will go a long way towards removing unlawful discrimination against people with disabilities participating in education or training.
A number of issues were raised during the debate. Senator Carr raised some issues and I would like to address those. Firstly, I reject Senator Carr’s assertion that the government has given scant regard to the costs borne by education providers. The standards and the amendments to the Disability Discrimination Act make clear that education providers will not be required to make adjustments for students with disabilities if those adjustments would cause the providers unjustifiable hardship. In addition, there should be no or very minimal additional costs incurred in implementing the education standards if providers are currently meeting their obligations under the act. Of course, the standards clarify existing obligations.
On 17 November 2004 my colleague the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Brendan Nelson, introduced legislation containing a $33 billion package of funding for Australian schools for the 2005-08 quadrennium. The funding includes an estimated $2.1 billion for a new overarching targeted program for literacy and numeracy and special learning needs targeted at the most educationally disadvantaged students, including students with disabilities. This money will be shared among the government, independent and Catholic school sectors. The minister for education has also offered to contribute to the development of professional development materials to support the introduction of the standards. These are all very positive aspects—
—They are very weak!
—They are not weak, as Senator Carr asserts. Of course, Senator Carr raised some other issues. One of them was: would the extension of unjustifiable hardship increase the disadvantage for students with disabilities? The government is keen to ensure that, once formulated, the education standards will reflect an appropriate balance between the interests of a student, or the prospects of a student, with a disability and the effects on the education provider of making an adjustment to accommodate that student. The amendment to extend the unjustifiable hardship defence beyond the point of enrolment will avoid the undesirable effect of discouraging educational institutions from admitting students with disabilities because they are concerned about the future potential unjustifiable costs of accommodating the students. In the Finney v Hills Grammar School case, the extension of unjustifiable hardship would have meant that the school could have admitted Scarlett Finney safe in the knowledge that, if future adjustments were necessary, it would not be required to make them, causing the school unjustifiable hardship.
In conclusion, the development of the draft disability standards for education—which will be supported by the amendments in this bill—are the product of extensive consultation with industry, government and disability sector representatives. The standards are a practical way of clarifying the requirements of the Disability Discrimination Act in the area of education. They will provide certainty for education providers as to their obligations under the Disability Discrimination Act and will clarify the rights of people with disabilities in relation to education and training. As I have said, this bill has wide support. Its passage should proceed as speedily as possible. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-02-09,"—The Bankruptcy and Family Law Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 [2005] will make a number of changes to the Bankruptcy Act 1966 and the Family Law Act 1975. The primary object of the bill is to address issues concerning the interaction between family law and bankruptcy law, which has created uncertainty as to the competing rights of creditors and the non-bankrupt spouse. Labor supports these aims and these changes. Some of these issues now contained within the bill have occupied for some time my time, the Senate’s time and estimates’ time.
The other objects of the bill are to provide a more effective means of collecting income contributions from bankrupts who do not receive their income as a salary or wage, and to prevent the use of financial agreements—that is, in relation to marriage—by bankrupts as a means of avoiding payment to creditors. In particular, those people who are not ordinary PAYE taxpayers have in the past had a greater propensity or capacity to make use of the inadequate interaction between family laws and bankruptcy laws by structuring their affairs in a way which has often left creditors and, of course, the tax office significantly out of pocket.
While the provisions of the government bill are sound to the extent they reach, the bill still fails to address the key bankruptcy controversy that instigated this batch of changes in the first place—that is, the issue of high-income professionals using bankruptcy as a means of avoiding their taxation and other obligations. Year after year, it seems the government has baulked at the very issue it should have addressed. It botched the exposure draft of the bill by hastily preparing provisions that went too far and caught way too many people. It has rightly ditched those far-reaching provisions, but has not managed to replace them with anything adequate and leaves, as a weeping sore, the potential for high-income earners to rort the system. In fact, we know that it was a very small number of people—largely a few barristers, most of them based in Sydney, I understand—who ever used these loopholes, in any event. But there is no excuse for the government failing to draft provisions to catch these people. Even the Liberal Party in its pro-business, pro-entrepreneurial culture should not condone ripping off small business creditors and the tax office.
More particularly, for some time now—right back to the original inquiry that exposed this—between the tax office and ITSA, the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia, we have at least understood that there were rorts going on. We then ended up with a report that did not provide, in my view, full details about what those rorts were. The explanation was given: ‘We didn’t want to encourage more rorts.’ If they are still continuing, then this government is not fixing those problems. It still remains to this day that some of those rorts, potentially, could be going on. We do not know. It is up to the Insolvency and Trustee Service but, more particularly, this government to manage its legislative program to find out what is going on and then come back with fixes that actually fix the problem. It should not use a scattergun approach or a broad approach to try to solve these things. It is a finite area. It needs considered, good work to track down and ensure that these things are dealt with appropriately.
Labor have also sought to bring forward some amendments to see if we can at least do what the government has failed to do. An earlier exposure draft of the bill was released by the Attorney-General in the weeks after he took on his job. It reflected the usual lack of attention that should have been drawn to this bill. When apparent weaknesses were quickly pointed out, he referred the bill to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for comment. The committee received 174 submissions and its report was tabled on 23 July 2004. Even surrounding that though were a number of shenanigans that went on that should not have gone on. I think those shenanigans can be sheeted home to the government side of the House. I do not intend to go into them now, but those who understand what went on will know it was a poor attempt by the Liberals to do some good work. They failed in my view.
What we find is that there were embarrassing inadequacies that were brought forward. The House of Representatives committee recommended that the amendments contained in schedule 1 of the exposure draft relating to tainted property and tainted money be abandoned. These provisions, although intended to cure the evil mentioned above, would have put at risk every legal and proper transaction of many small business owners and professionals over many past years. It is difficult sometimes to say it was poor drafting, because I do not like to blame the parliamentary counsel—the parliamentary counsel works on instructions, and those instructions usually come from the area that is concerned with the bill. So when I use the phrase ‘poor drafting’, it is not referring to parliamentary counsel, because they do a wonderful job. I think that sometimes the problem is that either the department or the agency that then moves the bill forward does not encapsulate what they actually want to achieve or, alternatively—and this is the sad thing that can happen sometimes—the minister or the minister’s office then intervenes and tries to shift the direction from actually fixing the nub of the problem, or sometimes they just miss it and use a scattergun approach. We might never know how it is that these things sometimes end up with a broad based provision like in schedule 1 as it was. Most of the submissions really did highlight the problem again and again. I am not sure if there was not one that did not continue to complain about that schedule 1. Perhaps the only person that did not complain about it in that instance was the Attorney-General’s Department.
The committee recommended that the amendments of the exposure draft bill found in schedules 2, 3 4 and 5 be implemented. In fact, I think most of the submitters were in agreement that there was a problem that should be fixed and should be moved forward. Those matters addressed if not all of the problem then part of the problem.
Turning to the provisions in this bill, the government took the committee’s advice. This bill contains amendments designed to clarify the interaction between family law and bankruptcy. It seeks to address concerns regarding the uncertainty facing both bankruptcy trustees and non-bankrupt spouses when family and bankruptcy proceedings occur concurrently. Under the existing law, different outcomes can arise depending upon the order in which events occur—for argument’s sake, separation, bankruptcy, and distribution of property—which sometimes provides incentives for deception to occur as well, unfortunately. Schedule 1 of this bill sensibly enables concurrent bankruptcy and family law proceedings to be brought together to allow all of these issues to be dealt with at the same time because, of course, sometimes human beings do not work in sequential order and things like this can get out of order. In this instance, at least schedule 1 allows all the issues to be dealt with at the same time as they arise or as unfortunate circumstances befall individuals.
I note that concerns have been raised in some quarters—they were outlined in the House of Representatives committee report—about jurisdictional problems in having the Family Court deal with bankruptcy issues, because the Family Court does not have established expertise in this area. However, the government believes these issues are surmountable and that they are outweighed by the benefits that these changes will make, and an increased reliance on the Federal Magistrate’s Court to deal with both matters should assist. I am sure that in the broader sense, by ensuring that bankruptcy and the division of property in marriage breakdowns can be handled by the court together, appropriate orders can be made so that the interests of all parties to the proceedings—the bankrupt, the non-bankrupt spouse and any creditors or other third parties—are equally and fairly taken into account. The experience I have had through estimates with the Federal Magistrates Service is that they will have the expertise within the overall place or develop it over time to ensure that fair and just outcomes are dealt with.
Of course, it is important that the law is flexible enough to deal with the many and varied circumstances and motives of parties that exist where bankruptcy and marital breakdowns occur concurrently—it is always a sad instance when that occurs—or at relatively similar times. Perhaps I do not need to provide a family history in this, but you can understand how bankruptcy can lead into marital breakdowns or marital breakdowns can lead into bankruptcy—unfortunately, they do seem to be sometimes wedded together, to use an unfortunate phrase. It also ensures that the technical timing of separation or bankruptcy is not a definitive factor which may disadvantage one or the other of the parties—for example, a creditor or a non-bankrupt spouse—and the provisions remove the incentive for people to use family law proceedings inappropriately as a means of protecting family assets that might otherwise be available.
Schedule 2 of this bill seeks to address the problem whereby some bankrupts, particularly high-income fee-for-service professionals, do not operate bank accounts in their own name. This practice renders the existing contribution and collection scheme ineffective because it is based on a system of garnisheeing—that is, taking out a proportion of a bankrupt’s income from their bank account. The proposed change gives the trustee the power in certain cases to require that a bankrupt pay all of their income into a bank account supervised by the trustee.
The proposed changes also provide for agreement to be reached between the trustee and the bankrupt on certain matters such as withdrawals from the account to meet the bankrupt’s living expenses or additional withdrawals to meet unexpected liabilities. That is dealt with on the proviso that the balance of the account remains sufficient to meet the bankrupt’s contribution amount—in other words, the amount is still sufficient to cover what is required. Decisions made by the bankruptcy trustee will be reviewable—firstly, by the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy and, secondly, by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal—so that the parties’ rights are safeguarded in that respect. Labor supports these measures to ensure that the obligations of a bankrupt to their creditors cannot be circumvented simply by a quirk of their accounting procedures and banking choice. It is essential to the integrity of bankruptcy law that the trustee is able to monitor any bankrupt’s income to ensure that all available money is returned to creditors.
Schedules 3 and 4 contain changes that also go to the interaction between family law and bankruptcy. They narrow the definition of ‘maintenance agreement’ under the Bankruptcy Act to prevent individuals from using other contractual arrangements—namely, financial agreements involving marriage under part VIIIA of the Family Law Act—to defeat the claims of creditors. Of course, maintenance agreements under part VIII will not be affected, including the liability of one party to a marriage to maintain the other under section 72 of the Family Law Act. In effect, what people are trying to ensure is that the system can work effectively without disadvantaging parties in other areas. You have to appreciate that a lot of thought has gone into the operation of this and the interaction between family law and bankruptcy—because it is a difficult area—notwithstanding their failing in relation to the earlier provision of schedule 1 that I talked about.
The aim of these provisions is to ensure that a potential bankrupt does not push himself or herself into bankruptcy by the very act of transferring valuable assets to their former spouse under one of these agreements. These provisions will also introduce a new act of bankruptcy that will occur when an individual is rendered insolvent as a result of assets being transferred under a financial agreement. So they are also trying to work through areas where persons might come up with neat little ways or inadvertent ways of defeating the purpose of the legislation. Labor supports these amendments and hopes they will be effective in preventing the inappropriate use of family law to contrive transactions with an intention to avoid the assets coming under the control of the trustee in bankruptcy. We also hope that between the family law, the relevant ITSA and the courts these circumstances can be monitored and a watching brief continued to see what happens to make sure there is no unfairness in the system, that justice is being done and being seen to be done, that those people who are obviously rorting the system can be singled out and that the system can take into consideration those people who might be unfairly caught by the system and the situation fixed where necessary.
Labor’s amendments go to the rebuttable presumption of insolvency that we will deal with in the committee stage. I will be returning to the notable omission from this bill and Labor’s suggested amendment to remedy it. We do not pretend that our amendments offer the answer to every use or abuse of the bankruptcy system but they seek to tackle an issue the government has failed to address despite extensive opportunity. We understand that the government will now be undertaking yet another consultative process in an attempt to address the anti-avoidance issues that have been raised consistently for the past four years—gosh, it has been that long—but we have a strong doubt about the government’s bona fides in this area given the length of time that has elapsed since they first became aware of this problem and their continued and repeated failure to grapple with it properly. Nearly four years on they are now releasing a discussion paper on this issue. Of course, the Labor Party will cooperate and take a strong interest in this process as we have done over the last four years and will continue to do so. These are important issues and we will continue to pressure the government to address them. But we must place on the record that an appropriate and detailed response should have been developed in response to this problem well before now.
Labor have taken account of the history of this issue and included in its amendments the presumption against the bankruptcy when they have an outstanding tax debt or where they have made a transfer of property but failed to keep adequate records. This is one of the methods discussed by the House of Representatives committee. It will not fix all of the problems but it goes some of the way. With the meagre resources of the opposition we put this forward as a serious improvement to that which the government continues to refuse to address. This amendment would ensure that the person who transfers assets to a third party at or below market value at a time when they proved to be insolvent could have action taken against them in recovering those assets. It will address the problem of high-income tax debtors abusing the present system and hiding behind difficult questions of proof that often face a creditor. Legitimate transfers will not be inappropriately caught—it is only a presumption which they can disapprove—but the evidentiary burden will shift to those who have done the wrong thing and will make it significantly easier for the trustee in bankruptcy to make out their case.
Labor propose that there be a rebuttable presumption of insolvency in certain circumstances—and they are set out in the amendments so I will not go through them in any detail now; we will deal with them in the committee stage. The sensible amendments shift the onus onto the very people whose actions are in question to ensure that these records are accurate and that their obligations to the Australian Taxation Office are fulfilled in the knowledge that if they fail in this regard there will be a presumption of insolvency against them. What flows from this presumption will bring the full weight of the law onto them if they have acted inappropriately while insolvent. Labor’s amendments reduce the evidentiary burden on the trustee in such a way so that again the bankrupt cannot rely on the absence of proper records to avoid scrutiny of particular asset transfers.
Our amendments act where the government has consistently failed to do so. They tackle the operational problems that exist in recovering assets from third parties under sections 120 and 121 of the act. The real difficulty, of course, in recovering assets from third parties who have received a transfer of assets is often not in the principle of the law but can concern evidentiary issues, that is, showing that assets were transferred to avoid them coming under the control of the bankrupt’s trustee. These may, for example, be in circumstances where their account and record-keeping has long since disappeared. Changes consistent with Labor’s amendments were suggested in several submissions to the House of Representatives inquiry into the poorly constituted exposure draft bill of the government, and these changes were viewed favourably by the committee.
By failing to adequately consult and develop a workable position on this matter the first time round and then failing to address this operational problem in the existing act through simple amendments, the government has ignored moderate and sensible changes that would have addressed legitimate problems in the existing law. Labor’s amendments are an appropriate additional step that can and should be taken in making these changes, and they are appropriate to the problem they seek to resolve. Labor are willing to support the other measures in the bill. We do, however, urge the government to support Labor’s amendments, which will further strengthen the law and tighten some of those loopholes which have allowed some high-flyers in the community to avoid tax or other obligations.",SENATE,<title>BANKRUPTCY AND FAMILY LAW LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004 [2005]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,4,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-02-09,"—Before I proceed, has the Labor Party circulated those amendments?
—We are onto that now.
—Thank you. The Bankruptcy and Family Law Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 [2005] has three main objectives. Firstly, it provides a more effective means of collecting income contributions from bankrupts who do not receive their income as a salary or wage. Secondly, it prevents the misuse of financial arrangements as a means of avoiding payment to creditors. Finally, it addresses longstanding issues concerning the interaction between family law and bankruptcy. The arrival of this bill and its debate and, I am sure, its passage today are to be welcomed.
As the Democrat spokesperson for finance, taxation and corporate affairs, I have previously dealt with bankruptcy legislation and actively participated in Senate and joint parliamentary inquiries into insolvency laws. In that respect, I draw the minister’s attention to the excellent report by the Joint Standing Committee on Corporations and Financial Services—a unanimous report—which we hope the government will respond to speedily. Change in the area of insolvency is much needed and should be fairly rapidly introduced.
There is a distinction between bankruptcy and insolvency, with the former referring to individuals and the latter referring to entities. Prior to 1990, there were fewer than 10,000 bankruptcies a year. However, in the financial years from 1997 to 2004 there were more than 20,000 bankruptcies per year. This is despite the strong economic conditions and the growth in personal wealth statistics that Australia currently enjoys. Back in 2002, when examining another bankruptcy bill, I noted the comments of Terry Gallagher, the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy, who said:
While it is no easier to go bankrupt now than it has been for many years, it is likely that excessive borrowing prompted by ready credit availability, perceptions of attainable living standards and a lessening of the stigma of bankruptcy have contributed to this increase.
Those remarks are as apposite now as they were then.
There are much freer banking practices, particularly with regard to the ability of people to use home equity for current consumption and particularly with regard to credit card access and availability. I am sure every member of the chamber, both parliamentarians and advisers, experiences what my family do; that is, constant unsolicited approaches by credit card companies to take one out, to raise your limits and all that sort of thing. Frankly, that sort of marketing to the wrong people and in certain circumstances is a contributor to people getting into difficulty.
Like previous legislation, this bill proposes to address bankruptcy law. Regrettably, it certainly does not and certainly cannot sufficiently address the root causes of bankruptcy. One of the things it is not able to address is our society’s problem with gambling and the delinquent approach of many states—thankfully not Western Australia—on the excessive availability of pokies and gambling outlets. It also does nothing and can do nothing to deal with unsolicited increases in credit card limits and the irresponsible promotion of consumer expenditure to people who cannot reasonably afford it. Members of the chamber would be aware that many of the charitable agencies are active in this field. One of the key areas they have to pay attention to is trying to encourage people to conduct proper family budgets and to restrain unwise expenditure.
In recent years, there has been a substantial increase in the number of bankruptcies. The government is attempting to encourage people to consider alternatives to bankruptcy and to clamp down on those who abuse the bankruptcy system. I urge the department, the government and the inspector-general to continue to be very proactive in this area.
Turning to bad examples, what is particularly offensive are revelations of people who use bankruptcy processes improperly as a means of tax evasion. I am referring, of course, to the many Sydney barristers—who unfortunately have not been named and shamed, which they should have been—who do this. The often arrogant pursuit of law and assumption of high morality in our courts of those particular people are not reflected in the way that they conduct their private affairs. They impugn the reputation, credibility and good faith of the vast bulk of barristers and lawyers who, I am sure—and so we are advised by the tax office—do conduct their tax affairs appropriately. Those revelations have highlighted the need to ensure the integrity of the bankruptcy system. When leading lights in our society behave in such a way it is hardly a good example to other Australians.
It was pleasing to note in the most recent annual report by the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy on the operation of the Bankruptcy Act that only 47 of the insolvent debtors were classified as legal professionals. It is a number that seems to be falling as a result of the publicity and as a result of the actions of some of the law associations, which deserve our full support in getting rid of those practices. However, my disappointment in some recalcitrant members of the legal fraternity was reinforced when I saw the front page of last Monday’s Australian. The newspaper reported that 30 per cent of barristers and half of all lawyers declared a taxable income under the top marginal rate of $62,500 in the 2002-03 financial year. They then had some spokesperson say, ‘Not as many of us as you’d expect earn that amount.’ Yeah, right! They think we are mugs. They deserve to be thoroughly audited as a result.
It was reported that the Second Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Gregory Farr, had earlier told a parliamentary inquiry into tax avoidance and bankruptcy that barristers were the worst tax avoiders compared to other professionals. In the parliamentary inquiry that examined this bill, Labor MP John Murphy correctly noted that ‘any form of tax avoidance sends a poor message to the taxpayers of Australia’ and that barristers were the ‘high priests of society’ and the talent pool from which future judges were chosen. It is surprising and disappointing to note the reports that one of the nation’s top judges has not lodged a tax return for seven years and a further 65 were at least 12 months late. I address these remarks to the minister: I wonder if perhaps the government should consider such matters as grounds for removal from office and perhaps legislate accordingly. Let us punish people who judge others but hold themselves above the ordinary legal requirements that we all have to comply with.
More generally, in my opinion the culture of tax avoidance is encouraged by the government’s overly generous provision of tax concessions, which encourage people to enter into negative gearing and pursue capital gains and other things. The thought that you can run losses on one side of your family balance sheet and cover those by your tax concession on another side has had the effect of getting some people into trouble, and God help them if the property market ever falls.
Getting back to the legislation before us, this bill will tackle some of the avoidance practices that have been used to manipulate Australia’s bankruptcy laws. Unfortunately—and this just reflects human nature—the government’s legislation cannot and will not put an end to some of the more outrageous abuses of the bankruptcy system by a few high-income earners, but it certainly will improve the ability to lessen those practices. Australians are rightly angry to see some corporate or former corporate high-flyers and other high earners in our society claiming bankruptcy and avoiding creditors despite having obvious wealth at their disposal through some third-party entity or family member. The report on insolvency I referred to earlier from the Joint Standing Committee on Corporations and Financial Services noted that there is a practice in, for instance, the building industry whereby people set themselves up as phoenix companies, go bust and then repeat the process again and again. It is an attitude that has to be stamped out. In my state of Western Australia we have one particularly high-profile example of such a crook. He is a dreadful person who wanders the beaches of Cottesloe, swanking about his ability to have robbed ordinary Australians of their money, and now he can build mansions and claim investments all over the world. It is disgraceful that such people are able to get away with it.
I have heard the government’s and the Labor opposition’s words of condemnation of those practices, and I hope that all parties continue to bring forward measures to limit the prospects of such behaviour and to tighten the screws on people who behave like that. Such people should not be able to avoid creditors through artificial arrangements that secure their own financial wellbeing but result in great hardship to others who have entered into business arrangements with them in good faith. While it is true that the bankruptcy system must guard against abuse, care in addressing the abuses must not result in preventing access to bankruptcy by those with a genuine need to do so. We should always understand that bankruptcy laws were designed right from the very beginning as a safety net for those experiencing unfortunate circumstances in life. Most bankrupts today, probably as always, are low-income earners who owe relatively small amounts of money. Those who genuinely require recourse to bankruptcy should not face unnecessary artificial barriers or be subject to unduly punitive measures. They should be given the chance of rehabilitation, and I think the government and this legislation are conscious of that.
We have had some correspondence from people in the small business community lobbying concerning changes to the bankruptcy laws that they think will adversely impact on the sector. However, those constituents are referring to the controversial first schedule of the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment (Anti-Avoidance and Other Measures) Bill 2004. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs conducted an inquiry into that bill. As I understand it, the government has not yet responded to the controversial aspects of that bill, but this bill contains the non-controversial aspects. The committee recommended that the non-controversial schedules—the ones contained in this bill—be passed, and the Democrats agree with that view.
The three areas covered by this bill are based upon recommendations of the joint task force report entitled The use of bankruptcy and family law schemes to avoid payment of tax. The task force consisted of officers from the Attorney-General’s Department, the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia, the Australian Taxation Office and the Treasury. I note that there are two minor technical differences between the original bill introduced in the last sittings and this bill, and the Democrats have no problems with those. There is also the Labor Party amendment to the bill. As I understand it, the amendment is a conversion of a recommendation of the Law Council. It creates a rebuttable presumption of insolvency if a person who is bankrupt makes a transfer of property and either has outstanding tax returns or has failed to keep proper accounts. I think that kind of tough approach to people who have a bad history has merit and seems reasonable, especially since it has been considered at length by the Law Council, but I look forward to hearing the minister’s views, and I will then see whether the Democrats should support it. But at this stage I am quite attracted to the idea put by Labor, as I understand it.",SENATE,<title>BANKRUPTCY AND FAMILY LAW LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004 [2005]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,4,1
"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2005-02-09,"—The Bankruptcy and Family Law Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 [2005] is an important move towards consolidating confidence in Australia’s bankruptcy laws. As members have already noted in this debate, it ensures that we progressively look to tightening provisions in both family law and bankruptcy law which permit people to avoid the payment of tax. In this debate, others have suggested that there is quite some way to go before everybody can be confident that all Australians are paying their fair share of the tax burden. Indeed, while laws remain very complex and procedures very involved to prevent the avoidance or evasion of tax, then clearly there will be much industry employed across this country, particularly by lawyers and tax accountants, to discover ways of avoiding those schemes. We need to be one step ahead of that, and I see this legislation as being one way of dealing with that. But I also think it is important to observe that this legislation is about ensuring that, when Australian families are unfortunate enough to be put in the position where they are interacting simultaneously with the bankruptcy laws and the family laws of this country, their position is clarified and the steps that they might take to deal with those situations simultaneously are clear.
This bill looks at the recommendations that were made by the joint task force report on the use of bankruptcy and family law schemes to avoid payment of tax. That task force reported and the Attorney-General took steps to implement key recommendations of the task force through the tabling of a draft bill, which has in turn been considered by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. Although Senator Ludwig described as shenanigans the proceedings of that committee, or the steps taken around that committee to progress this draft bill at that time, I note that nonetheless the committee did recommend substantially that at least schedules 2 to 5 of the exposure draft of the bill should proceed. That, indeed, is what is occurring with this piece of legislation.
The bill is designed to ensure that we are able to provide assistance to Australians who are in the position of having to resolve a family breakdown and deal with the settlement of property while at the same time perhaps setting up arrangements for the maintenance of a spouse. The bill is designed to ensure they have the assistance they require to know what they must do and how they must take steps to deal with that situation. At the same time it ensures that the arrangements are robust enough to prevent situations where those circumstances would give rise to tax evasion. It is a sad observation to make that some Australians, even in the midst of a family breakdown and the separation of the two parties, might nonetheless be united in a desire, to some degree, to mutually avoid the obligations they have to the tax man. These measures are designed to minimise the opportunity for them to do that.
As I have said, this bill substantially implements recommendations made in the joint task force report on the use of bankruptcy and family law schemes to avoid the payment of tax. The task force report is useful reading. It is important to acknowledge that it deals with a number of circumstances and, in one sense, that work is not yet completed. There is more to be done to ensure that this area of the law is sufficiently sound to prevent the sorts of situations arising that members have referred to already in this debate.
The government has already acted on some parts of the recommendations of that task force. Amendments were introduced last year to the Family Law Act 1975 to put in place some of those recommendations. The amendments were designed to increase the certainty of standing for third-party creditors to intervene in family law property proceedings and, in certain circumstances, to seek to have some of those orders set aside or overturned. Giving creditors the power to step into those arrangements is an important part of being able to ensure that Family Court proceedings are not used to avoid obligations that lie elsewhere.
The Family Law Amendment Bill 2004, to which I refer, also contains provisions to ensure that financial agreements are not entered into by couples for the purpose of avoiding creditors. This bill takes that process somewhat further. It is focused particularly on the powers and procedures that are available to courts in relation to family property and financial arrangements under the Family Law Act 1975. Perhaps the most significant provision in the bill is contained in schedule 1, which deals with amendments that clarify the rights of the bankruptcy trustee and the non-bankrupt spouse in a marriage and ensures that there is certainty as to the competing rights of those two parties. Clearly, the question of who has first call on the assets of a marriage in the event of a marriage breakdown—creditors or a non-bankrupt spouse—is a complex question and is not, as such, answered by this bill. It is answered, in a sense, by existing family law principles and by provisions made under the bankruptcy legislation.
A problem to date has been the fact that those two sets of laws have been administered by separate courts. We have bankruptcy law being administered in the Federal Court and we have the Family Law Act 1975 being administered in the Family Court of Australia or, in the case of Western Australia, the Family Court of Western Australia, and there has been a limited capacity for each of those courts to consider the jurisdiction of the other. Importantly, this bill creates a kind of cross-vesting arrangement to ensure that, where proceedings are in progress in one of those courts, it is possible for the legal provisions that would govern the operations of the other court to be considered at the same time.
Amendments in schedule 1 allow concurrent bankruptcy and family law proceedings to be brought together in a court exercising, for example, Family Court jurisdiction, to ensure that all the issues dealing with that breakdown are happening at the same time in the same court. It is achieved by giving courts exercising family law jurisdiction the additional capacity to consider bankruptcy matters and to facilitate the involvement of bankruptcy trustees and third-party creditors in family law proceedings. At one level that may not appear to be an appropriate step to take. To have a husband and a wife dealing with the assets of the marriage, or perhaps even the children of the marriage, in court and having their bankruptcy trustees or other creditors present at the bar table, so to speak, may not appear to be desirable in all cases. But it is important that families be able to deal in an effective and efficient way with all of their assets and all of the issues surrounding the breakdown of their marriage.
If they need to approach two courts or go through two processes to do that, or have separate sets of laws apply to their situation in a disjointed way, we run the risk of adding to their distress and contributing to a process which is not desirable. We need to make that process more efficient, and essentially that is what the amendments to schedule 1 of this bill achieve. By merging the courts’ jurisdictions in cases where there is jurisdictional overlay or overlap, the amendments will allow the courts exercising family law jurisdiction to consider, for example, both family law related issues and the non-financial contributions of a non-bankrupt spouse to the acquisition of family property.
There is, as I have said, the other side of the coin in this legislation. As I have said, it is about facilitating processes for parties to a marriage to settle their affairs at the end of the marriage. It is also about being able to ensure that parties who have an interest in the assets of that marriage are not disadvantaged by virtue of the breakdown of the marriage. The other side of that coin in schedule 1, therefore, is that the trustee in bankruptcy can be a party to property or spousal maintenance proceedings in the Family Court. The court will have jurisdiction over property that has become vested bankruptcy property—that is, the Family Court will be able to exercise some say in property which has effectively been covered by or affected by an order under bankruptcy legislation. The court will be able to make an order against a relevant bankruptcy trustee as part of the property adjustment, effectively allowing the trustee to stand in the shoes of the bankrupt spouse.
That obviously provides some certainty. Although it might not in all cases be a welcome intrusion, it provides some certainty to the parties. It offers procedures and protections to a non-bankrupt spouse. They will know where they stand in that event. As well—and this is an important qualification—the court can be on notice about the interests of creditors of a bankrupt spouse and can take those interests into account so that the order that is made at the end of the day does not prevent the legitimate creditors of a bankrupt from obtaining access to assets of the marriage.
Schedule 2 of the bill goes on to establish an enhanced regime for the collection of income contributions under the Bankruptcy Act 1966. At the moment, the Official Receiver can collect contributions to repay outstanding creditors from a bankrupt wage earner’s salary or bank accounts. They can garnishee those. That is an important part of ensuring that there is access to the sorts of income which Senator Murray referred to as too often not reaching creditors. The existing provisions, however, do not always give the bankruptcy trustee or the Official Receiver the kind of access which is necessary to ensure that there is full control over the income of, in particular, a self-employed bankrupt. When a person is employed, it is relatively easy to garnishee their wage or salary. When they are self-employed that is not so easy. So these amendments ensure that it is appropriate and possible for there to be a supervised account regime ensuring that the trustee is able to access all of the bankrupt’s income. Effectively, the order can cover the account into which money is paid, from whatever source, and it is regulated in some way so that a certain amount can be made to reach the bankrupt and a certain amount can be diverted in an even-handed and effective way to meet the legitimate expectations of creditors of one sort or another.
The other two schedules to the bill, schedules 3 and 4, are amended as well in a way that will prevent people from using financial agreements under part VIII of the Family Law Act 1975 to effectively step around the obligations owed to creditors. This is done by ensuring that the existing clawback provisions in the Bankruptcy Act 1966 can be used to recover transfers that are made in bad faith that would have the effect of defeating the interests of creditors. The extent to which this occurs is a matter that we might speculate on. Nonetheless, it is undoubtedly the case that some financial settlements entered into at the end of a marriage do incidentally or deliberately have the effect of avoiding the obligations of parties to that marriage to pay tax or to meet their obligations to creditors. It is important that that not be allowed to continue. So the capacity of parties to a marriage to use financial agreements to prevent the recovery of those sorts of debts is a step taken in this legislation.
The amendments will also create a new act which triggers the operation of bankruptcy laws—a new act of bankruptcy. Where a person is rendered bankrupt or insolvent as a result of a transfer that is made pursuant to a financial agreement, that will amount to an act of bankruptcy. That then allows the bankruptcy trustee access to dispositions of property made after that act of bankruptcy is committed. Clearly, an act of that kind can be characterised as an act designed to avoid legal and financial obligations and, where that occurs, powers should be vested in the bankruptcy trustee to make sure that those assets do not escape the proper administration of such a position as the bankruptcy trustee.
Senator Ludwig, in the course of his comments on this bill, suggested that this was not a serious attempt on the government’s part to deal with the abuse of bankruptcy laws in Australia. It seems to me to be just slightly ironic that, in the midst of debate about legislation designed to prevent people from abusing bankruptcy laws, that kind of comment can be made, but nonetheless I refute it. I think that the government is demonstrating its commitment to ensuring Australians do not avoid their obligations.
—It doesn’t go far enough and you know it.
—Senator Ludwig insists, obviously, that we have not gone far enough in this legislation, but I note that in his remarks earlier today he failed to mention exactly what further steps the government ought to take. No doubt Senator Ludwig has a gladbag somewhere with wonderful ideas on how Australia can further crack down on the abuse of bankruptcy laws or family laws, but I do not know what those provisions might be and I look forward to him laying out in some way what those provisions might be.
For my part, the government is clearly taking steps to ensure that Australians do meet their obligations. The coalition government does not condone the evasion of tax and will take steps to ensure that Australians who evade their tax are properly prosecuted. If the laws are not tight enough to deal with cases where taxes properly owing are not paid then those laws will be tightened and followed through. The demonstration of that is in the bill before us today. I am very proud and pleased that the government is demonstrating once again that it has the capacity to respond to problems in the administration of our law and bring forward solutions to it in the form that the Bankruptcy and Family Law Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 [2005] represents.",SENATE,<title>BANKRUPTCY AND FAMILY LAW LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004 [2005]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,4,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2005-02-09,"—I thank senators for their contributions to the debate on the Bankruptcy and Family Law Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 [2005]. I say at the outset that the government welcomes the opposition’s support for the bill. Senator Ludwig raised a number of issues and I will deal with each of those in turn shortly. This bill will assist in resolving the longstanding uncertainties in the interaction of bankruptcy and family law. The bill will provide creditors and non-bankrupt spouses with protections and procedures that were not previously available for the resolution of their competing claims, and this is very important. Under existing law both creditors of parties in family law matters and spouses have faced uncertainty and complexity in navigating the interaction between bankruptcy and family law. This bill provides a concurrent jurisdiction so that competing claims in these areas of law can be determined at the same time and in the same forum. The bill will also address the misuse of family law schemes to defeat the interests of creditors and will allow a court exercising family law jurisdiction to recognise the interests of creditors in appropriate cases. Further, the bill offers an improved regime for the collection of contributions from bankrupts, particularly in cases where that has previously been difficult to enforce.
The amendments represent a considered response by the government to the recommendations of the 2002 joint task force on the use of bankruptcy and family law schemes to avoid tax. These are significant reforms that necessarily involve careful development and extensive consultation with experts in the areas of insolvency law, business and family law. This bill has also been subject to parliamentary scrutiny by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, and some family law amendments were considered by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee as part of a previous family law bill. The amendments in the bill have been further refined to take into account the recommendations of those committees responding to the views of significant stakeholders in the areas as well.
I mentioned some issues that Senator Ludwig raised. Senator Ludwig commented on the fact that the bill does not contain the anti-avoidance provisions which have previously been dealt with. Furthermore, Senator Ludwig criticised the approach—the general procedure, the drafting and the instruction of the drafters of this bill. The original bill was released as an exposure draft to provide consultation with the community. The government listened to comments from the community, the stakeholders, and made a decision to withdraw the bill at that stage because of the unintended consequences that were being pointed to as a result of the consultation that took place. Senator Ludwig said that you need considered good work on this issue, and the government is the first to agree with that—it says that this is a complex area and we must get it right. In the last day or so we released a discussion paper which outlines options to strengthen the anti-avoidance provisions, and I believe that this is in keeping with the recommendations made by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. With this discussion paper we are concentrating on the anti-avoidance provisions. Senator Murray made a comment on this very issue and I want to assure him, the opposition and all those concerned that the government is totally committed to taking action to target high-income earners avoiding their debts and taxation. There is no question about that commitment.
What we need to do is get it right. That is why we have looked at the anti-avoidance part of the bill and put it to the community by way of a discussion paper. We are proceeding with those aspects of the bill which are very important—namely, the symmetry between family law and bankruptcy law. That is something I experienced as a legal practitioner before coming into the Senate. The fact is that those two areas of federal law operate in tension with each other, and sometimes that has consequences which I believe do not serve the interests of justice. This bill does have the commendable purpose of sorting out that aspect of bankruptcy law and family law. We are saying that rather than holding up these worthwhile objectives let us refine the anti-avoidance provisions by way of a discussion paper and provide options for the strengthening of those anti-avoidance provisions. That is what we are doing. I understand that the opposition has amendments. We will deal with those, no doubt, along with other amendments in the committee stage. But this is a very important bill in the areas of family law and bankruptcy law and I commend the bill to the Senate.
Question agreed to.

"Senator TIERNEY,",LP,2005-02-09,"—I rise today to inform the Senate of the challenges that face the world in the area of mental health. I have often spoken in this chamber about mental health policy in Australia and the funding challenges that we face. Last year, as the leader of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the United Nations General Assembly in New York, I received an international perspective on many policy issues, including mental health. Over time, the world’s nations have taken very different approaches to the plight of people living with mental illness. Not long ago in developed countries such as Australia, our most vulnerable people were locked up in asylums, never to be seen again by their friends and family. Not long ago, mental illness was something that we preferred not to talk about. When we did talk about it, it was seen as a problem in the rich, developed countries. However, one-quarter of the population of developing and developed countries now have a mental or behavioural disorder in their lifetime.
It is quite clear that mental health knows no borders. It is an issue that needs global attention. In fact, people in developing countries are often faced with a greater burden because of exposure to war and conflict, dangerous living conditions, exploitation and physical health problems caused by things such as lack of nutrition. What is more, access to services and medicines in developing countries is severely limited. This impedes an individual’s ability to access treatment. As a global community we are also becoming increasingly aware of the interrelationship between physical and mental health and the increasing disease burden that mental ill health is placing on society, sufferers and their families. Mental illness affects and is affected by chronic conditions such as cancer, heart disease and AIDS. Untreated mental illness can result in diminished immune functioning, noncompliance with medication and unhealthy behaviour.
The challenge is almost overwhelming, with 450 million people worldwide affected by mental, neurological or behavioural problems at any one time. Worldwide, about 873,000 people die by suicide every year, with depression contributing to 60 per cent of suicides. In some countries, more people die as a result of suicide than of traffic accidents. Those living with a mental illness are often subjected to social isolation, poor quality of life and increased mortality. One-quarter of all patients presenting to a health service are suffering from at least one mental, neurological or behavioural disorder. These disorders are a cause of staggering economic, social and personal cost.
What is most alarming is that the overwhelming majority of people with these disorders go undiagnosed or untreated, which severely limits their ability to lead healthy and fulfilling lives. The burden is difficult to measure, as the effect of lost productivity of family members or carers and the impact of stigma and myths associated with many mental illnesses are very difficult to quantify. What we do know is that there are huge financial and social costs in millions of people not reaching their full potential. We also know that many mental illnesses are treatable and even preventable. The last 10 years have seen tremendous improvements in our understanding of and ability to treat mental and behavioural disorders.
Over the last two decades there has been a growing movement to put mental health on the global agenda. In 1991 the UN General Assembly resolved that persons with mental illness shall be treated with dignity and humanity; shall be free from exploitation, abuse and degrading treatment; and shall be entitled to care and treatment at the same standard as other people who are ill. In 1995 the Secretary-General said:
To secure mental health for the people of the world must be one of the objectives of the United Nations in its second half century ... Our objective is to promote the mental health and well being of all the inhabitants of the planet.
In 2001 mental health was selected as the theme for World Health Day and as the technical subject for the World Health Report for 2001. This was an acknowledgement of the need for increased focus on mental health issues globally. The report focused on the medium-term aim of promoting positive mental health and instituting measures to work towards the prevention of ill health in the longer term.
There is a growing feeling and need for change. From an international perspective, Australia has come a long way in the area of mental health and has seen far-reaching reforms over the past two decades. Yet we still see many people living with mental illnesses who are not receiving the care and support they need. Nationally, we are now in the early stages of the third National Mental Health Plan 2003-08. It is a fine plan, agreed on by all federal, state and territory governments. This plan has received favourable international recognition. The World Health Organisation’s 2001 report, Mental health: new understanding, new hope, noted that Australia’s National Mental Health Strategy ‘has demonstrated that changes can be achieved in national mental health reform’. Like many other nations, Australia’s National Mental Health Strategy has deliberately shifted our focus from institutional care to community based care. Resources that previously targeted maintaining centralised mental health facilities have now been redirected to provide services delivered through a spectrum of service models, including general practitioners, community centres, day centres, specialist general hospital wards and small specialist hospitals.
The challenge now is to ensure that appropriate funding follows. Whilst Australia has made significant progress against the national reform agenda, there remain large challenges to be addressed. The number of mentally ill people who are committing suicide is rising, and many families still do not have access to the services they so desperately need. Like many developed countries, Australia needs to further integrate mental health services not only into the community but also into the primary health care system. In particular, we need to balance resources and the disease burden for mental health.
Mental illness in Australia makes up 14 per cent of the disease burden but only 9.6 per cent of health funding. Some experts estimate that funding is as low as 6.1 per cent, depending on how you define mental illness. This imbalance has meant that there are insufficient resources to support a wide spectrum of mental health services. Australia is not alone in this problem. The World Bank’s 1993 report, World mental health, presented at the United Nations in 1995, showed that mental health is responsible for more than one-tenth of the total disease burden globally, and that is projected to rise to 15 per cent by 2020. Suicide is among the top 10 causes of mortality globally. Five of the top 10 causes of disability globally are mental health problems, and depressive illnesses are expected to be the second biggest cause for the disease burden in 2020. Depression is already the fourth-ranked cause of the disease burden and in 2020 it is expected to rank second, following heart disease. In spite of a growing body of information available pointing to the increasing disease burden of mental ill health, there is a huge gap in funding and the lack of treatment available in developing countries is appalling. In some places 95 per cent of depression cases go untreated, along with 80 per cent of schizophrenia cases.
Around the world, people understand the need to provide high-quality health care but their focus is often on physical health. Last October, World Mental Health Day focused on the relationship between physical and mental health. Many people with chronic physical diseases, such as diabetes and cancer, also experience undetected and mistreated psychological and emotional problems. Approximately one-quarter of people in the world living with cancer will suffer from depression, and depression can weaken people’s immune systems. People with chronic depression are also more likely to develop cancer than those not suffering from depression. This is why the national mental health policy should not be solely concerned with mental illness but should also address the broader issues affecting the physical and mental health of all sectors of the community. This may mean refugee and settlement programs, training programs for the unemployed, reducing domestic violence and providing support for additional services to the elderly. Policymakers, health insurers and even members of the health profession still discriminate between physical and mental health services.
Mental health treatment requires multisectoral action that not only involves the health sector but also works with education and employment services, community based organisations, industry, churches and other organisations. In the words of Gro Harlem Brundtland, the Director-General of the World Health Organisation in 2000:
Only when a comprehensive strategy for mental health which incorporates both prevention and care elements is adopted, will we see substantial and sustainable progress.
We need to fight against the stigma of mental illness that can act as a barrier to sufferers seeking the kind of help they need. Stigma exists because of a lack of public understanding that could be remedied by a combination of working with the media and designing specific community information campaigns. The advances in understanding of mental disorders and human behaviour are providing reasons to be optimistic about future treatment. The results of studies and breakthroughs should be made available to all people, whether from developed or developing countries.
Research funding for mental illness, particularly in the developing world, should be given a much greater priority. At present, only two per cent of research into mental health occurs in the developing world, with its many different pressures and needs. This disparity is resulting in a large treatment gap for sufferers in developing countries. Twenty-five per cent of nations do not have access to the three most commonly prescribed medications for schizophrenia and depression. Pharmaceutical companies should ensure that the benefits of their research and development flow on to developing countries. They should consider relaxing intellectual property rights and delivering generic products to poorer nations where the need for this medicine is very great.
On World Health Day in 2001, the United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, said:
It is time for governments to allocate resources and establish public policy to meet mental health needs.
And yet more than 30 per cent of countries have no mental health programs and even more have no mental health policy. Mental illness has become one of the world’s leading causes of illness and disability affecting one in four people worldwide. Yet with most middle- and low-income countries devoting less than 0.1 per cent of their health expenditure in this domain, governments are still not giving mental health policy and programs the attention and resources they need. Countries around the world are paying a very high price by failing to provide appropriate mental health treatment and prevention for their people.
In our rapidly changing world, the mental health disease burden is likely to rise. It is more important than ever that we acknowledge the large disease burden of mental illness and know that many of these disorders can be successfully treated and managed. We need to provide care and treatment that is aimed at achieving each individual’s own highest attainable level of health and wellbeing, and governments should establish a goal of parity between the disease burden of mental health and the resources that are allocated. Surely, this is a crucial step in ensuring the welfare of some of the most vulnerable in our society—those living with a mental illness.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Health: Mental Illness</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST,7,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2005-02-09,"—For Senator Bolkus’s benefit, I have the relevant tax expert from the relevant department here to give me some advice in relation to tax matters and grants. I will pass that on to Senator Bolkus. Government grants that are provided to resident individuals and families are not taxable. For example, the Commonwealth ex gratia payments are not taxable. Business related grants are treated as assessable income, but the associated expenditure is deductible either immediately or over a certain period of time, depending on the nature of the expenditure. For example, a South Australian farmer who immediately spent the entire amount of the business grant on, say, feed for his livestock would claim that as a deduction.
The assessability of grants has been a longstanding feature of the tax laws. South Australian businesses have not been singled out. The same laws applied to businesses affected by the 2003 bushfires in Canberra and Victoria. They were treated the same. Given the devastating effect of the bushfires, the Commonwealth has provided a comprehensive relief package which better targets and assists those affected. The Commonwealth initiatives include the provision of family and community grants through Centrelink and crisis payments.
Centrelink granted 48 claims totalling approximately $15,000 in the period up to when the Australian government ex gratia assistance was announced by Minister Hockey on 14 January. Regarding the ex gratia payments, as at 7 February this year—a couple of days ago—Centrelink has received 355 claims and, as of today, about 262 have been processed. Approximately $285,000 in ex gratia assistance has been paid to date. Payments of $1,000 per eligible adult and $400 per eligible child are available to those whose principal place of residence has been destroyed or is uninhabitable and to those who have lost an immediate family member as a result of the fires. Centrelink has also provided staff to assist on the ground, including customer service staff and additional psychologist and social work resources.
The Senate would be aware that under the natural disaster relief arrangements the Australian government will reimburse the South Australian government 50 per cent of expenditure on eligible personal hardship and distress, including emergency payments to individuals for food, clothing and accommodation; essential repairs to housing and repairs or replacement of essential items of furniture and personal effects; and psychological counselling. If the expenditure exceeds certain thresholds the Australian government will reimburse the state up to 75 per cent of the cost of eligible measures considered appropriate by the South Australian government, such as the restoration and replacement of essential public infrastructure, loans and/or interest subsidies grants provided to farmers, and other acts of relief and restoration. Senator, you would be aware that these are arrangements in place under the natural disaster relief arrangements that apply to all natural disaster reliefs and which have been in place for some time.
There was assistance from the ADF, and I have mentioned that previously. In addition to that, the Attorney-General has approved a request for Emergency Management Australia to coordinate the provision of Australian government resources to aid the Eyre Peninsula disaster recovery clean-up. The tax commissioner has been helpful as well. He has given help in the form of a comprehensive assistance package to help those taxpayers affected by the bushfires meet their tax obligations, including more time to meet income tax and activity statement lodgment obligations, additional time to pay debts without extra interest charges and expediting refunds to affected taxpayers. The tax office has given out copies of tax office documents where the original documents have been destroyed in the fire, given people copies of their own documents and made field visits to reconcile lost records.
As I mentioned earlier, the Howard government has done quite a lot to try and help in these tragic circumstances. I know that various departments, including my own, are looking at ways that we could assist—in our instance, perhaps through the Natural Heritage Trust and other programs that the government runs. We certainly want to work with South Australia to this end, and I think the South Australian government well appreciates the work that the Commonwealth has done.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>South Australia: Bushfires</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,9,1
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2005-02-09,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked today.
I particularly would like to go to the answer provided by Senator Ian Macdonald and the supplementary answer provided just a few minutes ago. On 11 January South Australians, particularly those on the Eyre Peninsula, experienced the state’s worst natural disaster since Ash Wednesday some 20 years ago. You would have thought that, in the interim, governments at all levels would have been engaged in their plight in an endeavour to better facilitate their responses to them. We have seen a bipartisan response from the state government and from local members at a state level.
What we saw today and yesterday from the federal government was a minister with responsibility in the area but with no real knowledge of the plight of those people who have been affected and no real knowledge of what is needed at the federal government level. We had rhetoric, but we have not had federal ministerial involvement in this particular natural disaster, one of the biggest in the state’s history. He showed no idea of the issue in question time today, and in the supplementary answer all he has done is confirmed the ridiculous nature of the federal government’s response. If you are an individual resident and you get a grant then you are not taxed. If you are a business you are taxed. If you are a business and you get the grant from a charity then you are not taxed. If you are a business and you get the grant from government then you are taxed.
Saying that you can claim a tax deduction for what you purchase gives no joy to the people involved. Their needs are immediate and their expenditure is immediate. A lot of the expenditure that they will incur will be for plant and equipment which, for tax deductibility, works on a depreciation schedule. Many of the tax deductible items will not materialise in the hands of the farmers for quite some time. This is the ridiculous situation that I raised in question time. This is a situation that the government has not been on top of and farmers on the Eyre Peninsula on west coast of South Australia are concerned about it.
In this particular instance, high-level engagement was needed. There was engagement by the South Australian state government. They sent ministers and staff over there. They have worked with the community and put programs in place. But, up until a few minutes ago, the request for assistance with the reconstruction contained in a letter which was sent from Premier Rann to the Prime Minister on 11 January had not been responded to. Almost four weeks later we still have not seen a written response from the Prime Minister. That request to assist with the reconstruction has fallen on deaf ears. Six million dollars was incurred by the South Australian government. We were told today that, up until now, Centrelink has expended $285,000. That, together with the cost of the defence minister’s visit of one hour or so to the peninsula, is about the only cost incurred by the federal government in this matter.
A much faster reaction was needed from the Prime Minister and ministers. That did not happen. On top of that $6 million fiasco, there was a request for the Army Reserve. The Army Reserve are there now doing a good job. But, Minister Hill, they got there on the Sunday evening and they were not able to engage until the Wednesday morning, because there was a demand for a $100 million indemnity guarantee on the state government. It took two days—two vital days in reconstruction—to sort that out. We should have a system in place, not just for this instance but also for the future, where those sorts of impediments and red tape do not hamper reconstruction efforts.
As well as that, yesterday and today the minister claimed that federal government assistance knows no bounds. Their demand for money knows no bounds. They sent over the Army Reserve to do a good job and then Senator Hill went over there with a bill for $60,000 a week. Opposition leader Beazley raised the matter a week or so ago. It has been raised by the state government of South Australia. You would have thought that by now they would have desisted from that demand. That has not happened either.
As I said earlier, compensation will be taxed. These are four areas and four critical decision-making opportunities for the federal government. In each particular one, what we see is a pattern of disinterest and neglect, and no engagement by federal government ministers. The bureaucrats are doing a great job on their own. They have to work within the programs’ limits and processes. But what is needed here is engagement by the federal government. We have not seen it. The federal government, unfortunately for Labor, represents most of South Australia, but it is taking the state for granted. This federal government is taking South Australian residents, particularly those on the west coast of South Australia, for granted. Across the country people are engaging, assisting and contributing. People are going out of their way to help the people over there. But this federal government, which has the power, responsibilities and resources, has dropped the ball. (Time expired)

"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,2005-02-09,"—The issues raised by Senator Bolkus in this debate and during question time are quite erroneous and false. He has raised the issue of grants to victims of the bushfires on Eyre Peninsula in my home state of South Australia being taxable. The fact is that grants provided to resident individuals and families are not taxable. In terms of grants to businesses, while they are treated as assessable income, obviously the associated expenses are deductible. What Senator Bolkus is suggesting is that these people, who are obviously in some need and warrant assistance—and it is assistance with which the Commonwealth government has been forthcoming because of the parlous situation in which they have found themselves as a consequence of their suffering from the bushfires—should be given a double benefit from the government. Fair is fair. They are being given support through these grants.
Those grants in effect will not be taxed because they will be used to purchase goods and equipment that will be tax deductible in due course. Therefore, no tax will be payable on the grants because of the application of the funds and the way in which they have been used. To ensure tax fairness, grants remain assessable income as far as taxation is concerned. In due course, because of the purpose for which the grants are used, they will receive a tax deduction. That is a longstanding feature of tax law. It is not simply something that this government has dreamt up and is applying. It has been a feature of tax law under all governments. Grants to businesses affected by the 2003 Canberra fires and the Victorian bushfires were not treated any differently in this regard. As I said, this longstanding feature is to ensure fairness in our tax laws, and fairness and equity in tax treatment.
The relief package which the Commonwealth government has provided to people on Eyre Peninsula is substantial. Of course, that reflects the devastating nature and effects of these ravaging bushfires. This relief package specifically and effectively targets and assists those who are affected. Among the assistance and benefits provided is a crisis payment from the Department of Family and Community Services. This, of course, gives the lie to what Senator Bolkus said, which was that the Commonwealth has no concern for the victims of these bushfires. Centrelink granted 48 claims totalling some $15,000 before the ex gratia assistance was announced by Minister Hockey on 14 January 2005. As soon as the impact of the bushfires on people was evident, those crisis payments were made available through Centrelink. They have now been subsumed by the subsequent announcement of the ex gratia assistance on 14 January. As at 7 February, at the beginning of this week, Centrelink had received some 355 claims, and 262 of those had already been processed. A total of approximately $285,000 in ex gratia assistance had already been paid as at the beginning of this week.
Payments of $1,000 per eligible adult and $400 per eligible child have been made available to those whose principal place of residence has been destroyed or is uninhabitable and to those who have lost an immediate family member as a result of the fires. Also, very importantly, Centrelink has provided staff to assist on the ground, including customer service staff, an additional psychologist and social work resources to assist those devastated by these bushfires.
Then there has been assistance provided by the federal government, the Howard government, to the South Australian state government to assist in dealing with this disaster. Under the natural disaster relief arrangements, the Australian government will reimburse the state government 50 per cent of expenditure on eligible personal hardship and distress, including emergency payments for food, clothing, accommodation, repairs to housing, the repair or replacement of essential items of furniture and personal effects, and psychological counselling. If the expenditure exceeds certain thresholds, the federal government will reimburse up to 75 per cent of the cost of these eligible payments.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2005-02-09,"—I too rise to take note of answers to questions today, particularly a question from Senator Lees to Senator Ian Campbell about the National Competition Council’s recommendation that New South Wales competition payments in relation to its water commitments be cut by $26 million. It is of great concern to me, being a New South Wales senator, that there continues to be so much argy-bargy about the National Water Initiative and the commitments that the Commonwealth made to the states prior to the election being announced and then the sleight of hand that took place during the election campaign, which caused the New South Wales Premier and territory leaders to withdraw from the national water agreement.
That concern was expressed very extensively during the debate on the National Water Commission Bill, which took place in December last year. At that time the minister told this place that he was very confident that the premiers would re-sign, rejoin, the National Water Initiative, that that would happen very quickly and that efforts were in place to ensure that the concerns of the states were being accommodated. That obviously is not the case. We will all now see the National Water Initiative, once more, becoming a political football instead of the national policy priority that it really should be.
The second question that I wanted to take note of was the question to Senator Hill about our current economic situation and the current account deficit, which could be as large as seven per cent of GDP this year, after it rose to $7.4 billion for the three months to December, which is 12 per cent bigger than any previous record. The fact is that economists all over Australia have been warning that this is the case and that we have to do something about our external accounts. We know that Australia’s accumulating foreign debt is at an absolutely unsustainable rate. We are missing out on what has been an extraordinary period of economic growth but which cannot be sustained in the future unless we give some financial security to Australians.
At the same time, we have a Senate Economic References Committee inquiry into the possible links between household debt, demand for imported goods and Australia’s current account deficit. Several significant submissions to that inquiry have raised the concern that is now, very clearly, being raised by the Reserve Bank of Australia and the OECD—that is, as a nation we are no longer paying our way and we cannot continue to keep spending more than we are earning. Foreign debt has doubled under the Howard government, and right now we are one of the poorest performers in the world, with one of the world’s highest foreign debt levels. We are now paying more than $20,000 for every man, woman and child living in Australia. The concern that many economists and the OECD have raised is that this is leading to real concerns about our skills shortages and how we are going to manage that. We have economists saying that this situation is now going to create difficulties for Australia attracting foreign investors. We have many concerns about our levels of infrastructure and skills constraints and the fact that the debt that we have in Australia is personal debt as opposed to government debt, which we know is unsustainable in the longer term.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Answers to Questions</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS,10,1
"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2005-02-09,"—I rise to take note particularly of Senator Hill’s outstanding answers today in relation to the economy and some of Senator Stephens’s comments. Why is it that the Labor Party never like to talk about net government debt? They only ever want to talk about foreign debt; they only want to talk about current account deficits. It is really quite odd, because there is a direct relationship between government debt and foreign debt. One almost gets the feeling that Labor have a little something to hide, something that they are uncomfortable talking about. It is very instructive to look at the relationship between foreign debt and net government debt to see why Labor are so shy.
Let us remember that when the coalition came into office net government debt was $96 billion. We have reduced net government debt from $96 billion to $25 billion. It is a reduction from about $5,200 per person in Australia to about $1,200 per person. As a government, despite what Senator Stephens said, we are clearly living within our means. We do not need to borrow to fund our families package. We do not need to borrow to fund defence. We do not need to borrow to fund our health policies. We do not need to borrow to fund education. We do not need to borrow to fund infrastructure. As a government, we have not borrowed one dollar in net terms since we ascended to office.
We have among the lowest levels of general government net debt in the developed world. Our net debt to GDP ratio is among the lowest in the OECD. We are lower than Germany, lower than the total OECD, lower than the EU, lower than Japan, lower than the US. We as a government are determined to maintain those low levels of net government debt. Why is this important? What does this have to do with the current account deficit and foreign debt? The answer is pretty simple: the more government borrows, the less money is available to borrow in Australia. That means that people have to go overseas to borrow to invest in Australia. So there is a clear relationship. We know that Labor cannot be trusted with the budget. We have seen that before. I have with me what I think is my all-time favourite press clipping, from 1 February 1996. It is usually tucked away in my coat pocket. It is one of our favourites on this side of the chamber. It quotes Mr Beazley, the then Minister for Finance:
We’re in a position where we’ve got no plans to increase taxes ... Why would we? We’re operating in surplus, and our projections are for surpluses in the future.
We all know the reality: it was a $10 billion deficit. It is breathtaking that Mr Beazley and his team opposite seek to take the government to task on interest rates and foreign debt. Under the previous Labor government, of which Mr Beazley was an integral part, the debt servicing ratio rose as high as 20 per cent. We heard from Senators Hill and Minchin that that is now down to about nine per cent. It is instructive to look back at what senior figures opposite said in times past. Listen to this quote from 1995:
The best way of understanding the size of the foreign debt is to compare it to the size of the economy. Since September 1993, the size of foreign debt relative to the size of the economy has decreased. In other words, the economy has increased faster than the debt ... Debt is not a bad thing as long as you can support the debt, as long as you can repay it, so long as the borrowings are going into the economy and producing productive investment, producing jobs. Look at our record on ... growth.
That was from Senator Sherry in 1995. So in 1995 Senator Sherry was saying: ‘Foreign debt is okay as long as it’s serving a purpose. As long as it’s helping the economy, it’s not a problem.’ But he was not alone. There was another very substantial figure of Australian politics who had something equally interesting to say in 1995:
We have always been a country that has been heavily dependent on foreign capital. We are now even more attractive to that capital because we are a well managed economy. Foreign capital does not chase badly managed economies. Get that fairly clear in your head. Foreign capitalists or money lenders do not wander around the place looking for poorly managed places upon which to dump money. That is not their way. They lend money to people who look as though they will be capable of sustaining it. They look at countries like ours and the way that they are managed. They come to the conclusion that we would be capable.
That was from Kim Beazley in 1995. (Time expired)

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2005-02-09,"—In this chamber during question time the government have for the last eight or nine years been fond of trying to rewrite the economic record. They tried to do it again today. They think that endless repetition of the same group of arguments, irrespective of how poorly founded those arguments are, somehow makes those points true. Of course, it does not. It just means that people are mindlessly repeating the same old mistruths again and again. What would help debate not only here but in Australia generally about the economy would be a bit more of an impartial analysis of the Australian economy and a bit more recognition of the achievements that are quite monumental that have been rendered by the previous government—not to distort them but put them into a proper context.
The truth is that the strength of the Australian economy today is underpinned by the massive restructuring reforms made to the Australian economy during the Hawke-Keating years. Economists outside this building would tell you that. Economists from the Treasury testifying before Senate committees have said that. The Prime Minister said that in 1996 when he was representing the strength of the Australian economy to a group of visiting businessmen. It is without argument.
The Hawke-Keating government floated the currency. The Hawke-Keating government liberalised banking in Australia. The Hawke-Keating government fundamentally restructured the Australian economy by introducing competition reform. It began the process of decentralising the wage-fixing system as well. It introduced sweeping micro-economic reform and, most of all, it gradually wound back the level of tariff protection in this country, slowly exposing the Australian economy to international competition so that domestic producers in this country could become more efficient internationally and we could succeed in the international global market. It did those things.
Those things meant that when the currency crisis in 1997 came along—about 16 months after the change of government—the Australian economy was in a sound position to withstand the ravages to the economies in our immediate region. Yet, to listen to the government, none of those things occurred and it was all done by miracles by them simply assuming office. The economic cycle does not conform to the political cycle. The economic cycle is a lot slower and changes at a much slower rate. But the economic cycle and the changes and reforms created by the previous Labor government are the foundations of the modern economy, and this government has surfed along on the back of those reforms, claiming credit for them wrongfully. As I said, outside this building any economist will testify to that. Any economist will freely acknowledge the depth of those reforms.
Today we got into a bit of a joust about trade performance. Let me go to a comparative—compare and contrast—view of respective performances of the two governments. Under Labor, Australia’s exports grew at an annual average rate of 8.1 per cent. Under this government, Australia’s exports have grown by only 3.6 per cent. Under Labor, manufactured exports averaged annual growth of 11.5 per cent for the five years to 1996. Under the Howard government, manufactured exports averaged annual growth of only 3.2 per cent for the five years to 2003.
Under Labor, services exports averaged annual growth of 11.7 per cent for the five years to 1996. Under the Howard government, services exports averaged growth of only 4.8 per cent for the five years to 2003. Under Labor, Australia’s share of global trade peaked at 1.22 per cent in 1989. Under this government, it is down to 0.98 per cent in 2003. Under Labor, net exports consistently made a positive contribution to economic growth, and under this government net exports have made a negative contribution to economic growth for the past three years.
To succeed in international trade you have to be competitive. The truth is that this country has become less competitive under the Howard government than it was under the Hawke-Keating government, and the lack of competitiveness does not go to the alleged reforming of the industrial relations system. It goes to the drying up of funds and incentives for research and development that enable our industry to become competitive at the cutting edge, where global demand is for the products this country, a smart and clever country, can produce. If you deny and shrink the funds for research and development, you ultimately shrink your competitiveness and your exports. That is the tale of this government. (Time expired)

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-02-09,"—Today in question time we had more questions of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Vanstone, about what has become known as the Cornelia Rau case. There were a few answers from the minister, and a lot of other words came out of her mouth aimed at filling in the time while she avoided answering some of those questions. But one of the key aspects that has to continue to be challenged through questions of the minister, both in this place and in the public arena, is: will there be a genuine opportunity for the truth to come out?
It is not surprising that people are very cynical and very unsatisfied with the secret inquiry that has been announced to date. It is an old adage—and the reason that the adage is so old and has survived so long is because it is so valid—that justice must not only be done; it must be seen to be done. It is a bit hard for justice to be seen to be done if it is being done in a back room behind closed doors, so it is no wonder that people have little faith in the ability of this inquiry to get to the bottom, in a complete way, of everything that has happened.
This is not for the sake of pointing the finger of blame. I think we can point the finger of blame at the entire nation in many ways for our lack of proper understanding about mental illness and for some of the ways that people respond to mental illness when they are confronted with its reality. That is a failing of our whole society. So we do not need to get to the bottom of it all for the purposes of finger pointing or political point scoring. Indeed, if the focus is political point scoring, it will almost inevitably mean that the real questions are not answered and the real opportunities to get some positive gains from this terrible incident will be lost.
But that is not an excuse for having everything done in secret. In fact, it is an extra reason not to have it done in secret, because as soon as things are covered up it provides more opportunities for people to focus on the political aspects. Because nobody knows what the truth really is, you cannot draw the debate down and narrow it down to the truth, the facts, the substance and what needs to be done as a consequence. It is all covered up, so people will just rely on other reports and other statements, and the debate will not be as focused as it needs to be.
So it was good to see the response from the minister today that she has tried to chase up and ensure that video footage from the closed-circuit televisions that are in every single one of the management unit cells in the Baxter facility and other video footage is available. I hope that that video footage does exist—it will be a real problem if it does not—and that it is provided unedited and complete to the inquiry. It still has to be ascertained that that will happen.
The other aspect of Senator Allison’s question, which followed on from mine yesterday, is will the asylum seekers in Baxter who witnessed the way Ms Rau was allegedly treated be able to give evidence. That is a pretty straightforward question. The minister said yesterday, as she keeps saying, that she will do everything possible to get to the bottom of this. When I asked her yesterday, ‘Will the asylum seekers give evidence?’ she said: ‘I will have to give consideration to that. I will take that on notice and get back to you,’ and then repeated her determination to get to the bottom of it.
If the minister and the government are so determined to get to the bottom of it, why do they even need to think about whether or not the only people who have witnessed Ms Rau’s treatment in Baxter will be able to give evidence? They are the only eyewitnesses to her treatment, at least in Baxter, that are available. How could it even need a minute’s thought? Yet, when she was asked again today, she dodged the question and did not answer it again, a day later. She said: ‘The only eyewitnesses? Well, I’ll think about whether they can give evidence and we’ll see if there is any video footage as well.’ It will all be in secret, even if there is any evidence. It is a very, very dubious idea that the truth will be complete and will be outed in this area. No wonder people are very sceptical about whether justice will be done. It sure as hell is not going to be seen to be done. We do not even know if the evidence of the only eyewitnesses to it is going to be able to be fed into the process. It is a key question and it is one the Democrats will continue to push. (Time expired)

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2005-02-09,"—Today in the Senate, on behalf of the Labor opposition, I have proposed that the Senate discuss the serious issues of Australia’s current account deficit and foreign debt, which have reached record levels, and the need to develop proactive policies to reverse this increase in external deficit and debt and the associated problem of foreign debt putting upward pressure on Australian interest rates. The current account deficit over the almost nine years of the current Liberal government has almost doubled to $50 billion. The net foreign debt has doubled to some $406 billion. These are very serious figures. The rise in foreign debt levels swamps the reduction in government debt, which has been in large part funded by selling public assets.
The Liberal government, as we saw in question time today, loves to answer anything but the questions that are presented to it. There were three questions about the current account deficit and the level of net foreign debt. The government loves to talk about interest rates and government debt but refuses to answer the questions that were put to it today and on other occasions. We had an example in a response from Senator Hill, who wanted to go back through history—that is natural enough—and refer to the time that the current opposition leader, Kim Beazley, was finance minister in 1995-96, when there was a budget debt—not that Senator Hill was asked about budget debt—of almost $10 billion. I reminded him, via interjection, that we can go back through history to the current Prime Minister’s last year as Treasurer of this country, in 1983, when he left a $22 billion budget deficit and he covered it up. He did not own up until after the election. If people want to talk about Mr Beazley’s history, we will remind this country about the record of the cover-up of the current Prime Minister when he was last Treasurer in respect of budget deficits.
Going back to the current account deficit and net foreign debt: this government loves to talk about its successes but ignores and in fact has been complacent about some areas of our economic record that are very serious indeed. It has failed to introduce any policies to halt and reverse the spiralling external debt, the deficits and the associated national debt. I thought one of the most extraordinary claims today from Senator Hill was about the need for industrial relations reform in the context of a current account deficit. It was an absolute joke. I could not believe that the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill, would actually claim that you can reduce imports by industrial relations reform in Australia. What is the linkage? There is none, unless your industrial relations reforms are all about reducing wages in Australia. That would reduce imports. That is the only obvious linkage, if in fact there is one. I found it quite extraordinary that Senator Hill could wander into that little minefield.

Senator McGauran interjecting—

—This government has developed a bad habit of blaming everyone and everything but itself. It is a government that loves to take the credit but will not fess up and accept any of the blame when there is something wrong. So we have had this long litany of excuses in respect of national debt and the current account deficit. We have had drought, we have had SARS and we have had port bottlenecks—that is the latest one. Senator McGauran interjected about that earlier. Who gave control of the ports to Mr Corrigan in this country? We have a duopoly operating, thanks to this federal government.
—They fixed the waterfront.
—They said they fixed the waterfront; they certainly have. We have a duopoly operating, thanks to Senator McGauran and this Liberal-National Party government. What responsibility do you bear for that? You certainly fixed the waterfront. We have a stronger dollar—that is another excuse and, as I mentioned earlier, industrial relations is the latest excuse. They have carried out some industrial relations reforms, but apparently they did not work in respect of the current account deficit and national debt.
This government has enjoyed the benefits of the former Labor government’s improvements in productivity—policies we implemented in the 1980s. I remember the current Prime Minister saying in 1996 that his government had inherited a fundamentally strong and sound economy. But this government has neglected policy in a range of areas—and I know my colleague Senator Lundy will go into this in greater detail—for example, investment in infrastructure. It has been so concerned about flogging off infrastructure and privatising, it has failed to invest in infrastructure. We have got emerging skill shortages. And we had a very good question about trade negotiations from my colleague Senator Cook, the former trade minister.
The government has relied on a bilateral FTA, when its own research shows that that is going to cause the deficit to rise not fall. It has failed to remove the disincentives for people to rejoin the work force. It is strangling—in fact, choking—small business with more red tape and legislation. That is an issue I will talk about on another occasion in respect of so-called superannuation choice. The government will be hearing a lot more about the extra red tape in that area. That is just one example. Now the government is talking about making industrial relations more hardline and inflexible and reducing wages and conditions. That is what it wants to do.
The proposal that Labor has put before the Senate for discussion draws attention to the issue of an increasing foreign debt putting upward pressure on interest rates. I suspect that those opposite who contribute in this debate are going to try and refute that.

Senator Fifield interjecting—

—I notice a nod, in fact, from Senator Fifield. I want to go to an authority on this matter: none other than Senator Fifield’s former employer, the current Treasurer, Mr Costello. It was Mr Costello himself, some nine years ago, when he was shadow Treasurer, who claimed that foreign debt—when foreign debt was at half its current level—posed a serious threat to mortgage interest rates. Earlier today I actually read the speech in which Mr Costello made these claims. He cited numerous experts in support of his argument that an increase in foreign debt would put upward pressure on mortgage interest rates. In his speech of some nine years ago, Mr Costello quoted Mr Tom Valentine, who was Dean of Commerce at the University of Western Australia:
Of course the debt has an impact …
That is a reference to the national debt. Mr Valentine went on:
This causes higher mortgage rates.
I’m amazed there is even debate about this issue.
There was a quote from Chris Caton:
It’s quite clear that the current-account deficit at 6 per cent of GDP [gross domestic product] has an impact on long-term rates …
It is now well over six per cent; in fact, I think we now have the highest current account deficit amongst advanced economies in the Western world. The now Treasurer, Mr Costello, quoted Professor McKibbin:
Any country that has a large debt tends to pay a premium over the risk-free range.
You pay an additional premium in terms of interest rates for borrowing moneys from overseas, and Australia does have to borrow substantially from overseas in order to finance its current account debt. Why does it have to do that? Because savings have collapsed in this country. I am not talking about government savings, about which the government sounds like a cracked record: repeat and repeat; I am talking about household savings. Household savings in this country have collapsed under this government and, as a consequence, we need to import foreign capital. Because of our increased exposure on the current account deficit, we obviously have to pay more via interest rates. We have to pay a premium to attract capital into this country because we are competing against many other countries in order to attract that capital. There has been a very poor household savings record under this government. That is another issue it does not want to talk about at all. The level of household savings is collapsing in this country.
We become more and more reliant on foreign savings to finance our external debt and this is putting upward pressure on interest rates. We do know at the moment that mortgage interest payments—the actual money that individuals are paying—are at historically high levels. Yet this Liberal government has continued on with its complacency. It has the gall to attempt to criticise the former Labor government over its responsibilities—and we are talking about almost nine years ago now. This government should be able to justify its own performance—and it cannot in respect of savings and the current account deficit—when it is now approaching nine years in government. I think that this complacent approach by the Treasurer and by the Liberal-National government in general clearly shows a creeping arrogance in its approach and an emerging complacency. It demonstrates that the Treasurer himself and the other members of this government are out of touch with pressures on Australian families.
Not only did I read the speech made some nine years ago by the now Treasurer in which he argued that the current account deficit put upward pressure on interest rates; I also tuned into the telly the other night when he was trying to make the spurious link between industrial relations reform and interest rates. At that press conference on Monday night he claimed that the current standard variable mortgage rate is 6.25 per cent. It is actually 7.05 per cent. I do not think he was deliberately misleading, but it did surprise me that the Treasurer actually did not know this. The Treasurer of this country did not know the variable mortgage rate was not 6.25 per cent and that it is actually 7.05 per cent. It was a pretty serious error. I have got to give the press a touch along—and I do not often do this: they did not highlight the Treasurer’s error. They did highlight the ridiculous argument that industrial relations reform is somehow linked to interest rates, when it is not. This mistake by the Treasurer when referring to the standard variable mortgage rate—
—Wage rises are not linked to productivity.
—That is not right, Senator McGauran.
—Ask George Campbell about it.
—Senator McGauran claims that wage rises are not linked to productivity. That is not right. Substantially they are; it depends on which part of the industrial relations system you are in. For many workers, wage increases in this country are linked to productivity. Senator McGauran is apparently suggesting that we should remove safety net wage increases. They are not totally linked to productivity. What Senator McGauran is suggesting is the Americanisation of the industrial relations system: no movement in minimum wage rates of pay in this country. That is what he is suggesting. We know what is on your agenda. That is inevitably what you would do to lower paid wage earners. You would reduce their wages in real terms over time by removing that safety net provision, and that would reduce imports. Clearly, if your real wages are reduced, you cannot purchase as much, because consumption has declined, and you obviously would not be purchasing imported goods. This government has been complacent. It has been arrogant. It has wasted opportunities. It has ignored fundamental policy reform in a number of areas other than those that suit its own ideological prejudice and propaganda.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Economy: Debt Management</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,29,1
"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2005-02-09,"—What is so telling here is not what Senator Sherry has said but what he has not said. Why is it that every time Labor come in to talk about the economy they do not want to talk about net government debt? They want to talk about foreign debt and the current account deficit. They want to deny the link between them. It is always the same story. And it is odd, because there is a direct relationship between the two. One almost gets the feeling, as Senator Sherry leaves the chamber, that Labor have something to hide, that they are uncomfortable talking about net government debt. The reason is: they are. It is instructive, I think, to look at the relationship between net foreign debt and net government debt to see why Labor are so shy.
When the coalition came to government, we inherited a net government debt of $96 billion. It is a figure the Labor Party have never liked to hear and do not want to hear today. We have reduced net debt from $96 billion, 19 per cent of GDP, to $25 billion, three per cent of GDP. That is a reduction from $5,200 to around $1,200 per person. As a government we are living within our means. We can afford to do the things that we want to do for the Australian people without borrowing. Since we have been in office we have not borrowed one dollar in net terms.
We enjoy the lowest level of general government net debt in the developed world—lower than Germany, lower than the total OECD, lower than the EU, lower than Japan, lower than the US—and the government is committed to maintaining those low levels of net government debt. We have a much lower level of net government debt than most other developed countries. Our net debt to GDP ratio is amongst the lowest in the OECD. While net debt in most OECD countries is rising as a percentage of GDP, in Australia it is steadily falling.
Why is this important? Why am I talking about net government debt? Because it does have an effect on foreign debt and the current account deficit, for one very simple reason: the more governments borrow domestically, the less money there is to borrow to invest in Australia, meaning that people have to borrow overseas. If Labor were in office, there would be a much higher level of net government debt, which would have an effect on foreign debt. It is clear. We know Labor cannot be trusted with budgets, because we have seen it before. Earlier in this chamber, I was fortunate again to be on my feet on this issue. I referred to my all-time favourite article quoting Kim Beazley, in the Age of 1 February 1996. He said:
“We’re in a position where we’ve got no plans to increase taxes … Why would we? We’re operating in surplus, and our projections are for surpluses in the future.
The reality was a $10 billion debt, so it is absolutely breathtaking that Mr Beazley and his team opposite seek to take this government to task on interest rates and foreign debt. This government know that the best way for any government to take pressure off interest rates is to reduce government debt, which is what we have done. Let us never forget that Kim Beazley left us not only a $10 billion budget deficit but also an annual interest bill of $8 billion when we came into office. That is why senators opposite never want to talk about the other side of the economic equation.
Since 1996 the share of net foreign debt owned by the general government sector has fallen from 17 per cent to under five per cent, and the debt servicing ratio has fallen to around nine per cent. In 1990 under the previous Labor government—the team of which Mr Beazley was an integral part—20 per cent of exports went towards paying the interest on net foreign debt. Australians indicated at the last election that they know who is better at managing the Australian economy.
Those opposite, as always, are talking the economy down, but we have an enviable economy. We have strong growth, high employment, low unemployment, low inflation and low net government debt. There are indeed some economic challenges in this environment, associated with capacity constraints. There is one very simple solution to capacity constraints, skill shortages and inflationary pressure; we could always follow the Labor approach and kill the economy, as they did in the 1980s. A simple Labor solution to a skill shortage is to pursue policies that drive unemployment higher. An easy way to solve a skill shortage is to kill the economy—no skill shortage then. A simple Labor solution to capacity constraints is to pursue policies that squash demand and dampen business investment.
The government could pursue recessionary policies. Only today, Don Russell, former chief of staff to Paul Keating, has an article in the Age with the headline ‘Why we had to have that recession’. He tells us:
Far from enjoying the prosperity of the past decade, we would have spent the 1990s dealing with high inflation and high interest rates. In 1989, time was ticking and interest rates were the only way to avoid the otherwise inevitable disaster.
Too bad for those people who lost their jobs; it was just inevitable! He is not backing away at all from those policies of the 1980s. The truth is Labor only ever have one policy to lower inflation, to lower interest rates and to solve skill shortages, and that is to kill the economy. It is what they know, it is what they do well and it is what they do best. But we are determined to continue to pursue policies that will ensure that we have a strong economy and that will also keep inflationary pressures in check.
There are some practical things that we can do to improve Australia’s export performance. Addressing infrastructure constraints in our ports is one, as the Treasurer has noted. There is strong demand overseas for our commodity exports which is not being met by Australian companies because of bottlenecks in our ports, particularly in northern New South Wales and Queensland. So there are things that we can do there, and the Treasurer will be seeking the assistance of the relevant state authorities. Senator Sherry could certainly help by talking to his state Labor counterparts.
Senator Sherry has proposed that the federal government acknowledge that rising foreign debt puts upward pressure on interest rates. He also suggested that the government needs to adopt what he calls a proactive approach to policy. On matters of monetary policy and foreign debt, I am inclined to defer to the judgment of the Reserve Bank rather than Senator Sherry. The Reserve Bank say that the current account deficit is not and should not be an objective for monetary policy.
The Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank, Glenn Stevens, on 14 December 2004 gave an address in Sydney in which he raised the issue of the impact of foreign debt and the current account deficit on interest rates. He said, ‘The current account deficit is clearly not something to be addressed by monetary policy.’ He even went so far as to say:
Actually, whether the current account position should be an objective of any policy is not obvious—that would need to be argued. But whatever one’s view on that question, let me be clear that the current account is not, and should not be, an objective for monetary policy.

Mr Stevens did not stop there. He said:
We have had that debate in Australia. It was settled more than a decade ago, and I do not wish to re-open it.
If Senator Sherry were here, I am sure he would say, ‘But I have never said that.’ But in October 1990, Senator Sherry said:
The overriding objective of macroeconomic policy is to reduce the current account deficit to a level which stabilises Australia’s net foreign debt. In pursuing this objective the government has employed a comprehensive range of policies aimed at slowing demand growth to sustainable levels.
I actually think that the overriding objective of macroeconomic policy is to create a strong economy that provides jobs for Australians. So it is an interesting idea of what the purpose of a strong macroeconomic policy is. Senator Sherry might like to take on the Reserve Bank in reopening this debate—good luck to him if he does.
Earlier in the Senate, I referred to Mr Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition, who said, ‘We have always been a country that has been heavily dependent on foreign capital. Get clearly in your head: foreign capital does not chase badly managed economies.’ Kim Beazley said that in 1995. Fine, if you reject what Kim Beazley says, that is okay. Senator Sherry said, ‘Debt is not a bad thing as long as you can support the debt.’ If you want to discount Senator Sherry then that is fine.
So where does that leave us? It actually leaves us with an economy that is strong and with low unemployment. There are economic challenges but all Labor are doing here is running an old-fashioned interest rate scare campaign. I would have thought that from the last election you would have realised that the Australian people do not respond to your scare campaign on interest rates. They respond to facts and they rejected you.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Economy: Debt Management</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,29,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-02-09,"—Senator Sherry’s matter of public importance concerns Australia’s high current account deficit and the prospect of high interest rates. It may not be true, because we have no way of knowing what private discussions Treasury have with the Treasurer and other ministers, including the Prime Minster, but I do get the impression that the current account deficit has only just drifted onto their list of issues to be worried about.
It is always bad management to take action only once something is a full-blown problem, when the warning signals have long been known. One thing all economists and financiers understand is that in the long run a high current account deficit is not sustainable. There will be a nasty correction if it is not addressed. Of course, long run can mean the very long run; hence those who say, ‘Live for the day.’
The international dimension will always impact on Australia’s economic prospects and the decisions Australia takes. The largest cloud on the horizon is represented by the United States of America. A radical American fiscal policy under the Bush administration has turned a sound financial position inherited from President Clinton into one that has elevated world concerns at their high current account deficit and the capital flows consequent to that.
The government cannot deny the first part of Senator Sherry’s MPI, which notes that the current account deficit and foreign debt are at record levels. Net foreign debt, mostly private debt, is now at $406 billion, or 49.2 per cent of GDP. It averaged only 34 per cent of GDP during the Hawke-Keating government and seven per cent during the much maligned Fraser government. The current account deficit is now running at $15 billion per quarter, or six per cent of GDP. The Reserve Bank on Tuesday noted that the current account deficit is likely to hit 6¾ per cent of GDP in the December quarter—a steep rise.
To put this in context, the current account deficit averaged only 1.4 per cent of GDP during the also much maligned Whitlam government and 4.6 per cent during the Hawke-Keating era. The very reputable John Edwards at HSBC said in their weekly bulletin in September 2004:
It has attracted very little attention but over the last four years Australia has experienced its biggest investment boom in well over forty years.
                  …         …         …
Since the end of 2000 the volume of investment has increased 41%.
Australia often has upswings in residential construction, or in mining investment or in infrastructure or in general business investment. The reason for the big boom is that for most of the last four years there has been an upswing in all these categories.
                  …         …           …
The arithmetic of national accounts tells us that domestic investment minus domestic saving will be equal to the current account deficit. It is more often than not the case in Australia that an investment boom coincides with a sharply wider current account deficit.
Later on, he went on to say:
We continue to be puzzled ... by assertions that Australia’s export performance is failing. It is true that Australian exports fell from 2000 through to the middle of last year because of drought, currency appreciation and the global slowdown. It is true that decline contributed to the widening of the current account deficit.
                  …         …         …
The real weakness over the last year was in oil and gas exports and in metals—precisely the categories which have more recently benefited from China’s import demand.
Mr Edwards is a clever man, and apart from the virtue of recording his opinion, these remarks show there is much argument over where our current account deficit is going and what it really means to Australia.
On Tuesday the Prime Minister said he was ‘not the least bit pessimistic about our capacity through export performance to reduce the imbalance and what is a very large current account deficit over a long period of time’. Given that Mr Howard was elected on economic management, a sceptic might say, as that famous lady once said, ‘Well, he would say that, wouldn’t he?’ Unfortunately, the Reserve Bank is not quite so optimistic. They note:
Growth in Australia’s export volumes has remained weak over the past year or so, despite the growth in global demand and world commodity prices, with total exports virtually unchanged from four years ago.
Any economist will tell you that the numbers themselves do not necessarily reveal the true impact of the current account deficit on interest rates. If the capital inflows allow Australians to invest in new plant and equipment, social and economic infrastructure, and education, research and development, in the long term this will improve Australia’s trade performance. This is the so-called J-curve. It is what the capital inflows are used for that helps to affect interest rates. Unfortunately, this government has reduced relative spending on education and long-term research and development. We are below the OECD in those fields. Surveys show that our nine governments have underinvested in productive infrastructure. Worse, they have allowed essential infrastructure, such as for power, water, rail and ports, to deteriorate.
Much of the capital inflow has funded consumer spending and the property investment boom. Interest rates have already risen precisely because of those reasons. Neither of these items improves our trade performance or productive capacity that much, but they have been encouraged by the government with their tax cuts for high-income earners, negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions and the $66 billion of budget and election pump priming. Those are electorally popular, but we have to recognise that along with the upsides there are downsides. Consequently, the Reserve Bank have warned that we are likely to face higher interest rates to cool rampant consumer spending and reduce inflationary pressures. Note that it is not to cool investment spending but to cool consumer spending.
The Australian Democrats do not want to see higher interest rates or a slowdown in the economy. We recognise that Australia’s trade figures are likely to continue to worsen, at least in the short run, including as a result of last month’s tariff reductions for imported cars, clothing and other goods. The only way to improve our trade predicament is to boost exports and productivity and the Australian government has to make this happen. The alternative, of course, is to reduce imports. That will have the effect of lowering our economic performance. You actually want to lift the exports, not lower imports overmuch, although there is a case for imports being lowered.
The government’s policies of winding back the export market development grants, reducing incentives for research and development and reducing tariffs without equivalent foreign tariff reductions have contributed to Australia’s poor trade performance. The Australian Democrats have been right at the forefront of responsible macroeconomic reform, and we have experienced some criticism for supporting the coalition in some of those areas.
We do have policies that we think would help improve Australia’s trade performance. Amongst them are these. We recommend freezing further tariff reductions unless they are matched by our key trading partners. We would restore full funding to the Export Market Development Grants Scheme. We would like to see a review of business taxes and capital gains tax not only to make them more efficient but to encourage longer term productive investment rather than short-term speculation that results in short-term profit taking. We would restore the tax deductions for business research and development to 150 per cent. We would advocate putting much more money into public education and training to address Australia’s skills shortage. We would improve the low participation rate of women in the Australian work force by promoting more family-friendly policies such as paid maternity leave and low-cost child care. We would encourage the move from welfare to work by raising the tax-free threshold significantly and improving the disposable income of low-income earners. We strongly support much needed infrastructure expenditure. We stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the National Party in our belief that the rail infrastructure in this country badly needs further investment.
The Democrats believe that the Howard government should include improving Australia’s export performance as one of its key priorities for its fourth term. There does need to be a consensus of all our nine governments on what it would take to produce significant structural reform to improve our trade performance. There has been some discussion about IR, but we should never forget that much of the infrastructure is in the hands of the states. It is in their hands that our export destiny lies. The Howard-Costello government may feel they are in a strong position now. History tells you that the strong can be weakened. Having your eyes wide open in the good times may save them becoming bad times.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Economy: Debt Management</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,29,1
"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,2005-02-09,"—If what we have heard so far in this debate on the part of the Labor Party, who brought forward this matter of public importance today, and indeed what we heard earlier today in question time, reflects their electorally-driven, new-found interest in the economy, then they certainly have a long way to go. Over the summer break, we all read about Labor’s introspective navel gazing in the face of their leadership woes and the policy vacuum that contributed to their well-deserved, massive electoral defeat at last October’s election.
Following nine years of policy laziness, some opposite have apparently realised the truth of the old axiom, ‘It’s the economy, stupid’. However, it is going to take more than that realisation and recognition on the part of a few opposite for Labor to establish any credibility whatsoever with regard to economic matters. Trying to create an issue on false premises and harping on about it, as they did earlier today in question time and now in this debate, will certainly not establish any economic credibility whatsoever as far as the Labor Party is concerned. Their economic analysis of this issue is fatally flawed and, as has been the case for the last nine years, they offer no alternative, more beneficial policy to the issues they have been harping about.
The important thing to understand about the issue of the current account deficit is that it is essentially a function of the stage of our economic cycle. The fact is that, almost entirely as a result of the sound economic management that has been in place on the part of the Howard government over the last nine years, we have enjoyed strong domestic growth in our economy at a time when growth in the rest of the world has been much slower. Added to this factor is the situation of the declining value of the American dollar, which has had the reverse effect: the appreciation of the Australian dollar, which is up by 20 per cent over the two years to December last year. Of course, the devastating effects of drought over the past couple of years have had a substantially detrimental impact on the export earnings of Australia, and that continues to have residual effects. In addition to that, we had the issue of SARS and other factors which have affected Australia’s export earnings.
So this is, as I say, a consequence of the stage of our economic cycle combined with other extraneous events such as drought and the state of the American dollar and its impact on the Australian dollar. This was quite clearly spelt out by the International Monetary Fund when it said:
That external current account deficit has widened, mainly reflecting the sharp appreciation of the Australian dollar and the relatively strong cyclical position of the economy.
So, again, factors beyond the control of the current government have affected the level of the current account deficit. But do not just rely on what I am saying about this; let us have a look at what some of the experts in the economic field have said about this issue. This is in marked contrast to the performance of those opposite, who showed during their period in government that they knew absolutely nothing about the economy and sound economic management.
The OECD in its recent report—a report, I might say, that was warmly endorsed by the Labor opposition—said on the causal factors with regard to the current account deficit:
The desynchronisation of the Australian and global economic cycles, effective exchange rate appreciation and the drought-effect on rural exports led to a substantial widening of the current external deficit during the past three years.
That was the OECD reinforcing the points I made a moment or two ago as to the external factors that have contributed to this situation. On whether this is a matter for concern, the OECD says that current account deficits are not a cause for great alarm in countries with floating exchange rates and adds:
Moreover, when assessing the Australian situation, it has to be kept in mind that, with general government finances in surplus for seven years in a row—
again, something in marked contrast to all those years of Labor government deficits—
Australia’s current account reflects private saving and investment decisions. And with structural reform having stripped out many distortions from the economy—
structural reform initiated by the Howard government—the labour market reform, which has not gone far enough because of the opposition of the Labor Party and the minor parties in this chamber to much needed further workplace relations reform—
private sector saving and investment decisions are likely to be efficient, with capital flows reflecting informed decisions about relative investment opportunities.
On the risk of excessive foreign exchange exposure, the OECD says:
When taking on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet exposures together, Australian banks’ foreign currency exposure remains at low levels. Accordingly, the Australian economy as a whole, as well as individual sectors, do not seem to have important foreign exchange exposure.
On our ability to handle the current account position, the OECD says:
.... the banking system, which accounts for about 80 per cent of Australia’s net foreign debt, is in good shape. This is reflected in Australia’s Aaa and AAA foreign currency ratings, respectively, by the Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s rating agencies. The financial positions of firms and households are also sound. The general government’s share in net external debt is only about 5 per cent. Australian Government total net debt is very low, around 3 per cent of GDP in 2003-04, which is one of the lowest levels of general government net debt in the OECD. This places Australia in a comparatively better position than most other countries to respond to future economic shocks.
And why do we have that low level of government debt? Again, because of the sound financial management of the Howard government, running budget surpluses of several billion dollars for the time that we have been in government and paying off that massive inherited government debt from the Labor Party’s time in government—$90 billion to $100 billion of debt now down to $20-odd billion of debt. It has been an astounding performance by this government in reducing government debt.
—That’s really all you’ve got to say, isn’t it?
—As I said, the current account deficit is private sector debt, which is debt that is going into investment—which you would simply not understand, Senator Lundy, and nor would your colleagues in the Labor Party. The management of this government in relation to the economy is sound. Labor’s alternative approach, as we saw in government, would worsen the situation. This government’s position is entirely credible.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Economy: Debt Management</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,29,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2005-02-09,"—Well, well, well, it is amazing to see the crutch of the myth of the so-called Beazley black hole get a good dusting-off in this chamber today. We have heard speaker after speaker hark back 10 years trying to build an argument on something that obviously has very little relevance to the state of the economy today and the issues that Labor is raising right now about the massive current account deficit and the negligence perpetuated by the Howard government.
I want to talk about an area of economic policy that relates to our capacity as a nation to continue growing and relates to our capacity as a nation to innovate and to make the most of the opportunities for economic growth that present themselves to us. That is infrastructure, innovation and industry policy. This neglect has led to a whole raft of chronic symptoms that include a trade deficit that is almost beyond belief.
It is worth going back to cover a bit of history. The 1996 and 1997 budgets saw the coalition government walk away from earnest efforts of the Labor government to encourage industry to innovate and adapt to the new challenges of a global economy, and since then there has been a series of policies that in an ad hoc way have tried to backfill the neglect perpetuated in the late 1990s that saw the coalition squander a crucial period of productivity growth, particularly in well-developed economies that were capitalising on the technological boom and using that technological boom to upgrade their existing industries. In many respects we are left with what could have been. There is no doubt that the Australian economy has experienced growth, but the question goes to what could have been had we not squandered that period of growth and had the coalition not ignored the opportunity that investment in industry, innovation and infrastructure would have meant at that time and since.
Minister after minister in the industry portfolio in the coalition government can be characterised only as visionless, reactionary and weak. There is not any indicator that highlights the neglect of these policy areas more starkly than our consistently poor trade performance. As I said, while the rest of the world invested in the sorts of industries that would see their economies continue to grow strongly well into the 21st century, we have seen—and I can remember debating this in this place in 1997, 1998 and 1999—the disastrous results of this government’s lack of commitment to research and development investment. We have also seen its lack of commitment to developing information and communication technology industries and elaborately transformed manufactures—all of which underpin the upgrading of our existing industries which we continue to rely on. So, at a time when the government should have been making hay while the economic sun shone, Mr Howard, Mr Costello and Mr Anderson seemed to laze around on the veranda, perhaps perfecting their dog whistle, watching the capacity of Australia diminish through uninterested eyes.
The chronic symptom of this lazy neglect is, of course, the largest ever trade deficit—the seventh trade deficit in a row. Australia’s share of world exports is now less than one per cent, which is the lowest level for at least 25 years. In measuring up against the countries with which Australia competes, this country is being beaten soundly. This is not good news for Australia’s economy. So it is quite outrageous for the Howard government to continue to boast about being good economic managers, to mount the pitiful arguments we have heard in the chamber today, and to argue—as Senators Minchin and Hill did in question time—that this is somehow related to Labor’s efforts.
The contribution of manufacturing, for which I have portfolio responsibility, underpins Australia’s export success—not least because it is critical to strengthening our economic base through enhancing the value of our intellectual capital and natural resources. More than any other industry, the broad manufacturing capability can contribute to rapid economic growth. I refer again to my experience in the ICT portfolio, at a time when we knew it was possible to calculate the benefit of growth in that industry to our country’s economic growth. Predictably, the Howard government has been more focused on ensuring that those jobs and opportunities for contracts in Australia went overseas instead of developing our industry here.
In a paper published last year, Peter Brain, the Executive Director of the National Institute of Economic and Industry Research, stated very clearly the core reason why manufacturing is a strategic industry and more important than others; that is because it is the industry which transforms raw knowledge into wealth creation. The paper states:
If an economy allows its manufacturing sector to degrade relative to the rest of the world, it is allowing its technology creation potential to decline, which in turn will eventually lead to a fall in the overall per capita GDP growth rate. Manufacturing is strategic in producing elaborately transformed products which are skill, knowledge and innovation intensive. Relative to other industries, manufacturing purchases a relatively high proportion of goods and services from other industries.
So it has that flow-on effect as well. It is worth putting on record the Howard government’s dismal performance. Under this government we have seen 50,000 jobs lost in manufacturing between the years 2000 and 2004. Another pressure on manufacturing is the fact that the cost of inputs to manufactures has surged by 8.1 per cent—higher than last year and the highest rise in 14 years. We know that the share of total exports of manufactured goods has steadily declined under the present government and, according to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s own figures, the trade deficit in manufactured goods for 2003-04 currently stands at $76 billion. This deficit is at its highest in 2003-04 at nearly $77 billion—nearly double the $41 billion deficit that was recorded in 1996-97 just after Labor left office.
Meanwhile, manufactured imports climbed a staggering $42 billion between 1996-97 and 2003-04. In 2002-03, this meant that, for every $1 worth of manufactured goods produced in this country for local consumption, we imported $2.55 worth of manufactured goods. This alarming stall in export growth in the manufacturing sector does not seem to have even ruffled the feathers of government ministers. They choose to ignore trade and innovation policy to pursue a perennial ideological campaign of attacking unions. Outrageously, we have witnessed today, on several occasions, Howard government ministers huffing and puffing like mad to create a smokescreen of so-called industrial relations reform to try to obscure the export decline caused by their neglect. It is not an industrial relations issue that limits Australia’s trade performance; it is mismanagement and neglect of trade, industry and innovation policy, which is a critical part of economic management of this country. That is where the neglect lies. We heard nothing today refuting that, except this sideways smokescreen effort holding up an ideological campaign. When are they going to try to establish a credential on the issue of trade? It is just not possible to sit in this place and think that this government has any credibility in this area at all.
It is also worth putting on the record that in the 1990s, under the Hawke-Keating Labor government’s integrated trade and competitiveness strategies, we did lift this country’s productivity, open new markets and generate increased export growth. It was the policy agenda that emerged from around 1990 that put exporting at the centre of the new industry policy in Australia. The success of emerging manufacturing exporters in Australian states—and Victoria is a standout—can be attributed to federal Labor strategies implemented at the time and, since then, a renewed focus by the Bracks Labor government and other state Labor governments to support and lift their export potential. This is in spite of the lack of attention and care by the Howard government at the federal level.
Under Labor our exports grew, on average, 8.1 per cent annually. Under the coalition it is a dismal result, and we have seen the trade deficit widen to 3.6 per cent under the coalition government. It was interesting in question time today to see Senator Hill confronted by these facts. The government do not know where to turn. It has been a bad week for the Howard government. Closely following the record trade deficit figures, the Reserve Bank of Australia released their statement on monetary policy, which described the growth in manufactured export volume since 2000 as lacklustre, with growth in exports nearly 25 per cent lower than our global competitors and our performance ‘weak, especially compared with the experience of the 1990s’.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Economy: Debt Management</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,29,1
"McGauran, Sen Julian",NATS,2005-02-09,"—I join my colleagues on this side of the house to debate the matter of public importance we have before us, brought to us by the Labor senator Senator Nick Sherry. I and my colleagues on this side—indeed, all members of the government—welcome the Labor Party putting forward a debate on the economic situation for once. We have been waiting since the last election and even prior to the last election, if not for our whole term in government, for a serious debate on the economics of this country. We thought we might see it today with Senator Sherry, probably the only credible member that Labor have. They have wheeled him out to debate the situation in regard to the current account deficit and foreign debt.
Frankly, Senator Sherry, their only credible finance representative, has failed them tragically. In their first foray into an economic debate since the election, having understood that this is where their next three years should be focused, Senator Sherry, the only credible financial spokesman they have, has failed them. He has not progressed their economic credibility one iota today. But they have three years. They will wheel Senator Sherry out again sometime for an economic debate, and he will have another opportunity to perhaps inch the Labor Party toward some public credibility with respect to economic matters. Today has been a big disappointment.
Senator Sherry has simply chosen to present a doom and gloom situation in regard to the economy, when not just everyone in this chamber and every economic commentator but everyone in the public knows that that is not the situation of the Australian economy. The Australian economy is sound. It is strong and it is growing. The fundamentals are right, and they are in place. We need only go through the main statistics that affect every household, every business, small and large, and every export business in this country. Interest rates, for example, are the lowest they have been for decades. Home mortgages are around seven per cent. The inflation rate is within the bounds of the Reserve Bank requirements. It is 2.6 per cent. In fact, it is really only two per cent if you take away the spike that the higher oil prices have created in the last six to 12 months. So the inflation rate is tight and within the bounds of the two to three per cent set by the Reserve Bank.
The unemployment rate is the lowest it has been for decades. It is at a historic low of 5.1 per cent. Equally, consumer confidence is as high as it has been for decades. As reported in just the last day or two, business confidence is as high as it has been at any time over the past few years. It is showing no signs of declining. Don’t you think, Senator Lundy and Senator Sherry, that the business survey would be one of the first indicators that there was some sort of doom and gloom or approaching downturn in the Australian economy? None of those key statistics point to any downturn, let alone the doom and gloom and ruin of the picture you try to paint. We are not even looking at a downturn. We are quite confident, and we are backed up by the OECD.
I am afraid I am going to run out of time. I have only four more minutes to build a case against you, Senator Lundy, to show you just how solid this economy is and just how wrong you are in your presentation, whether deliberately or not. It does not matter: we are on air, and people are listening to the Labor Party’s view of the economy and, with their own basic understanding of economics, they will simply never agree with you until you come in here and present the facts properly.
The OECD report has given support to the Australian economy. The OECD predicted a continuation of Australia’s strong growth, low inflation and low unemployment—key economic indicators—although it is true to say that they have signalled that we need to maintain our reform agenda. So we wait. When we introduce further reforms into this parliament—albeit that we do not need your numbers after 1 July—

Senator Lundy interjecting—

—we will wait to see whether you support us or not and whether you support us in industrial relations reform and many other areas when we introduce those reforms. We will be introducing and voting on them well before 1 July, Senator Lundy, so we will see your true colours in regard to reform and maintaining that growth in the strength of the economy.
Much has been made of the current account deficit. We are confident that we can meet the concerns about the current account deficit. Senator Sherry asked the federal government to note the increase in the current account deficit. We do note the increase in the current account deficit, but there are reasons—pretty clear and good reasons—that we have the current account deficit situation that we have at the moment. As I said, we have a very strong economy. That success is what has led to the current account deficit. We are probably a victim of our own success. The Australian domestic economy is growing. It has great demand and is sucking in the imports. It is not in sync with the rest of the world, which is not growing at the same rate as Australia, and so our exports are not getting out there.
I say to Senator Lundy and those opposite: overlaying that has been, for the last two years at least, a lingering, patchy drought that Australia is yet to come out of. Of course, that has had an effect on a major exporter, the rural sector, in all areas—in the beef industry, in the dairy industry, in wool, in sheep and in wheat. That drought has touched every sector and it is still lingering in parts of Australia. Of course that has affected our exports and the current account. Added to that, we have had a high Australian dollar—higher than the rural industries would want. The rural industry spokespeople want the lowest possible Australian dollar, as all exporters do. The exporters see a dollar in the high 70s and breaking into the 80s as higher than they would like in order to maintain their competitiveness. (Time expired)

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-02-09,"—I continue my remarks on the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Imposition Amendment Bill 2004 and related bills. On the face of them, these bills are quite clear. Under the current arrangements some small financial institutions have argued that they bear and have borne a disproportionate burden of the levies which are already in operation, but they acknowledge that the new arrangements provide greater equity. The obvious consequence of that is the reason we should support the bills, because even those who feel they are hard done by find the new levy arrangements better.
The second thing we should draw attention to is the very large number of levies and new taxes that have emerged under this government since 1996. There may well be a case for their rationalisation and for more consistent policy concerning these levies. The other point to make is that the Australian electorate have not punished the government—they have re-elected it—so obviously the levies and new taxes have not upset that many people. But I think there may be a case, as there is for any mature government—and I think we can now classify this as a mature government, in its fourth term—for looking back over what has been done and seeing if further rationalisation is possible. These bills do not do that—they merely improve an existing situation. In the end the debate should be about the level of government services and how those are funded. I suppose the number of new taxes is not the critical issue, but it is a fact that people find that the presence of multiple different kinds of fees and taxes gives them a sense of being hit upon—of governments finding every way possible to sting them. You are often better off with a few bigger taxes than a multitude of minor and irritating taxes.
Back in 2001, ASIC collected $201 million but only spent $139 million. There is an issue of whether the funds raised should equal the funds spent and not find their way into general taxation. The purpose of a levy and the taxation philosophy behind a levy is that it should meet the specific expenditure—the hypothecated expenditure, almost—that it is intended for. Very often with government levies we hear the criticism that only part of the levy is used for the purpose the levy was designed for and the rest is simply taking profit and is off to the general taxation reserve. That is not good practice.
The bills do not address the issues of whether cost recovery is appropriate in regulating the financial service sector, whether current funding arrangements produce the most efficient or effective returns or even whether the level of funding for APRA is adequate, although I must say to the government that the reforms of APRA have markedly improved its performance—something which they well know. I think its earlier performance was pretty miserable. Cost recoveries are not really an increase in taxation, and you can never quarrel too much with that. The Australian Constitution seems to require seven different bills due to the requirement for a separate bill for each particular levy and tax. It is an odd thing that we are faced with a paper nightmare when it could have been done much more easily in another way.
Those are just some rambling and reactive thoughts concerning this. I and my party are certainly not opposed to these bills, nor are we opposed to the levies and how they are being used. These bills achieve the government’s aim of implementing those recommendations made in the report on the review of financial sector levies that require a consequent legislative change. Whether the moneys in the end will do the good deed we need them to do we will only find out in the process, but I hope the government takes to heart my point that at some stage we need to review the entire philosophical basis under which we are operating at present with these multiple levies, fees and taxes.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION SUPERVISORY LEVY IMPOSITION AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,38,1
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2005-02-09,"—I thank Senator Sherry and Senator Murray for their comments and note that the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Imposition Amendment Bill 2004 and related bills are supported, so I will sum up very briefly just so that the government’s position is clear. This package of bills implements the legislative elements of the government’s response to the review of financial sector levies. The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, APRA—as the prudential supervisor—the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, ASIC, and the Australian Taxation Office, the ATO, in undertaking certain consumer protection and market integrity functions, which I am sure we all support, relating to prudentially regulated entities, perform vital tasks within the Australian financial system. The government is committed to ensuring that the three regulators are properly resourced to undertake these tasks both effectively and efficiently. It is therefore important that the financial sector levies which fund the regulatory activities can meet the evolving needs of prudential supervision and raise the funds from financial institutions in an equitable manner.
The existing levy determination arrangements were established following the 1997 financial system inquiry and the acceptance of the general principle that the cost of financial regulation should be borne by those who benefit from it. The arrangements are evaluated regularly every few years to ensure that they remain appropriate. In performing its evaluation, the most recent review was required to balance accountability, efficiency, transparency and equity with simplicity of administration and collection, and to ensure that the recommended options had the capacity to provide stable and effective funding for the regulators on a sustainable basis going forward. Fundamentally, the review’s task was to consider how the burden of funding the relevant regulatory activities might best be distributed amongst the prudentially regulated industries and institutions. The government has therefore accepted the review’s recommendations, subject to them not causing increases in levies paid by the smallest financial sector entities.
I might just pause there to emphasise, basically in response to a comment by Senator Sherry, that these bills are not actually introducing new taxes; they are simply changing the way of calculating existing levies to fund APRA, part of ASIC and the ATO. The levies only charge the amount considered necessary to cover the cost of the regulators—no more and no less. While some key features of the current levy determination framework remain appropriate and are being retained, a number of important adjustments to the framework are being introduced through the package of bills to achieve equity. The amendments generally allow for increased flexibility in the way the levies are determined for 2005-06 and subsequent years. It is intended to ensure that the levies meet the objectives set for the review.
The legislative package restructures the levies into two components. The first component reflects the cost of supervising an institution and retains the structure of the existing levy arrangements of flat proportionate assets, subject to minimum and maximum levy amounts for individual institutions. The second component, and this is a new component, reflects system impact and vertical equity considerations, and is calculated as a proportion of assets. There is an overall cap on the amount that may be raised through this component by no minimum or maximum amount applying to individual institutions.
The statutory upper limit on the maximum amount of the first levy component is being increased to $1.5 million for 2005-06 with an increased indexed factor applying in later years. This overcomes an inequity that has prevented, for example, the largest banks being levied significantly more than much smaller and far less complex banks. Small APRA funds, for instance, are being recognised as a separate class of superannuation fund with the intent that the small superannuation funds will be levied at a lower rate than other funds. This simply recognises that a single approved trustee commonly manages a large number of small APRA funds and that the primary focus of prudential attention is on the trustee rather than each of the individual funds.
In addition, authorised, non-operating holding companies in the general insurance sector are also being made subject to the levies for the first time. This brings them into line with the arrangements for the authorised deposit-taking institution sector. I should also thank Senator Watson for his remarks. I am sorry to have left Senator Watson out. I thank him for his usual erudite comments on these matters. As he mentioned, the fact that we have got seven bills and perhaps not a more simplified way of presenting this is because of the constitutional requirements for a separate bill for each levy, which relates of course to each industry sector. I do hope that these remarks have placed the government’s response to the review in context. I think it has taken into account the varying circumstances of how to appropriately regulate different sized institutions. Once again, I thank colleagues for their comments. I commend the bills to the Senate.
Question agreed to.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2005-02-09,"—This afternoon, I want to say a few words about what will, I believe, come to be seen as one of the transforming events of the early 21st century. I speak of the elections for the Iraqi national assembly and for 18 provincial councils, which were held on 30 January. I want to speak in particular of the courage of the millions of Iraqi citizens who, braving dire threats of intimidation by the enemies of democracy, made those elections such a triumphant vindication of those whose sacrifice brought democracy to Iraq, and I want to pose the question: while the struggle to create a democratic state in Iraq was at its fiercest, where was the Left?
Have you ever noticed how much the rhetoric and symbolism of the political Left is dominated by the language of war and struggle? Those on the Left speak of the class war and the class struggle; radicals, particularly in universities, delight in being described as militants; terrorists are commonly called freedom fighters; Third World populations are constantly being urged to wage war against their oppressors, usually the United States and other democracies; and postcolonial civil wars are invariably described as wars of national liberation. From Marx to Marcuse, the central concept of their political universe is revolution. In fact, one of the most enduring items of late 20th century kitsch is the image of the bereted and bandoliered guerrilla Che Guevara in the pose of iconic freedom fighter. Yet, notwithstanding the Left’s romanticisation of violence and idealisation of the revolutionary warrior, their victories are almost all rhetorical. Those of the Left are curiously absent when it comes to fighting the real wars of national liberation.
Nobody captured the mismatch between the heroic rhetoric of the Left and its moral cowardice better than did George Orwell, who, having himself fought and been grievously injured in the Spanish Civil War, knew a thing or two about what wars look like from the point of view of the people actually fighting them. In one of the greatest political essays ever written, ‘Inside the Whale’, Orwell quoted from the then fashionable Leftist posturing of WH Auden in his poem about that war:
... Today the struggle.
Today the deliberate increase in the chances of death,
The conscious acceptance of guilt in the necessary murder;
Today the expending of powers
On the flat ephemeral pamphlet and the boring meeting.
Orwell wrote of that stanza that it was:
... intended as a sort of thumbnail sketch of a day in the life of ‘a good party man’. In the morning a couple of political murders, a ten minutes’ interlude to stifle ‘bourgeois’ remorse, and then a hurried luncheon and a busy afternoon chalking walls and distributing leaflets. All very edifying. But notice the phrase ‘necessary murder’. It could only be written by a person to whom murder is at most a word.... Mr Auden’s brand of amoralism is only possible if you are the kind of person who is always somewhere else when the trigger is being pulled. So much of left-wing thought is a kind of playing with fire by people who don’t even know that fire is hot.
Orwell, the soldier who actually fought in the Spanish Civil War, never glamorized violence; Auden, the Leftist poet reclining comfortably in Hampstead, could afford to write cheaply of armed struggle, secure in the knowledge it would always be other people who did the fighting.
Fast-forward 65 years, and we see the same thing in our own day. Once again, when a real war of national liberation was being fought, in Iraq, where were the Left? They were nowhere to be found. Forget the heroic rhetoric about liberation, fighting for freedom, the struggle against oppression. When it came to actually fighting a war of national liberation, a war to free an oppressed people, a war to instate democratic rights, where was the Left? At worst, they were howling denunciations against those who sought to liberate Iraq—the United States, Britain and Australia. At best, they were sitting on the sidelines, loud in their criticism of errors in policy but remarkably muted in their celebration of the great act of democracy which occurred in Iraq last week.
Whatever shortcomings there may have been in intelligence gathering before Operation Iraqi Freedom began, whatever errors have occurred in planning since the liberation of Baghdad, whatever criticism might legitimately be levelled at American policy makers and strategists for failing to anticipate the extent of the insurgency, one thing is crystal clear and cannot be denied: but for the liberation of Iraq by coalition forces in 2003, there would have been no Iraqi election last week. If the Australian Labor Party, the Greens and the Australian Democrats had had their way, the war would never have been fought, Saddam Hussein would never have been toppled and the election which took place last week could never have happened.
Australia is blessed by the fact that democracy came easily for us. Our democratic institutions were created by an act of democracy itself: by a referendum. For us, democracy has always been a given, and perhaps we take it too much for granted. But there are very few democratic nations in our happy position. Many of the great democracies—America, Britain, France, Italy, India—had as their birthright wars of independence, civil wars or revolutions. For others, for instance Japan, democratic institutions were established following armed occupation. Merely because it was Australia’s historic good fortune that our democracy came to us by peaceful means, we must never lose sight of the fact that for most people democracy was created by war, and wars are won by fighting. And so it was with Iraq.
Even before it had happened, the usual apologists—the John Pilgers, the Noam Chomskys, the Gore Vidals—along with our own pallid local imitators of the great Leftist sages, denounced the Iraqi election. They denounced the imposition of ‘Western’, or even ‘American’, cultural values on an Islamic nation—as if democratic government was a right vouchsafed only to the peoples of the West. These were, if my memory serves me correctly, among the very same people who welcomed the introduction of democracy in South Africa—yet South Africans are hardly Westerners.
In one form or another, democratic forms of government now exist in nations of all cultures and all races: in India, in Indonesia, in Japan and Taiwan, in Israel and in the Palestinian Authority, in Afghanistan, in Russia, in the Ukraine, in East Timor. Many of the very people who were swiftest in their denunciation of the military action which made democracy possible in Iraq were eager to invoke the authority of the United Nations. Yet the core document of the United Nations, the political testament which is its whole raison d’etre, is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The declaration, by article 21, proclaims:
(1) Everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives.
                  …         …           …
(3) The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government; this shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures.
And, by its preamble, the declaration provides that it is the duty of member states to work to achieve ‘the promotion of universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms’ which it proclaims.
How is this so different from what President Bush said in his address to this parliament the year before last:
Some are sceptical about the prospects for democracy in the Middle East and wonder if its culture can support free institutions. In fact, freedom has always had its sceptics. Some doubted that Japan and other Asian countries could ever adopt the ways of self-government. The same doubts have been heard at various times about Germans and Africans. At the time of the Magna Carta, the English were not considered the most promising recruits for democracy. To be honest, sophisticated observers had serious reservations about the scruffy travellers who founded our two countries.
Every milestone of liberty was considered impossible before it was achieved. In our time we must decide our own belief: either freedom is the privilege of an elite few or it is the right and capacity of all humanity.
In the 16 months since President Bush spoke those words in October 2003, democratic elections have been held not only in Iraq but also in Afghanistan and in the Palestinian Authority. In the first two of those instances, but for the use of external military force, led by the United States and supported by Australia, to displace appalling dictatorships—the Taliban in Afghanistan; Hussein in Iraq—the elections would never have happened.
What President Bush said in October 2003—and on many other occasions before and since—did not place him outside the mainstream of American foreign policy, as many have suggested. It was not in substance different from the noble sentiment which animated President Wilson when he proclaimed his famous Fourteen Points and told congress in January 1918 that the United States was ‘willing to fight and to continue to fight for the principle of justice to all peoples and nationalities, and their right to live on equal terms of liberty and safety with one another, whether they be strong or weak’; or the famous words of President Kennedy’s inaugural address in January 1961; or President Reagan’s history-changing speech at the Brandenburg Gate in June 1987, when he challenged Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin Wall.
But the final arbiters of the rightness of the military action to topple Saddam Hussein must be the Iraqi people themselves. In the days before 30 January, the world held its breath for fear that insurgents and terrorists would destroy the election. The most notorious of them, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, announced ‘a bitter war against democracy and those who seek to enact it’. Iraqi citizens were repeatedly warned that, if they participated, they would put their lives at risk. On 10 January, for instance, one insurgent group, the Secret Republican Army, announced that 32 snipers would be emplaced at polling places in the province of Wasit, south of Baghdad. Another threatened that it would ‘wash the streets with voters’ blood’ if they dared to participate. Similar threats of the same nature were made throughout Iraq by a variety of insurgent militias.
There can surely never have been a time, in any nation on the earth, that participation in an election was accompanied by such grave peril. If the Iraqi people did not want a democracy, they certainly had no incentive to participate in one. And what happened? The people of Iraq took their lives into their hands and voted in their millions, in numbers which far exceeded anybody’s expectations. Of a total eligible voting population of about 14.2 million, turnout was initially estimated at 72 per cent. That was subsequently revised downwards to 57 per cent. The latest estimate of turnout is 60 per cent. Understandably, the turnout was much higher in the Kurdish north and the Shiite south than in the Sunni centre but, even there, Sunni Muslims voted in surprisingly large numbers against the wishes of their religious leaders and the threats of terrorists.
That, by exercising for the first time the right to vote, Iraqis placed themselves in mortal peril is beyond doubt. Early estimates suggest that at least 44 were murdered at polling places or shortly after voting. The danger of attack was made even greater by the practice of dyeing the forefingers of voters in ink to prevent double voting, which made those who had exercised the right readily identifiable to terrorists. In Baghdad, for instance, according to CNN reports four voters identified by their ink-stained fingers were kidnapped by terrorists and murdered with grenades.
But the Iraqis were undeterred. There could be no more emphatic answer to the cynics who ridiculed the election even before it had happened, no more persuasive vindication of the use of military force to liberate Iraq and no greater vote of confidence in the sustainability of a democratic future for Iraq than the fact that, in a voluntary ballot, on even the most conservative estimate, more than half of the adults of that nation put their lives on the line, took themselves to their local polling place and cast their vote.
How does that compare with the more mature democracies? At last year’s American presidential election, the turnout was actually lower—56.2 per cent. In the 2001 British elections, it was about the same—59.4 per cent—as was also the case in France, where in the final round of the 2002 elections for the Assemblee Nationale the turnout was 60.7 per cent. And indeed, at the most recent elections for the European Parliament, the turnout of the French was just 42.7 per cent, and that of the Germans was 43 per cent. How ironic that the European nations which did more to oppose the liberation of Iraq than any other—the French and Germans—should care less about their own democracy than the newly freed people of Iraq care about theirs.
And where was the Left when the battle for democracy in Iraq was being fought and won? Where were the balladeers of struggle, the gladiators of the printed page and the warriors of the spoken word, the moral bankrupts who endlessly talk about democracy and evoke the dignity of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights but never do anything about bringing them to accomplishment, the Che Guevara T-shirt wearers, the spineless bourgeois Leftists who affect the language of struggle and national liberation as a fashion statement—who, just like Auden during the Spanish Civil War, thrill to the frisson of the tough-guy rhetoric but are always somewhere else when the shooting starts?
For the Left, the romance goes out of wars of national liberation when they are being fought by democracies and, even more shockingly, if the democracies are led by conservative leaders such as George Bush and John Howard. The Left’s enthusiasm for national liberation can never withstand its appetite for self-loathing, particularly of its own country and its own democracy. The truth is that, when the struggle to liberate Iraq and to create a democracy in Iraq was being fought and won, the parties of the Left were nowhere to be found. In fact, it was worse: they were as swift in their denunciation of the liberation of Iraq as they were slow to welcome the success of its election or to applaud the courage of those who stared down the terrorists, put their lives on the line and voted in their millions.
Historians of future generations will, in my view, come to see 30 January 2005 as a milestone in the long story of democracy and a turning point in the modern history of the Middle East. Although the war of liberation which made it possible was denounced by fashionable opinion in all of the older democracies, including ours, but for that war there would have been no popular election last week. The people of Iraq would still be denied that which the Universal Declaration of Human Rights declares to be the universal right of every person.
We should all be humbled by the courage of the Iraqi people. I, for one, am overwhelmed by the emphatic vindication of democracy we saw last week and, like everyone on this side of the chamber, very proud of the role Australia played in making Iraqi democracy possible.",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL’S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,MISCELLANEOUS,39,1
"Tierney, Sen John",LP,2005-02-09,"—I rise this afternoon to speak in the debate on the address-in-reply to the Governor-General’s speech which opened the Australian parliament at the end of last year. This followed the election victory of the coalition government, a victory which provides tremendous opportunity and cements in place the agenda of this current government. For too long, we have been frustrated in this place by obstruction, particularly by opposition members and smaller parties. We have put forward a very clear agenda over eight years and this has been blocked or watered down. One of the great outcomes of that election was the fact that we won control in the Senate. Following 30 June, we will have the opportunity to put in place that agenda. We have clearly spelt it out and it is so crucial for the future development of our great country.
In his speech, the Governor-General said:
Few nations can claim the special gifts that providence has bestowed on this country—as a beacon of democracy and tolerance underpinned by a prosperous economy and a fair society.
We now have the opportunity to grasp what this last election has given us, to provide for Australia those opportunities and, in this place, to provide the legislative underpinning for those opportunities.
It is a far cry from the situation that existed when I came into this chamber 14 years ago. At that stage, in the early parts of 1991—ironically, the first Gulf War was just wrapping up then, and now, as I leave the parliament, we find ourselves still involved in a gulf war—the economic circumstances were very different. We were in the worst recession since World War II. In the first month I was in this place, unemployment peaked at 11 per cent and the inflation rate had been incredibly high, getting up around seven or eight per cent. We had experienced interest rates of 17 and 18 per cent just a year or two before. For people to build businesses, for families to build prosperity and try and gain employment, it was a very bleak landscape at that time. Because of the abundant natural resources we have in Australia but, more importantly than that, because of the developing intellectual and cultural resources of this nation, the nineties showed us as very resilient people. We have bounced back, but to some large extent we have bounced back because the policies put in place during those years are underpinning our current prosperity. We now have an opportunity to build on that.
We are only a small country, but my time at the United Nations actually demonstrated very dramatically to me what a wealthy country we are in comparison with the situation in many other nations. There are 191 nations in the world, and we actually rank 11th in size of economy. That is quite dramatic when you think of it: 11th out of 191. Mind you, there are some very big economies above us. We are up there as major players, not only in terms of the size of our economy but also in terms of trade.
One thing came home to me very clearly a little after I finished my time at the UN. It was with regard to the tsunami disaster and how well developed our skills and our infrastructure are to help those in need. There was a magnificent response from Australia following 26 December. We were in there very quickly helping. The impressive thing is that we had the equipment and infrastructure to actually help in areas which did not have such assistance. The fact that we could turn salt water into fresh water at the enormous rate of 240,000 litres a day made a difference between life and death in many of these countries, particularly in the Aceh region of western Sumatra. Our ability to do this is because of the strength of our economy, the strength of our society and the spirit of our people. We can drive this forward with the opportunities that now lie before us in putting into place the full program of the government.
One of the areas I want to start with relates to the industrial relations program. This is one that I have been very close to as Chair of the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee. After 1996 we started out well, with a reform agenda for industrial relations, and we made some progress—none of it thanks to the Labor Party, mind you. It was due to the Australian Democrats and the way in which they are prepared to negotiate a new industrial reform agenda. We did make that initial progress but then in the last few years it got bogged down.
We have made very clear what we want to do in the industrial relations area, and every three years the Australian people have given us a mandate to do that. But we are also constantly blocked in what we are trying to achieve. The best example of that is the unfair dismissal laws. There will be nothing more important to drive the Australian economy through its main engine room, the small business sector, than reform in this area.
Every time we have put this up to the Senate committee we have had the unions come round and give their point of view. Employers gave their point of view, the government gave their point of view, and then it was blocked. About a year later, we returned and we did exactly the same thing. It was a bit like Groundhog Day: we just kept coming back, and back again, going through the same process and not making any progress. It is absolutely terrific that we will now have the opportunity to do that and to change so many other areas in workplace relations. The Australian workplace agreements that this government have brought in have been very successful in so many areas but have been resisted fiercely by the unions, particularly in the areas of the Public Service and universities.
Nothing will free up the Australian work spirit more than the opportunities that can be provided in a freer industrial relations climate. We now have the opportunity to do that. Our minister has foreshadowed that we will try to move towards one industrial relations system. Over 10 years ago, the Victorians handed over their powers in this area to the federal government, and it works quite well. When the Brogden government is elected in New South Wales, I am sure it will do the same thing. We are moving towards a unitary system. Again, this will create great efficiencies in the Australian economy, because nothing is more dissipating and distracting than two whole different sets of rules, state and federal, cutting across industries and cutting across workplaces. That is about to change with the reforms that will come in under this government.
The second area relates to education, in particular universities. The federal government of course have the major responsibility for this area, but again we have been frustrated in the Senate in the reform agenda that we have put forward. We had to go through quite a number of compromises with the Independents in this place to advance the reforms of the Crossroads review and we did make great progress. Now there is the opportunity to make greater progress.
One thing that is missing from our tertiary education system is a significant private sector. The irony is we have a big private high school sector—one-third of students go to private schools—but when you get to the university sector it is very tiny. When I was in the United States I took the opportunity to have a look at the private universities. I went to places like Princeton, Columbia, MIT and Harvard. These places have built, on private money, a huge university structure. One of the reasons why we have not been able to find places for students over the years is that that part of our system has been missing. But we now have 27 institutions that are moving towards or actually offering degree-level courses. Their students, for the first time, have access to FEE-HELP. We are starting to build this private sector. Notre Dame university, based in Perth, is opening a campus in my own city of Sydney, and that is another private campus of an established university. So, those sorts of developments are now possible.
The way in which, over the last 10 years, we have been able to provide alternative sources of money for our university sector means that it will be able to move towards a properly developed higher education system, with enough students and enough research going on to underpin the modern Australian economy, which is going to be very much an information economy, based so much on knowledge industries. The need for that to be underpinned by the system that we are now developing is incredibly important. Again, there will be opportunities in this place to bring these reforms forward in the next period of parliament.
The challenge of the ageing population is one of the things that the government have to really focus on in this next term. We had some limited success, going back three budgets ago, when a major review was done of where the ageing Australian society was heading and its implications for the Australian budget. The 40-year out projections, in terms of an ageing population, show that there will be an enormous increase in costs and in the burden on the Australian federal government budget over the next 40 years. They will rise in two ways: (1) the sheer volume of people in the retired population will increase and (2) the costs of maintaining quality of life will increase because of developments in medical science, meaning that there will be a whole range of procedures, a lot of them expensive procedures, to help maintain people’s quality of life—and they will rightly demand access to these services.
So, how will that be funded? It cannot be funded totally from the budget. There has to be a cooperative arrangement in our system whereby people pay and government pay. We have moved towards that in some of our reforms over the last few years, and we now have an opportunity to position the country to take into account this ageing population and prepare for it properly. If we wait 20 years and do not have such measures in place, we are going to be in a situation where the budget is going to blow out incredibly rapidly, and that means a much higher tax regime, which will have all sorts of implications for the Australian economy as well as for the budget.
Another area that will change dramatically and where we have been frustrated over the last eight years is communications. The sale of Telstra has been on our agenda for eight years. There is no reason why governments should be in the ownership of telcos. This is a historical artefact. When other countries have moved to a more privatised system their communications systems have become more robust and have developed properly, when some of the disciplines of the market have been brought into the equation.
There has been great concern out in the community about the protection of the services of telecommunications. A lot of this fear, whipped up by the opposition, has been ill founded. We have a Telecommunications Act that has considerable protections in it. It does not matter whether it is Optus, which is entirely private, or whether it is Telstra, which is half government and half private, or whether it is a fully privatised Telstra, these matters can be controlled by a legislative regime. Things have improved dramatically over our time in government, particularly the services to rural and regional Australia. Although these have not been perfect, when I compare the current situation with some of the reports we were getting from the old Telecom, back over 10 years ago, about the level of service providers to customers, the rate of repairs on broken equipment and cost structures, things have improved dramatically in this new information age. They will continue to improve.
The last area I want to deal with relates to the future of Australia’s trading relations with other countries. We are the 12th largest trading nation in the world and we have enormous opportunities, not just with our raw mineral products and crops, which have been the mainstay of our economic development for so long. In this new information economy, there is such enormous opportunity in the skills of the Australian people developing products and services that can be sold overseas.
One of the most dramatic developments and one of the greatest achievements of this government in the last term was the signing of the United States-Australia Free Trade Agreement. We are now working on a free trade agreement with China, having signed one with Thailand. These opportunities for using our skills and niche markets in conjunction with very large economies like China and the US mean that we will not face the problem of unemployment in the future. As a matter of fact, the paradigm has already shifted. When I came into this place, unemployment was the big problem. We now face skill shortages. That will be a brake on the economy unless we can move towards improving those skills.
The creation at the last election of the Australian technical colleges—a federal government initiative to better link the school system into the trade system and provide a lot of the missing skills—will be the sort of program that will help our economy develop, help us continue the stream of goods and help to provide a trading environment where we can improve our balance of payments, which is probably the biggest economic challenge that Australia faces today. As I look to the future from the Australia that we have in 2005 and as I compare it to the Australia of 1991, when I came into parliament, I am very optimistic about how Australia has come through very tough times. I believe the measures that the Howard government has implemented over the last eight years, and what it will implement over future years, will provide Australia with a very bright and prosperous future.",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL’S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,MISCELLANEOUS,39,1
"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,2005-02-09,"—I commend my colleague Senator Tierney for his comments. There is only one comment that I disagree with. I like to compare Australia in 2005 with the Australia we inherited in 1996. As we witnessed at the recent election, the Australian people have so much more confidence in 2005 because of what this government has done for them compared with how they felt given the state the country was in in 1996. It only goes to show, although the election is some time past, how much confidence the Australian people have in this government, which was returned with a resounding, increased majority. It is one we are very proud of and it is due to the fine leadership that has been shown by the Prime Minister and the members of his cabinet and ministry.
I commend Senator Knowles, who moved this motion and who is finishing her term in this Senate. She and Senator Tierney, who spoke just before me, have both made a tremendous contribution to this Senate in their own way. Both will be leaving us at the end of June; this is their last address-in-reply opportunity. Their colleagues know the work that they have put into both the party and this Senate. We commend them for it and thank them very much for the good work that they have done over all those years.
When I stopped to think of the election result it reminded me of my entry into the Senate in 1992, when there was a Labor government. I was paired to that great Labor electorate of Grey in South Australia, under the system that we have. Grey is an electorate that had been held by the Labor Party since the Second World War for all but three years, from 1966 to 1969. I set up an office in Grey in Port Augusta because you could reasonably class it as the centre of the electorate, although the electorate went from the Western Australian border to the Northern Territory border to the Queensland border to the New South Wales border—it was an enormous seat.
From the time I set up the office and we preselected a candidate to stand in the seat of Grey—my good friend and colleague Barry Wakelin, who is well known to my colleagues on this side—we had to achieve a two per cent swing to win Grey in 1993. Since 1993 we have achieved more than that two per cent swing and Barry Wakelin won that seat by two per cent in 1993. In 1996 he increased that to about six per cent, in 1998 he increased it to eight per cent, in 2001 he increased it to 10 per cent and in the 2004 election Barry Wakelin had a 14 per cent majority in the seat of Grey, only one per cent of which has come about because of a redistribution. So I want to pay tribute to my good friend Barry Wakelin, who shows what you can do when you work hard as a local member, even for a vast electorate like Grey. The people who voted for Barry Wakelin are very similar to the people who voted for all of the other coalition candidates throughout Australia. They had confidence in him, they had confidence in what this government was doing, they liked the decisions we were making and they knew that we took them away from some of the serious deficiencies that the previous Labor governments of both Hawke and Keating had left them with in their businesses.
Grey is a very large electorate and Barry Wakelin, his family and his staff are to be congratulated on the incredible efforts they make at all times of the electorate cycle for their electorate. I was at the opening of his new office in Port Pirie last week because I now live in the electorate of Grey, which I had never done before. I had always been in the electorate of Wakefield. Senator Hill opened this office, and I remember him saying that when he opened Barry’s first office in Whyalla there were about 12 people in attendance to witness the event. With Barry being brand new in the area, there were just some local, loyal supporters there to witness the opening. With the opening of Barry’s new office in Port Pirie last week—it had shifted because of the changing nature of the electorate—there were well over a hundred people to witness the opening. I might add, Senator Bishop, that it is a good, strong Labor town where you would not expect many of the local people to attend. The Mayor, many of the local identities and people from all over the electorate had come a long way to not only pay their respects to Barry Wakelin but also acknowledge the fact that his hard work has done wonders for his electorate and has also made it into what is now a safe seat.
This was a vote of confidence in the policies of the coalition government in regional Australia. Many country people recognise the hard times caused by some of the economic mismanagement that was characteristic of much of the Keating years. I well remember paying 23 per cent interest on my farm. It of course meant for those who had to borrow money that, if you stayed in that position for long enough, every four years you bought your farm again. Certainly, given the value of the money, it was like buying your farm again.
During the debate in the Senate chamber today the opposition had the temerity to question the economic credibility of this government. We heard the ministers respond, quite rightly, by reminding us of the times when we were paying interest rates in excess of 23 per cent and housing interest rates of 17½ per cent. The Australian public has never forgotten that. Even those young people in Australia who cannot remember and did not vote in those days all know what difficult times that caused their parents and what a crippling effect it had on small businesses in Australia. I remember the argument being put at the time of the introduction of the GST. We had members of the opposition telling us how many businesses would go out of business because of the introduction of the GST, how it would cripple small business. I can tell you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that nothing crippled small business like high interest rates. It is to the credit of this government that, throughout the almost nine years that we have been in government, we have been able to keep interest rates low for business and professional borrowings and also for housing loans. That is one of the reasons why people, particularly country people, have every confidence in the Howard government and the way that they manage the economy.
In my first speech to this chamber in 1992 I highlighted the concerns of the then Labor government’s neglect of rural and regional South Australia. Access to services was limited and prosperity had dwindled, partly because of high interest rates, and many farmers suffered the loss sometimes of their farms and their livelihoods. One of the greatest records of achievement of the Howard government has been through an increased understanding of the starkly different way of life between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas. I believe there was a period in the seventies and eighties when the gulf of understanding between the urban population and the rural population was growing markedly. I can understand that because I remember when I was a young fellow that the population of the country was much greater. Not only that, nearly everybody who lived in the city had a country cousin of some sort and so people in urban areas tended to visit the country, whether it was in school holidays or for any other form of holidays. So there was a greater understanding between urban and rural populations. I think that the Howard government has done much to try and increase that understanding between country and rural areas so that people who live in cities understand the difficulties that rural people go through. They understand hardships caused by natural events like the recent tragic bushfires on Eyre Peninsula in the electorate of Grey. They realise the devastation that can be caused by drought. I think that this government has helped to improve that understanding, which began to go the other way through the seventies and eighties.
The government has shown an increased awareness of the needs of rural and regional Australians and I, like many of my colleagues from rural areas, were delighted to hear the Governor-General, in his speech, talk about the government’s fourth term agenda to provide better services in regional Australia. The electorate of Grey is also going to benefit from the government’s commitment to establishing technical colleges across Australia, with a high likelihood that one of these will be in the Whyalla-Port Augusta region. The Governor-General highlighted the key platform that resulted in the successful re-election of the Howard government. This included faith in the capacity of Australians to exercise choice in their daily lives. If there has been one continuing vein throughout the prime ministership of John Howard it has been giving Australians some choice in their daily lives. To see that choice exercised and giving Australians that choice is an area that clearly sets us apart from the opposition.
I speak about the electorate of Grey partly because of my good friend Barry Wakelin, whom I have worked with for so long, but also because it is indicative of an electorate in Australia that has benefited from the Howard government and from all of the policies that have been put into place. The people of Grey, like people in other electorates across Australia, have every reason to feel confident that the future under the re-election of the Howard government will clearly be in their best interests.
Having been paired with the electorate of Grey for all that time, there was a sudden change for me in this election campaign. Having lived in the electorate of Wakefield all my life, I suddenly found myself living in the electorate of Grey but finding myself paired with the new electorate of Wakefield, which I now do not live in. That was a challenge that I relished and it was a challenge that was undertaken with some tenacity by all the people in the Liberal Party in the new electorate of Wakefield. A wonderful candidate was selected—David Fawcett, who has since become the member but who was a test pilot in the Army and had enormous credentials. He is a person who had not come up through the party all of his life. He was not someone who had a strong involvement with the Liberal Party, but he did believe in what the Howard government was doing and he joined the party and was successful.
As our Prime Minister has often said, we need to introduce into our chambers of parliament, both the House of Representatives and the Senate, people who have different backgrounds in life—people who have lived the life of ordinary Australians, people who on Friday nights have never been sure what their wage packet is going to be, people who are involved in small business and enterprises of their own, where the people who get paid first are the ones who work for them and the ones who get paid last are themselves. I have been in that position. In my early years of farming I can remember my brother and I paid ourselves and our working man exactly the same wage because things were pretty tough. We always knew we had enough money to pay our two working men’s wages, but we were never quite sure whether we were going to have enough to pay our own wages. In good years we got a bit more and in poor years we got a bit less, but there was no certainty.
Of the 14 new members in the House of Representatives who were candidates in this election—candidates who were attracted to the Liberal Party—some 11 or 12 of them have had experience in life outside of politics They had not been long-term members of the party. They are people who have lived the lives of ordinary, everyday Australians. They are people from all walks of life who have come to this place with the sort of experience that I think is very good for making sound judgments as to what is best for other Australians.
I worked with David Fawcett in the electorate of Wakefield—a seat, through redistribution, notionally held by the Labor Party by just under two per cent. There were many within our group who were pessimistic. With a longstanding Labor member—and one I can say who was quite well respected: Martyn Evans, who had been the member for Bonython—they were somewhat pessimistic as to the opportunity for success for our party. I have never worked with a candidate who worked so hard on the ground every day doorknocking, as did David Fawcett. I must also pay tribute to the former member for Wakefield, Mr Andrew, who was the Speaker of the House in the previous parliament, who spent day after day with the new candidate doorknocking in the hardest parts of the electorate. I do not know of any other retiring member who has ever worked so hard to win a seat—which had previously been a safe Liberal seat all the time that Mr Andrew was the member—to make sure that his successor in the seat with the name of Wakefield would be the Liberal candidate at the election and to further help the Howard government.
It was a tremendous thrill for those of us who were involved to find out—not on the night because things were pretty tight by the time we had finished counting on the night, but we were pretty sure that we were going to win—that the Liberal candidate, David Fawcett, had achieved a swing large enough to win the electorate by something close to 1,000 votes. I think it was a remarkable achievement. It was a remarkable achievement by all the volunteers within our party who, with some due modesty, actually beat the opposition on the ground, thinking that they could not win the seat. Whereas I think, without being too unkind, Martyn Evans and the people who supported him felt that they would be able to retain the seat even though there had been some swing against them the time before.
To see the hard work of our candidate, David Fawcett—doorknocking day after day for a period of nearly six months, because he resigned from the Army as soon as he had won preselection—come to fruition is something that we should be proud of. It gives an indication that a person with a strong commitment, a person who wants to follow an ideology, a person who wants to represent people in this parliament, can achieve this through sheer hard work in many instances, even when you are trying to win a seat away from a sitting member. I was delighted. I pay a great tribute to all those people in the electorate who came down from rural towns within the electorate to man polling booths in what we would call the hard Labor areas of that seat where there was always a Labor majority in the booth. They did not win those booths, but in some there were six and seven per cent swings to our candidate. To those people in the electorate who volunteered so much time and effort and took the trouble to support someone they believed would become a good new member of parliament, I pay a great tribute. They certainly received some reward for all of their efforts.
In conclusion I want to say a couple of things. The achievements of this government have been recognised by the people of Australia. They have been recognised because of what we have done, not what we have said we would do. We have achieved all those things that were possible in the nearly nine years that we have now been in government. The list of government achievements is endless, so I will not go into them now. Above all, the key thing is the confidence that this government has given to small business operators within Australia. The engine room, the driving force, of our economy is small business operators throughout Australia. I think the number is something like 800,000 small businesses. I am not sure of the exact number but I know it is something like that.
Small business have confidence that, one, this government is best placed to keep their interest rates low and, two, this government is prepared to tackle industrial relations—and it has promised further reforms which I think will give further incentive to small business. I think small business, being the generator within our economy, is in for a good time. The flow-on effect from that will be that Australians now and in the future will place their confidence in the coalition government for what it has achieved over the past eight years and for what it promises all those people in the future.",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL’S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,MISCELLANEOUS,39,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2005-02-09,"—I too am very pleased to be part of this address-in-reply to the Governor-General’s opening speech. I will take up the tone that Senator Ferguson used in speaking about the electorate in which he was so successful a contributor—

Senator Ferguson interjecting—

—I am about to speak about that. Firstly, I should echo Senator Ferguson’s words and say how proud I am to be part of the Howard government, which has now been re-elected for the fourth time. I was delighted on my own behalf to be re-elected for a third term in the Senate as part of the coalition Senate team in Victoria.
Like Senator Ferguson, I was responsible for an electorate in Victoria—the electorate of McMillan. McMillan has been won again by Mr Russell Broadbent, the member in the other place. Mr Broadbent has had a distinguished career as a member of parliament at the federal level. He was previously the member for McMillan between 1996 and 1998, and before that he was the member for Corinella between 1990 and 1993, before that seat was abolished. As Senator Ferguson said, not only has Mr Broadbent given total devotion to the Liberal Party over the 20 years or more that I have known him; he has also pursued a very successful career in small business. He and his wife, Bronwyn, ran a Mensland store in Pakenham, which was an extremely successful business enterprise. If I am not mistaken, he and Bronwyn were the second generation of his family to run that store before it closed a little over 12 months ago.
McMillan is a fascinating and diverse electorate. It takes in what can now be termed the outer suburbs of Melbourne on the eastern side. Formerly, the area of Pakenham and Cranbourne were part of the countryside. Indeed, the Pakenham Racing Club is now on the edge of suburbia. In that area very large housing estates are being established, full of young, aspiring, hardworking young couples—usually with young families—who are looking forward to making a better life for themselves far away from the city centre of Melbourne but in an area where they and their families can grow and prosper. Included in the new boundaries of McMillan, which were drawn up between the election just past and the election of 2001, is the rolling, rural landscape of South Gippsland, which encompasses some of the richest beef and dairy country that you would ever want to see. The farmers in that district are very successful small business men and, together with the tourism and residential developments along the coast, that area is geared for development that is, I hope, not too fast but certainly well planned and that will integrate tourism and the local economy to a great extent.
I worked with Mr Broadbent intensively for the year in which he was preselected, and I was absolutely delighted when he was elected with a substantial majority at the last election. I congratulate him and I am delighted to have been a part of that.
I would like to move to a wider consideration of the Governor-General’s remarks, particularly with regard to trade. Trade liberalisation has always been a goal of Australian governments, and we have tried to work through multilateral trade agreements, through bilateral trade agreements, through free trade agreements, through our membership in the World Trade Organisation and through our membership in regional trading blocs. As everyone would know, the US free trade agreement was successfully brought to a conclusion at the end of last year, and the timely conclusion of that was of the highest priority for Australia—for reasons that I will go into in a moment. As well, in June 2004 the Minister for Trade was successful in signing the Australia-Thailand free trade agreement, which will also bring us some benefits which I will detail. We will also continue to consider possible free trade agreements with China, Malaysia and the ASEAN nations—the latter in conjunction with New Zealand.
I am delighted that we will be investing an extra $30 million over three years in the Export Market Development Grants program. Since coming to government, the Howard government has scaled that program far more towards small and medium exporters. From what I have seen of Austrade offices around the world, all of those offices use the resources available to make sure that Australian exports have the freest possible entry into the country in which they are located. Far from being a mere bureaucracy, the Austrade offices that I have seen are very entrepreneurial and proactive in discussing Australian exports with likely importers and then seeing that it is brought to fruition. That has been a great success story. The government will also appoint 30 new export facilitators to maximise our export opportunities to the United States market, which I will detail in a moment, and we are also going to create export hubs in regional Australia through the co-location of the services of Austrade and AusIndustry.
I will move to a more particular examination of some of the benefits that the US agreement has brought to our country and especially to my home state of Victoria. The major Victorian merchandise exports to the United States are: beef, $A260 million; motor vehicle parts, $218 million; wine, $134 million; and lamb, $128 million. As I detailed in my remarks about McMillan, I am sure that beef and lamb from that district will play a particular role in those exports to the US. Going in the other direction, from Melbourne towards the western part of Victoria, no doubt the Pyrenees-Grampians wine region will also have a particular part to play in that, as will areas further to the west.
The United States is the world’s largest market. It has a population of nearly 300 million and a gross domestic product of almost $US11 trillion. It is the world’s largest importer, the world’s largest investor and the world’s largest purchaser of goods and services. Victoria, my home state, has trade with the US. The United States is Victoria’s largest two-way trading partner and its second largest destination for exports. In 2003, Victoria’s total merchandise exports to the United States were worth $1.8 billion. Three of the state’s top exports to the US—beef, lamb and automotive parts—will receive an immediate boost from the US free trade agreement, as will our very important dairy industry and our growing wine sector. The emerging biotechnology sector in Victoria will also benefit over the longer term from Australia’s increased attractiveness to United States investment, as will the financial sector.
When the US free trade agreement was first mooted, there were many, many doomsayers who said that this would never work. Right throughout the process, there were hurdles thrown up, particularly here in Australia, by those people who said that it would not work, that we were simply casting ourselves into the cauldron, as it were, to be eaten up by the fire of the US furnace and that our industries and our investments would vanish into the US, never to be seen again. The fact remains that, owing to the careful crafting of the agreement, we will be able to provide professional, business, education, environmental, financial and transport services. A framework to promote mutual recognition of professional services has been developed. This is a big gain for Australian professionals doing business in the United States. Our financial sector will undoubtedly reap the benefits associated with financing the increased trade in goods and services flowing from the agreement. So future access for Australia’s financial services to the world’s largest financial market is assured. In addition, the agreement guarantees that any future US liberalisation in this sector cannot be reversed. Australia and the US have agreed to closely and jointly consider a number of issues regarding the closer integration of our two financial sectors and report within two years of the agreement entering into force.
We will also be able to enter the vast market of government procurement. There is a $A200 billion market in US federal and most state government purchases of goods and services, and that will now be open to Australia. Australia will have a waiver from US programs favouring US firms and products, and all US federal government contracts over $US58,550 and construction contracts over $US6,725,000 will be open to Australian firms. Obviously, Australian preferences for small business and Indigenous people will remain.
One of the other major sources of debate or discussion was the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Access by Australians to affordable medicines under the PBS will be maintained under the free trade agreement. It reinforces our existing framework for intellectual property protection of pharmaceuticals. There are many other ways in which our national interests have been protected by this agreement—unfortunately I do not have time to detail them—and it is undoubtedly an agreement which will keep our national interests alive and provide an enormous boost to our primary and manufacturing industries as well as to the intellectual property market and intellectual technology as well. It is a personal delight to me to see that happen. As I said, I am particularly pleased with the developments in my own state of Victoria.
I noticed that a journalist reported in an article in the Australian newspaper today that there is a move to cut US farm subsidies. As we know, our agricultural industries suffer a great deal from the fact that the United States pays domestic subsidies to its producers in a way which then means that it is very difficult not only for our products to enter America but also for our agricultural products to be sold to other countries within the trading framework. So we suffer both ways. In fact, Cotton Australia’s Chief Executive Officer, Philip Russell, says that US subsidies are estimated to cost the Australian cotton industry $65 million a year, or between $5,000 and $6,000 per farm, because US production subsidies encourage overproduction, which depresses prices and reduces export demand for the Australian product. That reduced demand translates into reduced farm incomes.
However, there have been some encouraging signs on the horizon of farm subsidies. For instance, Brazil, supported by Australia, recently took the United States to the World Trade Organisation disputes panel. The panel found in favour of Brazil—that is, that the United States programs were distorting world markets and were illegal under World Trade Organisation rules. The US government has appealed that decision, but this is a slight opening of the door. President Bush has apparently announced that there will be a degree of review of existing farm subsidies.
To give you an idea of the price disparity between what US growers get and what Australian growers get, US cotton growers are guaranteed US72c a pound whereas Australian growers have to take the market price of about US40c. We are out there in the open market. The US growers, in some industries, have their prices guaranteed by the government. Again, US sugar producers get US20.4c a pound while the equivalent price for Australian producers is about US8.7c a pound.
Our trade minister, Mark Vaile, has welcomed the move towards reducing farm subsidies, saying:
If implemented, these subsidies will go some way to reducing the disadvantages faced by Australian farmers and others, mainly from developing countries, in competing for markets around the world.
We have seen this scenario before. In 1995 there was a move to reduce subsidies and make cuts to payments to farmers in the United States through the Farm Bill. In the intervening time, subsidies and payments to farmers simply went up to more than they had been before. With the decision by the World Trade Organisation that it can find against America, I hope that these systems can ultimately be dismantled and then our farmers will face a fairer market not only in America but also around the world.
I will move on very briefly to the Australia-Thailand Free Trade Agreement, which was signed in July 2004. Again, Australia will receive great advantages from being part of this. I would particularly like to concentrate on the area of tertiary education institutions because the export education market has been one of our successes in South-East Asia. In January, I was fortunate enough to take a study trip to visit Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia and Malaysia. The standard of education that Australia has and the quality of the education services it can provide for Asian students here in Australia and also on the ground in that region is something we can be very proud of.
I understand that Swinburne University, Monash University and the University of Melbourne, all from my state of Victoria, are represented in Malaysia. Also, in Vietnam we have an extremely successful Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology set-up on two campuses, one in Hanoi and one in Ho Chi Minh City. The reason Australia is seen as a key destination in terms of both the export of Australian services and the facilities that we provide to Asian students here is that many parents—of a particular vintage—may have studied in Australia under the Colombo Plan. They see us as an ideal place for their children to study, given that we have a stable political regime, and they see us as an ideal place to invest in for property. Also, Australia is accessible in terms of distance if they wish to visit their children or wish for their children to come home for school term vacations. In that study trip I made, I was extremely proud to learn about what is being provided by Australia in some of those countries.
For those people who are nervous about free trade agreements, I will give you a few examples from the Australia-Thailand Free Trade Agreement, which, as I said, was signed in July 2004. Thailand will permit majority Australian ownership of mining operations, up to 60 per cent. The previous limit was 49.9 per cent. Thailand will permit 100 per cent Australian ownership of companies providing management consulting services through a regional operation headquarters or associated company or branch. The previous limit was 49.9 per cent. Thailand will permit majority Australian ownership of major restaurants or hotels, up to 60 per cent—the previous limit was 49.9 per cent—and it will permit majority Australian ownership of companies providing certain maritime cargo services, up to 60 per cent.
There are many more examples that I could give, but I am limited by time. I would like to impress upon the Senate the way in which the free trade agreements are carefully entered into by negotiating teams and the way in which the whole process is carefully overseen so that Australia obtains the maximum benefit from them, which can only benefit our industries. I am personally delighted with the progress that we have made since entering government in 1996 and I can only hope that this progress will continue—and I know it will—given our very stable regime of low unemployment, low inflation and national prosperity.

",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL’S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,MISCELLANEOUS,39,1
"Lightfoot, Sen Ross",LP,2005-02-09,"—I am privileged tonight to be able to participate in this address-in-reply to the speech made by the Governor-General, Major General Michael Jeffery, on 16 November last year. I do not necessarily want to continue where my colleague Senator George Brandis left off, but I also do want to say something about Iraq. It is a country which I have visited and to which I was a guest—once last year and once this year, having arrived back only last week.
I want to briefly outline something about Iraq, not as I know it but statistically. Iraq is of course in the Middle East. It has the Persian Gulf at its southern extreme and it lies between and is abutted by Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the Kingdom of Jordan, Syria, Turkey and, with a major border on its eastern side, the Islamic Republic of Iran. Its area is 437,000 square kilometres, with the land component being 432,000 square kilometres. Its coastline, by comparison, is only 58 kilometres. Its terrain—and I have seen a lot of it—is mostly broad plains and reedy marshes along the Iranian border down in the south but with vast mountain ranges to the north. The larger cities in the south are Umm Qasr and Basra. It has large flooded areas because it is fed by two major rivers, the Euphrates and the Tigris, with the Tigris only running into the gulf.
Iraq has a glorious imperial past spanning over thousands of years. The first civilisations could be said to have settled up to 10,000 years ago between the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers because of the rich flood plains supplied by those ancient rivers. A 12-year noncompliance with a United Nations resolution led to the Iraqi war, led by a coalition of nations, of which Australia was one, in March 2003. However, after the victory, the coalition worked assiduously to transfer power to a new sovereignty—one that would be based eventually on democracy—and that process began on 28 June 2004.
I went to Iraq two weeks ago to witness the election, to make sure that everything was run in accordance with the best possible practices given the appalling conditions that people in Iraq have suffered as a result of one of the great killers of the world, Saddam Hussein, and, more lately, with the insanity of the bestial insurgents, who kill indiscriminately—regardless of sex, regardless of age, regardless of anything really. How anyone could kill innocent people in the name of a god, expecting to seek some divine reward, is beyond my comprehension. The areas that I visited were mainly in northern Iraq or Kurdistan and were near Mosul: Kirkuk in the south-eastern part of Kurdistan and Sulaimaniya in the central eastern part. I paid a visit to Halabjah, Arbil and Dahuk, which are all major cities—some bigger, some smaller—of the Kurdish part of northern Iraq.
I met Prime Minister Allawi, who I have met on a couple of occasions. This gentlemen has conveyed himself in such an excellent manner that I hope he plays a major role in any new Iraq and particularly in any new federation. I also met the leader of the Kurds, his Excellency Jalal Talabani, who has for 45 years been what is termed a ‘peshmerger’—a patriot—who has fought for the independence of Kurdistan because of the appalling treatment of his countrymen, who happen to be different ethnically from the Arabs of the south. Mr Talabani is also certain to play a major role in any reorganised federation of Iraq.
The Kurds in the north make up approximately 20 per cent of the population of Iraq, which was estimated in July 2004 to be just over 25 million people. Of those people, 60 per cent are Shiah, 20 per cent are Sunni and 20 per cent are Kurdish. It is the Kurdish people to which I wish to continue my remarks. The Kurdish people have a long and ancient history, something akin to that of the people who represent different backgrounds in this House. But Kurdistan, if I can call it that—the northern part of Iraq—is something of a special interest to me. The Kurds have been persecuted for decades. They have been persecuted by the Ottomans and persecuted particularly by Saddam Hussein, a Sunni—one of the 20 per cent that has controlled Iraq over the past 50 years, although not always under Saddam Hussein.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-02-09,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
The report from the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations relates to the Air Passenger Ticket Levy (Collection) Act 2001 for the period 1 April 2003 to 31 March 2004. It reports on the administration of the special employee entitlement scheme for Ansett group workers. My colleague and leader, Senator Allison, spoke in this place on 7 December last year about the administration of this scheme and drew the Senate’s attention to the fact that not only have Ansett workers not received all their entitlements but the Australian travelling public have paid their Ansett ticket levy in the belief that the money was to go to Ansett workers when in fact it has gone into government coffers. We have now learned that the money is to be used to prop up this government’s war on terror in the form of aviation security related measures such as joint agency antiterrorism exercises in regional areas rather than to be spent on workers’ entitlements.
I think it is appropriate that the Senate and the public are aware that the report tabled today covers the period 1 April 2003 to 31 March 2004. It has been tabled nearly one year after the end of the reporting period and less than two months before the end of the next reporting period. Given the brevity of the report, I cannot understand why this would be the case. I think it would be helpful if the government or the minister could provide an explanation about that.
The report tells us that the government contracted SEES Pty Ltd, a private sector entity, to loan the administration of Ansett $350 million to cover workers’ entitlements—a loan which the Commonwealth underwrote. Senator Allison has asked questions on notice to find out about the ownership of that company but has not yet had an answer to those, as I understand it. The Commonwealth then recouped the money from the administrators of Ansett, through Ansett asset sales, covering the cost of the loan. At the end of the reporting period last year, that figure had reached $159.45 million, but since then a total of $218 million has been repaid. In addition to recouping the money for the loan from Ansett administrators, the Commonwealth levied a ticket tax. The Australian travelling public was told that this was the Ansett ticket levy—money to pay for Ansett workers’ entitlements. We are now finding out, however, that the Ansett administrators are paying for Ansett workers’ entitlements by repaying the government loan while the government profiteered on the ticket levy, pocketing the travelling public’s funds and using it to pay for other measures.
This might not be so bad were it not for the fact that Ansett workers are still waiting for their full entitlements. The government has said on numerous occasions that all Ansett employee entitlements have been paid up. This is only true to the extent that the employees have been paid the government’s own very restrictive level of entitlements that it said it would pay. For example, there is a maximum of eight weeks redundancy pay. This was according to the government’s so-called community standard. I believe the government has not clearly explained how this so-called community standard was arrived at. There are workers who have worked for Ansett for decades and who are owed more than eight weeks pay, so to say that they have been paid their full entitlements is simply not accurate.
Last year Senator Allison called for the government to release the money that it has pocketed from Ansett asset sales and to return that money to Ansett workers. On 15 December last year, the government made a big deal of the fact that Ansett administrators have paid Ansett workers a further $16 million in entitlements, but what the government did not say was that, on the same day, it collected a further $10 million from administrators to repay the loan on top of the Ansett ticket levy that it collected. So that double-dipping continues. We certainly say that the government should immediately stop collecting funds from Ansett assets and direct that money where the public was told it would go, where, I would suggest, it would be most appropriately directed and certainly where people are entitled to have it go—that is, to the Ansett workers.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Report to the Commonwealth under Air Passenger Ticket Levy (Collection) Act 2001</title>,DOCUMENTS,40,1
"Watson, Sen John",LP,2005-02-09,"—I rise this evening to comment on the importance of the Australian Maritime College. It is particularly important to my home city of Launceston and the worldwide maritime industry, and it has contributed to the social capital of northern Tasmania. This has only been possible through a partnership with the federal government. I wish to acknowledge the great contribution that has been made by the far-sightedness of its board, its head, its teaching staff and students past and present.
The Maritime College was established in Launceston in 1978 with the first students commencing in 1980. Since that time the number of students has continued to rise. In 2004 there were 1,900 students enrolled in award courses and 1,759 students undertaking short courses, mainly through the AMC’s commercial arm, called AMC Search. That was a total of almost 4,000 people studying last year at the college.
The direct economic benefits for Launceston and Tasmania are quite significant and are in excess of $20 million annually but the total economic benefit is estimated at greater than $50 million. That equates to more than 500 jobs, both directly and indirectly. The high proportion of international students has provided a strong multicultural influence in our community. The college contributes significantly, as I said earlier, to the social capital of Tasmania. A partnership between the Maritime College and the West Tamar Council has built a swimming pool at the Beauty Point campus which is available for students and, I point out, for the local community. It has been in use since the beginning of 2004, so there is great community interaction and social responsibility.
The college has a fine international profile and reputation which has continued to grow over the years. It hosts a number of visiting academics from overseas—for example, a professor from Kobe University is working on simulation research. Staff have delivered courses in places like Taiwan, Japan and Thailand. It has a strong relationship with the National Kaohsiung Institute of Marine Technology in Taiwan, which saw a number of their students attend a summer school at the Maritime College.
The Tokyo University of Fisheries’ training ship visited the AMC in 2003 and a joint research program in fish behaviour has been initiated. There is also a partnership with the Shanghai Maritime University, where the AMC will provide degree courses in China. The first students enrolled last year and will commence their studies in February this year. The college received accreditation from the Royal Yachting Association in the United Kingdom to offer their superyacht course in Australia. These are internationally recognised qualifications needed by prospective superyacht crew members.
As a measure of its international reputation, the AMC is now the Senior Vice-Chair of the International Association of Maritime Universities and it hosted the general assembly in November 2004. At that time, the principal, Dr Neil Otway, became the chairperson of this organisation and will hold office for the next 12 months.
It is important to acknowledge that the Australian government has continued to provide very significant support to the Maritime College. In fact, funding of $7 million was announced in December 2003 to provide high-speed, high-capacity internet links between Tasmania and the mainland to facilitate improved education and research. That has continued to provide students with excellent facilities and contacts. The number of AMC programs offered in a flexible mode has increased significantly. To facilitate further developments, educational software—WebCT—was acquired, which has been embraced by academic staff for a number of their courses.
The government in its last budget in 2004 announced a further $9.7 million for the college over the next seven years to support a new operation at Point Nepean in Victoria and $4.5 million was made available for the establishment of the Australian Maritime Hydrodynamics Research Centre in Launceston. This project has completed its first full year very successfully. It has met its targets to date and is well placed to achieve its vision of becoming a world-class centre of excellence for experimental and theoretical hydrodynamic research.
Perhaps the most exciting area for the college lies in its commercial partnerships. Its research arm, AMC Search, continues to have success. In fact, it received an outstanding contractor performance award from the Department of Defence for its Pacific patrol boat courses, a great achievement for such a small company. Presentations on AMC Search’s capabilities were made in a number of locations around Australia, including Melbourne, Canberra, Fremantle, Brisbane and the Gold Coast.
I point out to the Senate that this college continues to be an innovative organisation, providing high-level teaching, research and consulting services to the Australian and international maritime industries. I believe it has a great future and is of great benefit to the state. I commend the federal government for its support for this outstanding college.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Australian Maritime College</title>,ADJOURNMENT,41,1
