"Ludwig, Sen Joe (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",ALP,2008-05-15,"—I seek leave to make a short statement in relation to the hours of business today.
Leave granted.
—I thank the Senate. It is worth explaining to the Senate the position we are now in. At the beginning of the week it was understood we would proceed with two bills and then a third bill was added, the social security bill, a budget bill which came out from Tuesday night. We expect the social security bill to be dealt with expeditiously today. In respect of the two bills that the government did want to proceed with this week, the first bill is the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment Bill 2008, which has been dealt with and the government has met the commitment that that bill would be passed as a necessary bill for this week. The second necessary bill for this week is the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (National Broadband Network) Bill 2008. That bill was dealt with last night, up until 6.50 pm, when we went on to government documents. Because of amendments moved by the opposition, that bill is being dealt with in the House of Representatives today. It will, hopefully, come out of the House at an early time, which will allow that matter to be dealt with by the Senate before 12.45 pm. However, there does not seem to be a guarantee that I can give for that.
It is a bill that the government did indicate at the beginning of the week that it does want to deal with. The government will continue to say that we do need to deal with that bill in its entirety this week; therefore, I will move a motion which will allow that bill to be dealt with to conclusion once the message returns—hopefully before 12.45 pm, but there is no guarantee of that from the House. I will not seek to move the motion concerning hours this morning and have the debate without knowing exactly when that bill will return and whether there will be sufficient time for that bill to be dealt with.
I seek the concurrence of other senators to postpone the hours motion until later on in the day, and I can move that motion by leave if necessary to allow the debate on that bill. That would mean a couple of things. Firstly, if the bill were to come forward after 12.45 pm, during what is called the non-controversial time for bills, then that message could be dealt with during that period. If it were not able to be returned and finalised by that time, the next available time would be during general business, and I would ask the opposition to provide the time for the message to be dealt with during that time. I expect it not to be a long debate, so we could then go on to general business. If the bill continued to be dealt with and was not finalised, then we could continue past 6 o’clock and use the time for at least half an hour, until 6.30 pm, have the dinner break and come back for the address-in-reply by both the opposition and the minor parties and then continue to deal with the bill and/or message until conclusion. That is the intention of the government.
We are serious about this bill, which is one of Labor’s main election commitments. It provides for the rollout of the national broadband network. It provides the basics for the mechanics to allow the tender process to go forward. The bill cannot be held up in the Senate. We must deal with it this week to allow all of those processes to proceed. I thought that it would be worth while this morning to explain the position, although I have taken longer than I might have imagined. It has an impact on all senators and their work requirements—and perhaps on the planes that they may wish to catch this evening. In any event, I seek the agreement and cooperation of the Senate to achieve that.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,1,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2008-05-15,"—by leave—On behalf of the opposition, we are in agreement with the government in relation to the way matters should proceed. We want to cooperate on this, and I associate myself with the remarks made by Senator Ludwig. However, in any change that may occur with general business today, I ask that it not be at the expense of the time allocated for general business. I think that can be done because we have a break between 6 pm and 8 pm. We certainly want to cooperate, and I think flexibility is the answer here. I agree with what Senator Ludwig has said.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,1,1

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2008-05-15,"—I rise today to support the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2008. Not surprisingly, the coalition support this bill because it closely mirrors our tax policy that we took to the last election. The coalition support the bill because the coalition parties have a strong record on personal income tax reduction, combined with a strong commitment to the philosophy that Australians should pay less tax. Labor, of course, are trying very desperately to spin this bill as their tax cut, because it is becoming increasingly obvious that they do not know what they are doing when it comes to running the Australian economy. What is alarming is that the tax cuts are being undermined by a confused and a contradictory approach to the budget and the economy more broadly.
Of course, we are getting all the spin and rhetoric about the budget being all about productivity and dealing with inflation. The reality, unfortunately, is that Labor have delivered a very old-style, big-taxing, big-spending budget that will increase pressure on inflation and see up to 134,000 Australians lose their jobs in the current year. This is a budget that proposes to increase expenditure by $34 billion over the next five years, to cut expenditure by $16 billion and to jack up taxes by $19 billion. So much for the fight against inflation! What we will see over the next five years is the Rudd Labor government proposing to spend more money, not less.
It is clear that what is emerging is that the Labor government have no clear strategy to keep the economy growing, to keep jobs secure, to keep inflation in check and, importantly, to keep petrol and grocery prices from rising. The government intend to raise taxes, with blatant disregard for the negative effects that this has on the economy and the Australian people, particularly working Australians. It is becoming increasingly obvious that the Labor government have no strategic framework that can give business confidence to invest and they have no clue about how the economic levers work.
Labor have not sought to engage in policies that will grow the economy; they have resorted to increasing taxes in a desperate attempt to haul in billions of dollars of extra revenue. Labor have not sought to build productivity or to effectively fight inflation; they have instead introduced new taxes that will put upward pressure on prices, inflation and interest rates. If the Rudd Labor government were serious about fighting inflation, they would be embarking on a series of policies that will actually make prices go down—not up. Instead, Labor have announced that they intend to raise taxes on a number of consumer products and to change policies, which will put further upward pressure on prices. Because of this budget, Australians will suffer the double whammy of increased taxes along with increased prices—and, of course, the consequent upward pressure on inflation.
The increase in taxes on so-called alcopops has nothing to do with binge drinking and everything to do with binge taxation. Labor’s assumption that consumption will basically stay at current levels really bells the cat when you look at the papers. Labor will get $3.1 billion in extra revenue, while those who binge will simply move to cheaper substitutes, as we all know. This is not an attempt to stop binge drinking; it is a measure designed to increase taxes and raise revenue to cover Labor’s spending splurge in the budget.
Labor’s increased tax on luxury vehicles suffers from the same attention deficit. It has not occurred to the Labor Party that prices on all motor vehicles will rise as a result of the $550 million tax increase. Of course, while the politics of envy and the desire to ping Porsche drivers may have been the motivation, families with a number of children to transport will have Labor to thank for slugging them with thousands of extra dollars in tax just to acquire a vehicle, such as a people-mover, large enough to transport them safely. Once again, Labor seem to have trouble walking the walk after they have talked and talked and talked.
And who can forget Labor’s promises to keep petrol prices and grocery prices down? But what do they do? They increase the excise on diesel fuel. Labor have made moves to increase the diesel fuel excise on the transport industry by 1.37c per litre and to raise trucking registration fees. Under their plan, Labor will index the diesel taxes at a rate which is greater than inflation. An increase in diesel taxes will simply raise trucking and transport costs, especially for the transport of food.

Senator Patterson interjecting—

—We all know where this is travelling, as Senator Patterson notes. Labor’s taxes will slug consumers with higher prices at the checkout. Labor’s tax-and-spend budget will hurt more hardworking Australians than it will help.
Another very tenuous position that the government have taken in the budget is to double the threshold before the Medicare surcharge comes in. An unwelcome consequence of this action, as people are now beginning to talk about very vociferously, is that health insurance premiums will increase. Furthermore, this will cause people to leave the private system and move to the public system. More pressure in the public system will lead to increased outlays as well as higher health insurance premiums for those who remain in private health funds. That equals more inflation overall, not less. Again, Labor’s tax policies will punish the people of Australia, because they will only act to fuel inflation. The people of Australia will be slugged with the increased public hospital outlays as well as higher prices.
We have often been lectured by Labor since they got into government that these tax cuts will increase workforce participation. Increasing workforce participation is of course something to aim for. It is a worthy objective that I think all governments should aspire to. That is why we devised the tax cuts in the first place—the tax cuts which Labor have now copied.
Tax cuts can help reduce inflation by encouraging workers to increase their skills and discouraging excessive wage claims. Treasury modelling indicates the coalition’s tax cuts since 2000 have increased the labour force by around 250,000, yet Labor have flagged that this will be the last round of tax cuts for some time. This leads one to ask: if the major tax cuts from the 2007 election campaign reduce inflation by promoting participation, encouraging skill development and keeping wage pressures under control, doesn’t that argument also apply for future tax cuts? I think we can glean from just these measures alone that Labor appears to be totally confused, with a budget that will deliver higher taxes, higher spending and an increase in unemployment to the tune of up to 124,000 fewer people in jobs. As one might say: go figure.
Australian families deserve these tax cuts—and I want to be very clear about that—because they have worked hard and they have earned them. The coalition proudly supports hardworking Australians keeping more of their own money. We strongly believe that, after all necessary expenditure to adequately fund government programs, ensure good government and maintain a surplus, any excess money should be returned to the people who earned it, rather than kept in government coffers. This is underpinned by our core belief that Australians know better than government how to spend their own money. The former coalition government had a very strong record on taxes and the economy, which I am quite sure will be borne out when history is written about this time in our country.
Whilst those in government have chosen to try to recast and rewrite the past, the simple fact is that the previous coalition government was very successful in implementing tax reform and reducing the personal income tax burden on working Australians. The coalition’s careful and skilful management of Australia’s $1.1 trillion economy enabled the government to pay off Labor’s $96 billion debt and convert Labor’s $10 billion deficit into a $14 billion surplus at the same time as giving tax relief to all Australians at all income levels.
A look at last year’s budget papers reveals the truth about personal tax cuts. Under the coalition, a tax burden shared by working Australian families dropped in real terms. In 1996-97 personal income tax receipts were 12.4 per cent of GDP. This was the legacy that the coalition government inherited from Labor. This financial year, the personal income tax burden is projected to decline to 10.9 per cent of GDP. Measures from the tax policy that the coalition formulated and announced at the last election—details that have of course been now plagiarised and copied by the government—are implemented by the passage of this bill. The estimated tax burden for individuals is expected to decline to 10.1 per cent next financial year. Even from opposition, I contend, the coalition is still leading the way in the area of taxation reform. The shadow Treasurer, Mr Turnbull, has announced a review of the entire taxation system so that we can come up with the best and most efficient taxation system for our modern economy. We believe that you cannot have meaningful taxation reform without a reduction in the tax burden. Labor, however, appear to be up to their old tricks and have subsequently copied the coalition by announcing their own review. The problem for them, I think, is that they have asked Treasury to run the review. I have a lot of respect for Treasury—I have worked very closely with them—but what this effectively means is that Treasury is tasked with reviewing itself, which is never a healthy way to conduct a review of this scale and scope.
Labor’s addiction to spin has no bounds. Their copycat review is supposed to be a root and branch review of the tax system, but somehow or other it will not be reviewing very important areas, such as the GST. You cannot have a root and branch review when it does not even consider reform of the GST. I really believe that, unlike the coalition, Labor are still trying to follow the leader in this area because they have no strategic taxation agenda and no strategic framework for this review. I think it has been the case for many years now and I think that the country will be the poorer for it.
I very much support the tax cuts in this bill and I think that I have said enough about how these have effectively been cuts that the coalition devised. I am very pleased to see that these benefits will be passed through to the people of Australia but I also think that it is appropriate, when we look at the budget that was handed down, that we put it in context. The 2008 federal budget has, I believe, let Australians down. It is a very typical Labor budget—let us be clear about it: it increases taxes, massively increases spending, plays the politics of envy and, I think, shows that they do not know what they are doing in running the economy going forward. It is a budget of confusion and contradictions. It is a budget that confirms that Labor has no really clear idea about how to deal with the economic challenges facing Australia, particularly inflation, which is what they said they were trying to address.
I think that it shows that the Treasurer is still struggling to find how he is going to take this economy forward. He claimed that the budget would ease the pressure on inflation and honour Labor’s election commitments to families, but he has failed his first test, in delivering what is unequivocally an expansionary budget.
The budget will do nothing to meet Labor’s promises to keep grocery prices, petrol prices and home interest rates down. For that alone, Labor are to be condemned. They ran around promising that that was what they would do and, search though you may, in the budget there is precious little indication of any ability to do any such thing. I think Australians can take very cold comfort from Labor’s decision to raise taxes on cars, alcohol—for the sake of it but trying to dress it up as some measure to address a problem, which we all think is a significant problem, only this is hardly a way to deal with it—energy, computer software, fringe benefits, passenger movements, passports and visa applications and to increase the cost of private health insurance. I think Mr Swan’s first budget will be remembered very much as a taxing budget. It confirms Labor stands for higher taxes, and this of course will put upward pressure on inflation.
I think it is fair to continue to say from the opposition’s point of view that Labor was indeed left with a strong economy which had a key strategy to keep the economy growing and to keep inflation under control over the longer term. In contrast, it is also fair to characterise Labor’s budget as a political grab bag, not an economic strategy going forward, and I do think Australians deserve better than that. However, what concerns me very much is that unemployment will increase as a result of this budget, with Treasury forecasts showing 134,000 fewer people in jobs. That is a very shameful outcome for the first Labor budget. Despite all the rhetoric about education revolutions and lifting productivity, the participation rate in the workforce is actually forecast by Treasury to fall.
When it comes to the various investment funds on infrastructure, education and health—also, of course, copied from the coalition—there is an appalling lack of detail, with absolutely no explanation of what criteria will be used for the administration and expenditure of billions of dollars of taxpayers’ money withheld from them and retained for some purpose without any detail as to what it will be. And, of course, there is absolutely nothing to tell Australians how this will actually address the infrastructure bottlenecks. Are these funds going to be accessed in the short term? If they are, that is going to put a lot of pressure on inflation. If in fact they are not going to be accessed in the short term, then of course they are not dealing with the problems that have been identified in infrastructure. Labor has made absolutely no attempt to reconcile these contradictions in its approach to these investment funds.
The bottom line is that Labor have not kept their election promises. The Labor government promised not to touch private health insurance, but they are gutting it. The Labor government promised to leave the baby bonus alone, but they are in effect slashing it. Labor promised not to increase taxes, but taxes have gone up. It is very disappointing, and I think it confirms what Mr Garrett said in an unguarded moment before the election: ‘Once we get in, we’ll just change it all.’ The proof of that is well and truly seen in the budget. After promising so much before the election, Labor have let Australians down.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (PERSONAL INCOME TAX REDUCTION) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2008-05-15,"—Before I move to the substance of my remarks in the second reading debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2008, I ask to table a document. I circulated with my amendments to this bill an explanatory note, but the Senate officers have advised me that I have to table that explanatory note, so I seek permission to table it.
 (Senator Mark Bishop)—Are you seeking leave to table a document, Senator Murray?
—The explanatory note to my amendments—yes, I am.
—Is leave granted?
—Almost certainly yes, but I have not seen it, so—
—Perhaps the attendants could take it to the two sides. I had assumed it happened automatically, but I was wrong.
—We will ask an attendant to deliver it to both the whips.
—Thank you. I now turn to my remarks on the second reading. Perhaps, at the end of them, both sides could indicate if it is acceptable to table the document.
—Yes.
—To approach this bill, which has a very substantial price tag of tens of billions of dollars attached to it, I think you need to look at it from three perspectives. Firstly, does the bill represent good income tax policy? Secondly, what is the opportunity cost of spending this money in this way? Thirdly, how does this bill contribute to the needs of fiscal policy?
Dealing with income tax policy first, the Democrats have long had a view that what is needed with respect to income tax policy is not strategic reform but structural reform. We long criticised the coalition when they were in government for not having such a plan. I want to use the opportunity of these remarks to stress to the new Labor government that, in their own review and their own decisions about tax, they need to present to the Australian people a structural plan, not just a strategic plan.
The Democrats have five pillars attached to our taxation reform plan. We believe there should be a comprehensive structural overhaul that fosters the development of a modern civil society, stimulates growth, competition, jobs and investment and is equitable, efficient and inclusive. Our five-pillars agenda for income taxation reform focuses on, firstly, raising the tax-free threshold—this bill does not do that. Secondly, it focuses on indexing tax thresholds—this bill does not do that. Thirdly, it focuses on broadening the taxation base—this bill does not do that, but that is done to a degree in the budget. It focuses, fourthly, on reviewing and addressing negative tax-welfare interactions. Fifthly, it focuses on lowering taxation rates and raising taxation thresholds, which this bill does address.
Unless you have a structural view of income taxation, you cannot properly address the way in which the system operates. At the moment, it is complex and it is highly inefficient due to significant churning effects and unnecessary tax concessions. We think the purpose of income tax policy should be to fall within overall tax objectives of improving measures of equity, simplicity and efficiency within the Australian taxation system. As I say, the bill does address the issue of lowering taxation rates and raising taxation thresholds, but, unless you index to inflation your tax thresholds, in the end whatever changes are made in a bill like this are eroded over time as the value of money falls. That has been a fundamental weakness of our income tax system and remains a fundamental weakness of our income tax system. I note the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry continues, along with many other peak groups, to advocate the indexing of tax rate thresholds. It is a bullet that needs to be bitten.
The second area of interest with respect to the broad policy issues that surround this bill is the opportunity cost issue. The bill itself captures forward estimates—I think, with respect to income tax changes already established through the 2007-08 budget and those that are proposed through this bill—which over the next three years will be another $57 billion of expenditure. When you are spending that amount of money, you say to yourselves: ‘Could you spend that better elsewhere?’ And the answer is: you always can because you always have alternatives that others suggest.
I note, for instance, the Australian Greens take the view that you would be better off not passing these income tax reductions and using the money for the community in different ways. I have noticed surveys over time which have indicated that many Australians—a very substantial portion of Australians—believe that improving services should come ahead of these tax reductions. The Democrats do not take that view. We take the view that a substantial slice of the income tax changes is necessary, particularly for low- and middle-income Australians. We take the view that it is necessary from two perspectives. The first is from a perspective of catch-up. Because the value of money has been eroded by inflation over time, you are restoring people, to some extent, to where they would have been if not for inflation. The second reason we support it is we think the disposable income of low- and middle-income Australians needs to be increased in order to allow them to advance their living standards in a way which keeps the equity and inclusiveness characteristics of Australian society. We do not think it is an either/or situation—that none of this money should be given to Australians and it should all go back into services—but we do not think, either, that all the personal income tax reduction is warranted. That is the opportunity cost argument, and it is always an interesting and difficult decision to make as to what you give up because you are spending it in this particular way.
The third area is fiscal policy. With respect to this bill, the government fails. It does not fail because of what it is doing in this bill; it fails because of what it is doing in the budget. If the intention is to fight inflation, you have to ask, ‘Where do inflationary pressures come from?’ There are exogenous pressures, about which the government can do very little. Those exogenous pressures obviously relate to such high inflationary impact items as the increase in the cost of energy, petroleum fuels in particular, increases in the costs of things like foods as they are rising elsewhere in the world and increases in the cost of money. The cost of money has risen very substantially, even without regard to the Reserve Bank interest rate increases, essentially because of international events. That cost of money flows through, of course, to the price of goods and services. Australians can do very little about those exogenous or external events and simply have to wear them in an inflationary sense.
The other side is endogenous—those things which are domestically based and domestically caused. Principally, the problem has been identified as supply side, not demand side so much. Of course, you do need to address demand in the sense of dampening consumer demand, and that is what the Reserve Bank has been trying to do in its blunt way. But primarily you can see the examples of supply side effects in the recent wage increase figures. For instance, the recent figures I saw—if my memory is correct—for Western Australia showed wage increases of 5.9 per cent, principally from the mining sector effects, and elsewhere in Australia as low as three per cent. That clearly shows a supply problem in WA, and not as much elsewhere.
If you go to somewhere like the Pilbara, you would see that people are being compensated in terms of wage costs and businesses are being compensated for the difficulties in business activity there, all of which induces higher prices, because of a failure to invest in two areas: hard infrastructure and social infrastructure. People want to be compensated for the fact that they have to live in dongas, which are converted containers, or sleep in the back of their cars or sleep in caravan parks and so on. I note with some concern that the government has just sucked another $2½ billion, I think, out of the Pilbara companies and others with its ending of the condensate concession. I do not condemn the ending of the condensate concession. My concern is, having sucked that $2½ billion out, that I want to see you put $1 billion back into our social infrastructure—into our housing and our amenities for our communities up in the Pilbara and elsewhere. By all means, change the condensate policy—I think it is a good change; I support the change—but what are you going to do with the money? The problem is you are not spending it in the supply side area, which would actually reduce the inflationary pressures. What you are doing is quarantining that money. You are leaving for another day the expenditure in the very areas where you would reduce the supply price pressures.
I think there is a problem with the fiscal policy settings in your budget. You have got real growth. You are not reducing aggregate demand. There is over one per cent real growth, in other words, ahead of inflation. From a consumer perspective, you are not making the budget aggregate demand neutral. You are in fact adding slightly to inflationary pressures at the consumer side and with respect to the capital side you are quarantining investment which could actually reduce supply pressures. That is an economist’s perspective from me, but I think it should be a legitimate concern in examining the effects of this budget.
Turning specifically to the provisions of the bill—as you are well aware and hopefully my explanatory note makes this even clearer—you are affecting a number of settings at the threshold rates level and moving the thresholds themselves. The sense of things is that lower income Australians will see a shift in the 15 per cent rate, which currently ends at the $30,000 threshold level, so that it ends at the $34,000 threshold level. It is an excellent change and one I and my party support. At the 30 per cent level, the threshold shifts to $80,000 from $75,000. From the perspective of middle-income Australians, the Democrats think that is a good idea. What we do not think is a good idea is the proposed shift to $180,000 for high-income Australians. There is no credible economic or social policy reason for that to occur. That is the first criticism I would set.
Another thing the government has done—and its effect is good but I am not convinced that the policy is the best one—is to introduce changes that increase the maximum amount of low-income tax offset. That will shift from $750 to $1,200 from 1 July 2008, then lift to $1,350 from 1 July 2009 and finally lift to $1,500 from 1 July 2010. The effect of this is that those eligible for what is known as LITO—that is, low-income tax offset—will not incur a net income tax liability until their annual income exceeds $14,000, and this grows to $16,000 by 1 July 2010. It is a good idea in its effect. The Democrats actually support a tax-free threshold around $20,000, below which people do not pay tax. If you did that, you would take a huge swag of people out of the income tax system—I might say that 85 per cent of them are women in part-time and casual work. You would not have to have them involved with all the compliance activities or have the Taxation Office involved with all the compliance activities and costs that surround that.
Unfortunately, the LITO system means that instead of using a tax-free threshold device so that you exclude up to two million Australians from having to put in tax returns, you force all these people to put in tax returns, to go to tax agents, to make work related tax deductions of well over $1½ billion, maybe more, and to be in this system. So the intent is right—give low-income people an ability not to have to pay tax up to $16,000 by 1 July 2010 with respect to this bill—but the method is a churning method. It is complex, inefficient and wrong. Good intent; bad process. Senior Australians also do well. Their tax offset, which is known as SATO, will lift from $28,867 for a single person on 1 July 2008 to $30,685 by 1 July 2010, and for couples from $24,680 from 1 July 2008 to $26,680 from 1 July 2010.
With respect to these tax cuts the Treasurer made a number of points. He said Labor had promised specific tax cuts and he is keeping his promises. That is terrific, but I have already noticed a number of promises that have not been kept and sometimes for good reason. You cannot keep every promise. For instance, I think cutting the cut-off point for wealthy welfare benefits from $250,000 to $150,000 is a broken promise and I am glad you have broken it. It is a good idea. You do not always have to keep your promises, but it is important that you keep your most important promises. I am not going to criticise the government for doing that. Although I think, in view of the fiscal emergency of inflation that the government talks about, it could well have not needed to deliver the high-income tax cuts.
Secondly, the Treasurer says these tax cuts give necessary relief to working families. Every time I hear that phrase I want to scream. I want to know what defines ‘working families’. It is not a phrase that connotes wealthy Australians and there are a whole lot of families who are worth a lot to me and who are not working. Think of old people; they are families. ‘Working families’ excludes them. It is a horrible phrase. Thirdly, he says tax cuts will ease pressure on wage claims. I think he is right in that respect. At the lower end I think it does relieve those pressures. Fourthly, he says these tax cuts improve workforce participation. Yes, he is right, especially in the low-income area and in the middle-income area. At the upper-income area he is absolutely wrong. It will do zip, zero and nothing to support the cause of workforce participation for high-income Australians. You are just giving them tax cuts at that level because the coalition are their mates. It was their idea and you are just following on. That policy is stupid, unnecessary and wrong.
The idea that wage claims will be influenced above the $75,000 to $80,000 threshold is fanciful. The idea that workforce participation will be enhanced above that level is unlikely, and I say to you that the Reserve Bank will raise rates again if aggregate demand increases to levels it regards as threatening. Tax cuts increase aggregate demand, so you should be cancelling or deferring non-essential tax cuts. That means cancelling or deferring those at the upper end. The conclusion I have is that there is merit in accepting the LITO and lower income tax changes.
 (Senator Mark Bishop)—Senator Murray, your time has expired. Are you still seeking leave to table a document?
—I am. I seek leave to table the explanatory note to the amendments that I have provided both sides with.
Leave granted.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (PERSONAL INCOME TAX REDUCTION) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1
"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2008-05-15,"—It gives me great pleasure to support the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2008. It is a fulfilment of an election commitment by the Rudd Labor government. That commitment was a fundamental part of our policy at the election and is now fulfilled with this bill. Senator Murray has correctly identified problems that arise with inflation in this country, inflation that is initiated by world events and, to some extent, domestic events. There certainly is some risk that inflation, which has continued to rise since the election period, will fuel demand and that will in turn fuel inflation in this country. Inflation is now at a level which has alarmed the Reserve Bank of Australia. It is very important to fight the effects of inflation. It has a very pernicious effect on households and businesses and our economy. It is a primary goal of the Rudd Labor government to maintain downward pressure on inflation.
In that context, this bill, as Senator Murray has correctly said, does not assist that process but does not create an unusual level of demand to fuel inflation. That is because the government’s budget has tightened monetary policy to restrict demand in the country. It is this balancing act which the Treasurer, Mr Swan, has talked about constantly and which clearly the Liberals, and Senator Coonan in particular, have not quite grasped. They continue to deny the effects of inflation and deny the effects of the previous government’s policy on inflation. They continued to drive up inflation with their spending. The way that they used their surpluses drove up inflation. The way that they did not use the surpluses for infrastructure, skills development and productivity meant that there was no amelioration of that inflation trend. Clearly the Liberals still do not understand that balancing effort that the current government is faced with.
Senator Murray is clearly concerned about the inflationary aspects of this bill, but we must remember that the world economic outlook is also very uncertain. There is a great deal of uncertainty in the United States of America and in Europe, while nevertheless China and India and other economies continue to grow. It may be that Australian consumer confidence and Australians’ ability to cope needs to be boosted a little by measures such as these, by small measures such as providing increased spending power in the form of the tax cuts people will get as a result of this bill. There is this balance between putting too much of a brake on the economy through too tough fiscal policy and letting the economy continue to grow. The Treasurer has very neatly balanced the competing demands in both this bill and the budget generally. It is a pity that the opposition has still not come to terms with this fundamental requirement.
Senator Coonan continues to talk about no strategic framework of this government, but it is in fact the failure by the former government to have a strategic framework that has created this difficulty in our economy. It was the former government, which had zero productivity growth through its last years and zero attention to skills development, that caused a lot of the bottlenecks in our economy that we are now having to face. Senator Coonan did nothing in her response today to show that the opposition now has any plan to address those particular problems. Indeed, it seems only determined to oppose what the government is doing to address them.
The budget does indeed address aspects of skills development, jobs development and, in particular, participation. It is this aspect of this bill that I am particularly pleased to see, because the government has a strategy to bring together aspects of job participation such as child care and incentives to work. This is one area where I differ from Senator Murray. The government’s policy differs from the previous government’s proposal for tax cuts in that it has directed tax cuts towards the lower end of income levels, such that it now does make sense for people at lower income levels to undertake more work or to undertake work at all.
Several other measures in the budget contribute to that so that we should have more people working and more people working more hours. The budget removes some of the financial disincentives to do that through taxation and also assists by measures such as child care. There is an estimate by Treasury of 65,000 more workers entering the workforce through these measures. That is certainly welcomed because, wherever you go in this country, wherever you talk to anyone in business, you hear the constant refrain that there is not only a skills shortage but a shortage of workers generally, so we really do need to encourage people to get back into the workforce and to get back to work.
It is here that the low-income tax offset is also important, and it is pleasing to see that it will grow progressively from $750 to $1,500 by 2010. It is indeed an important measure to improve income for low-income taxpayers. There are queries about its efficiency, whether it encourages income splitting and whether people who are engaged in non-productive work like investments benefit from it at the expense of other workers. I am sure that that will form part of the general review of the taxation system that has been flagged by the Rudd Labor government.
I am also sure that the Rudd Labor government will look at the still high effective rates of marginal tax that are paid by many workers in the low-income area who are juggling family tax benefits and other government assistance for families with their job income. There is still a great deal to be done in that area, and I expect that more will be done to help those people—who are now called ‘working families’ but are perhaps families that want to work more or want to work more effectively while juggling with family responsibilities—so that the country is more productive and makes better use of the workers that it has in its workforce. The government has set up a very good strategic framework and has just begun on the path to resetting the taxation, welfare and benefits system of Australia so that it is fairer, more efficient and easier for Australians to navigate.
Senator Coonan also talked about other aspects of the government’s budget and about increases in consumer items for Australians in the budget—as if it were competing with this, as if people would be spending their tax cuts on consumer items that were being increasingly taxed by the government. I think she is on very shaky ground when the most substantial examples of this that she can come up with are the alcopop tax and that on luxury vehicles. Some of the Liberal opposition must be living in a very rarefied world if they think that people with a large number of children will generally go and buy luxury cars, cars over $60,000, so that they can move their children in safety and comfort. She needs to know that most families cannot afford anything like that to move their children around. Senator Coonan is also on very shaky ground when she talks about the disincentives for consuming alcopops and the new tax on those. Surely if the opposition are going to find an example to oppose this budget on, if they are serious, they can find a better example than the taxation on alcopops. Surely that is not a fundamental part of most families’ consumption patterns; that they cannot withstand an increase in taxation on mixed drinks. Senator Coonan has indicated support for the bill and opposition to some aspects of the budget, but the aspects of the budget that she opposes do not seem to make a great deal of sense, quite frankly.
To return briefly to the effects of the bill and where we might be going from now, on the Senate Standing Committee on Economics that looked at this bill we also had some discussion about the inflationary aspects of giving tax reductions to the population and how money might be more effectively spent. We addressed the concept of those tax cuts being put into superannuation on an optional basis so that families who were struggling and needed the extra money to pay additional interest rates and costs could accept the money from tax cuts but other families, those who were perhaps not struggling quite as much, could choose to put their tax cuts into their superannuation. I think that this is a very worthy scheme. It was principally proposed by Dr Nicholas Gruen, an economist, and it certainly makes a great deal of sense. There are a number of people in our community who need a bit of catch-up with the level of their superannuation. The compulsory superannuation guarantee is still at only nine per cent, and there are people who need to contribute more to their superannuation. I am thinking particularly of those in the 40-plus age group. This could have been an ideal opportunity for them to say, ‘We are managing as it is; we can afford to put the extra money straight into our superannuation.’ I would certainly recommend that to the government as a scheme worthy of further consideration.
In closing, I again commend the bill to the Senate. It is a very timely bill. It is part of that balance between allowing people to keep up with costs and reducing the impetus for any wage growth, while not unduly depressing the economy in Australia. It keeps us flexible for any external influences from the world system. There seems to be very little doubt that the international economy, and, in particular the economies of the United States and Europe, will be further depressed in the coming year. We do need to guard against coming down too hard on our economy and depressing any growth at all. This is a worthy part of the Labor government’s strategy, and I am very pleased to support the bill.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (PERSONAL INCOME TAX REDUCTION) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2008-05-15,"—The Australian Greens oppose the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2008. Let me quote from Dr Peter Rischbieth of the Rural Doctors Association of Australia on budget night, who said:
At the end of the day, the Government can’t say it doesn’t know how bad the rural health crisis is—we have repeated over and over again that an additional 16,000 health professionals are needed in the bush, including an additional 1000 rural doctors (and probably now an additional 1500 doctors based on the Government’s own audit).
The fact is that, even in the 21st century, rural Australians:
can expect to die younger than their urban counterparts
continue to suffer from much worse health outcomes and difficulties in accessing treatment
continue to suffer from reduced access to health services because of a huge shortfall of healthcare funding compared with those living in the cities.
We know, from the Australian Medical Association and other studies, that $500 to $600 million per year is required for health services for Indigenous communities. The great task, which the government has said it is taking on, of eliminating the 17-year life-expectancy gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians is not being undertaken at a serious level in this budget.
The Australian pensioners have been left stuck, with no increase in the base pension of $273 per week. The Greens have been campaigning for a long time now to get that raised by between $30 and $100. The government has some one-off payments, but the pensioner community—over one million pensioners in Australia, who have been the working families in this country for the last half-century and who have given us the Australia that we have, one of the wealthiest nations on earth—are living in poverty. They were ignored by the budget on Tuesday night.
The tax cuts that we are dealing with here are largely servicing the wealthy. As Senator Murray pointed out, three-quarters of the tax cuts will go to people on more than $34,000 a year—and, of course, the wealthier you are, the better off you will be with these tax cuts. Had these tax cuts been diverted to pensioners, they could have got the sort of increase that the Greens have been campaigning for. As it is, pensioners have not had any real growth in income since 1993 or thereabouts. There was the drought of the Howard years for pensioners, and that drought has kept going now under the first Rudd-Swan budget.
I cannot understand why pensioners have been ignored while tax cuts for the rich have risen to the top of the flagpole under this social democrat government’s first budget. Of course, I was very alert to the election campaign last year, when then Prime Minister John Howard announced in the first week of that campaign that he was going to have over $30 billion in tax cuts. The press gallery went into overdrive, saying that Labor had to respond to this. You can remember the days ticking by, and there must have been very, very intense negotiations in the Labor camp, in Mr Rudd’s office, during that week.
The outcome was that by Friday Labor announced that it was going to follow suit. It was going to back the conservative Howard government’s tax concessions to the wealthy, and that commitment is what we have before us in the Senate today. It is manifestly unfair, it is inflationary and it has to starve funds from this country’s ability to adequately fund hospitals, the health service, the public school system, fast and efficient public transport and the great challenge we have to address climate change in 2008. But if we have to pour money—and it is a cash-rich period for governments—into infrastructure for the nation, for the benefit of all the people, why have these tax cuts which are loaded to the wealthy? It is the wrong way to go, it is unfair, it is socially regressive and it fails every test of nation building that we would have expected of a new government. Let us look at one of the alternatives that could have been undertaken here, beyond our priority of giving pensioners a fair go—and I would add, of course, carers, who have got very meagre returns from this budget as well.
If we move to climate change, the government has flopped on its high duty to address climate change and make that a priority in this first budget. Instead, much of what is going to address climate change—and even on the government’s own figures it is something between $2 billion and $3 billion; it is less than a 10th of these tax cuts over the coming four years—is going to the coal industry. These megawealthy largely overseas owned corporations ought to be investing in so-called clean coal—this chimera, this entity that does not exist and that even the coal industry says will not exist for the next decade or two. It cannot help meet the international scientists’ call for a rapid response to climate change that will see greenhouse gas emissions from the planet, instead of increasing, falling within five years. If we do not do that, we face catastrophic climate change with temperatures rising more than two degrees Celsius globally, with massive consequences for economies, society and the environment.
I add here: every day we pick up the latest scientific information on climate change—as in today’s newspapers, the impact on biodiversity. It is much worse than previously thought, and there is one consistent trend with the analysis on climate change around the world. Each analysis says: ‘This is worse than we thought it was before.’ But this government has got its head stuck in the sand. Incredibly, in the budget it cuts $200 million over four years out of the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts. Presumably, that is part of the sacking of some 3,300 jobs out of the Public Service—the government says it is 1,200 or 1,500; whatever it is—the sacking of many hundreds or thousands of breadwinners for so-called working families. They have been spiked by Labor up-front. Some of that will come out of the department of the environment. Where that money is going to we do not know—$50 million is going to be redistributed at $12.5 million a year to the new climate change unit, but it is small change compared to the $31 billion in tax cuts we are looking at here. If you combine that with the last budget, the Howard-Costello budget tax cuts, we are looking at no less than an astonishing $57 billion in tax cuts over the coming prescribed years.
Was it too difficult for this government to adopt the Greens’ proposal brought forward to the Senate by Senator Milne that over the coming 10 years every single house in Australia be retrofitted for climate change with renewable energy, with solar power or alternative renewable energy—a solar hot-water system or alternative heating from renewable energy and retrofitting with insulation? These things create jobs and stimulate the economy but cut greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power stations. Was that too difficult when that program, through cutting power bills for people—some of which they returned to government—would in the long run be cost neutral? The government could not come at it. Instead, it is going to try this program for 200,000 households over the coming five years. That is three per cent effort compared with what the Greens were proposing.
I do not know what has happened to Ministers Garrett and Wong, but they have failed to impress the economic conservative Prime Minister and his Treasurer. They have failed to get their message to a Prime Minister who says, ‘I have as a priority climate change.’ No, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, you do not have it as a priority. You have dismissed it and relegated it to an insignificant other in this budget. And, by the way, what has happened to the rhetoric of Labor in terms of supporting research and development and science in this country? There are smart remarks coming from the Labor benches at the moment, but I will ask somebody from Labor to get up and justify the $69 million cut to the CSIRO—$69 million, and we have got $31 billion going to tax cuts, specifically benefiting the big end of town. Labor, my foot! Social democrats, my foot! This is a conservative government presenting a conservative budget to please the lobbyists, who dominate this parliament and the political process, the corporate sector and the already wealthy.
I have to canvass many more knowledgeable people than me on the prospect of inflation. The speaker before me said it is not going to be inflationary. Yes, it is. We all know that, and every Labor person knows that, including the Treasurer. You cannot be injecting over three or four years $57 billion into tax cuts—and remember Labor supported those cuts last year; the Greens opposed it but Labor did not—without creating inflationary pressure. The alternative, of course, is to have massive cutbacks in public spending, and the government has not shown it is willing to do that, nor should it be. So this fact does emerge, and I agree with the opposition completely on this: if we do get further interest rate rises—and they will really hit the working families that Labor attributes so much to—they will be squarely on the shoulders of Prime Minister Rudd and Treasurer Swan. The inflationary process is being fuelled by these tax cuts, which come out of this legislation here today.
I want to go back to look at the cruel disparity between the commitment Labor is making to pensioners and the commitment it is making to the already wealthy people who are on big incomes. It says these are tax cuts across the board. They are not; they are highly loaded towards the big end of town. Next year, for example, if you are on $30,000 you will get $11.54 per week in tax cuts—hardly enough to pay for the rapidly increasing fuel costs in this country. However, if you are on $300,000 you will get $91.35 per week in tax cuts.
I heard a Labor interjector during the week say, ‘Yes, but the disparity gets better as you go further on.’ Let’s look at the year 2010-11. If you are on $30,000 then you will be getting an extra $14.42 per week, but if you are on $300,000 you will be getting an extra $116.35. In other words, the further we go under this tax cut program, the bigger the disparity between the rich and the poor.
When you go across to pensioners you find that they get zero. They are not on an increase of $11 or $14 a week. By crikey, they could use it but they are not going to get it. Instead of that they languish at the poverty line. Let me quote from a single age pensioner who wrote to me about this matter last year. In anticipation that there would be a change of government, she was very hopeful that she would get a better response. She wrote:
I have written to the spokesmen of the Government and the Labor Opposition regarding the poverty in which Single People, who are solely reliant upon a Single Age Pension, are existing.
I have not yet had a response from the Opposition—
that is the Labor Party—
and the response from the Government was not at all sympathetic and, I considered, rather high-handed.
I wonder how the Members of Parliament, or their Advisers would manage to live on the sum of $530.90 per fortnight (this includes $5.80 Pharmaceutical Allowance) which is reported to be 20% below the Poverty Line and less than half the Basic Wage.
For your information I am enclosing my fortnightly Income and Expenses Budget. I live as frugally as I can, cook all my own meals. I rarely buy prepackaged food, and cannot eat take-aways, having had surgery for Bowel Cancer.
You will note that this statement does not cover Dental Care. I and many others are going to spend the $500 Special Grant given by the Government in July on Private dental care—
We can bring that up to date. Another $500 has been given by this government—no difference.
because of the long waiting time for Public dental care—some areas are waiting for years.
I know the Government—
she is talking here about the Howard government—
has said that it will expedite dental care for pensioners with serious illnesses. This is putting the cart before the horse, because many people I know personally are suffering serious health problems due to the lack of dental care.
I am 83 years of age and a “little l” Liberal who is looking to change my vote at the coming election. I feel that I may not look further.
To me, as a Green advocating an increase in the pension, she says:
Thank you again for advocacy for a large but fairly voiceless part of the Australian population.
She provided her budget, including such things as canned fish, paper products, household cleaners, coffee, tea and sugar—right down to the last cent. In a sentence amongst all this she says she puts aside for birthdays and Christmas gifts, 12 at $40 each, a rather hopeful $480. Savings for car service, the gap payment for specialist medical treatment, repairs to the refrigerator, TV, washing machine or dryer, and donations to churches and charities are all under a question mark. Holidays, outings and clothes are not provided for.
In effect, pensioners are living in very tough times. I reiterate: these are the working families who have made Australia the wealthy nation that it is. They have helped get us to the point where we have a Treasury swimming in money, a budget surplus that is unprecedented in Australian history, yet we have a miserly attitude to one million to two million pensioners and carers in this country which leaves me speechless. I would have thought, as did that pensioner—she was intending to change her vote, as you heard—that the advent of a Labor government would have brought some relief for pensioners, but they have been dudded by Labor.
This is a matter that the Greens intend to continue to campaign strongly for. Let me tell the government, it is not going to go away. There is no way that we will support the legislation for these tax cuts when pensioners are left out in the cold, struggling day by day simply to make ends meet. There is no way we are going to support massive cash injections, effectively, into the realm of the already wealthy while the poverty stricken remain as they are, unheeded by this government. I foreshadow Greens amendments as circulated.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2008-05-15,"—I would like to thank all senators who have taken part in the debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2008. The measures contained in this bill honour the government’s election commitment to cut personal income tax for all Australian taxpayers from 1 July 2008. It implements important taxation reform, championed by the government, to position the economy for continued growth. The tax changes in the bill are fiscally responsible. They are designed to enhance individual incentives and workforce participation and productivity, particularly for part-time workers and secondary earners. This will lift the supply capacity of the economy. Ultimately it will help to fight inflation and prepare Australia for its future economic challenges.
Chronic labour and skill shortages are reported regularly by business as major constraints on business expansion. These in turn put pressure on wages and inflation. Effectively dealing with inflation requires strategies that both tackle skill shortages and lift workforce participation. The tax cuts are a key component of the government’s five-point plan to fight inflation. The five-point plan to fight inflation also involves fiscal restraint, encouraging savings and tackling skill shortages and infrastructure bottlenecks. It is anticipated that the tax cuts will over time result in an additional 2.5 million hours of work being added to the economy each week and that this will generate approximately 65,000 additional people in the workforce.
By increasing the disposable income of households, these tax cuts will provide much needed relief for working families. In particular they will assist households to retire debt and repair the household balance sheets. This government trusts Australian working families to know how best to use the tax cuts. They are in the best position to decide how to balance the household budget prudently and will be in a better position to do that as a result of these tax cuts.
The tax cuts will be progressively phased in, taking effect in three stages: from 1 July 2008, from 1 July 2009 and from 1 July 2010. The measures to take effect in the first year focus on taxpayers—particularly part-time and secondary income earners—with the greatest labour supply response. The tax changes in this bill include increases in the 30 per cent marginal tax rate and its thresholds, a reduction in the 40 per cent marginal tax rate and increases in the low-income tax offset. The 30 per cent threshold will increase from $30,001 in 2007-08 to an eventual level of $37,001 on 1 July 2010, with the first increase in the threshold being to $34,001 from 1 July 2008. This means that the 15 per cent marginal tax rate will apply up to and including $34,000 of income in 2008-09. In addition, the 40 per cent marginal tax rate will be reduced from 1 July 2009 to 38 per cent and further to 37 per cent from 1 July 2010.
These changes are the first stage in the government’s plans to flatten Australia’s personal income tax scales to 15 per cent, 30 per cent and 40 per cent. This bill increases the amount of the low income tax offset over three years, from $750 in the 2007-08 income year to a level of $1,500 from 1 July 2010, with the first increase to $1,200 taking effect from 1 July 2008. This offset will continue to phase out from $30,000. Therefore, from 1 July 2008 those eligible for the full low-income tax offset will not incur a net income tax liability until their annual income exceeds $14,000. This will increase to $15,000 from 1 July 2009 and to $16,000 from 1 July 2010. These changes are in line with the government’s longer term plan to provide a more generous low-income tax offset, delivering an effective tax-free threshold of $20,000 to low-income earners. Importantly and for the first time, from 1 July 2008 eligible taxpayers will receive half of the benefits of this offset to their regular pay. This will allow people to realise sooner the benefits of working more.
As a result of the increase in the low-income tax offset, from 1 July 2008 senior Australians eligible for the senior Australian tax offset will be able to earn more income before they are liable to pay income tax. From 1 July 2008, eligible senior Australians will not pay tax on their annual income—up to $28,867 for singles and up to $24,680 for each member of a couple. Further, increases to these thresholds will apply from 1 July 2009 and 1 July 2010. This package will enhance workforce participation, which is a vital component of the government’s five-point plan to tackle inflation. These tax cuts will also reward the hard work of Australians whose efforts are so critical to keeping the economy strong.
To sum up, this bill delivers on the government’s election commitment. It provides significant reductions in taxes that will help relieve cost of living pressures and will enhance incentives for workforce participation and skill formation. In this context, I note that in recommending that this bill be passed the Senate Standing Committee on Economics noted in its report on 1 May 2008:
There is a strong case for Australian working families to receive the promised tax cuts to assist them in dealing with financial pressures.
All Australian taxpayers will share in the tax cuts, but importantly the tax cuts will tip the balance in favour of middle- and low-income earners, especially parents returning to work. I again thank senators who have participated in the debate. I commend the bill to the Senate. Senator Murray, could I say we are in agreement on many of the points you made. As I think you would be aware, we have announced a very full review of the tax system and its impacts. In that review process we are hoping to take up many of the issues you have raised. Thanks to all senators.

"Watson, Sen John",LP,2008-05-15,"—The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Board and Other Measures) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2008, currently before the Senate, has been the subject of a lot of delay before today’s very brief debate. The bill does have the support of the opposition Liberal, National and Country Liberal parties.
The bill indeed has a very wide coverage. For example, schedule 1 of the bill covers something like 27 Commonwealth acts that make reference to the previous CSS and PSS boards which effectively recognise the Australian Reward Investment Alliance and replace references to the previous boards with the new name, Australian Reward Investment Alliance, or ARIA.
I need to put the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Board and Other Measures) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2008 into a time perspective. For example, on 1 July 2005 the Public Sector Superannuation Accumulation Plan was introduced. This bill makes certain amendments to that legislation. Then, on 1 July 2006, there was established a single superannuation board, named the Australian Reward Investment Alliance, to administer the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme, the CSS; the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme, the PSS; and, finally, the PSSap, which is essentially an accumulation fund. The bill before us today sees the introduction of a new regime for managing legislative instruments provided for under the Legislative Instruments Act 2003, known as the LI Act. The bill ensures the use of ordinary time earnings, sometimes referred to as OTE, to calculate the employer superannuation guarantee. This matter essentially has only academic interest, because the earnings base for a long time for Commonwealth sector funds has always related to ordinary time earnings.
An interesting measure of the bill is the proposal to remove the requirement that interest determinations be gazetted. Website listing is of course a much more efficient and practical approach than gazettal, when members seek to get information about their investments. I would also like to signal that there are some interesting aspects of the manner in which ARIA makes its periodic determinations of interest on investment earnings that are credited or, in the event of a downturn, debited to members’ accounts. This is a matter that I will take up in other forums. But it does raise questions that I will take up with APRA to ensure there is consistency amongst superannuation funds in crediting members’ accounts with income earned.
The schedules and amendments ensure that ARIA, the Australian Reward Investment Alliance, is not only the trustee body and board but also the management authority and, according to the bill, is the appropriate body to issue certificates for the Commonwealth commissioners and authorities, where the employee member retires on grounds of physical or mental incapacity. It covers a diverse range of people such as—and this is not an inclusive list—the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner, the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency, APRA members, the CEO of the Australian Film Commission, Australian Federal Police employees, the Auditor-General, the Registrar of the AAT and the CEO of the Family Court.
I would like to take a few minutes of the Senate’s time to speak about ARIA’s management and its transparency. I remind the Senate that, at the last Senate estimates hearings, I raised issues about scrip lending. Scrip lending can be engaged in by bodies such as hedge funds. It appears that ARIA has permitted its custodian to engage in such activities. In fact it raised something like $889,000 of income during 2007. You may say it is good for members to get such income, and the Chairman of ASIC indicated that there is nothing illegal in such practices, but I remind the Senate that there is still an ethical issue—whether it is ethical for the board to allow the lending of scrip, which essentially belongs to members, to hedge funds and other people, so we can get a sort of short-selling operation. I raise this issue, because those assets really belong to approximately 156,000 federal public servants and approximately 52,000 uniformed members of the Australian Army, Navy and Air Force. Such activity is not illegal. In times of rising stock exchange values you could say that it is good for the exchange because scrip-lending activities increase the volume of activity, but I remind the Senate that in times of a decreasing or a falling market the practice can be absolutely devastating and can lead to a high degree of instability, which we have seen in recent times. In fact, the super fund Equiticorp had falling share prices caused by short-selling and has now discontinued its own short-selling arrangements.
Trustees of ARIA might say, ‘Yes, it’s good that we can get some investment income,’ but is it good for members who are pulling out of a fund at a time when the market is low because of instability created by short-selling, scrip lending and other sorts of activities which ARIA has supported? No doubt some people have experienced diminished payouts. The extent of the impact the practices of ARIA might have had on market valuations could never be determined. I remind the Senate that highly ethical investment companies, such as the Australian Foundation Investment Company, completely prohibit this practice of scrip lending, and they are far bigger than the ARIA investments.
I put to the Senate and to the members of ARIA and their board: please consider some of the ethical issues as well as the potential to get investment income from your practices. I also call on you to provide greater transparency and disclosure to your members and to ensure that members are confident that you have adequate policies in place and that members are told of policies to cover such interests as rights to dividends on scrip lending, because in the absence of disclosure problems can arise. I will conclude on that note. I issue this challenge on ethical grounds to the board of ARIA to look at their policies to ensure complete transparency and disclosure and to ensure that such practices cannot contribute to instability in the market which can lead to members, on retirement, getting less than the full value of their investment. I thank the Senate and I commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TRUSTEE BOARD AND OTHER MEASURES) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,33,1

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2008-05-15,"—Mr President, I seek leave of the Senate to make a short ministerial statement on threats to the Australian high commissioner and his staff in Fiji.
Leave granted.
—I thank the Senate. I would also like to indicate that my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, is making a similar statement to this in the House of Representatives as I speak. I regret to advise that our high commission in Fiji has today received a second death threat against the high commissioner and his staff.
Senators may be aware that a previous anonymous and grave threat was delivered to the high commission in Suva on 7 May. The Australian government believe these threats to be credible and is extremely concerned by them. Both threats were immediately brought to the attention of the Fiji police and we are grateful for their investigative efforts to date.
Following the first threat, the government has taken urgent steps to fully revise security arrangements for Australian High Commission staff in Fiji and to improve the safety of the staff of the high commission and the security of the high commission premises. Restrictions have now been placed on access to the high commission.
In response to the first threat, the high commissioner met ministers of the interim government and requested agreement for Australian Federal Police officers to join the high commission staff to provide additional close personal protection and security. He also requested additional security services be provided by the Fiji police to high commission staff.
The foreign minister, Mr Smith, has today sent a formal note to the Fiji interim foreign minister reiterating the deep concern of the Australian government about these threats and seeking urgent and full cooperation in responding to our formal requests for additional personal protection and security.
I can inform the Senate that Mr Smith has taken the opportunity, prior to question time in the House of Representatives today, to brief the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Nelson, and the shadow minister for foreign affairs, Mr Robb, about these matters.
Australia’s travel advice for Fiji has, this afternoon, been updated to take account of these threats as well as recent increasing levels of crime in Fiji.
Mr President, the safety, security and welfare of all high commission staff and their families are paramount in Australia’s response to these threats. If, for some reason, these threats are an effort to intimidate the Australian government about its policy on Fiji—or an attempt to intimidate our high commissioner—let me make it very clear that they will have no such effect.
I thank the Senate for allowing me to make this statement.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Fiji: Australian High Commission</title>,Ministerial Statements,34,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2008-05-15,"—Yesterday, Senator Watson asked me a question about funding for the Tasmanian health services infrastructure plan, and I undertook to provide a detailed answer for Senator Watson. The Rudd government announced its $50 million Tasmanian package on 25 September 2007, prior to the last federal election. Playing catch-up, the Liberal Party then announced a smaller package. The people of Tasmania had the opportunity to evaluate the $37.5 million on offer from the Liberal Party or the $50 million to be provided by Labor. Labor was always entirely up-front about this clear choice. Claims from the Liberal Party that the Labor government has cut health are scaremongering—pure and simple. The Liberals should know better than to keep playing politics with health.
The Liberals’ catch-up package contained $15 million less than Labor’s package overall and $1.5 million less than Labor for improving patient transport. Unlike Labor’s package, the Liberal package did not provide a commitment to the integrated care centre. This meant it contained nothing to take pressure off Tasmania’s public hospitals, as Labor’s plan will through a $15 million investment in GP superclinics. The Liberal Party had 12 years to deliver better health to Tasmania but instead chose to neglect the health system.
The Rudd government are getting on with the job of delivering our election commitments. These election commitments include $42.2 million in GP superclinics, a cancer care service in the north or north-west of Tasmania, a PET scanner for the Royal Hobart Hospital and an integrated care clinic with renal dialysis facilities in Launceston, and a further $9.9 million allocated to patient transport, particularly in the north and north-west of the state.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Health</title>,Questions Without Notice: Additional Answers,36,1
"Watson, Sen John",LP,2008-05-15,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the further answer given by the Minister.
I thank the Minister for Human Services for his response, but his response has not clarified the position at all. According to the budget paper that I referred to yesterday—and I referred to it by name—there was a saving of $37.5 million. The minister, in response to my question of yesterday, although he said he would take it on notice, added some comments to the effect that that money was going to be spent elsewhere.
The issue is: you cannot use the same $37.5 million twice. You cannot use it as a transfer to other activities yet at the same time in your budget papers call it a saving of $37.5 million. You have to make up your mind: is it a saving, as referred to in the budget papers, or is it a transfer and you have used that saving in another area? The people are confused. Who is right? Are you right, Minister, or is the budget paper right?

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2008-05-15,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Human Services (Senator Ludwig) and the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research (Senator Carr) to questions without notice asked today relating to the 2008-09 Budget.
From the performance that we have seen over the last couple of question times from Senator Carr and Senator Ludwig, you cannot help but be left with the impression that Labor ministers are now being mugged by reality, and the reality is that Labor has delivered a very old-style, big-taxing, big-spending budget that will increase, not decrease, pressure on inflation and—this is the critical point—see up to 134,000 Australians lose their jobs in the current year. Labor’s first budget after 13 years is actually increasing unemployment at the same time as it is trying to deal with inflation. What is emerging from the way that Senators Carr and Ludwig are trying to approach their portfolios is that they really do not have their ducks lined up in a row and they cannot take steps to keep the economy growing, to keep jobs secure and to keep inflation in check. It is really quite extraordinary that the government’s foray into so-called fiscal management is bound to end in tears.
Labor was left with the strongest fiscal position in the history of this country. Labor promised to ease the pressure on working families but failed the very people they promised to help. They project fewer working families and, in fact, more welfare families. How can this possibly be consistent, with all of Labor’s ranting, raving and rhetoric about the importance of increased participation and productivity, when they have unemployment increasing following the budget, with Treasury forecasts showing 134,000 fewer people in jobs? I do not think that is the end of it and I will come to that in just a moment. There is an inherent contradiction. Despite all the rhetoric about an education revolution and lifting productivity, eventually you get mugged with the reality that the participation rate in the workforce has been forecast by Treasury to fall. I think that either Labor do not know what they are doing or they are in for a very rude surprise. You cannot have it both ways.
Leaving aside Treasury forecasts, following the budget announcement concern is growing for the welfare of jobs throughout the entire public service sector. I must say that my concerns have been fortified: slashes to Centrelink funding have already sparked a prediction of 2,000 job cuts. Apparently Mr Whalan is going. I hope he is going voluntarily and that he is not being punished by Labor for predicting a loss of 2,000 jobs, which he did earlier this year. The Community and Public Sector Union now holds fears for 3,300 Commonwealth Public Service jobs as a result of the budget. It is evident to me that the Rudd government is deliberately setting out to increase unemployment in the public sector with indiscriminate and poorly thought out application of an across-the-board two per cent efficiency dividend that is going to have a dreadful impact on the so-called working families that Labor professes to care about.
Labor is introducing new reviews and systems to Centrelink programs, such as means testing the baby bonus, launching a new welfare debit card and cutting staff to the organisation and other areas of the Public Service. After Senator Ludwig’s performance during question time, I do not think that anyone could have any confidence that he is actually across what this is going to do not only to Centrelink, which he tried to deal with today, but also to the Child Support Agency, which is going to lose a further 435 jobs, and to the Medicare office, which is going to lose 171 jobs. Senator Ludwig, who cannot even find the page in his brief to answer a question, is going to preside over a department that will lose 816 jobs from agencies that are tasked with delivering essential services for very needy Australians.
The Department of Human Services is tasked with the efficient delivery of payments to people who really need them. It needs to be efficient and accountable, yet what we have seen from Senator Ludwig is that he dodges responsibility. He did not even know that carers payments are not indexed. Whilst the Prime Minister might now talk about a modest rise in unemployment, it will be cold comfort to the 3,000 or so Australians who are going to lose their jobs. (Time expired)

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2008-05-15,"—In taking note of answers this afternoon, let me assist in taking note of Senator Carr’s excellent, innovative and forthright answer in respect of the CSIRO. We need to place on record that there is in fact an increase—a ‘modest’ increase, to quote the minister—in the budget of the CSIRO, which will now get an allocation of $676 million over 2008-09.
I know that my constituents in the Territory who work at CSIRO or who used to work at CSIRO under the previous government will be able to relate to this: the previous government were the ones responsible for closing down the plant industry division in the Northern Territory—an division that was doing innovative research on mangoes, bananas and such crops of the north—and decided, in absolute blindness and stupidity, to ensure that those officers were relocated to Canberra. I cannot see too many activities relating to mangoes and bananas happening in this climate, I have to say. If we want to look at track records in respect of the CSIRO and job losses, do not look any further than the people opposite me. They gave no care and no thought whatsoever to the innovation and research that was happening in the Top End of this country. Contracts were not renewed—eminent scientists in that division were forced to move to Brisbane to undertake their work.
We have now a minister who is passionate about research in this country. He has been tracking the work of CSIRO over many years and has ensured that CSIRO will get a modest increase in their allocation. Why is that? The increase will be modest because we have said from the beginning that this is a responsible budget. This budget will put us into the future. It will allocate increases to programs where they are deemed to have a capacity to build our country, to ensure that research and innovation become front and centre of what we do in this country. That is why a modest increase is going to the CSIRO. Some programs have been streamlined and new priorities will contribute to the fiscal discipline. We know that savings will be applied to ANSTO and to CSIRO, resulting in $47 million over four years, I might add. The bottom line is that the CSIRO will enjoy a modest increase, taking their appropriations for 2008-09 to $676 million.
This government is actually putting the future of this country—our industries, development and innovation—front and centre. I have not in my years in this Senate seen the previous government—the opposition now—try to defend its record, and now it is trying to attack us on our record. This will not stack up at all when you look at the history of the previous government’s treatment of the CSIRO and research and innovation.
We have an innovation policy that will be aimed at ending the brain drain, an innovation policy that will work in partnership with business. It will tackle climate change and provide more effective support to small business and innovative companies. We will be about driving productivity and economic growth, through advancing our industries in this country. You do it through research and you do it through no better organisation in this country than the CSIRO, so we will be increasing their budget. We will make sure the research they do is relevant and appropriate to their industries. Unlike the people opposite me, we will be ensuring that industries such as the plant division in the Top End would stay in places like the Top End and not be relocated around this country and closed, or contracts not renewed and jobs lost. We are a government that will place research such as that done by CSIRO front and centre of our future reforms and the future growth of this country. We have done that through this budget. We will continue to do that through our priorities. (Time expired)

"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,2008-05-15,"—I likewise take note of the answer given by Minister Carr to the question asked by my opposition colleague Senator Sandy Macdonald in relation to funding and job cuts in the nation’s premier research body, the CSIRO. In that question, the minister was asked to confirm whether 85 people were to lose their jobs as a result of the government’s decision to slash $44 million from CSIRO’s budget—not a modest increase, as Senator Crossin just claimed, with typical government spin; a $44 million slashing of funding from CSIRO’s budget. Of course, as we no doubt have come to expect from this minister in the few weeks that parliament has sat, he failed to answer Senator Macdonald’s question. Instead, he chose to run the Labor Party’s standard line about cutting inflation.

Senator Wong interjecting—

—Well, Minister, it is quite ironic that, while the minister believes research funding is a cause of inflation in this nation, he and his colleagues apparently do not believe that increasing the price of things such as alcohol, cars, health insurance and energy will have any upward impact on inflation. But then of course it is asking far too much to expect any understanding of economics from the Labor Party. In his answer, as I said, Senator Carr launched into typical spin about the Labor Party’s claimed dedication to science and research, and that spin we just heard reiterated a few moments ago by Senator Crossin in a vain attempt to defend the minister and this decision.
The reality is that, over the next three years, the CSIRO will have $44 million less than it did in the last year of the Howard government. Clearly, the Liberal and National parties are committed to scientific research and some of the amazing results which are beneficial for the Australian community that can ensue from such research. But the Australian Labor Party and this appalling government, already showing its colours, are only interested in short-term headlines and spin.
The Labor Party went into the last election with a policy claiming that it would revitalise our public research, including the CSIRO. Today Minister Carr claimed that he stands by that policy. Well, it is fair to say that the hypocrisy of this government knows absolutely no bounds, when Minister Carr stands up, in the face of a clearly defined budget cut, and claims that the policy that the Labor Party took to the last election is being implemented. How can the minister honestly stand in this place, claiming to stand by the claim that his party will reinvigorate the CSIRO, while on the other hand slashing $44 million from its budget? This is yet another broken promise in the short period that the Labor government has been in office. It seems to have come into this process of government believing that people will just listen to its spin rather than actually reading what is in the budget papers. It is fair to say that the Australian people are owed much more respect than that from this new government.
Australian scientists have made many outstanding discoveries through their scientific research that have benefited not only our community but people right around the world. Take the development of things like the cochlear ear implant, which has made a world of difference in people’s lives right round the world. There are deaf people not only here in Australia but right around the world who now have the capacity to hear because of that dedicated work of Australian researchers. More recently, the cervical cancer vaccine, Gardasil, was developed in Australia through scientific research which will simply save the lives of thousands of young women. Clearly, this sort of scientific research does not meet the Labor Party’s short-term objectives of positive media headlines.
Surely there must come a point at which the government recognises that it has a responsibility to do the right thing, irrespective of whether that is going to provide it with a short-term media or poll boost. All Australians, irrespective of where they live, deserve the benefits of publicly funded research to improve their lives, and this government has failed every Australian in this budget in relation to CSIRO. We will never know what life-saving discoveries will not be made because of these budget cuts to CSIRO, but we certainly know that this government has let down not just those directly involved with CSIRO but in fact every Australian who will lose the benefit of their researchers’ tireless work, which has been truncated by this slashed funding.
Senator Carr, the minister, should be ashamed, not just because of the budget slashing of CSIRO or for the CSIRO staff who will lose their jobs, but because he came into this place and, rather than being honest about this appalling policy, delivered more spin and absolutely no answers for those CSIRO staff working hard to keep Australia at the forefront of scientific research.

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2008-05-15,"—The senator has pointed out that the Australian public do not read budget papers, and I think that is a really important issue to take up, because we need to have some honesty about the focus of the current budget and also what will be put in place. It has been said so many times—and will continue to be said in this place and across the community—that the budget was put in place facing a clear economic process in this country. No-one can deny the issues around the increasing inflation and the threat of further inflation in this country. No-one can deny that. The opposition cannot deny that. They can pretend that everything is rosy, but it is not. The indications are that a budget had to be formulated which took into account the future—and the effective future—of our country. No-one was hiding from that. The Treasurer, when he produced the budget, said that there would be areas of needed response. He made no mistake.
Senator Coonan has focused this debate on the answers relating to Centrelink and CSIRO. I was present at the last Senate estimates when this wonderful figure of Centrelink losses was brought up. I am very sorry at the way it was done, because when we were sitting there asking questions about the future—before the budget was brought down—the CEO of Centrelink, Mr Jeff Whalan, was engaged in a discussion in which issues were raised about what would happen in the future of that agency. There was natural concern that there could be management decisions that would involve some job losses. No-one denied that. In terms of process, what we were looking at for professional public sector organisations was how those organisations in this country would manage the process into the future with the budget that they were allocated. No-one was running from that. There was no denial.
Now that the budget has been brought down, the strength, professional nature and efficiency of the public sector will ensure they work with government and the community to see that the programs they are charged to deliver will be effectively delivered for all Australians. This is not a surprise. Anyone who has worked in the Australian Public Service, as I did for many years—and I still describe myself as an Australian public servant—knows that restructuring changes and working with budgets are a daily challenge for all of us. That is not new.
What we have now is the typical process that happens after a budget when people are trying to maximise their positions. It is quite a worry to me that senior opposition shadow ministers are using scare tactics to cause uncertainty and fear amongst Australian public servants—people who are working for us and for the community. Since the budget, Senator Coonan, in particular around the issues of Centrelink and Human Services, has been in the media throwing out allegations about the job losses that will occur in the public sector. This has not been validated. And the more that exaggerations are made, the more that fear is created, the more difficult it is for the people who are trying to do their jobs effectively—that is, to concentrate on the program expectations to ensure that they know what their jobs are and that they can work effectively into the future.
In relation to the statement made by Minister Ludwig earlier that Mr Whalan has announced his retirement, I want to put on record my personal appreciation and respect for the job that Jeff Whalan has done, not just in Centrelink, which is where I have had the chance to meet with him over the last couple of years, but in a very distinguished Australian Public Service career. Seeing that, I think it is even worse that his name has been used in this place around figures that are not actually correct. I know that senior public servants understand the way this place works. I would hope that we would be able to gather together and acknowledge his service in that process.
It will not be easy for the Australian public sector to work through an efficiency dividend, but we are used to it. We have worked with previous efficiency dividends and we have been able to work effectively with the expectations of the community to provide essential services. That will continue. Program by program, individual public sector agencies will look at their budgets, their work plans and their people and they will work with their people to ensure that the work is achieved in our community. The message for all of us is to respect the work of the APS, to work with them and with their union—my union, the Community and Public Sector Union—to ensure that people are looked after and their work is respected into the future.

"Bushby, Sen David",LP,2008-05-15,"—I rise to take note of answers given by Ministers Carr and Ludwig today on matters related to the budget, particularly the effect of changes to the income level for the Medicare levy and job cuts within CSIRO, Centrelink and other places in the Public Service.
Senator Moore has just asked for honesty when we are talking about the current budget. I could not agree more. We do need to look at this in an honest way and see what really is going on. There has been a whole series of headlines and discussions by commentators over the last few days since the budget was delivered. Many of those have talked about Robin Hood budgets and the like. But, if you have a look at the comments made by those who have some economic expertise, you will find that the general consensus of those commentators—people who actually know what they are talking about—is that the budget has been fiscally neutral in its inflationary impact.
You will also see that some commentators have commented that it is the biggest spending and biggest taxing budget that this country has ever seen. Those opposite have been arguing—and the ministers have certainly commented in their replies—that they have cut deeply and that huge measures have been incorporated into the budget with a view to reducing inflationary pressure.
Prior to the budget, the government built this up in a huge way. They were constantly going on about the inflation crisis we are having. We have heard from the Treasurer, Wayne Swan, stories about the inflation genie; we have heard comments about the cancer that is eating away at the Australian economy—that being inflation. They have built up to a huge extent the need for fiscal responsibility to make massive cuts but, as I have just commented, the reality is that most commentators with any economic expertise are saying that what has been done in this budget is fiscally neutral in its inflationary impact. The spin has not been met by the actual delivery. The government have failed to deliver on the promise.
Just today, a young student of macroeconomics came into my office to see me. She and her fellow macroeconomics students have spent the last couple of days pulling the budget to pieces, looking at it particularly from the perspective of its impact on inflation. Their conclusion was in fact that it was fiscally neutral in terms of its inflationary impact. They could not see where it relieved the inflationary pressures that, as the government continually tell us, we are currently experiencing as a nation. The reality is that, despite the spin, the government have not delivered in this budget any major changes that will reduce inflationary pressures.
At the same time, they have delivered a budget that will lead directly to an increase in unemployment in this nation. The budget papers themselves admit that there will be 135,000 people who will lose their jobs. That is in the budget papers. It is not the opposition saying it; it is not commentators having a bit of a look at it and saying, ‘This is likely to cost 135,000 jobs.’ It is in the budget papers. Treasury say that, over the next 12 months, 135,000 people will lose their jobs. I would suggest to you that it probably understates the figure, but it is in there from Treasury. In one of the papers today a spokesman for the Community and Public Sector Union was saying that the estimate of 1,200 jobs that will be lost in the public service is grossly understated. I think he said that it is probably more likely to be double that. If the union is saying that, it is probably more likely to be triple or quadruple.
Here we have a budget that not only has failed to deliver the reduction in inflationary pressures that was promised but is also putting people out of work. Rather than being a Robin Hood budget, the reality is—as has been stated by a number of the government members, including the Treasurer on the night that he delivered the budget—this is a traditional Labor budget. Why is it traditional? It is traditional because it focuses more on looking after those who have jobs than worrying about people getting jobs in the first place. They are quite happy to put people out of work. They will put in place whatever measures they need to meet their ideological desires and preferences—and hang the consequences for people. They are quite happy to put them out of jobs. They are generally more worried about the rights of those who have work than those who have no work at all. (Time expired)

Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Budget</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,38,1
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2008-05-15,"—On behalf of the Committee of Privileges, I present the 133rd report of the committee, entitled Possible false or misleading evidence before the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—I move:
That the Senate endorse the finding at paragraph 1.31 of the 133rd report of the Committee of Privileges.
That finding is that no contempt was committed in respect of evidence given by Mr Robert Cornall AO, Secretary of the Attorney-General’s Department, or Commissioner Michael Keelty, Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, or its predecessor, in respect of the Australian government’s knowledge of the rendition of Mr Mamdouh Habib to Egypt.
This matter was referred to the committee on 18 September 2007 on the motion of Senator Nettle, after the President gave the motion precedence in accordance with standing order 81. In giving precedence, the President summarised the matter as involving, and I quote:
… seemingly inconsistent answers given by officers at estimates hearings about the government’s knowledge that Mr Mamdouh Habib had been taken to Egypt. Some officers suggested a lack of knowledge or certainty on the part of government that Mr Habib was ever in Egypt, while other answers appeared to indicate a definite knowledge that he had been taken to Egypt.
The legal and constitutional affairs committee, at the request of Senator Nettle, had sought responses from Mr Cornall and Commissioner Keelty following the transmission of an ABC Four Corners program in June 2007 which raised questions about the veracity of their evidence. The committee was satisfied that it had not been given false or misleading evidence—except for Senator Nettle, who exercised her right to raise this as a matter of privilege.
The Committee of Privileges sought further responses from Mr Cornall and Commissioner Keelty, including as to the matters canvassed by Senator Nettle in raising the matter of privilege. The committee also asked the legal and constitutional affairs committee for an account of its consideration of this matter and of its deliberations on the responses the committee received from Commissioner Keelty and Mr Cornall as to whether they had given false or misleading evidence.
Paragraph 12(c) of privilege resolution 6, which sets out a non-exhaustive list of matters constituting contempts, provides that a witness shall not:
… give any evidence which the witness knows to be false or misleading in a material particular, or which the witness does not believe on reasonable grounds to be true or substantially true in every material particular.
Furthermore, privilege resolution 3, which sets out criteria to be taken into account when determining matters relating to contempt, requires the committee to take into account whether a person who committed an act which may be held to be a contempt:
(i) knowingly committed that act, or
(ii) had any reasonable excuse for the commission of that act.
The committee had no evidence before it to support any contention that either Commissioner Keelty or Mr Cornall intended to mislead the legal and constitutional legislation committee or its successor. An essential element of the contempt, therefore, could not be established, and on this basis the committee has found that no contempt has been committed.
I will read the conclusion, paragraph 1.31:
... The committee concludes that neither Commissioner Keelty nor Mr Cornall knowingly gave false or misleading evidence to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee in respect of their knowledge of whether Mr Mamdouh Habib had been taken to Egypt. The Committee therefore finds that no contempt was committed in this regard.
In fact, the committee went further, although it was unnecessary for the finding, in paragraph 1.29, when it concluded:
... Overall ... the committee concludes that, although in certain respects the evidence of Mr Cornall and Commissioner Keelty was equivocal, it was not in fact misleading given the state of these officers’ knowledge at the time and the terms of the relevant questions addressed to them.
The Committee of Privileges has dealt with numerous cases of possible false or misleading evidence and this is the sixth case involving evidence given by officers at estimates hearings. In the report, the committee has made some general criticisms of the quality of evidence given at estimates hearings, particularly where officers give the narrowest possible answers to questions posed by senators who are obviously interested in obtaining as full an account as possible of a particular matter. In fairness to officers, however, it ought also to be observed that the answers given depend in part upon the skill and precision with which the questions are posed. I commend the report to the Senate and I seek leave to continue my remarks.
Leave not granted.
—Senator Brandis, Senator Bartlett wishes to address the motion before the chair. Senator Bartlett, at the end of your speech you might seek leave to continue your remarks, unless there are other speakers in this chamber on this motion.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Privileges Committee</title>,Committees,40,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2008-05-15,"—I will speak only briefly to it, Mr Deputy President. I would normally leave it to later, except opportunities for subsequently speaking to reports are fairly rare these days, so I thought I should speak to it when the opportunity arose. I am not a member of the Privileges Committee and I have not had the opportunity to read the report that has just been presented by Senator Brandis, although I think Senator Brandis gave a very good, succinct and clear detailing of its findings and conclusions. I am a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs but I have not followed the detail of this issue, partly quite consciously. Once you are not across all the detail, it is better to just let it follow its course, rather than know half the facts.
I simply want to reinforce, firstly, what I assume is a unanimous finding, as all Privileges Committee findings are, to my knowledge, and say the nature of privilege and whether or not there is a breach of privilege or contempt is a quite specific allegation. It is one that I do not think is very well understood; that is, certainly once the media start reporting on it. Not surprisingly, this issue has had some controversy around it and some media coverage of it. I simply want to put on the record I think it is very much worth while for people, in ongoing debates around the broader issue of what the previous government and various officials did and did not know and when they did or did not know things, to actually read the specifics of what is in this report. So in having that debate, whatever their perspective on it, they will have it on an informed basis as to who said what and when and how that relates or does not relate to the specific issue of contempt and breach of privilege.
The wider matter of what the previous government knew with regard to the rendition of Mr Habib is important. I think it is one that certainly merits more examination, in the same way as making assertions about referring the matter to the Privileges Committee should not have been perceived as a prima facie indication of egregious fault. Also, the flip side is that this committee’s finding that there is no breach of privilege is not in itself a complete resolution of some of the questions that were raised about what was known with regard to the rendition of Mr Habib. So I simply take the opportunity to put that report in its broader context and to, once again, without having yet read the report, commend the Privileges Committee on its ability to deal with these issues within the specific ambit of its terms of reference, its role and its ability to do so in a unanimous way without getting distracted by the valid political debate around the wider issues. It is in that context very much worth absorbing the specifics of this report, and from that, hopefully, people will get a better understanding of what breaches of privilege do and do not mean when people raise these sorts of issues as part of wider public debate. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2008-05-15,"—I move:
That the committee agree to the amendments made by the House of Representatives.
In doing that, can I thank those opposite, including the shadow minister, for allowing a speedy passage of this bill. It is an important bill. Without it, as I said yesterday, one of the key government commitments from the election—the rollout of the fibre-to-the node network—would have stalled.
—Do we have it already?
—Perhaps you are about to be rescued, Senator Coonan. I was perhaps even looking forward to a healthy discussion with you, but Senator Brandis is almost as much fun as you!
—Nobody is as much fun as you, Senator Conroy!
—Thank you. And I see Senator Ronaldson has joined us. I welcome the participation. The government is pressing ahead with its agenda. The $4.7 billion that we are considering putting in to facilitate the rollout of the National Broadband Network demonstrates the Rudd government’s commitment to investment in infrastructure vital for Australia’s long-term prosperity. The government is moving quickly to fulfil its election commitments. This government recognises that bidders will need access to relevant network information to prepare proposals on an equal footing.
—That expression must stick in your throat, Senator Conroy: the Rudd government.
—Are you enjoying the Nelson opposition, Senator Brandis?
—It’s magnificent!
—That is why my department is working with carriers to achieve a voluntary outcome for the provision of the data that is required. Is ‘Turnbull opposition’ more to your fancy, Senator Brandis? Telstra has recently provided some information voluntarily which my department is currently reviewing. However, the government’s view, as I have indicated, remains that it is important to have a legislative framework in place. The Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (National Broadband Network) Bill 2008 provides a mechanism for providing potential proponents with access to relevant information so they can put forward robust proposals for the competitive assessment process.
We did consider the opposition’s amendments and we appreciate that they were put forward—certainly some of them in good faith—but we believe they were technically flawed and unnecessary because they were already covered by a number of government amendments. Furthermore, they do not appear to guarantee the provision of sufficient information voluntarily. Ours were not drafted by Telstra and Mallesons, so we are confident that they will actually stand up to scrutiny. Unlike the opposition, the government is committed to ensuring potential proponents have access to the necessary information required to prepare competitive bids. We welcome the indication from those opposite that they will not insist upon their amendments and, to speed the journey, I will wrap up there unless I need to respond to comments from the opposition.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (NATIONAL BROADBAND NETWORK) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,43,1
"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2008-05-15,"—I assume that Senator Allison is listening and that she may want to make a contribution on that, given that it has come on at fairly short notice. I would hope that if her office is listening they will advise her of that so that she can come down and make a contribution. She did not have the opportunity yesterday because of time constraints imposed by the minister and his inability to properly handle this matter. So, Senator Allison, if you are listening, I hope you have the opportunity to come down.

Senator Conroy interjecting—

—Senator Conroy, I need to listen to Senator Ronaldson, please. It is very important.
—I was actually going to talk about some other things but, given the interjection from Senator Conroy and his comments, I will actually do something else. I will now read the comments from Mr Billson, in the other place, in relation to the minister. Having been invited to do so by him, I will actually accommodate that. Thank you very much for the invitation to do so. I will read the comments from Mr Billson, the member for Dunkley, the shadow minister in the other place:
This is the same minister who, this morning, rang me to see if we would again bail him out of trouble, as we did in the Senate yesterday, when the minister and his government could not get the government’s own amendments considered in the time available.
I am just waiting for some figures at the moment, but there was an hour and 20 minutes on the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment Bill 2008, apart from anything else. We are just getting some figures now to see what government business there was on Tuesday, which you, Minister, could quite actively have used to facilitate this process but, because of your total inability to manage your portfolio, you could not do so and you could not even get amendments in until Tuesday night. I will continue with Mr Billson’s comments:
He throws himself on the opposition and says, ‘Please, please rescue me from this disaster I have created.’
They are your words, Minister: ‘Please, please rescue me from this disaster I have created.’ I continue:
He rang me again this morning and said, ‘I expect you will characterise my phone call, Bruce, as begging, grovelling and gagging.’ Yes, he is absolutely right. We gave an undertaking to have this bill passed in this place by 11 o’clock so that it could get back to the Senate to be dealt with. And guess what? The minister has missed another deadline. He could not even deliver on that timeframe we had accommodated for him in another act of constructive and helpful engagement in this process. This is more about saving Stephen Conroy from himself. This is too important to leave to this minister who is making error after error after error.
We have seen, I think, six items of government business already transacted here this morning. So urgent was this that the minister put out the most ridiculous press statement yesterday having a go at me—
that is, Bruce Billson—
and the coalition for rescuing him from his own incompetence. Is there no end to the gall of this man? Does he think running the government is like some factional deal where you just muscle up and ignore the truth? Come on, Minister! He is having a go at us for actually facilitating the process that he could not organise for himself.
So, Minister, you not only had the opportunity to do something about this on Tuesday; you had the opportunity to do something about this yesterday. You also had the opportunity to put this bill in before the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment Bill 2008—where there was an hour and 20 minutes that you could have used for this. And you sit there with that stupid look on your face thinking that this is all a bit of a joke. Well, Minister, I can tell you that no-one out there actually thinks this is a joke. The only thing in this process that they think is a joke is you and your behaviour in relation to this process—and I think the description of the phone calls with Mr Billson quite actually reflect this.
We put to you a constructive approach to making this bill better, to save you, Minister, from yourself—to save you from a politically motivated time frame imposed by you to meet imperatives for your own job. But you would not even accept that. Minister, you will not even take the advice of the carriers. Did you pick up the phone to speak to the industry about your amendments or our amendments to see whether this process could be facilitated? No, you did not. You did not even bother speaking to the people that you are expecting to participate in this process about whether these amendments did or did not assist this incredibly stupid, short time frame that you have imposed. You would have thought that a minister who had some interest in all this might have done that to see whether the process could be facilitated. Mr Billson went on:
The time available was not enough to deal with the government’s own amendments, but then when our amendments were universally recognised in the telecommunications community as a vast improvement on what the government was offering he got cranky about that.
The minister got cranky about this whole thing, because the minister knows that he has completely and utterly bastardised this process. He has not been able to organise in this chamber a discussion of this matter.
It was No. 7 in the House of Representatives today. Yesterday we were running around making phone calls to the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, the Leader of the Government in the Senate and Senator Conroy trying to facilitate a process, due to this ‘urgency’ to get it out of here and across to there last night. But where was it today in the House of Representatives? It was about No. 7. And, again, there was another phone call from Senator Conroy to Mr Billson—whose actions in relation to this bill should be a salutary lesson to every minister who is sitting across the other side of the chamber here and in the other place. Mr Billson has genuinely tried to assist with this process. He has genuinely tried to assist this minister and has tried to save this minister from himself.
I could go through the comments that others have made about Senator Conroy’s interest in his portfolio but I will not do so, because I will not be playing the sorts of games that he has been playing over the last 24 hours—but I am happy to accommodate that if that is what he would like me to do. I will go on with the comments from Mr Billson:
There is a reason the minister does not know the mood of the telecommunications community: he does not talk to them. It was up to the opposition to discover that there had secretly been some government amendments dropped out there—
which happened to be Tuesday night—
There was no notification to us.
Was there any discussion with the industry? Mr Billson continues:
He did not consult anybody. If he had, he would have known that there is considerable support right across the telecommunications community, across the users of these services and across policymakers and analysts for the actions the opposition has taken.
There was not even a courtesy extended to the Leader of the Democrats to discuss these amendments. The Democrats spokesperson on this matter was not even given the courtesy of a phone call from this uninterested minister to discuss these amendments. If that is the consultation that business groups and community groups can expect from this government over the—hopefully, short—period of time that they will be here, they will deserve what they get.
I would not normally be standing up here supporting the Democrats, but I thought Senator Allison’s behaviour and approach yesterday deserved a lot more praise than you gave, Minister. You effectively treated her with contempt by not briefing her and then leaving her in a position where she had literally 20 seconds to discuss these matters. If that is the way that you want to approach this chamber, that is entirely up to you. But I do not think it is right, and I do not think that people would expect the minor parties to be treated in such a way. Mr Billson went on to say:
But he would not know that because, just as he did not call the opposition about their amendments and did not consult anybody about them, he certainly did not consult any of the key stakeholders that these amendments are aimed at. So the press release that came out yesterday accusing us of slowing up the process when we saved his bacon is just more of the hubris we expect from this minister.
…            …            …
This is a bill that got dropped into the Senate on the second last day it sat, which sat around in the Senate yesterday and the day before when they did other things that were thought to be more important. The minister then claimed that we were holding up the bill because we were facilitating the debate on it, and now it is here in the House a day later.
I have three or four minutes left.
I just want to say to the minister, through the chair: why you chose to adopt this process and this attitude, quite frankly, is completely and utterly lost on us. It is lost on the minor parties. It is lost on the industry. It is lost on us why, when you had an imperative that we acknowledge was an election promise, when you knew the magnitude of the task, when you knew that you and your department did not have the information you required to make this process open and transparent, when you were given the opportunity to do that, you have chosen to take out the sledgehammer, to blame everyone else for your inability to drive this process appropriately. The turning point yesterday was when you foolishly, in my view, rather than engaging and rather than accommodating a process where amendments could be appropriately debated, chose to take the one course of action that debased your bona fides in relation to this debate—and that was your decision to try and blame the opposition, the minor parties and everyone else for holding this up.
I might be wrong, but, if there is an example in the last three years where the then Labor opposition tried to facilitate the process of legislation and of a bill as we have done through shadow minister Billson, I would be very, very surprised. If the view is that it is appropriate to effectively abuse the goodwill of the shadow minister, both in the other place and here, then that is ultimately a choice, Minister, that you will make. I have been around for a fair while, as most people would be aware. Why someone in your position would choose, when you were given a very, very substantial olive branch, to play a bit of cheap politics with it is, quite frankly, something that I will not and do not understand. Why you went down that path, I am not entirely sure.
Quite frankly, there were a number of matters that I wanted to talk about with our sensible amendments yesterday. You know, Minister, and I know, and everyone who was in the chamber knows, that we facilitated that process—whereby I did not speak to those amendments—to assist you, Minister, to get it out of this place and into the other place. And, us having assisted you to do that, you then put out a press release attacking us for holding this process up. Then we got to that other place this morning and there were six matters that went before this. You then rang the shadow minister and said: ‘Help me out. Again, can you help us out with this?’
If that is the sort of bipartisanship you want in relation to the future conduct of these sorts of things, that is okay. We have been prepared to play ball on this because we think the issue is bigger than politics. But, quite frankly, the view of the shadow minister is that you have put politics above good public policy with this, and your behaviour has detracted from what should be a sensible and reasonable outcome. You can smile and laugh and giggle about it—that is okay. We actually think it is important, and we have facilitated this process. We do not agree with your amendments—we think our amendments were good amendments—but we are not going to stand in the way of this process, because, as you know and we know, if it were to go any further than today it would make it incredibly difficult for this process to go through in an appropriate sense that would give anyone any confidence— (Time expired)

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2008-05-15,"—Mr President, I seek leave to incorporate for the information of honourable senators the Leader of the Opposition’s response to the budget speech, given by Dr Nelson in the House of Representatives earlier this evening.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
Australians expected a lot with the election of a new government. Last year they listened to what the now Prime Minister and Treasurer had to say. They heard them say that they were going to be good economic managers. They heard them say that they would do something about grocery prices. They heard them say that they would do something about the price of petrol. They heard them say that they would do something about home interest rates. They heard a lot. Every Australian should now ask themselves this question: will this budget make it easier for me to keep my home, to fill my trolley with groceries, to put petrol in my car and to keep my job?
The Prime Minister and Treasurer have styled themselves as new Labor leaders, yet this is old Labor returning to haunt the Australian economic landscape again. This is an old-fashioned, high-taxing, high-spending Labor budget that seeks to punish those it does not like and discourage aspiration. The government promised to ease the pressure on working families but failed the very people they promised to help. How can any government boast of a budget that proposes to put 134,000 Australians into unemployment? Under the coalition it was ‘welfare to work’; under Labor, we are headed again on the road from work to welfare.
How can they boast of a budget that largely ignores the men and women whose sacrifices built this nation—seniors and retirees? How can they boast of a budget that not only leaves carers in the lurch but sells them down the river? Where were the incentives for small family business? Where was the emphasis on water, farmers and rural and regional Australians? This budget, like this government, puts media spin ahead of substance, bureaucratic doublespeak ahead of people and more than 100 reviews, inquiries and committees ahead of decisions. There is no substitute for a sound economic strategy—and Australians know it.
For months, the nervous man that is now Treasurer talked up an inflation genie as being out of the bottle. He spoke of an inflationary crisis. He darkly warned that deep funding cuts were needed. Yet he has delivered a budget that actually increases spending and increases taxes. Far from slaying inflation, this budgetary approach risks breathing new life into it. This budget will do little to reassure Australians nervous about whether this Treasurer and this government really understand what they are doing. In contrast, the Liberal and National parties have enormous demonstrated experience in keeping the Australian economy strong and competitive and in making sound judgements according to economic circumstances.
Since last November’s election, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have been more concerned with undermining and misrepresenting the Howard-Costello legacy than they have been focused on the economic challenges facing Australia. We should never forget that the leadership of the coalition of John Howard and Peter Costello enabled Australia to become a stronger, more prosperous country, more confident in itself and its place in the world.
Australia was a dramatically different place when the coalition came to office in 1996. Under Labor, Australia had emerged from oppressively high interest rates, the collapse of businesses and a recession that deeply scarred the nation. It was an Australia in which every parent feared for the future of their children. There was no talk of a skills crisis.
In its very first budget, the coalition faced a deficit of $10 billion and $96 billion in accumulated Labor debt. Last November, by contrast, we handed to the new Prime Minister and the new Treasurer an economy the envy of the world. There was no Commonwealth debt, surplus budgeting is now accepted as the norm and more than $60 billion was then invested in Australia’s future. During the 12 years the coalition was in government, everything that should be up—wages, economic growth and business and consumer confidence—was up while everything that should be down—inflation, interest rates and unemployment—was down. Under the coalition government Australians were able to get ahead.
This sound management and economic prosperity took place in the face of the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s, the US recession of 2001, the tech wreck, the SARS epidemic, the terrorist attacks of September 11 and in Bali and amidst the worst drought in 100 years. We took these challenges in our stride because we know that managing a trillion dollar economy is never easy.
The Labor Party steadfastly opposed every single coalition measure that was essential to getting Australia into the position that it found itself in in November last year. Before the election, the Prime Minister repeatedly styled himself as an economic conservative. Expensive advertisements, slick management, cardboard cut-outs and expensive suits do not make economic conservatives. It is deeply rooted in philosophical conviction and character.
Today Australians are not confident about our economy. Business and consumer confidence has plunged to record-breaking lows, despite the fundamentals still being strong. Retail sales have fallen, building approvals have fallen flat, house values have fallen in many suburbs and Australians are less confident both in the economy and in their government—all this before the global liquidity crisis is yet to fully wash through the Australian economy and Labor’s inflationary, job-destroying roll-back on workplace relations. Union bosses are back in town, and we have no confidence that this Prime Minister will be able to stand up to union intimidation. Why would he? After all, they invested so much money in getting him into government.
Under Labor there is little opportunity for Australians to get ahead. This underwhelming budget is one of lost opportunity. The Prime Minister and Treasurer have presented their high-taxing budget as one that fights inflation. While no-one should deny that there is an inflationary challenge to be managed, there is no crisis. The last Labor government ran inflation in excess of six per cent a year for six years and it peaked at 8.3 per cent. Inflation is currently running at 4.25 per cent and is forecast to fall.
We have never subscribed to the Treasurer’s assertion that an inflation ‘crisis’ justifies savage budget cuts at a time of significant domestic and global economic uncertainty. We do not support higher taxes and higher spending. For all his talk of slaying some dragon, the Treasurer has breathed new life into inflation with a budget that delivers something Australians have not known in Commonwealth budgets in recent years: tax increases. The government has perpetrated a fraud on the Australian people.
Preliminary calculations indicate that the budget will increase the CPI by up to 0.4 per cent. The price of alcohol is up. The price of cars is up. The price of groceries will be pressured in part from higher taxes on trucks. The passenger movement charge is up. Taxes on software are up. And workers are about to have the Treasurer bite into their hard-earned money with a tax on canteen meal cards.
And health insurance premiums will increase with measures that will see a so-far confirmed figure of half a million Australians—mainly young people—drop private health insurance, leaving families, retirees and pensioners to pay even higher premiums to keep their private health insurance. We will stand up for private health insurance. We have always stood up for people with private health insurance and we will continue to do so. We will oppose this measure.
These are real price increases and they will cut into household budgets of real Australians, many of whom can least afford to pay it. These price increases could also mean higher interest rates. Far from reducing spending and putting downward pressure on inflation, this budget increases spending. The Treasurer has not, as he says, ‘taken the axe to irresponsible spending’. He has merely taken a sledgehammer to people the Labor Party does not like and ignored others—seniors, carers, small business, and rural and regional communities.
The government has cut $15.2 billion from programs, but then it has added $30 billion in new Labor spending programs, so net spending will increase by almost $15 billion over the forward estimates. The government has not paid for this new spending with cuts. The government has instead chosen to impose taxes and increase revenues that will raise $19.7 billion over the next five years. Far from reducing taxes to encourage incentive and workforce participation, this budget increases taxes. The total tax take will increase over this year alone by $15.7 billion. That is a 5.2 per cent increase in taxation in one single year. This is a high-taxing, high-spending Labor government.
As for the income tax cuts announced by the Treasurer on Tuesday night, bear in mind that these are the coalition tax cuts copied by the new Treasurer. He no longer, however, has a straight A student in the form of Peter Costello to copy. As such, Australians have seen the last tax cut that they will see for some time. This budget confirms that Labor stands for higher taxes, whereas the coalition stands for lower taxes. Even after the income tax cuts, the total income tax take from Australians will increase by $42.8 billion, or 21 per cent, over the next four years.
Tax relief not only provides practical help for families; it also rewards hard work and self-sacrifice. It can also help tackle inflation by removing pressure for wage claims while encouraging people into work. The Treasurer demonstrated his lack of commitment to tax relief in January, when he called for an end to the Howard government policy of returning excess budget surpluses as tax cuts. The Reserve Bank, he warned, had been allowed to shoulder too much responsibility for controlling inflation with interest rate rises. If the coalition tax relief delivered in this budget reduces inflation by promoting participation, encourages skill development and keeps wage pressures under control, as Labor accepts, doesn’t that argument also apply to future tax relief? Clearly the Treasurer does not believe his own argument.
Labor is giving us something with one hand and taking it back with the other—and not just through knee-jerk measures, such as the new Tarago tax on cars or the $1 slug on responsible Australians who happen to enjoy a pre-mixed Bundy and coke or a scotch and dry. We know that, as incomes rise over time and workers move into higher tax brackets, the value of today’s tax cuts will be eroded in the future. Economists call it ‘bracket creep’. We call it tax increases on the sly. There must be a commitment to future tax relief. Alcohol abuse is a problem—it is a real problem—not only confined to some young people but spread right across society. I spent much of my medical life seeing its human consequences. I am also a parent.
According to the government, the principal cause and the source of binge drinking is the so-called ‘alcopops’ or ‘ready to drinks’. A whopping 70 per cent excise increase, we have been told, would make significant inroads into binge drinking. The evidence does not support the government’s assertion—in fact, quite the contrary. The National Drug Strategy household survey confirms binge drinking by young women since 2001 has actually declined and alcohol abstinence in this group has increased. So the Prime Minister has told Australians that they have got to pay $3.1 billion more in tax on one alcohol product to deal with binge drinking. Any parent, let alone a health economist, will confirm that, if you jack up the price of alcohol in isolation from other measures, kids will simply move to another form of alcohol or a drug.
The budget confirms that after its tax increase the government expects consumption of these products to grow at a rate of some 10 per cent per year compounding. This is nothing more than a tax binge falsely presented to Australians as something that it is not, and that is why we are angry about it. We will oppose it. A real strategy to deal with alcohol abuse and antisocial behaviour demands an integration of education, prevention, policing, media, appropriate pricing measures and parenting where it involves young people. I will convene a national forum of alcohol specialists, educators, police, parents where expertise in their field is involved, and those who have expertise in related fields to develop a truly integrated approach to what is an undeniable problem. This will involve more substance than style.
Before the election, the Prime Minister led the Australian public to believe that he would do something about the price of petrol. He has done nothing of substance. Watching petrol prices does not bring them down. Australians may not have expected a silver bullet in the case of petrol, but they sure as hell deserve a government that does more than fire blanks. In 2001, when the price of petrol spiked sharply, we took the view that a strong budget allowed for some tangible relief. Petrol indexation was abolished. Petrol is now 17.7c per litre less than it would otherwise have been. The coalition did that.
Petrol is now hurting Australians in every walk of life and in every part of the nation. There is only one way that an Australian government can actually do anything decisive about the price of petrol and that is to cut taxes. So, tonight, I propose a cut in fuel excise of 5c a litre. This is a modest but meaningful way of helping all Australians—families, small businesses, pensioners and working people—so dependant on their cars. Ninety per cent of Australian households have a car. Right now, they all need help—real help. The coalition believes it responsible and fair to return a further $1.8 billion back to hardworking everyday Australians in the form of a 5c a litre reduction in the fuel excise.
By lowering the price of petrol and the cost of transporting goods, this 13 per cent reduction in petrol excise will also have a modest, but measurable downward impact on inflation. This is in stark contrast to the tax increases under Labor which, as I have outlined, will have an impact on the CPI upwards of 0.4 per cent. The coalition is serious about reducing price and inflation pressures. Labor talks; the coalition acts. This is a real tax cut in the best traditions of the Liberal and National parties.
It was the Keating Labor government that put 5c onto the excise in 1993. We opposed it. I challenge the Rudd Labor government to help us take it out in 2008. This is not a review, it is not a committee, it is not a summit, it is not an idea to have a meeting—it is a decision. It is decisive action.
Small family businesses are the backbone of the nation. Indeed, it is one of the pillars of Liberal belief—men and women taking a risk, borrowing money to create or buy a small business and employing other Australians. Few things are more important to our way of life and our future prosperity. Get the conditions right for small business and employment will flourish and businesses will grow. We believe in encouraging and rewarding hard work. The tax system should not stifle innovation and Australians who are prepared to have a go.
Therefore, we are announcing tonight a major reduction in capital gains tax for small business. The current 15-year rule with respect to waiving capital gains tax on the sale of a small business entity on retirement from age 55 was an incentive to small business introduced by the coalition in government. To further encourage small business men and women to invest in establishing or taking over a small business, the coalition will introduce a five-year rule for capital gains tax on sale of the business for retirement. After owning and operating a small business for five years, we believe you should be entitled to capital gains tax relief should you sell your business for retirement. You will be rewarded, as you should, for your hard work, determination and sacrifice.
Education is our future. The centralised fund proposed by Labor for school infrastructure cannot replace ‘parent power’. Parent groups and school principals will always know what their school needs much better than a clipboard-carrying bureaucrat who turns up from a centralised education department. The government has scrapped our Investing in Our Schools Program. These direct grants to schools made a big difference to improved buildings, classrooms, playgrounds and upgraded technology. The coalition will reinstate it. We will get them moving again. The government speaks of a so-called ‘education revolution’ in delivering more computers to schools, while ignoring the added costs to parents and schools of connection, of maintenance and of training.
The single most important influence in the life of a child, apart from a parent, is their teacher. But no teacher can teach what they do not know. The standard of teacher training in Australia must be improved. It is unacceptably low. Higher standards in universities mean higher standards in classrooms. In this, we are failing. The coalition commits to education reform, so essential to our economic and social development. The coalition will require a number of conditions on Australian universities before they receive a dollar in public funding if they are training teachers. Entry scores to undergraduate teaching degrees at Australian universities are embarrassingly and pathetically low. The minimum university entrance score must be higher for entry to an education degree and will be formally set as a condition of funding.
Science, humanities and social science departments will be required to set and/or accredit relevant course content and assessment in education faculties. All trainee teachers will be taught how to teach children to read using proven techniques, including phonics based instruction. They must also be taught and assessed in basic sciences, mathematics, English and history. University education faculties will be required to appoint high-quality classroom teachers to their academic staff as tutors and lecturers. We need more classroom teachers teaching in our universities and less social engineers. This will assist in lifting the status of teaching as a profession and it will bring a greater practical focus to the training of teachers. To attract our best graduates into teaching, we must provide quality teachers with access to increased pay. Like any other profession, teachers should be rewarded and recognised on merit, as assessed by their peers. Better teachers deserve better pay. There can be no place for mediocrity when it comes to the future of the nation’s teachers, yet that is tolerated in too many of our teacher training institutions. This is an education revolution.
The Prime Minister has repeatedly told the House that he would reduce the financial stress of carers by providing them with ongoing secure support. The budget has failed carers. The carers bonus, introduced by the Howard government, is only being paid this year because the Labor government was shamed into action. Devastatingly for carers, however, there is no commitment in the budget papers to pay it in future years. These men and women, these carers, are the window into our humanity. Their work is done on behalf of all Australians. What modest support they receive from government should be recognised as a wage that saves Australian taxpayers in the order of $30 billion a year. Tonight, I give all Australian carers my commitment that we will use the government’s inquiry to ensure equitable funding to carers in reflection of the work that they do on our behalf.
Australian seniors feel let down that the federal budget does very little to ease their cost-of-living pressures when they have done so much to build this country. That is why we will not support Labor’s changes to the income test for the Commonwealth seniors health card, which will leave thousands of seniors without a health card when they need it most.
In addressing the future and the course of our nation, we need to identify and respond effectively to five key challenges. The first is the prosperity of our nation. How can we hand to the next generation a level of prosperity of which we can be proud and in which they can have confidence? This will mean taxation reform—not just simplification but lower taxes overall—and we have already begun that process. Further, how can we prosper when this budget cuts investment in research and development and swings cuts through the CSIRO?
The second challenge that we face is that of the Federation. It is very important for every one of us to ask ourselves in this the 21st century: how can we make the Federation work more effectively for our country in the interest of Australians? It will require all of us, in a mature and sober way, to examine the constitutional arrangements and responsibilities of the three tiers of government—who is responsible for what, how the money is raised and then how it is distributed.
The third challenge is that of the environment. We, as Australians and as global citizens, need to begin to live on environmental interest instead of environmental capital. It is time that we focused on water and food security as much as on anything else. Further, Australia alone cannot solve climate change, but we can do enormous environmental and economic damage to our future if we get this wrong.
The fourth challenge for us in our future is that of the security of our nation—the defence and protection not only of our country but of, increasingly, our people, our interests and the values for which we stand throughout the world.
The fifth challenge is to ensure that we are a cohesive society—to make sure that we see drug use, alcohol abuse and illiteracy not only as a human but as an economic issue. We must see the existential despair and state of 90,000 Aboriginal people living in remote parts of this country and many other things such as gambling addiction as being no less important to us in our future than getting our economic fundamental absolutely right, upon which, ultimately, success will depend. Before the next election we will announce policy to shape the future that we want as Australians. We are an opposition, but we are also an alternative government.
Our beliefs are in the individual, in the encouragement of, and rewards for, hard work and self-sacrifice in everyday life. We believe very strongly in the family as the bedrock of Australian society, while respecting and reaching out to every other Australian, whatever their economic or personal circumstances.
We believe in choice. We believe Australians should be encouraged and supported in choice in health and education. Equally, they should be free to join a union or not to join a union.
We believe strongly in defence and security and investment in it for the protection of our nation. We believe very strongly that small family businesses are the lifeblood of our nation and its economic prosperity. We believe always in lower taxes, once our obligations to society in health, education, road infrastructure, defence and other requirements have been met.
We believe ultimately in the individual. We believe that the inherent worth of every single Australian is paramount and that our task as Liberals and as Nationals is to stand against oppressive bureaucracy and governments that too often—and under this new government—appear to think that they know what is best for Australians, instead of leaving choices and freedoms in the hands of individuals who actually make this country work.
We believe we will be at our best as a nation if we see ourselves and strive to be an outward-looking, highly competitive and compassionate people, reconciled with our Indigenous history and imbued with fundamental values of hard work, self-sacrifice, courage, tolerance and a determination to see that we support one another, that we respect our freedoms and stand up for the rights, values and freedoms of not only all Australians but all people throughout the world.",SENATE,<title>BUDGET</title>,<title>Statement and Documents</title>,Budget,44,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2008-05-15,"—Like most Australians, I have looked forward to this, the first budget of the Rudd government. The economy is booming, the new government has plenty of revenue, and it seemed likely that the serious problems of climate change; water and skills shortages; underfunding of early childhood development, public schools and universities; poor health and housing in Indigenous communities; and the lack of investment in infrastructure—to name just a few—would at last be fixed. The new Prime Minister promised a visionary and bold platform of reform and nation building. The other message that we had been hearing for weeks before the orchestrated leaks was that this budget would be tough, with lots of savage cuts in spending—cuts that were made necessary to ward off the risk of inflation to working families. That did not quite turn out to be the case.
For 2008-09, spending will actually increase by $297 billion—$10 billion up on the previous year—but income in the same period will rise by over $15 billion. The budget is big on handouts, which may well be inflationary. There is little by way of structural reform, too little is being spent on urgent problems like climate change and water, and the money is available far too late. The election promises have certainly been delivered, however ill advised, like the $47 billion in tax cuts, most of it to high-income earners, and the tax rebates for school expenses that also make the tax system more complex—the $5.7 billion for school computers and trade blocks that were certainly not the highest priority of schools. The budget displaces some of the vote-winning stunts of the previous government: summer schools and bonuses for teachers that were driven by a government keen to suggest that a lot of teachers needed retraining and keen to bring in quasi performance pay.
Childcare rebates will be lifted to 50 per cent of a cap that has been almost doubled to $7,500 and paid quarterly. The Democrats support this initiative. In fact, we would sooner see it even higher. But neither this nor the A to E grading on childcare centres will fund better pay and training for childcare staff. We strongly support national standards, but these must improve quality through better trained and paid staff. We see no measure to deal with the shortage of childcare places in inner urban areas where land prices are high and shortages are acute. We hope that the $114.5 million spread over four years to build 38 of the promised 260 new childcare centres will address this problem, but at this rate of funding it will take a quarter of a century to reach the government’s target. We welcome the Jobs, Education and Training Child Care Fee Assistance now covering two years of approved study. The previous restriction to 12 months severely limited the capacity of single parents to finish most courses of study.
In the bigger picture, there is plenty of money for projects, and deficits and government debt are a thing of the past. Over $30 billion in surpluses for the next two years alone will go into the Building Australia Fund. Ten billion dollars is there for new medical technology, research facilities and hospitals, but none of it will be spent before 2009. The Howard government’s $5 billion Higher Education Endowment Fund will be more than doubled and renamed the Education Investment Fund, but it now covers vocational institutions and research organisations, and the capital can be tapped as well as the interest.
The Commonwealth will return to funding its own big-scale road, rail and ports, and fast broadband to 98 per cent of the population—perhaps a new era in investing in Australia’s long-term future needs. The Democrats strongly agree with this objective. We have been calling for it for years. We just hope that future governments do not sell off these new assets as readily as they have airports, the Commonwealth Bank, Telstra and the like. We would sooner see the telecommunications network in public hands, fibre to the node and all, and healthy competition in service delivery instead of the monopolistic monster which was created by privatising our once public carrier.
We are deeply disappointed that over 90 per cent of transport funding will be blown on roads, with freight rail getting the leftovers and public transport getting zilch. Labor seems to have forgotten that it signed off on a Senate inquiry recommendation eight years ago that called for funding for new and improved public transport and FBT reform to encourage its use. It ignored too the recommendation for greenhouse abatement to be incorporated in transport policies and taxation. As we know, Infrastructure Australia does not have an obligation to investigate greenhouse in its deliberations on transport or any other infrastructure.
One of the reasons the government coffers are awash with cash is the resources boom, much of it in the Top End, and yet there is no funding for social infrastructure in places where that cash is being generated. An extra $33 billion of tax revenue is expected from increased commodity prices in 2008-09 alone, but it is not returning to these areas. Wages in the Pilbara, for instance, are very high to overcome the difficulties in living there. The opportunities that urban dwellers take for granted like shops, theatres, libraries, pools and housing choices are just missing.
There were cuts, certainly, worth $6 billion to $7 billion. The bureaucracy will pay with a $1.8 billion dividend efficiency. Cancelling the welfare access card nets $1.2 billion. Cancelling the OPEL contract brings in a billion dollars. Health lost about $2.6 billion, not all of which seems sensible—but there is little detail other than the cuts to GP payments, pathology, after-hours clinics, research, and advertising campaigns. The dental health scheme worth $500 million for 150,000 people with chronic illness is being scrapped in favour of one for teenagers and for public waiting lists. Small business and employment programs have been cut back, including the Commercial Ready program of grants to small and medium enterprises for research and innovation—which seems at odds with government claims of encouraging smart industries.
A lot of the cuts are from means testing, and we tentatively welcome this departure from the previous government’s ‘cheque’s in the mail’ handouts to all, including the wealthy. The baby bonus will come fortnightly from January next year, which is probably not such a bad thing. It and the family tax benefit part B will not go to those families that earn over $150,000, despite Labor’s promise that the threshold would be $250,000. That $150,000 threshold now also applies to tax breaks for workers supporting a dependent spouse, housekeeper, invalid relative, parents or parents-in-law.
We welcome the baby bonus being extended to adoptive parents for children over two—a win for my colleague Senator Stott Despoja, who has campaigned for this for some time. But there is still no publicly funded maternity leave, and I wonder how big the surplus has to be to make $590 million a year affordable—or is there some other objection to giving women in Australia entitlements that are taken for granted in other countries? Women are—rightly, I think—asking how come the means testing mostly affects them and their family responsibilities while measures such as the abolition of tax on retirement income mostly benefit men.
Men are certainly more likely to buy expensive cars, which now are to be taxed at a higher rate of 33 per cent. But surely it would be more strategic to tax according to energy waste rather than dollars, like so many other more enlightened countries do. The photovoltaic panel rebate stays at $8,000, but we were shocked to hear that this is now to be means tested to an absurdly low household income of $100,000. As a non-essential item, PVs are still very expensive at around $16,000. According to solar companies that have contacted me today, 85 per cent of those who have put them on their roofs so far have family incomes of over that amount. The $10,000 in low-interest loans does not come on stream for another 12 months, and solar installers are saying that their clients are dropping off like flies since the means-testing announcement. This is a very serious mistake, and it will be a complete disaster for the industry unless it is reversed—and immediately.
The education revolution in schools mostly consists of capital works, computers and literacy programs, but it does not address the shortfall in per capita funding for running schools, the funding disparity between primary and secondary schools or the inequitable private school funding formula that becomes more irrational every year as more and more schools are given exemption from it.
We look forward to seeing the details of the government’s $577 million literacy and numeracy programs. These need to be spent on effective and flexible programs to deal with a wide range of problems that children have in learning. It is not enough to test children to see where they are in comparison with their peers; we need to understand why it is they do not learn at the same rate as them—and sometimes that will not matter because they will catch up. In other cases, learning difficulty and disability will dog them throughout their schooling unless there are effective interventions.
We are pleased to see 44,000 new scholarships, the abolition of full-fee degrees and incentive for students to study and teach maths, science and nursing—but that is it for student support. The $500 million one-off cash injection in 2007-08 to help universities rebuild campus infrastructure is a very good start, but the backlog of deferred maintenance across the sector is estimated to be in the order of $2 billion. There is no money to revitalise student services and organisations that have almost disappeared under voluntary student unionism, and the government’s review seems to have come to nothing. Labor, like the last government, is not addressing the inadequate indexation of university grants, and this will continue to eat into any gains in the headline level of funding allocated to universities.
There are incentive payments to the states of $200 million a year for three years for elective surgery as long as they meet targets on reduced waiting times, but there is still no decision on how the Commonwealth underfunding of the health care agreements for hospitals will be dealt with. The states will be given a billion dollars in the budget to tide them over.
We welcome the threshold increase for the Medicare surcharge. We doubt the private health insurance industry doomsday claims but even if there was a drop of 400,000 members—just four per cent—they would cease to prop up a very expensive health system. We are disappointed that the government has stuck with its 30 per cent private health insurance rebate. This costs us $4 billion a year—money that would be far better spent on the public system. We welcome the $275 million for GP superclinics and hope these are not more of the same fee-for-service arrangements but instead provide integrated primary care in places that most need it.
The National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission disappears next year—or at least the funding to it does—instead of being an ongoing body with standing committees monitoring the difficult and mostly invisible areas of, for instance, Indigenous health, mental health and aged care. Most Indigenous health spending is a follow-up on the Northern Territory intervention, and most of it finishes next year. It needs to be asked why these measures should not be introduced across the country, because problems also exist in Aboriginal communities in other states. Indeed, Professor Altman points out that the child abuse notification rates in the Northern Territory are about half of those of the national Indigenous average.
Of the 37 new measures identified to help begin the process of closing the gap, the major ones are previous government commitments. A lot of the money goes to government business managers, $31 million; income management, $64 million; and the task force reviewing the intervention, $34 million—but this compares with a mere half a million dollars for consultation on a new national representative body.
There are small sums for child and maternal health services, and it is good that night patrol services, youth alcohol diversion programs, follow-up health care and the promotion of law and order are to be funded.
The Minister for Health and Ageing was presented with a worthy proposal to fund a mobile health unit targeting women’s reproductive health services in very remote communities, which would help prevent the very high death rates from breast and gynaecological cancer. But I do not see this in any of the budget papers.
It is clear that properly investing in Indigenous community health centres and better support for remote area nurses is crucial, and for less than $30 million eye diseases like trachoma could be wiped out in just three years. Thirty per cent of Aboriginal kids in Katherine, 16 per cent in rural Darwin and 53 per cent in the Pilbara have trachoma. A lot of them will go on to have irreversible blindness. The government has a proposal to fix this from the Centre for Eye Research, which has great expertise in this area, but it continues to ignore it. Even Niger, the poorest country in Africa, is controlling its trachoma with an active intervention program—but not us.
We say a large chunk of the new $10 billion health fund should have been earmarked for Aboriginal primary health care, and we support ANTaR’s call for capacity building in Aboriginal health programs.
The $780 million for dental health is a good investment, but it falls short of an overall long-term plan, and the government will need to insist on better accountability from the states for success in delivering timely treatment.
The government has kept and increased slightly the conditional adjustment payment for aged care, which will be welcomed by the industry, but it is only a stopgap measure. And there should be an obligation to the nurses in aged care, who currently earn $20,000 a year less than their colleagues in other sectors.
There is nothing extra in the budget for mental health, despite the yawning gaps in services, particularly in supported accommodation, early intervention and services for young people, as our inquiry is discovering. Some of the previous package is certainly improving services, but it is still only eight per cent of the health budget, a lot less than its 14 per cent of the disease burden.
The MBS item has taken out the bulk of the 2006 health funding, and yet there is inadequate monitoring or analysis of its success.
We warmly welcome the $85 million for perinatal depression. It is irresponsible to have had so little by way of services and support for women and their babies at this vulnerable time at this point.
It would have been good to have seen money for building expertise in the treatment of many conditions that largely go untreated, like eating disorders.
The government persists in the idea that carers can be fobbed off with a bonus handout and a few more qualifying for the carer payment, but this is grossly unfair to individuals making great personal sacrifices in caring. Their contribution needs to be recognised, both to acknowledge their responsibilities and to reward them financially for the job they do and the $30 billion or so that they save governments every year.
Climate change action is now super urgent, but this is certainly not reflected in the budget. Most of the $2.3 billion for climate change will not be spent for four to six years. The budget is also littered with yet more solar pilot programs and small grants projects instead of measures that will deliver the fundamental shift needed to prepare us for the deep cuts we know are going to be necessary to avert the most dangerous climate change.
A mere $55.5 million of the $500 million renewable energy fund will be spent before 2010, and even clean coal, so-called, will only see $158.4 million spent in that time. Whatever you think about the prospects of carbon capture and storage from coal-fired power stations and the public funds being spent on finding the technology that can do it cheaply, this does not suggest that the government or the industry is in any sort of hurry.
There are literally gigawatts of renewable energy projects—solar, thermal, wind—ready to build and to invest in, but those commitments will not be made unless the new increase in the MRET is started this year instead of 2010. The previous target was met four years early, and waiting unnecessarily another two years loses momentum as well as capacity building in the manufacturing industry here.
We need a thorough overhaul of the tax system and the energy and transport subsidies that currently encourage emissions at a time when we must start abating. The green car fund, worth $500 million, is deferred until 2011. We urge the government to use this fund not just for incentives for hybrid petrol-electric vehicles but also for the so far small-scale local importers and converters of vehicles that are fully electric plug-in cars, scooters and motorbikes.
Transport congestion in cities imposes huge costs on business and citizens alike, but despite this the building infrastructure fund will spend only $75 million on transport infrastructure this year. The tens of billions will not start flowing until the end of next year, and only a fraction of it will be spent on rail. We should be modernising track and road-rail interchanges to deliver a substantial shift in intercapital freight from road to rail and investing in public transport, particularly expanding rail services and transport nodes.
On the Murray-Darling, where major investment in water-saving infrastructure is urgently needed, $400 million was announced, but half the spending is next year. Money is being poured into new water sources like desalination, despite the high cost and high energy use of these plants. Spending on water licences, buybacks and conservation of water is minimal and there is nothing to suggest the Murray will get its promised 1,500 gigalitres of water back.
There is a tiny subsidy for rainwater tanks and greywater treatment units for a small percentage of the population—nothing like the national fund needed to drive investment in effluent treatment and reuse, stormwater harvesting, efficient irrigation or household incentives to collect, reuse and save water.
The Democrats give credit to the government for its progress on tax reform and in taking major steps towards a less wasteful and more equitable tax system, but it is apparent to us from this budget that the government has deferred many of the hard decisions. Tax cuts will cost $47 billion over four years. The low-income tax offset goes from $750 to $1,200 from 1 July, but tax will still be paid by people earning just $20,000 a year in 2011. We say the tax-free threshold should now be raised to $20,000 and the rates indexed.
It is disappointing that there has not been any progress on reforming capital gains tax or negative gearing.
First home buyers will get a 17 per cent contribution for the first $5,000 deposited in a first home saver account each year. It remains to be seen whether this will just add to the price of new houses. There is also a $623 million fund for landlords to lower rents for those on low incomes. We hope this works better than the rent assistance that is available in keeping rents affordable.
It is troubling to see $512 million for freeing up land for housing. This usually means greenfield sites on the outskirts of our already sprawling cities where there are no services and people are locked into driving for hours to get to work and school. We would like to see a renewed interest in building regional populations and increasing the density of our cities around good transport and services rather than endlessly spreading our cities.
There is no excuse for the government to delay lifting its overseas aid budget to 0.5 per cent of GDP in 2008-09, rather than waiting for five years, and it must reach 0.7 per cent soon after that. The projected sea level rises will displace hundreds of millions of the poorest people on earth. Our overseas aid budget will have to be higher in the future unless we act now on climate change.
We also need to see far more spending on reproductive health. Our nearest neighbours, Timor and Papua New Guinea, both desperately need this assistance. In Timor, 660 women die for every 100,000 births, compared with just eight in Australia. In PNG, that number is 300. Five Australian babies die per 1,000 born, but in Timor the number is 82 and in PNG it is 65. Only nine per cent of couples in Timor have access to contraception, and it is little wonder that they have on average almost eight children per woman—much higher than in the poorest African countries. The Millennium Development Goals cannot be delivered unless Australia increases its aid to these countries for health and education.
The government’s caring for country program ought to be for maintaining biodiversity. Aside from funds to conserve the Tasmanian devil, however, and to tackle the cane toad menace, the budget gives little for the systematic and comprehensive protection of threatened species and habitats. Australia has 1,800 threatened species that face impending extinction. While welcoming the $180 million for the national reserve system and the $200 million for the Great Barrier Reef Rescue Plan, we cannot see any initiatives on biodiversity conservation in the budget.
We welcome the $2.8 million over two years for public consultation on the need for a human rights charter, but we query whether this is a realistic sum, given the government has pledged to consult far and wide with communities across Australia who are at most risk of having their rights breached. There is unfortunately no significant funding to increase legal aid, despite the fact that the National Legal Aid council says there is an urgent need for an injection of $156 million for a properly funded system.
There are a host of other items missing from this budget, including assistance for people with disabilities, especially those who are young and in nursing homes. There is nothing for the underfunded ABC or SBS. There is nothing to help sole parents caught in the Welfare to Work trap. There is very little for many single age pensioners, mainly female, who will have little or no extra income. There is nothing to increase the superannuation savings of women compared with those of men. Overall, we say the first Rudd budget is too tentative to deal with the serious issues that are facing our country.",SENATE,<title>BUDGET</title>,<title>Statement and Documents</title>,Budget,44,1
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2008-05-15,"—The arctic ice and the Saudi Arabian oilfields seem a long way from Australia and Prime Minister Rudd’s 2008 budget. But they should be at the forefront of our minds as we consider what a real leader, a leader contemplating the state of the world and the wellbeing of all people, would have delivered for our nation in his first budget. Leadership means having the courage and imagination to face up to the challenges of the time and to formulate a vision worthy of the people, their future and the situation in which they find themselves. It means presenting that vision in such a compelling way that people are inspired to be part of it.
Faced with the fear and crises of the Cold War and the space race, President Kennedy captured the imagination of his country when he announced that America would put a man on the moon within the decade. He could not have known if the moon mission would be successful in a decade or how much it would cost, but he united Americans around a goal that fired their imagination and he succeeded. The same can be said of Churchill, when he exhorted Britons with those famous words, ‘We will fight them on the beaches,’ during the Second World War. The cost of not winning, the loss of freedom and a way of life, made losing unthinkable in both cases, and the people lifted.
The summer arctic ice melt and the depleting oil reserves are representative of the social and economic catastrophe that we now face from global warming and peak oil—every bit as compelling as the challenge faced by Churchill and Kennedy. The evidence is now clear that slow and steady action is a recipe for ongoing disaster. We are already experiencing dangerous climate change and may have passed peak oil. If we are to avoid catastrophe, we must not only reduce emissions but halve them by 2020 and cut them to net zero as soon as we can. We must build a new postcarbon economy and society and we must do it now.
Henry David Thoreau once wrote: ‘In the long run, men hit only what they aim at. Therefore, though they should fail immediately, they’d better aim at something high.’ If we try, perhaps we will succeed, and at worst we will fall short of the target. But if we do not try we will certainly fail. A true leader would try. The 2008 budget demonstrates that we do not have a leader, a Prime Minister, equal to the task. We have a manager for business-as-usual times when we have already gone beyond business-as-usual times. We have an accountant when we needed a fiscal visionary.
This budget props up Third World economic vulnerabilities by selling off our natural capital. The government’s expenditures, taxes and subsidies undermine instead of unleash knowledge based industries and intelligent green growth. This budget’s plan for selling off natural assets does not represent a strategy for responsible financial positioning. Giving the community a few more dollars in tax relief to slightly reduce the significantly higher costs of petrol, food and energy, driven in large part by climate change and oil depletion, whilst living and working in the same ways, does not deal with the problem. Superficial promises to cut the excise simply delays the action that we need to take in oil proofing the country to address the underlying causes of high food and fuel prices.
The world as we know it is already permanently physically changed. It is shocking to know that by 2013 growing scientific evidence suggests there will be no arctic summer ice and the magnificent polar bear and numerous other species will be close to extinct in the wild. The risk of the thermohaline ocean conveyor slowing or stopping is heightened. The age of cheap, easily accessible oil is over not only because we are running out but also because we cannot afford to keep on using it if we are to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. There is no going back. But how we go forward will determine whether we experience a future that delivers positive benefits for people and communities or one that delivers poverty, scarcity and conflict.
Prime Minister Rudd gave Australians the impression that he understood the urgency and magnitude of climate change when he acknowledged that it is the greatest moral and economic imperative of our time. Addressing climate change was a key element of his election appeal. But now it is clear that the Rudd government is just as negligent as the Howard government. Global warming is not just another budget item. Oil costs are not just a figure in the current account deficit. It is a figure that will grow to $25 billion by 2015 and beyond.
Global warming and oil depletion represent the biggest challenges that we will face in our lifetime. But they also represent the greatest opportunities to make our lives not only different but better. What is required is total transformation of our way of life and the economy that underpins it. As the UN Secretary-General, Mr Ban Ki Moon, said prior to the Bali United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change conference:
We have experienced several great economic transformations ... the industrial revolution, the technology revolution, our modern era of globalization. Now we are on the threshold of another revolution—the age of green economics.
He then went on to call on nations to fight global warming and promote that transformation.
There is an emerging consensus that nations and corporations that fail to understand this imperative will lose competitive advantage while those that grasp the new opportunities it offers will prosper. Australia is well on track to losing competitive advantage, not because we are not blessed with fantastic natural advantages, not because we do not work hard or because we do not have the capacity to be different, but because we fail to grasp that imperative and that opportunity. As Albert Einstein said, ‘The world will not evolve past its current state of crisis by using the same thinking that created the situation.’
We know we need to change. We are materially better off than generations who have gone before, but is the price worth it? We are already living the rat race that people who fought for and won the eight-hour day would not believe possible. We have given up weekends in the name of productivity and efficiency. We have to work harder and longer for bigger houses full of stuff that we do not need and which are literally costing us the earth. Our children have to work to get themselves through university and are then saddled with HECS debts. And our aged are lonely and undersupported with families who have little time to visit or care for them. How fair or sensible is it for people to go to bed with their mobile phones and be required to be available 18 hours a day? Tired people are unhappy people, yet so many adults and children go to work and school in the dark and get home in the dark, having wasted four hours or more in traffic jams. How many of us do not know our neighbours and have no time to walk anywhere or grow anything in our gardens? How many of us can offer to do community voluntary work or play amateur sport and engage in and be part of the local community? We live day to day with a nagging uneasiness about living in a rich society where many are poor, homeless and sick. How many of us buy our families more consumer goods to make up for the time that we cannot spend with them? How many of us regret that fruit and vegetables come from all over the world when local farmers are struggling to survive? How many people, when asked, answer that what would make them happy is more time? The treadmill seems inescapable.
But the surplus generated by the resources boom has given us a one-off opportunity to change. And global warming and oil depletion make it impossible not to do so. Australia has a choice. All that is holding us back is the lack of imagination and the political will to change. What needed to happen in the budget was for the government to fund a vision for transformation, but instead it squandered both the opportunity and the surplus in tax cuts, reduced services and slashed research. Whilst there are education, health and infrastructure funds, there is no climate fund, with nothing for disaster readiness. We have spent $10 billion on counterterrorism since September 11 but only $500 million on emergency relief capability. We are not immune in Australia from massive natural disasters caused by climate change. As one of the wealthiest countries in the region, Australia should establish a global disaster relief centre to coordinate civil and military aid responses to disasters like cyclones, floods, bushfires, earthquakes and tsunamis at home and abroad. Imagine how we would be feeling today if we had a real vision for a sustainable future such as that painted by the Greens. Imagine if the Prime Minister, through his Treasurer, had said what a Greens Prime Minster would say. Here is what we would have heard:
‘We as a world and a nation are living beyond our ecological limits and suffering global warming and oil depletion. Our land is sick and, in spite of our surpluses, in spite of being materially better off than our forebears, we are not as healthy or happy as we could be. We need to aim for a higher quality of life—to be happier, healthier and more fulfilled with greater environmental, social and economic resilience in the face of the challenges before us. It is time to face up to climate change, time to embark on a great new Australian initiative. It is time to make imagination Australia’s natural resource of the future. We must reconcile our humanity with our economics. We need transformation—a wave of environmental, social, technical and economic innovation that will touch every person, community and institution such that we change from a resource economy to a knowledge economy living in harmony with the land, rediscovering our connection to life. And we need it urgently. To that end my government, with your help, will make imagination the resource of the future. We will make Australia sustainable by 2020—ecologically, socially and economically sustainable by 2020.
We have delivered a transformative, enabling budget that will make it happen. To reach our goal of sustainability we will need every one of us to bring to the task all of the brainpower, innovation, creativity, and nation-building capacity that we can muster. We have designed a budget strategy that by 2020 will: (1) deliver all of Australia’s electricity from renewables; (2) maximise the energy efficiency to all of the nation’s businesses and industries and homes; (3) heal our country by ending the logging of the remaining native forests and clearing of savannahs, restoring and building resilience in ecosystems and maintaining the carbon they store; (4) redesign and revitalise Australia’s cities into urban villages linked by rapid mass transit and cycleways; and (5) produce more of our own food sustainably.
To do this we need a healthy society and a well-educated one. We need to increase our spending on education, research and innovation at every level from schools, TAFE colleges to universities and research institutions. We need free public preschool for all children, 12,000 new teachers, a 50 per cent increase in capital and maintenance investment, and a rise in teachers’ salaries. We need to make teachers, especially in the TAFE system, permanent again. A knowledge nation values its teachers even more than it values its sports stars or celebrities. After a decade of denigrating public schools, we need a national empowering public schools program to encourage and resource excellence and promote enrolment in local schools.
Local schools strengthen local communities, and local communities will be the backbone of a sustainable society. Sustainability must be incorporated into the curriculum and in all vocational courses. To rapidly achieve the transition to a postcarbon economy, we need every person to understand the values that underpin sustainability. This is not the time to slash $63 million from CSIRO funding. Science is critical to a sustainable future. We cannot drive a revolution on the scale we are talking about on a scale greater than the IT revolution, for example, without science and energised students.
We will abolish HECS. Instead of tax cuts for the rich, we will provide students with a living allowance so that no student is forced to work during term time. Doesn’t that make for happier families, healthier students and a better educated population? We will have national discussions about how we can work together to be healthier and happier and share the changes and workloads to achieve these goals in a way that reduces the gap between the rich and the poor, the overemployed and the underemployed. We need to come to a national consensus about how we can have a higher quality of life by redesigning our homes, communities, cities and workplaces and our ways of life to be more sustainable.
The future is ours for the making. We embrace the challenge and look forward to 2020 when we will look back and say that we were the generation that set Australia on the path to the healthy, happy and authentically sustainable nation that it has become. We were the generation that did not disappoint our children or steal their future from them.’
Mr President, that is the speech Australians would have loved to hear. It would have drawn a line under the past and made the future hopeful and exciting, not daunting. But instead of such a speech, we had what can only be described as a tweaking of the parameters of imagination and thinking of the Howard years. Whilst there have been welcome changes to try to reduce the gap between the rich and poor and to alleviate additional costs of child care and energy, they can only be seen as token against the backdrop of the tax cuts. The increased tax on luxury cars will be offset for the rich many times over by the huge take-home pay hike for the wealthy as they pocket their tax cuts. The 30 per cent private health insurance rebate, costing almost $5 billion a year, has not been touched.
A person on $300,000 will take home $91 a week more, whilst a person earning $30,000 will take home only $11. One tank of petrol or one visit to the supermarket will absorb that and more for a low-income earner. If the government was serious about a more equitable society, it would have seriously addressed inequity by not proceeding with tax cuts for those earning over $75,000. The Greens will move to amend the budget accordingly.
The current disparity between what the rich get and what low-income earners get is stark when you consider that, by 2011-12, the cost of superannuation tax concessions will exceed the cost of the age pension. How can any Labor member of this parliament justify that? To suggest that a one-off energy payment will satisfy pensioners’ needs is dishonest. The age pension is inadequate and must be increased.
While the one-off payment to carers is welcomed, because anything is better than nothing, the government have failed to deal with the long-term wellbeing of carers. They urgently need an increase in carer payment and a scheme to address their long-term disadvantage, for instance, in superannuation. We cannot say that our society is sustainable if carers’ vital work, impacting on their own mental and physical wellbeing, puts them in the lowest social wellbeing index.
To address gambling or alcohol abuse we must ensure that taxes are returned to address the problems generated. The $10 billion dollar alcohol abuse problem will not be minimised by filling government coffers with an undirected alcopop tax but by redirecting that taxation revenue to education, counselling, access to services and by banning advertising. That is what the Greens seek to do.
Funding for Indigenous people does not match the government’s rhetoric, nor adequately addresses what needs to be done. Around $450 million per year is needed for health if we have any hope of closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, yet in this budget the spending is only $250 million for all programs and most of that is misdirected through the government’s discriminatory, ill-targeted Northern Territory intervention, spending another $69 million for administration of the failing income quarantining debacle.
The nation is in surplus. Surely now is the time to invest in making it fairer. Whilst certainly not a Green budget, this is not even a traditional Labor budget. It will benefit the already wealthy without addressing the underlying causes of increased costs of food, petrol, and energy which hurt everyone, but which disproportionately hurt those who are already struggling.
So what of the five headlines of a green budget needed to deliver a sustainable Australia? How did they fare under the Rudd budget? Instead of hearing a vision that all of Australia’s electricity will come from renewables by 2020, we heard a deathly silence on commercialisation or rollout of renewable energy technologies. The Greens say: can we do this by 2020? Yes, we can. Ask yourself whether, in 1995, only 13 years ago, you would have thought it possible to have the world wired for instant global communication or that our lives would revolve around instant messaging received by telephones in our pockets. But a renewably powered Australia by 2020 will not happen by paying lip-service to renewable energy technologies and giving $500-plus million to support a coal technology that does not exist and has no prospect of delivering any significant emission reductions by 2020.
What should have happened is as the Greens have advocated—a bold emission reduction target for 2020, the establishment of a ‘sun fund’ of $3 billion over 10 years to drive research development and commercialisation, as well as the introduction of a feed-in tariff to support these technologies that are ready to go but are not as cheap as wind. A bill such as the one I introduced today is what is needed.
The 20 per cent mandatory renewable energy target is a good start but should have been at least 25 per cent. It currently is most effective for wind energy but has to be supplemented by a feed-in tariff for the technologies that are market ready but not yet the least-cost technology. The fact that the government do not understand renewable energy or the realities of large-scale rollout of the technologies or the barriers to market readiness is no better demonstrated than by their rush, within 24 hours of the budget, to try to fix the mess they have made by giving everything to clean coal in 2008-09 and by flagging that they will patch the gap by shifting $40 million from the Energy Innovation Fund which was previously committed to solar energy storage and hydrogen technologies and redirecting it to assist geothermal energy companies with ongoing drilling costs.
Why is the government trying to divide and rule the renewables sector by taking from solar to give to geothermal when it should have taken the funds from the coal industry’s pipedream? Has the government decided to destroy the solar sector? Any preliminary analysis or even a conversation with the industry would have revealed that means testing rooftop photovoltaics would lead to a complete collapse, and so it is already happening. Within 24 hours of Minister Garrett’s myopia, solar companies are already calling my office, reporting that potential customers have indicated that they will not be proceeding with photovoltaics. There is serious speculation of industry-wide collapse, taking down the government’s Solar Cities program on the way out. This is amateur hour for the government, and it will have to reverse it. Did the government even consult the renewable energy sector, or were Ministers Garrett, Ferguson and Wong too busy meeting with the coal companies to make time?
Another Green headline: maximising energy efficiency across the country, from huge industrial complexes to offices and to every home by 2020. Yes, it is a big idea. It is a climate winner, an expansive jobs and manufacturing industry driver, and it is achievable. The Greens have put forward a series of policies that would, given a sufficient investment, drive systemic change of this kind across Australia. The first, the Energy Efficiency Access and Savings Initiative, or EASI, would retrofit all of Australia’s 7.4 million homes over the course of a decade, rolling out home energy audits, providing the service and paying the up-front cost, which would be recouped through savings on energy bills. EASI would require an up-front investment from the government that, at its peak, would reach $22 billion. But it would more than repay itself, not only through direct repayments but also through deferred investment in new power stations and electricity grid infrastructure, reduced emissions and greater household amenity.
We also have EASI programs, energy efficient programs, driving energy efficiency in commercial buildings across Australia and in large industrial complexes, requiring them to implement the energy efficiency opportunities that they have identified in the audits that have been conducted to date. Instead of this, set against that bold vision, what Rudd Labor promised in the budget is a confused hodgepodge of small-scale investments targeted at achieving media coverage now, a few photo opportunities down the track and very little in the way of real emissions reductions. The Rudd government has broken an election promise to spend $225 million over three years to 2010-11; instead, committing only $126 million by that time.
The government’s green loans scheme is tokenism when what we need is systemic change. With only $240 million allocated, a third of it not to be spent until after the next election, it could give loans to as few as 24,000 households if each chooses to borrow at the top end of the $10,000 limit. The slow start, with no sense of urgency, means that as few as 1,360 homes could benefit in the next year and only 16,000 before this government’s term could be ended at the next election. What is more, by only providing financial support, it ignores the other well-known barriers to people taking up energy efficiency opportunities—namely, lack of information and lack of priority.
The Low Emission Plan for Renters is similarly tokenistic and ill thought out. With only a $500 rebate available for landlords to install insulation—less than half the cost in many cases—landlords still have very little incentive to save their tenants energy and money. It also has a slow and late start. Housing assistance is one way to permanently reduce costs for low-income earners. All new housing initiatives must meet high energy efficiency standards and be on public transport routes. Immediate housing affordability is not seriously addressed, as people are still struggling to find affordable rental properties or are struggling to pay their mortgages. The Clean Business Australia initiative, Climate Ready, the Green Building Fund and Re-Tooling for Climate Change are more of the same: piecemeal, minimally funded, with no sense of urgency.
Green headline 3: heal our country by ending the logging of the remaining native forests and the clearing of savannahs, restoring and building resilience in ecosystems and maintaining the carbon they store. This would be a climate and biodiversity winner, but instead the government continues to drive ecological destruction and the destruction of rural communities by slashing the environment budget and continuing to subsidise logging and the managed investment schemes that are destroying river systems and town water supplies as well as social harmony in rural Australia. The carbon and biodiversity tragedy of the loss of old-growth forests in Tasmania, Victoria and New South Wales can be sheeted home to the Rudd government just as much as to the Howard government. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts is just as responsible as his predecessor.
Under Rudd Labor, Collins Street farmers are set to own the water in our rivers and pay nothing for our groundwater. According to the government’s 2007 Tax Expenditures Statement, the tax deductibility of forestry managed investment funds will cost $140 million in 2008-09, $365 million in 2009-10 and $425 million in 2010-11. In other words, the Rudd government plans to pay the rich to destroy our ecosystems, forgoing almost a billion dollars over three years. Meanwhile, it is taking $50 million away from the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts and abolishing the Biodiversity Hotspots program.
Caring for our Country is ad hoc and non-strategic, with no increase in spending on the environment. It demonstrates that the government has failed to learn the positive and negative lessons of the Natural Heritage Trust. Once again, there is no understanding of the need for landscape-scale restoration or the urgency of the task. In the Murray-Darling Basin, for example, long-term targets for return of water to the Murray have still not been set and—amazingly—the Murray-Darling Basin plan does not come into effect until 2019. We will have a plan and no river. The much vaunted reform has not overcome the conflict between the states. The science says that 3,500 gigalitres of water must be returned to the system if it is to have any chance of recovery. When are we going to get it, Prime Minister?
Redesigning and revitalising Australia’s major cities into urban villages linked by rapid mass transit and cycleways is the Green’s fourth headline. This is not only a great climate idea, it goes to the heart of the stress and obesity crisis that we face. The Greens would invest heavily in public transport and redesign our cities to be people-friendly rather than car-friendly. We would allocate at least 25 per cent of the $22.3 billion AusLink 2 funding for 2009-10 through to 2013-14 to major infrastructure projects that shift people or freight off roads and onto more climate friendly alternatives. By 2014, the proportion of funding for low-polluting and mass transit options should be greater than that for roads. But it is certainly not going to be the case.
Imagine the difference to people’s quality of life if they could walk to work or cycle in their neighbourhoods and move between neighbourhoods on rapid transit. The oil crisis and the climate crisis make it critical that jobs are taken to where the people are, rather than move people to the jobs. This would mean that people have more time to enjoy their lives—they would be healthier, breathe cleaner air and get to know their neighbours. Instead, the Rudd government has invested only $78 million in dealing with congestion, and has continued with billions into roads and freeways. No government that takes peak oil or climate change seriously would spend only five per cent as much on rail as on road funding in the coming year. The government has not even had the courage to abolish the fringe benefits tax concession for motor vehicles, the cost of which will be about $1.6 billion in this financial year alone. Getting rid of it would have been a clear climate winner and behaviour change driver. If an equivalent tax concession was made for public transport, it would take people out of cars and on to public transport. Even with cars, we have no vehicle fuel efficiency standards, and the Rudd Green Car program, much spun and publicised, does not begin until 2011—after the next election.
The Greens would expand the AusLink funding guidelines to include urban, intrastate and interstate public transport infrastructure projects. We would ensure that AusLink’s corridor strategies would address the issues of oil vulnerability and greenhouse gas mitigation.
Finally, the Greens’ fifth headline for a sustainable Australia by 2020 is ‘going with our own food’. Imagine if Australians produced more of our own food and produced it sustainably. It is a high-level goal because it goes to the heart of our health and wellbeing, the interaction in our neighbourhoods and our interaction with our rural communities. The world’s food production systems are becoming increasingly frayed by ecological degradation and human rights abuses. Every Chinese frozen vegetable that finds its way into Australian mixed frozen vegetable packs is subsidised by environmental destruction and low wages. Extreme weather events will drive shortages as land is turned over to biofuels, cooking oils and plantation forests. In spite of the free trade mantra, countries are now declaring food emergencies. (Extension of time granted) We need a national food plan to deliver food security in the face of the collapse of global free trade markets, crop collapse because of drought, floods or fires and displacement by plantations. We need to understand our food better—where it comes from, what it takes to grow it and what carbon is embedded in it.
Just as the climate is approaching a tipping point, so too is society. Revolutions do not occur when people are ground down as in the Howard years—they occur when they expect things to be better and their hopes are dashed. The Australian people want us to aim high in addressing the overwhelming challenges of our time. They want of be part of the solutions. The Greens provide that vision and the new thinking that will actually solve these massive challenges. The climate will not wait for governments which cannot imagine a different world and neither should the people, for it is an uncharted, different world that we are now a part of.",SENATE,<title>BUDGET</title>,<title>Statement and Documents</title>,Budget,44,1
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2008-05-15,"—The Rudd government’s first budget has delivered the promised tax cuts for Australian working families, and families are happy for whatever help they can get to cope with higher interest rates and skyrocketing petrol and grocery prices. But the government has failed vulnerable Australians: it has failed those on a pension; it has failed families in the outer suburbs and regional areas; it has failed to address short-term inflationary pressures and it has failed to give families a real choice in child care. The government has also chosen to find savings from payments made to support and recognise families, thereby raising the concern that families and the vital service they provide to the community will continue to be seen as a target for future budget cuts.
Australia’s 3.4 million people on a pension are overlooked. These Australians are really struggling to make ends meet. That is why Family First wants to give all pensioners across the country an extra $70 a fortnight to cope with the skyrocketing cost of living. The increase should go to the 1.9 million Australians on the age pension, as well as those on the disability support pension, the parenting payment single, the carer payment and a number of other pensions. They are the most vulnerable people in our community.
So many pensioners are really struggling to make ends meet and need extra help to pay huge petrol and grocery bills and to just get by. The current pension rate is too low. Singles get $546 a fortnight, while couples get $456 a fortnight each. An extra $70 a fortnight would make a substantial difference. According to the St Vincent de Paul Society, age pensioners spend 30 per cent more on food as a proportion of their income than average households and are the hardest hit by soaring grocery prices.
Family First believes the Rudd government’s first budget should have cut petrol tax to put immediate downward pressure on inflation to help families with the ever-increasing cost of living. Craig James, the Chief Equities Economist at CommSec, said:
Petrol is the single biggest contributor to the current high inflation rate ...
We know that cutting petrol tax does two things: it puts downward pressure on inflation and it helps families to make ends meet. Petrol prices and inflation driven interest rates are two of the biggest impacts on family budgets. One of the most significant drivers of inflation has been, as I have mentioned, skyrocketing petrol prices. So why didn’t the Rudd government cut petrol tax by 10c a litre, as part of its billion dollar tax cuts, to put immediate downward pressure on inflation? More than 50c of the price of every litre of petrol goes to the government in tax. Petrol tax is one thing the government can control in trying to reduce inflation. Cutting petrol tax in the short term makes sense, but over the medium to longer term we need to significantly lift our investment in public transport to give people in the outer suburbs and regional areas an alternative to using their cars. Lower income people and first home buyers tend to live in the outer suburbs where housing is cheaper. But poor public transport means they depend on their cars, which means they suffer more from punishing petrol prices.
The federal government should have announced an investment in public transport infrastructure and capacity in the outer suburbs and regional areas on top of state government funding, building to a $1 billion annual fund. This would help families struggling with skyrocketing petrol prices and mortgage interest rates. Recent research on families living in the outer suburbs of Western Sydney found that they were spending three times the proportion of their gross household income on petrol compared to what people in the eastern suburbs of inner Sydney were spending. That was because people in the west were driving more than 20 times the distance that people in the inner suburbs were driving and, tellingly, because they did not have the same public transport options. Families in the outer suburbs of Melbourne and in the outer suburbs of cities across Australia are facing the same problems. How can they avoid petrol pain unless the government provides adequate public transport services to give them the option of not using their car?
Family First is passionate about caring for Australia’s environment to preserve it for our children to enjoy. That is why Family First welcomes the Rudd government’s initiative for workers and their families with the introduction of low-interest green loans. Family First also welcomes the National Clean Coal Fund, which will help reduce greenhouse emissions and secure jobs for thousands of workers and their families.
The government has also announced new means testing of family payments, including the baby bonus. The first reaction of most people is that all welfare payments should be means tested but these family payments were never meant to be welfare payments. Whilst Family First agrees that millionaires do not need access to these payments, treating family payments such as the baby bonus as welfare is a concern. Family First is concerned about the ultimate result of means testing important family payments. Once means testing starts, where does it stop? With birth rates still below replacement level, families who have children are actually helping Australia. These family payments also help with the greater expenses parents have in bringing up a family. Kids bring greater expenses whatever your income level.
The government has now means tested family tax benefit part B and the baby bonus, so they are not available to families earning more than $150,000 a year. Means testing families by their income level may sound good, but it ignores the number of children in a family. A family with three or four kids with a family income of $155,000 would not be entitled to either the baby bonus or family tax benefit part B and would be far worse off than a family on $150,000 with one kid. In this simple example the expenses of a family with more children is much greater, but that family is no longer entitled to family payment support. The government should, at the very least, make an allowance for the number of children a salary is supporting. Senators will remember that I come from a family of 16 children. I can tell you that if my parents had been fortunate enough to earn more than $150,000 they still would have had higher costs than most families.
The simple fact is that Australia needs children and families to grow and that most Australians of child-bearing age want to have children. But research by the Australian Institute of Family Studies shows that, even though couples want to have children, they do not have as many children as they would like. One key reason for this is that couples do not have confidence that they will have strong continuing support from the community. Family payments are one way of giving that community support.
The government provides many benefits to members of the community that are not made available on the basis of income alone, like universal access to health care, because these are important social goods for the community. All families, regardless of wealth, can send their children to public, government funded schools for a free education. They can also access free surgery in public hospitals. The difficulty with introducing a new means test is that, once you concede the principle, the cut-in level for the means test can always be moved further down the income scale. Once governments start to cut family payments, there is a temptation to make one more cut and another saving, and they may find it hard to stop. Family First is happy to look at better ways to deliver the money to families but is concerned about cutting the overall level of money available to families.
Treasurer Wayne Swan also says mothers in paid work will be helped in the budget by tax breaks and more money from the childcare tax rebate. It is great that mums in the paid workforce can expect more help from the government in the budget, but what about mums who have made a great financial sacrifice to stay at home? The Treasurer has talked about mothers who work to make our economy strong, but families do not work for the economy. The government should be making the economy work for families. A Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs study last year found that more than half the mothers in full-time paid work would prefer to work fewer hours. There needs to be a balance between work time and family time. What is the government doing to help families find that balance?
The government will increase the childcare tax rebate, which will help those families that can afford institutional child care, but what about those families that choose to use a family member or a friend and get no extra assistance in this budget? Why does the government restrict assistance to parents who choose centre based child care, rather than allowing parents to have a tax break for the type of child care they want? Only 20 per cent of parents choose formal care for their kids. Family First wants to give all families with children under five the same childcare payment every year so they can choose the child care they want, whether it is in-house care from a grandparent or neighbour or from a childcare centre. This would replace the childcare tax rebate, which only some parents can claim. Government policies must help all mothers, not just those the government wants to work to serve the economy.
Family First welcomes the government’s attempts to provide better medical care for our rural and regional communities by providing $4.6 million over the next four years to place more medical students in rural and remote communities as part of their training in the hope that they will return to the country after they have graduated. However, Family First does not think that this has gone far enough to help with the acute shortage of doctors in country Australia and calls on the government to adopt Family First’s doctor scholarships scheme. Under Family First’s plan, hundreds of free medical places would be offered, in exchange for a five-year commitment to work in regional and rural Australia.
Turning to the alcohol toll, one year ago, at the last budget, Family First raised the alcohol toll as a significant issue facing Australia. It costs Australia $15.3 billion a year to mop up after problems related to alcohol. I drink, and most Australians drink, but we need to create a culture of responsible drinking. That is why Family First wants the government to ensure there is information or warning labels on all alcohol products, wants to restrict all alcohol advertising to appear after 9 pm and wants to close the crazy loophole that allows alcohol advertising during the day because it is related to sport. That is wrong. It sends the message that alcohol is linked to sport, a link that we should certainly break.
Finally, Family First is concerned that the budget has nothing in it to help the states reduce their dependence on pokies, despite the Prime Minister’s concern over gambling dependency. Family First knows the government shares its concern over the significant social issue of poker machines but does not understand why the government did not use its first budget to look at ways to alleviate the problem. It is quite clear that the states are so hooked on gambling revenue that they are unable to break their habit without federal intervention. Family First’s Poker Machine Harm Reduction Tax (Administration) Bill 2008 would, over time, move poker machines out of pubs and clubs and see them restricted to casinos and racetracks, which are dedicated gambling venues.
In conclusion, Family First welcomes the Rudd Government’s first budget with tax cuts for working families but is concerned for Australia’s most vulnerable people, those on pensions, who have once again been left to fend for themselves on slim pickings and crumbs from the table.

"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2008-05-15,"—I rise this evening to talk about National Families Week 2008, which we have celebrated this week between 11 and 17 May. National Families Week is an annual event involving tens of thousands of people and hundreds of organisations across Australia. Its purpose is to celebrate family life in Australia and to recognise the diversity of the family unit in modern Australia.
Australia’s celebration of National Families Week is scheduled today, 15 May, to coincide with the United Nations International Day of Families. This day is observed by the United Nations to mark the importance of families in the international community and to draw attention to the plight of families around the world. It is an opportunity to promote awareness of issues relating to families as the core unit of society and to promote a better understanding of the functions, problems, strengths and needs of families, as well as to recognise the social, economic, cultural and demographic issues which also affect families.
Australia’s celebrations are headed by Australia’s peak independent not-for-profit organisation for promoting the needs and interests of families—that is, Families Australia—on behalf of the Australian government’s Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. The theme for this year’s celebration is ‘Work and family: getting the balance right’, which is particularly about encouraging Australian families to find ways to effectively balance work and family life.
Families are an important priority for this government. The Rudd Labor government recognises many of the financial pressures placed on families, in whatever capacity a family may exist, and is working hard to reduce pressures on working families through the implementation of its policies. Families are an important resource in Australia. They are society’s most enduring basis for raising children, caring for family members, providing and receiving love, meaning and support and for transmitting values, culture, language and traditions between generations.
A traditional modern Australian family almost defies definition these days. There is a great diversity of family forms in Australia. There are married and de facto couples with or without children, single parents, same-sex couples with or without children, grandparents taking on the parental role for their grandchildren, foster parents, adoptive parents and step-parents. Extended family and grandparents often play an important role in supporting families, and more and more family members are often acting as full-time carers to their sick, injured or disabled relatives. Australian families, in whichever form they exist, are all valued equally in our society and recognised for their crucial societal role.
An important recent initiative of the government has been to draft the Same-Sex Relationships (Provision of Equal Entitlements) Bill (No. 1) 2008, which will be introduced into the parliament in the winter sittings. This legislation will serve to remove a raft of discrimination which currently exists in federal legislation and particularly impacts same-sex couples and their children. This law is expected to be operational by the middle of next year. The reforms will cover areas such as tax, superannuation, Medicare, pharmaceutical benefits, aged care, veterans entitlements, workers compensation and employment entitlements. But, most importantly, the bill will provide economic equality for same-sex couples throughout Australia and will ensure that the children of same-sex parents receive the same benefits as all other Australian children and are not disadvantaged simply because of structure of their family.
The budget delivered by the Treasurer, Mr Swan, on Tuesday night also provided good news for families. A number of measures were announced that were aimed at relieving pressures facing families. I am pleased to hear that the Chief Executive of Families Australia, Mr Brian Baddington, welcomed the budget and described it as, ‘Good news for families and children.’ The budget announced new federal funding for education and health infrastructure as well as new funding support for Indigenous families through the provision of child and maternal health and education programs.
Child care and early education also received funding and there was a special allocation made for the development of Australia’s first ever national child protection plan. The government committed $2.6 million to work with all levels of government, child protection workers and the community sector to establish a national framework to protect all children. All levels of government can help strengthen families and prevent the circumstances in which child abuse and neglect are commonly found. The national framework for protection of Australia’s children is a key part of the Australian government’s child-centred approach to family policy.
The changes to the carer payment in the budget will mean that thousands of parents who are carers of children with severe disability will now have access to essential benefits. The budget also included tax cuts for low to middle-income earners, an increase in the child-care tax rebate, as well as funding for the first home saver accounts, the Rental Affordability Scheme and the national Fuelwatch scheme, all of which will assist families with housing and managing their own family budgets. Overall, the budget offered good news for families and the working family support package will help families meet the cost of living.
As I mentioned in my introductory remarks, the theme for National Families Week this year is ‘Work and family: getting the balance right’, which is particularly about encouraging Australian families to find ways to effectively balance their work and family lives. The Rudd government announced in February of this year that it would ask the Productivity Commission to examine ways the government can provide improved support to parents with newborn children. The Productivity Commission’s inquiry into paid maternity, paternity and parental leave will take place throughout this year, and is due to report in February 2009. Any policy reforms in this area will be aimed at ensuring strong and sustainable economic growth. It  will take into account our ageing population and the importance of early childhood development, and it will support Australian families balancing work and family responsibilities.
Around 250,000 children are born every year in Australia and many parents who care for these children are currently not entitled to paid parental leave. As a consequence, I am very pleased that the inquiry has been given the responsibility of exploring the current extent of paid parental leave provided by employers in Australia and identifying models of paid parental leave that could be adopted in this country. In conclusion, as we celebrate National Families Week this week, it is important to recognise the diversity of modern Australian families, the unique and important role that families play in raising children and caring for one another, and to ensure that we continue to offer the best support possible to families in these roles.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>National Families Week 2008</title>,Adjournment,45,1
