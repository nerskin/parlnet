"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2013-05-16,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia) (09:50):  I indicate to the chamber that the coalition will not be opposing the Migration Amendment (Unauthorised Maritime Arrivals and Other Measures) Bill 2012. The reason we will not be opposing the bill is that the substance of it is consistent with the coalition's long-held position in relation to the offshore processing regime and, in any event, it is fundamentally the same bill as the one that was introduced by the Howard government in 2006 and, which I note, was passed by the House of Representatives.


The stated objective of the bill is to expand the existing offshore processing regime to apply to all persons arriving on mainland Australia unlawfully by sea. It will replace the concept of 'offshore entry person' with the concept of 'unauthorised maritime arrival'. The effect of the bill is that persons who arrive on Australian soil by boat without a valid visa will be subject to removal to an offshore processing country and will be processed according to that regime—that is, the bill will effectively excise the Australian mainland from the Migration Act. It is intended to be a disincentive aimed at discouraging potential unlawful immigrants from making the hazardous sea voyage to Australia.


While the coalition will not be opposing, and in fact is strongly supporting, the passage of this legislation today—and I note for the record that the coalition voted with the government to rearrange the business of the Senate today to ensure that this bill was given precedence and that the coalition gave up our private senators' time this morning to ensure that this bill is facilitated in a timely fashion—I do believe we need to consider why the government has introduced this bill, given that when the same bill was introduced in 2006 by the Howard government those on the opposite side of the chamber howled in opposition to it. These are the facts that Australia is faced with today.


Five years ago in November 2007, when this Labor government was first elected to office, there were just four people in immigration detention who had arrived in Australia illegally by boat. When the Labor government was elected to office in November 2007, maintenance of Australia's immigration detention network was costing Australian taxpayers less than $100 million per annum. In fact, it was costing approximately $85 million. Today there are well in excess of 15,000 illegal maritime arrivals in Australia's detention system, whether they are on bridging visas in community detention, in alternative places of detention or in the detention network itself. This government's spectacular record of failure in relation to this portfolio worsens when you consider that the number of people who have arrived since November 2007 is 40,772 on 673 boats. It is a fact, and that is one of the reasons whereby the government and Minister O'Connor today came to the coalition quite literally on bended knee and begged us to facilitate the passage of this legislation, which we agreed we would do. It is a fact that Australia is now witnessing what is an unprecedented rate of boat arrivals and that is, without a doubt, the sole reason the government has done an about-face in relation to policy in this area.


April 2013 is now on record as the month with the largest number of asylum seeker arrivals, with 3,300 people arriving by boat in that one month alone. March 2013 saw over 2,500 asylum seekers arrive and even though we are only two weeks into May, we have already seen 1,500 asylum seekers arrive. What that means—and perhaps the reason the government again came to the coalition on bended knee today, with Minister O'Connor begging shadow minister Scott Morrison for his assistance in relation to the facilitation of this legislation through the Senate—is that Australia has witnessed approximately 66 people arriving by boat per day this year. That is solely attributable to this government's grotesque failure in relation to border protection policy. 


This bill was introduced into the parliament by the former Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Mr Bowen, on 31 October 2012. The proposal set out in the bill reflects some but not all of the advice of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers, which recommended that an arrival anywhere in Australia by regular maritime means should result in such individuals having the same status as those arriving at an offshore place which has already been excised from the immigration zone. The effect of this bill will mean that irregular maritime arrivals anywhere in Australia will make that person liable to regional processing arrangements.


Given the hysteria of the government in 2006 when we introduced what is effectively the same piece of legislation—which I believe the government now acknowledges, given they have today come cap in hand to the coalition, is part of a suite of policy measures which indeed does stop the boats—I believe it is appropriate to put on the record comments of those at the time and what the Labor members said in relation to the Howard government's legislation and to note that today they are the ones who are begging us, the coalition who stopped the boats, to now support them in their efforts to restore part of the former Howard government's strong suite of border protection policies, which clearly, by the passage of this legislation, they now admit they were wrong in rolling back. Take, for example, the comments of the former minister for immigration, the minister who in the other place introduced what is effectively the former Howard government's bill. This is what he said back in 2006: 


This is a bad bill with no redeeming features. It is a hypocritical and illogical bill. If it is passed today, it will be a stain on our national character ... If it is passed, it will be repealed by an incoming Labor government.


History now records that it was, in fact, repealed by the incoming Labor government. History also now records the facts I have outlined for the record today—that Australia has now been subjected to an unprecedented number of illegal boat arrivals. Under this government, we are heading towards 41,000 arrivals in 2013, which equates to approximately 66 arrivals per day. 


Despite the fact that Minister Bowen in 2006 took a completely different stance on legislation which had been proven to work and to stop the boats, we see that same minister, now in government, acknowledging that Labor have made one of the greatest—if not the greatest—policy mistakes of all time. They are now backing the coalition to side with them and support what is effectively Howard government legislation.


What did Mr Simon Crean say at the time the Howard government's bill was passed?


The bill is shameful and xenophobic.


   …   …   … 


It is a bill that should be opposed. 


I note that by 2012 Mr Crean had clearly had a change of heart.


What did Mr Anthony Albanese have to say at the time?


This bill is wrong in principle and it is wrong in motivation. 


   …   …   …


This bill is a disgraceful shirking of responsibility by Australia and it must be rejected.


   …   …   …


I reject the bill as being fundamentally abhorrent to everything I believe in …


   …   …   …


It has been a test of the Australian Labor Party and we have risen to the occasion, and that is why we are rejecting this legislation.


Clearly Mr Albanese has also come to the realisation, as have the majority of Australians, that Labor were wrong in 2006 and that they were wrong in 2008 when they repealed the Howard government legislation. But they are right today to come into this place and to ask the coalition to assist them in facilitating the passage of what is effectively the former Howard government's legislation.


Why has the Labor Party done an about-face? Why did the Labor Party—the current minister, Mr O'Connor— come to the shadow minister, Mr Morrison, and effectively beg him to assist Labor in passing this legislation today? These are the reasons. Over the life of the Howard government, 1999 was the year of the greatest number of boat arrivals—86 boats arrived in 1999. In comparison, this year 86 boats arrived just between 1 January and 14 April. The greatest number of asylum seekers arriving in any one year under the Howard government was in 2001—5,550 people arrived in 2001. In comparison, the Gillard government managed to exceed that figure in just the eight weeks covering March and April of this year. 


What did we, the former Howard government, do? We realised we had a problem and we took strong and decisive action, which included the action set out in the bill before the Senate today. What was the result of the former Howard government's strong border protection policies? In 2002, the year after the Pacific solution was introduced, the number of boats arriving in Australia was reduced to zero. In 2003, one boat arrived; in 2004, zero boats arrived; in 2005, four boats arrived; in 2006, six boats arrived; and, in 2007, five boats arrived. The fact of the matter is this: the Labor Party cannot deny that, when they assumed office in November 2007, they inherited a solution from the former Howard government. In August of 2008, they proceeded quite deliberately and arrogantly to wind back the proven border protection policies of the former Howard government. We have now come almost full circle and we stand here today in the Senate implementing—or re-implementing—a further plank of the former Howard government's border protection policies. 


Will this go far enough? Absolutely not. I have put forward a private senator's bill to reintroduce temporary protection visas. That is something which this bill does not do. I would say to those on the other side: if you really are fair dinkum about stopping the boats and if you really do want to return, as you are telling us, to the former Howard government's policies, you must also give urgent consideration to restoring temporary protection visas as part of the suite of policy measures.


There is a difference between the Howard government bill and this bill. One of those differences is—lo and behold—their effectiveness. The government's March 2012 decision to allow all offshore entry persons access to merits and judicial review through the RRT and the courts severely weakens the effectiveness of this bill and will prove to be very costly to taxpayers—bearing in mind that the cost to taxpayers of the government's failed border protection policies is now in excess of $10 billion. When the coalition introduced its bill in 2006, the bill's impact would have been much more significant than that of the current bill and would have denied all asylum seekers access to merits and judicial review. 


Whilst the Labor government have significantly watered down a number of previous coalition initiatives, consequently diminishing the potential impact of this bill, the broad principle of this bill is, as I said at the outset, consistent with coalition policy and we will therefore support it—notwithstanding the gross hypocrisy of Labor. In 2006, Labor were screaming from the rooftops that the very provisions which they have begged us to support today—the very provisions which, under the Howard government, were proven to work—were anathema to them. I commend this bill to the Senate.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2013-05-16,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (10:07):  I rise to speak in opposition to the Migration Amendment (Unauthorised Maritime Arrivals and Other Measures) Bill 2012. The Australian Greens are in strong opposition to the idea of removing Australia's entire mainland from our migration zone. When John Howard, back in 2006, proposed to do this very thing here in this place, not only did we have members of the Labor Party speaking strongly against it; we even had members of the coalition speaking strongly against it. When John Howard proposed to strip all migration law rights away from people based on their arriving on the Australian mainland, one of the reasons that that bill did not end up passing the Senate was that even Barnaby Joyce—




Senator Williams:
  Senator Joyce.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  believed that this was bad policy. Even Senator Barnaby Joyce knew the madness of this policy. It must be pretty bad when you have got Senator Joyce arguing for the rights of refugees and the rights of vulnerable people under basic rule-of-law provisions.


I urge all members in this place to search the back of their conscience and to think about why this is really being put forward and why there is an urgency for it to be rushed through. There is no urgency, of course, except the continued failure of the government's already harsh, inhumane and cruel no advantage rule and offshore processing, which have not worked to stem the flow of people in our region who are desperate to seek protection. The Prime Minister on this issue is always looking for somebody else to blame, and now it is that we have provisions on the mainland that uphold the rule of law—that is bad and that has got to go, according to the Prime Minister and this Labor government. And of course Tony Abbott's opposition are going to support this legislation, because it is their policy. This is the Labor government implementing John Howard's policy and Tony Abbott's policy. That is what is going on here. We do not have to wait until 14 September; we have already got the opposition's policy. The Labor government have done all the Liberal Party's dirty work when it comes to beating up on refugees, dog whistling on immigration and stripping away laws that protect the most vulnerable in our community.


This bill effectively excises the entire mainland of Australia from the ordinary operations of the migration zone so that, wherever somebody may arrive, they do not have the right to seek protection under normal circumstances. This expands the already existing two-tiered system that is in direct contravention of the refugee convention, which clearly identifies that we should not be discriminating against people and their right to protection, care and safety based on their mode of arrival. It is simply wrong. It is unacceptable under the refugee convention. Yet here we are this morning seeing exactly that happening—both the government and the opposition doing away with, violating, the letter and the spirit of the rights outlined in the refugee convention.


As I said, the Howard government had already attempted to do this. In 2001, they set up a system which treated refugees who arrived by boat differently—not to protect them, not to care for them, not to deal in a practical way with their vulnerability and needs. No, no; it was to demonise them, to whip up fear and hatred and to send a signal to the nastiest, darkest parts of our psyche, where we may think that somehow, because somebody is a refugee and had to come by boat, they are a bad person. That is precisely why John Howard changed these rules in 2001 and that is precisely what the Labor government, hand in hand and shoulder to shoulder with Tony Abbott's coalition, are doing today.


This is yet another stark and very, very disappointing example of the government locked in a race to the bottom with the coalition over immigration and refugee policy. Punishing refugees for seeking protection in Australia is the central concept of this bill. Let us not beat around the bush. This bill does nothing to save people's lives. This bill does nothing to protect and help and care for vulnerable refugees, including children. This bill does nothing to help these people and it will not save their lives. This bill is all about punishment and all about whipping up fear and hatred and demonising people because of how they arrived and where they have come from. The fact is that the majority of people who arrive here by boat—whether it is in the already excised zone or the small handful of people who find their way to the mainland—are people who could not come to Australia by plane because they never would have got a ticket without a visa, because of the countries that they come from, because of their need to flee from torture, from persecution, from war. This bill goes right to the heart of discriminating against refugees because of the places they have had to flee.


Of course, as we know, just as happened in 2006, this bill has been widely criticised by a range of legal and human rights experts. This bill went to inquiry, and it was universally condemned. The only supporting evidence to this inquiry came from the government's own department. Not one independent voice in support of this piece of legislation came forward. Not one independent voice of support exists for this legislation.


In fact, let me just go to what the United Nations and their human rights and refugee committees have said in relation to this piece of legislation. We know that the UNHCR in Australia have said that they are extremely concerned that the measures to excise large portions of the territory to set up systems which substantially reduce fundamental refugee protection rights sets a negative precedent internationally.


This is not about building a regional protection framework; this is doing the absolute opposite. This is about gross, bottom of the barrel, crass domestic politics here in Australia. This is about the Labor Party competing with Tony Abbott as to who can be the toughest, the cruellest, the meanest on refugees.




Senator Williams:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I ask Senator Hanson-Young to refer to those in the other place by their correct titles. She started off with 'Barnaby Joyce' instead of 'Senator Joyce', then continued on about 'Tony Abbott'—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Bernardi
):  Thank you, Senator Williams; I understand your point. Before you continue, Senator Hanson-Young, Senator Williams is absolutely correct: you have, on a number of occasions, referred to other members of parliament without their correct titles. You have corrected yourself on one of those occasions, and I should have drawn it your attention earlier. So, please, would you adhere to the Senate standing orders.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. This is crass domestic politics that is based on the Labor Party competing, in a race to the bottom, as to who can be the cruellest, the nastiest, the meanest, the harshest on refugees. A race to the bottom with Mr Abbott's coalition—that is what this piece of legislation is about.


The UNHCR goes on to say that, if each one of the 148 other countries around the world that have signed on to the refugee convention took this attitude and changed their laws in this way, it would undermine the entire convention. This legislation is out of step with not just the letter but absolutely the spirit of the convention. We know that the Refugee Council has said that they are extremely concerned about this as well—that it violates our obligations. It strips away people's rights, and it will likely cause serious harm to people fleeing from persecution and torture. It will cause more harm, more damage, to people who are already fleeing some pretty unsafe and harmful circumstances. That is what the experts are saying.


We know that many of the church groups around the country are extremely concerned about this as well, from a moral perspective as well as a legal one. We have seen Elenie Poulos, the National Director of UnitingJustice, attached to the Uniting Church, say that this is a shameful piece of legislation that undercuts our moral responsibilities as a nation towards vulnerable and oppressed asylum seekers.


This is a bad piece of legislation and is only designed to hurt people and not care for them. There is nothing in this legislation that will save people's lives—in fact, unfortunately, all to the contrary. People's lives are going to be at more risk. People are going to suffer more. Children will not have rights. Despite the need for protection, they will not now have access to lawyers. They will not have any legal assistance at all. They cannot even make a claim for refugee protection under this legislation. They can be sent, of course, offshore to one of the cruel camps—whether that is Manus Island or Nauru or wherever else this government or the coalition decide they want to start dumping vulnerable refugees. This bill exposes vulnerable people to indefinite detention in inhumane and cruel camps.


As to those who may be lucky enough to be put on a bridging visa after suffering in detention, they will have no work rights. They will have no access to proper education or medical services. They will have no way of being able to rebuild their lives and protect their children. In fact, children and families under this legislation will be pushed into poverty even further.


This legislation exposes more people in immigration detention to inadequate legal assistance and legal oversight—in fact, not just 'inadequate'; they have no rights at all. Whether you are the vulnerable family of someone who has been fighting for democracy in Iran or a Hazara family from Afghanistan, you have no rights for proper protection under this piece of legislation.


What is the urgency for us to have to rush this piece of legislation through? It is not going to stop people coming here by boat; we know that. We know that being harsh to people, deterrence policies, do not stop people taking those dangerous journeys when that is the only option they have. We have seen that proven over the last six months.


Back in August last year, we saw this again—the Labor Party implementing the coalition's policies on offshore detention, on stripping out protection and on the no-advantage rule. We were told that was going to slow the boats. It has not slowed the boats at all: we have four times the number of people fleeing to Australia than we did last year. It has not stopped people taking those journeys. It has not saved people's lives.


In fact, the unfortunate thing about all of this is that no-one is safer—no-one is being kept safer or treated better; no-one's rights are being upheld. In fact, the exact opposite is happening: we are now subjecting children to institutionalised child abuse in the detention camps of cruelty on Manus Island. That is the reality of the policies that are coming from this government, backed up by Mr Abbott's coalition. These policies are not saving people's lives; they are not caring for people. These policies and this legislation are subjecting people to further harm and torture.


I will be moving three amendments to this legislation. The first amendment is in relation to allowing for media access to these detention camps that Australians are paying billions and billions of dollars for. We saw the budget come out on Tuesday night and we know that offshore processing is costing Australian taxpayers more than $7½ billion. In fact, if you include this year and the forward estimates, it is costing $10 billion to detain children and their families on Manus Island, in inhumane conditions, damaging them for the rest of their lives—$10 billion. There is of course no media access to these detention centres, because the government do not want the Australian people to see how badly we are treating our fellow human beings. They do not want the Australian conscience to be pricked by the truth of what is going on in these camps. The amendment that I will be moving in relation to that is to allow media access to our detention centres, particularly those offshore on Manus Island and Nauru.


The second amendment is about allowing the Australian Human Rights Commission to enter those camps and be able to inspect them—because we cannot trust either this government or any government run by the coalition to treat vulnerable refugees and their families properly. We know that every time we actually get a glimpse into what is going on in these awful places, we see that people are not being treated right, that it is inhumane, that children are suffering. We should be allowing the Australian Human Rights Commission to go inside and inspect. I ask you, Mr Acting Deputy President: if there is nothing to hide, why not let them in?


The third amendment is a very important one, in relation to removing children and their families from Manus Island. It is a horrible place. It is a cruel place. It is an inhumane place. Even adults should not be there. Vulnerable refugees do not deserve to be treated like animals, as we have seen from the footage that was leaked through the Four Cornersreport only some weeks ago. Children are suffering on Manus Island, and it is time they were brought to the Australian mainland and cared for properly. This amendment will ban any government from being able to detain children, remove children to those awful places of abuse and cruelty—they are inhumane. Those children must be brought to the Australian mainland and cared for.


As a mother I have a responsibility to stand in this place and argue for the rights of those children. I call on every senator in this place to stand up for those children's rights as well, and do what you would want if they were your children.

"Thistlethwaite, Sen Matt",ALP,2013-05-16,"



Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales—Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs and Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs) (10:28):  I thank all senators for their contributions to the second reading debate on the Migration Amendment (Unauthorised Maritime Arrivals and Other Measures) Bill 2012. Dealing with the issue of irregular maritime arrivals has probably been the most difficult public policy issue that our nation has dealt with in the last 25 years. I do not believe that anyone in this parliament believes that Australia should take an immoral or heartless approach to refugees. And certainly our history demonstrates and proves that this nation has been most welcoming of people coming from difficult circumstances, fleeing persecution, fleeing war and settling in Australia.


This government's commitment to supporting refugees coming to this country is highlighted by the fact that we have increased the humanitarian intake of refugees to 20,000—I believe the largest settlement program of any nation throughout the world. But what we cannot allow to continue to happen are events such as those that occurred on 15 December 2010, when 50 innocent women and children drowned in shocking circumstances before the eyes of this nation on the rocks at Christmas Island. We simply cannot allow, as a nation with a heart, those circumstances to occur again.


The Gillard government empanelled a team of experts, headed by Angus Houston, to develop a set of recommendations to try and take the politics out of this very difficult issue and to come up with a workable solution for the long term. That panel consulted and reported, and they came up with 22 recommendations. They made it very clear to the government and to the nation when they made those recommendations that they must be accepted as a whole, a full package—that you could not seek to pick out and implement elements of it. They made it clear that it needed to come as a full package for it to be effective.


This bill delivers on one of those recommendations. It delivers on the advice of the experts that the government consulted to attempt to take the politics out of this issue. That recommendation is recommendation No. 14. It says:


… arrival anywhere on Australia by irregular maritime means will not provide individuals with a different lawful status than those who arrive in an excised offshore place.


That is, irregular arrival by sea anywhere in Australia should make the person liable to regional processing arrangements. That is necessary to ensure the no advantage principle is adhered to. The panel's reasoning in making this recommendation was the need to reduce any incentive for people to take even greater risks with their lives by seeking to reach the Australian mainland to avoid being subject to regional processing arrangements. The report states:


The Panel considers that all possible measures should be implemented to avoid creating an incentive for IMAs taking even greater risks with their lives by seeking to reach the Australian mainland. As a complement to facilities in Nauru and PNG, the Panel recommends the Government bring forward legislative amendments to the Migration Act 1958 so that arrival on the Australian mainland by irregular maritime means does not provide individuals with a different lawful status than those who enter at an excised offshore place, such as Christmas Island.


That is making it very clear to the Prime Minister, to the executive and to the nation what they expected as an effective means for ensuring a deterrent to people-smuggling. The panel also emphasised—and the government has consistently reiterated—that this recommendation in the report is part of an integrated set of proposals. To be effective in discouraging asylum seekers from risking their lives, the incentives and disincentives the panel recommended must be pursued in a comprehensive, coordinated manner. This includes incentives to encourage greater use of regular migration pathways and international protection arrangements and disincentives to undertake irregular maritime voyages, including the application of a no advantage principle and regional processing arrangements. The legislative amendments proposed in this bill are part of that integrated approach.


The bill was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee for inquiry and report. I thank the committee for their report, tabled on 25 February 2013. I thank those who provided submissions and of course those who appeared before the committee. The bill involves complex issues, and I commend the manner in which the committee has captured and reported these complexities. The report states:


… the committee supports the intent of the Bill, subject to one important amendment.


The committee recommended that the bill be amended to require the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship to report annually to both houses of parliament in respect of matters relating to unauthorised maritime arrivals, including arrangements for assessing their refugee claims as well as the arrangements relating to accommodation, health care and education. Additionally, the committee recommended that the minister report on the number of asylum claims by unauthorised maritime arrivals that are assessed and determined to be refugees during the 12-month period. The government amendment that will be moved in the committee stage reflects this recommendation and will require the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship to cause that to be laid before each house of the parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after the end of the financial year.


The government does not support the amendments that have been put forward by the Greens, as that would be contrary to the recommendations of the expert panel, which the government has accepted and is implementing. The bill marks an important further step in giving effect to the recommendations of the panel and will remove yet another incentive for asylum seekers to take greater risks with their lives to reach the Australian mainland. 


In respect of the claim that this is excising the Australian mainland, let me reiterate that this bill does not purport to excise the Australian mainland from the migration zone. The definition of the migration zone is not being amended in this bill. Instead, the bill defines individuals subject to regional processing based on their status as unauthorised maritime arrivals—that is, by arriving in Australia in the migration zone, by sea, without a visa in effect. This is in contrast to the current situation, where an individual is only subject to regional processing if they enter regional Australia in an excised offshore place such as Christmas Island.


In summing up, this government is fully committed to delivering a proper and sustainable regional solution through the full implementation of the recommendations of the expert panel that was led by Angus Houston. No-one should doubt this government's commitment to implementing all 22 of the recommendations of the expert panel to break the people smugglers business model and help to stop people dying at sea. That is how responsible governments develop policy—listening to the advice of experts.


I thank all senators for their contributions to this debate and I commend the bill and the government amendments to the Senate.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2013-05-16,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (10:45):  The first amendment that the Australian Greens are moving this morning in relation to this bill is to allow for the Australian Human Rights Commission to visit, inspect and report on the conditions and what is going on in offshore detention centres that are run by Australia and paid by for Australian taxpayers. We know, at the moment, they are on Manus Island and Nauru. This is a very important amendment. We know that the Human Rights Commission has these rights in Australian mainland detention centres. They are able to go to detention centres, inspect what is going on, talk to people about their cases and talk to people about the conditions that they are experiencing in those places.


The importance of this amendment is that it allows for the same rights and obligations that the Human Rights Commissioner has already for Australian based detention centres and, indeed, on Christmas Island to be similar to those for detention centres that we have further offshore on Manus Island and Nauru. It would allow the Human Rights Commissioner to go in, inspect, look at the conditions of what these camps are like and deal with any complaints or issues that come out of that. It is really important because, as we know, these centres are costing Australian taxpayers billions of dollars. The legal rights of the refugees who are locked up there indefinitely have been taken away. There is currently no transparency at all on Manus Island and Nauru.


I previously wrote to the minister about this. I raised this with the department in Senate estimates. It is clear that, unless we change the Migration Act, which is what this amendment does, there is no ability for the Australian Human Rights Commission—Australia's peak human rights body—to inspect what is going on in these places. When you look at the reports that have come out and when you hear the stories of people who have said how they were treated in these god-awful places, then you know something is going on and we need a bit more transparency.


For the Australian Human Rights Commission to be able to go in and inspect is a really important thing for us and this chamber to do. We think that it is okay for it to happen in Australian based centres and it is all okay for it to happen on Christmas Island; let us make sure it is there for the refugees who are sent offshore. Let us not forget that these people are there indefinitely, as the government has this open-ended 'no advantage' rule. The children, their families, and the young men and women who are detained in these places could be there for five, 10 or 15—who knows how many—years. To allow for some proper transparency would go a long way to making sure that Australian taxpayers and members of our community who are concerned about issues of human rights and how we treat our fellow human beings can have some assurance that there is somebody watching what is going on.


It is an important amendment and I would ask for the government and the opposition to support it. If they are not going to support it, I would ask for the minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship in this chamber today to explain why the government does not want to see this type of basic transparency available to the Australian Human Rights Commission in these god-awful places.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Senator Hanson-Young, before you formally move your amendments, because there are two of them you have to seek leave to move them together.

Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales—Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs and Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs) (10:51):  The government rejects both amendments moved by Senator Hanson-Young. The government believes that requiring another country to provide assurances that it will provide access to the Australian Human Rights Commissioner is something that this government cannot guarantee; therefore, it is not appropriate to put it in this legislation.


The department has received advice from the Solicitor-General on the extent to which the Australian Human Rights Commission may inquire into complaints about alleged human rights breaches in regional processing centres. The advice was sort after the president of the Human Rights Commission wrote to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, inquiring into a complaint that the AHRC had received from persons transferred to Nauru under the regional processing provisions of the Migration Act. The department accepts that the president of the commission can inquire into such complaints. As to the full implications of the advice, the department is further considering this.

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (10:52):  I must say that I am extremely disappointed that the government wishes to continue this secrecy in relation to how vulnerable refugees are being treated and the conditions they are being kept in on Manus Island and Nauru. The Australian people have a right to know what is going on there, who is really in charge and, above all else, what our $10 billion being spent in the government's offshore processing regime is actually going to. It is hard to understand why the government would not want to ensure in Australian law through the Migration Act that the Human Rights Commission have access to these camps unless they have something to hide. That is the reality. What else are the Australian people meant to think? 


This is disappointing to many members of the community after seeing how badly people can be treated and the conditions they can be kept in in these places. It is not just under this Pacific solution mark 2 regime; we know that the conditions were horrendous when the camps were being run by the former John Howard government. One of the reasons why the Australian detention system was opened to the Australian Human Rights Commission and, indeed, the Commonwealth Ombudsman was the scandal of Vivian Solon and Cornelia Rau. They are the very real examples of what happens to people when governments do not allow these places to have proper scrutiny and transparency. That is the reality. We have seen it. It has been proven. It has ruined people's lives.


Now, despite all of the evidence in front of us, this government are prepared to make the same mistakes all over again. What are the Australian people meant to think? There is no other explanation than that the government are wanting to hide what is really going on. They do not want proper scrutiny. It is bad enough that they put gag clauses in their contracts with service providers, but not letting Australia's peak human rights body inspect what is a fundamental part of this government's immigration system is dishonest, irresponsible and, frankly, shameful. There is no other explanation than that the government are wishing to hide what is really going on.

Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales—Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs and Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs) (10:56):  The government is implementing appropriate transparency and monitoring arrangements in line with the recommendations of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers. As the minister has said on previous occasions, the process of designating regional processing countries, which can be disallowed by the parliament, provided the opportunity for parliament to scrutinise the arrangements that we were putting in place. It included the requirement to place before both houses of parliament a range of documents relating to regional processing arrangements, such as why it is in the national interest, advice from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and arrangements in relation to the treatment of persons.


There are now a range of other mechanisms in place to support the objectives of transparency. For example, access to regional processing centres has been granted to the UNHCR and other human rights organisations and observers and, indeed, Australian politicians, and there is regular public reporting in relation to regional processing arrangements, including through mechanisms such as Senate estimates hearings. Additionally, Australia is working closely with regional processing countries to establish advisory arrangements as specified in the memoranda of understanding. An interim joint advisory committee has been established for Nauru, and we continue to work closely with PNG to develop similar arrangements. The government sees the oversight mechanisms as important in ensuring transparency of operations and policy.


I note that part of the committee's recommendations included reporting on health, education and accommodation arrangements in centres. In addition to a range of oversight arrangements in place, there are also a number of established quality assurance and reporting mechanisms for health, education and accommodation. These include treating transferees with dignity, respect and integrity, building an environment that supports security and safety, improving health and wellbeing outcomes for transferees, interacting with transferees in a culturally sensitive way, reflecting human rights principles through the provision of services and facilities, and ensuring the best interests of the child are taken into account.

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (10:58):  Wow! I realise the minister representing the immigration minister today is not the minister who was in the Senate on the night that we debated the legislation that would allow for refugees to be dumped on Manus Island or Nauru, but there is nothing binding in law to ensure that that entire list of things that the minister has just read out have to happen. In fact, there is nothing in law to ensure that they have to happen. The government and the opposition made it law that the minister does not have to prove any of this in the first instance. This chamber was not given the ability nor the right to scrutinise the conditions on Manus Island or Nauru deliberately by the government, because they knew it would not pass the test that even the Houston panel suggested was needed. The Houston report outlines a list of things that need to happen—how people have to be treated, the conditions that they will be kept in, the appropriateness of services, the appropriateness of accommodation. The Houston report said that no-one could be sent to these offshore places without these things in place. The point is precisely that none of those things is happening and there is no-one to ensure that they start happening, because there is no independent scrutiny or checks. It is precisely why we need the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to have access. 


I come back again to the fact that the government are more concerned about hiding what is going on in these places than making sure that they are following their own policies or the recommendations of the Houston report. The fact is that those things are in the report and they have not been done. You are more interested in trying to cover it up. That is the truth of it. They are not in law and they are not binding. This government would prefer that it stayed out of the public eye—that Australian taxpayers did not know that they are spending $10 billion on decrepit, inhumane, wet, insufficient camps of cruelty. That is the reality of this. Chair, I ask that the amendments be put.

18B


After subsection 198AB(6)



   Add:


   (6B) If the Minister designates a country or has previously designated a country under subsection (1), the Minister must:


   (a) subject to the media access protocol referred to in paragraph (c), ensure that the country provides assurances that it will provide accredited media representatives with reasonable access to any place where a person who is an unauthorised maritime arrival for the purposes of this Act is detained, housed or otherwise held; and


   (b) subject to the media access protocol referred to in paragraph (c), ensure that the country provides assurances that it will provide accredited media representatives with reasonable access to interview and speak with a person (being a person who consents to be interviewed) who is an unauthorised maritime arrival for the purposes of this Act; and


(c) enter into a media access protocol with the country that allows accredited media representatives to enter a place where a person who is an unauthorised maritime arrival is detained, housed or otherwise held for the purposes of:


      (i) general reporting on the facilities operation and status (including for the purpose of taking photographs, recordings and other footage); and


      (ii) interviewing and speaking with a person (being a person who consents to be interviewed) who is detained or otherwise held at the place; and


(d) make publicly available the media access protocol referred to in paragraph (c).


(2) Schedule 1, page 12 (after line 14), after item 60, insert:




60B


Application provision—subsection 198AB(6B)



   Subsection 198AB(6B) of the Migration Act, as inserted by this Schedule, applies in relation to a designation that is made before or after commencement.


The second lot of amendments that the Australian Greens are moving this morning relate directly to the establishment of media access protocols for detention centres and camps on Manus Island and Nauru. There are two technical amendments which allow for this to occur. 


The media have access to Australian based detention centres, subject of course to appropriate media access protocols, but for some reason—and there is only one conclusion to be drawn—the government has not been willing to allow media into the detention centres on Manus Island and Nauru. I will read amendment (1) so it is very clear to people what it does. If the minister designates a country, such as Manus Island or Nauru, or has previously designated a country under subsection (1), the minister must:


   (a) subject to the media access protocol referred to in paragraph (c), ensure that the country provides assurances that it will provide accredited media representatives with reasonable access to any place where a person who is an unauthorised maritime arrival for the purposes of this Act is detained, housed or otherwise held; and


   (b) subject to the media access protocol referred to in paragraph (c), ensure that the country provides assurances that it will provide accredited media representatives with reasonable access to interview and speak with a person …


(c) enter into a media access protocol with the country that allows accredited media representatives to enter a place where a person who is an unauthorised maritime arrival is detained … for the purposes of:


      (i) general reporting on the facilities operation and status (including for the purpose of taking photographs, recordings and other footage); and


      (ii) interviewing and speaking with a person (… who consents to be interviewed) who is detained or otherwise held at the place; and


(d) make publicly available the media access protocol referred to in paragraph (c).


This is fundamental to allowing not just proper scrutiny of the conditions within these camps but also proper scrutiny and assurances for the Australian taxpayer. Australian taxpayers are paying $10 billion a year, including this year, with the establishment of these awful camps. These are Australian run camps. They are Australian funded, they are managed by Australian representatives and most of the workers in these places are Australian. This is all under the auspices of Australia. The Australian people have a right to know what is going on in these camps and what their money is being spent on.


This amendment does not allow for the doors to be flung open and for anyone to come in and take photographs and footage. It requires that there be an agreement and a proper media access protocol established, with assurances from the host country that the media will be able to gain access, interview those who wished to be interviewed and take photographs of the conditions—all within an appropriate protocol. We do not even have a protocol at the moment. There are no rules against visiting these detention centres, apart from the fact that the government says you cannot. Media agencies here in Australia have for some time now been able to talk to and interview people within Australian detention centres if they follow the appropriate media access protocols. All this amendment is asking for is that the same type of access be available on Manus Island and Nauru. It is common sense—it allows for proper transparency and proper scrutiny, and it gives an assurance to the Australian people that they can find out what is going on in these places. 


It should not be that difficult for the government to give assurances that media who follow the appropriate rules can have access—unless, of course, the government have something to hide; unless, of course, what is going on in these places is so atrocious, so out of step, that they do not want the Australian people to know. I have a question for the minister: will the government allow for the establishment of these media access protocols and allow for media to visit these detention centres to find out what is really going on?

Senator LUNDY
 (Australian Capital Territory—Minister Assisting for Industry and Innovation, Minister for Multicultural Affairs and Minister for Sport) (11:15):  The government is of the view that it is inappropriate to make any amendments to the bill that impose upon the independence and authority of sovereign nations in the way Senator Hanson-Young has proposed. As sovereign nations, it is the exclusive decision of the governments of Nauru and PNG to determine to whom they grant lawful entry into their respective countries. As a corollary to that, access to regional processing centres is at the discretion of the governments of Nauru and PNG and it is not appropriate that that be legislated by the Australian government. 


The Australian government is working with both of the regional processing countries on what the arrangements will be for suitable visitor and media access. That work is continuing. However, we do not see any merit in legislating in the way proposed in the Greens amendments.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2013-05-16,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (11:17):  I have brought these amendments to the chamber today because there is no guarantee that anything that the minister has just described will happen. Back in October I asked the minister and the department during Senate estimates when we would get media protocols and access guidelines for Manus Island and Nauru. We were told they would have a look at it; they might try to draft something. That was almost nine months ago. 


This government have no intention to provide proper scrutiny and transparency of what is going on in these god-awful places. No commitment could be undertaken that would convince anyone that they are serious about doing this. If they believe it is important, they can make sure it goes in the act. I am not dictating how the provisions have to look, or in what time frame they have to be put in place. They have already had nine months and nothing has eventuated. I am saying that the act must stipulate that it should be done. Otherwise, we know there is absolutely no way the Australian people can trust the government to do this. 


The Australian people know there is no way we can trust this government on anything to do with asylum seekers and refugees. Every time we are promised something, the promise is broken. Every time we are told people will be treated properly, we find out they are not. Every time we hear children will not be subject to harsh treatment, we find out they are being subjected to harsh treatment. Every time we hear from the government that they are working on making the system fairer, we find out there has been nothing done. Unless it is in the act, it will not happen.


I do not believe the other side would be any more inclined to stick to their word. I do not have any hope that, if we had a coalition government, they would be allowing the media to access detention centres on Manus Island or Nauru either. If this government believe that it should happen and that it is important, they should put it in law. They either believe it is important and it needs to be in the legislation—particularly ahead of the September election—or they do not. The fundamental message from all this is that there is no commitment to proper scrutiny of what is going on in these places, and there is absolutely no way the government wants the media finding out about it.


A couple of weeks ago the Four Cornersreport on Manus Island and Nauru was aired. That footage had to be smuggled out. What does that say about our government and our laws—that the only way to find out how we are treating vulnerable refugees, under a system we are paying billions of dollars for, is to smuggle out footage of these places? 


What does that say about basic democracy, about fundamental understandings of transparency, about how we spend our money, about how we treat people and about how the government is in line with the law? When it gets to a point where refugees have to smuggle out footage of the conditions they are in, or Australians have to go in to get it and sneak it out, to give us an understanding of what is really going on, that is not something Australia should be proud of. These conditions are more like those in some of the countries these people fled from in the first place. 


It is clear that the only take-home message from all of this is that the government does not want the Australian people to see what is really going on inside. If there is nothing to hide then let the media in and commit to putting it in law so that it cannot be abused, so that there is no ambiguity about the right of media to speak to people in detention, to see the conditions and to report back to the Australian people about how their money is being spent and how these individuals are being treated. If there is nothing to hide, then open the doors.

The final amendments the Australian Greens are moving this morning concern children and families being detained on Manus Island. There are a number of people within the Australian community—and this is also reflected in here and in the other place—who are incredibly uncomfortable with the indefinite detention of children on Manus Island. 


We know that the conditions there are substandard. The UNHCR has told us that. We know that the conditions are inappropriate for children, harmful for children. Not only has the UNHCR said that; Amnesty International has also told us that. We know that even the government's own Department of Immigration and Citizenship believes that the current conditions on Manus Island are pretty poor.


Many Australians were shocked and horrified when the Four Corners report was aired a couple of weeks ago and they saw the conditions children were being kept in. There are other people in this place, from other parties, who also do not believe that vulnerable children and their families should be kept on Manus Island. Senator Cameron has said that he does not believe that children should be kept on Manus Island. I agree with Senator Cameron. The opposition's spokesperson on immigration, Mr Morrison, has said that he is uncomfortable with the idea of children being kept on Manus Island.


When I went to Manus Island at the end of January, before parliament resumed this year, I met with the children who were being detained there. It was a pretty harrowing experience. When I was there, there were 35 children. The youngest was seven; the oldest was 17. There was one little boy who was very clearly distressed. 


I met the children without their parents—I had their parents' consent. I met with them, sat with them and talked with them. They all talked to me about how awful it was being locked up there. They asked what they had done—what was the bad thing they had done which meant they had to be locked up in this prison? This little boy, who was clearly depressed, told me that he was scared and upset but that he could not cry. He had stopped himself from crying—because every time he cries, his mum cries. And his mum cries all the time. This is that little boy's picture: 'My mum is crying and I am sad.' This is the naked truth of what we are doing to children on Manus Island. Other children talked about how they felt as if they were locked in prison. This is a picture of a young boy staring out from inside the fence: 'This is a boy; he is in prison and waiting.' This is from an eight-year-old child.


They were all taken to Manus Island on a plane and they told me the stories of how they were taken there. They were ripped out of their beds on Christmas Island, some of them at four or five o'clock in the morning. They were given no warning. They were put onto the plane in the middle of the night. They talked about how they had had to take the almost 10-hour flight—there was a stopover where they remained on the plane—while still in their pyjamas, terrified about what was going to happen to them.


They are in this camp, which is hideous. Not one person, aside from the immigration minister, believes that these conditions are appropriate. It is a place of cruelty. In this hideous, hideous camp, there is really nothing for these children to do, so they are watching all the time, and, when they see planes flying over, they think the plane is coming to get them to take them back to safety. 'When there is an aeroplane in the sky, all the kids start to cry and ask for leaving Manus with it.' That was from a 10-year-old child that I met when I was on Manus Island.


I know this issue is difficult. I have never argued that there is a simple solution to addressing the needs of asylum seekers who arrive on our shores. I do not think there is a simple solution. But I do not believe that we should be punishing children in some way to pretend that there is a simple solution. We are sacrificing these children's lives. We are—and I do not say this lightly—subjecting these children to child abuse, to institutionalised abuse, to child abuse by policy. We are creating a damaged generation. Most of these kids, at the end of this, are going to come to Australia, be given protection, because they deserve it, and become Australian citizens—and we have damaged them. We have damaged them. They will become the next damaged generation.


Children and their families cannot be kept in detention in these camps of horror. We must bring them to Australia, assess their claims fairly, treat them with care—look after these poor kids. These children have fled some of the most horrendous circumstances we can imagine—war, torture, brutality. They have seen their parents subjected to torture. And now we have them locked up in conditions that are inhumane, where they are witnessing adults who are under so much pressure that they are threatening to take their own lives, attempting self-harm—and these kids are seeing it all. It is not right. 


We debate in this place all the time how we manage this issue. There has to be something said for protecting children and standing up for the rights of these children when they are totally voiceless. If we do not do it in this place, who is going to? If we cannot see that subjecting these children to these types of conditions is dangerous, is harmful, is cruel, what will be we prepared to do next? It was wrong when John Howard detained children in Woomera. It was wrong when John Howard detained children on Manus Island. It is wrong today to have children detained in our detention centres. It is wrong to be detaining children on Manus Island. We have the capacity to assess their claims here and stop treating them like animals, subjecting them to abuse and creating the next damaged generation. I seek leave to table our pictures.


Leave granted.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2013-05-16,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (11:42):  I rise today to support these amendments and to speak on behalf of children. I ask people to think about what is going on today on Manus Island, where we are punishing children because they are seeking asylum in our country. They are children, they have come here and they are asking Australia to assess their refugee status, to bring them in and to take care of them. I compare it with what we are doing now in the criminal justice system in this country, where the criminal justice system says there have to be exceptional circumstances in which you would detain a child and that detention should only be used for children who have committed serious and violent crimes. These children have committed no serious and violent crime. These children have simply asked to come and be part of our community and our society—and that is why this legislation that we are debating here today is a stain on our national character. I put to all of you: is this how you would want your family and your children to be treated if you found yourselves seeking asylum somewhere else in the world? Look at your own children, think about your own children and ask yourself: would you be prepared for your children to be locked up indefinitely on Manus Island—yes or no? Would that be okay for your own children? If it would not be okay for your own children, why is it okay to punish other children?


Earlier this week I spoke in here to give the Greens' wholehearted support to the apology to people who had been subjected to forced adoption. But it is not the first time parliaments have had to apologise. We also apologised to the stolen generations of Indigenous children who were taken away. We have also stood up and apologised to the forgotten Australians, the child migrants who came here and who were lied to, locked up, institutionalised and abused; we have apologised to them. And we have apologised for forced adoptions. And every single time we get up and say: 'Oh—if only we had known,' or 'It was the culture of the period,' or 'What a shocking thing was happening to these children, and it ought not to have happened.' And we have admitted that we created a scarred generation, in each of those cases, that has gone on for generations ever since. The difference is: not one of you who votes against this amendment, in 10 years, 15 years or 20 years, when there is a national apology to the children detained indefinitely in detention for the sole supposed crime of seeking a better life in our country because they are running away from persecution with their families—not one of you will be able to stand up and say: 'Oh, we didn't know,' or, 'It was the culture of the period,' or, 'It was the best way, we thought, of saving their lives, by locking them up in detention in places which the UNHCR has said are completely unsuitable.'


The UNHCR went to Manus Island, and their report speaks for itself. They say that it is totally inappropriate, the way that children are being detained there. But this parliament seeks to take no notice of that. This parliament seeks to perpetrate the lie—and it is a lie—that locking people up in indefinite detention is saving their lives because it is stopping them drowning. Well, that was a ridiculous proposition in the first place and it remains a ridiculous proposition.


Since you have taken these measures, the more cruel they get, the more people are arriving in our country. That is why we are here today—because you are excising the whole of the Australian mainland in order to take away people's human rights. That is what you are actually doing here today, because more and more people are arriving as you get more and more cruel. That says to me that your deterrence policy does not work, has not worked, will not work, is not working right now, and more and more and more people are risking their lives, not fewer and fewer and fewer. So you are actually deliberately choosing cruelty. You are deliberately choosing to punish children. And there is no justification for it at all—none. Look in the eyes of a child and say: 'What crime have you committed? The crime you have committed is: as a child, you have come here with your family to seek a better life.' And, as I said, if you were in the criminal justice system, no child would be detained unless they had committed a serious or violent crime.


If this parliament will not stand up for children, who will? Is it any wonder that every mental health expert in the country is saying that we are driving people into more and more desperate circumstances? These children are witnessing the mental torment of their parents. They are put in vulnerable circumstances. Not only are they in physically difficult circumstances on Manus Island, as has been shown to the country with television footage—it is hot; it is humid; it is a bad place to be keeping people in terms of the physical environment—but the mental cruelty, the torture, that is going on on an ongoing basis, every day, to those children is unacceptable. You all know about it. Many of you have your own children. You all think it is fine for somebody else's children to be punished, to be kept in indefinite detention, to suffer the mental scars for the rest of their lives—but it is okay, because your children will never be in that position.


Well, I am very glad to be standing here today on behalf of those children. I am very proud to be standing here with my Green colleagues—with Senator Sarah Hanson-Young who has just spoken so eloquently on behalf of those children and reported on the visit that she made to those children on Manus Island earlier this year. And it is not just the Greens. The UNHCR is saying it. But this parliament chooses to ignore the UNHCR.


The hypocrisy here is extreme when it comes to many members of the Labor government because, in 2006, when John Howard tried to excise the whole country, Labor was up in arms and the Greens spoke strongly against it then and it was not proceeded with. But now Labor in government has done what the former Prime Minister John Howard was not able to do. You have gone even further. Every day you come up with more and more cruel options. Every day those options cost the Australian people huge amounts of money, in a budgetary sense, with a massive blow-out for your cruel detention centres.


But it is not the financial cost which is the greatest cost to the nation. The greatest cost to the nation is the disappointment, the heartbreak, the mental damage and the scarring, as well as the physical damage, of a whole generation, the majority of whom are going to be found to be refugees who meet the criteria under the refugee convention. What are you going to say to them when, at some point, you decide that your 'no advantage' clause is completely unacceptable? What are you going to say about having locked up these children and deprived them of media access? You know it is wrong; otherwise, you would be allowing the media in there to take pictures and to talk to people. You know it is wrong. Not only is it 'Out of sight, out of mind'; it is about, 'Lock them up, throw away the key, pull down the curtains; let's not show people what we are doing.'


The media has been able to show some images, and this parliament has been shown some drawings. You know what is going on: you are choosing cruelty to children; you are choosing punishment for innocent children. I ask, when these amendments are put, that you think very carefully as you vote, and as your name is recorded against this vote, of what you are going to say to your own children when they ask you, 'Why did you do this?' And please don't lie to your own children and say, 'I did it to save their lives,' because your policy is not saving lives by stopping anyone getting on boats and coming here by sea—there has been a quadrupling of the numbers of people coming on boats. So if that is your concern then you should abolish this policy at once, because this policy has, in your eyes, driven a greater increase.


But the fact is, whether you like it or not, that if you send an army into Iraq on a lie, if you cause the problems that have occurred subsequent to the war in Iraq, you will have refugees leaving Iraq. If you go into Afghanistan, and you witness what is going on in Afghanistan, and you say that the Taliban in Afghanistan must be defeated, and that is why we have troops there, and people are running away from the Taliban—the people we agree are cruel; the people we agree are persecuting the Hazara—don't then say, 'Yes, run away, but don't come to us, because we will lock you up and keep you there indefinitely, because we don't want you in our country.'


It is the same in Sri Lanka. You all know that the Rajapakse regime in Sri Lanka is carrying out, as we speak, persecution and human rights abuses in Sri Lanka right now. You all know that, and yet you are pretending you do not. The reason we are getting more and more Sri Lankans is that they are being persecuted by the Rajapakse. You have just had the International Commission of Jurists bring out a report talking about the impeachment of the chief justice; you have had reports of what is going on in that country, with disappearances, where academics are disappearing in white vans—you have had all of those things. And yet you choose to pretend and listen to the Rajapakse saying, 'No, everything's fine in Sri Lanka; it's not a problem.' Well, it is a problem—and that is why people are leaving, and you know it. So you all know that the reason people are leaving their countries is that they are persecuted.


I went to the Pontville detention centre not long ago, when 129 children, unaccompanied minors aged between 14 and 18—young men—were brought to that detention centre. And they talked about the persecution that they had suffered and that they had run away from. You know that is happening; you know the Hazara are being persecuted; you know they are genuine refugees—but you choose base domestic politics of fear and mean-spiritedness above decency, humanity and compassion when it comes to the treatment of children. That is what you are doing. We are standing here in this parliament to make a plea for those children: bring them home from Manus Island. Bring them home now. Bring their families home. Bring them to Australia and have them assessed against their asylum-seeking claims. Don’t do what you are doing and excise the whole country and go into the same immoral space where the former Prime Minister, John Howard, tried to take Australia and where you are now taking this nation.


It is a stain on the national character. It is a shocking day for Australia—you have got together and suspended standing orders to drive this through so that ahead of an election you can brag out in the community that you have been crueller than John Howard, that you have been even more extreme in your punishment of children. Congratulations—I hope you all feel really good about that! When you vote for this, I would ask you to explain to your own children why they should not be on Manus Island and why other people's children should be locked up, detained indefinitely, treated cruelly and subjected to mental punishment and torture. For the rest of their lives they will have to deal with what this parliament thinks is an appropriate way to treat children. I urge you to support these amendments.

This will be done on a case by case basis to assess individual circumstances. But we do consider sufficient safeguards are in place to protect vulnerable persons and that exempting children and their families would simply encourage people-smugglers to put children on boats to Australia.

Reports about unauthorised maritime arrivals



(1) The Minister must cause to be laid before each House of the Parliament, within 15 sitting days of that House after the end of a financial year, a report on the following:


   (a) arrangements made by regional processing countries during the financial year for unauthorised maritime arrivals who make claims for protection under the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol, including arrangements for:


      (i) assessing those claims in those countries; and


      (ii) the accommodation, health care and education of those unauthorised maritime arrivals in those countries;


(b) the number of those claims assessed in those countries in the financial year;


   (c) the number of unauthorised maritime arrivals determined in those countries in the financial year to be covered by the definition of refugee in Article 1A of the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol.


(2) However, a report under this section need deal with a particular regional processing country in accordance with subsection (1) only so far as information provided by the country makes it reasonably practicable for the report to do so.


(3) A report under this section must not include:


   (a) the name of a person who is or was an unauthorised maritime arrival; or

198AJ of the Migration Act



   Section 198AJ of the Migration Act applies to the period beginning on 13 August 2012 and ending on the first 30 June after commencement as if that period were a financial year.


The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee report made a recommendation that the bill be amended to require the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship to report annually to both houses of parliament with respect to matters relating to unauthorised maritime arrivals, including arrangements for assessing their claims, accommodation, health care and education. Additionally, the committee recommended the minister report on the number of asylum claims by unauthorised maritime arrivals that are assessed and determined to be refugees during each 12-month period. This amendment gives effect to those recommendations.

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (12:05):  Despite the Greens' support for more information to be given to parliament in relation to how many cases the department is managing, there is a big get-out clause in this amendment which renders this entire amendment useless, and it is item (2). Despite the list of things that the minister is required to include in a report at the end of each financial year, under schedule (1), the amendment states:


(2) However, a report under this section need deal with a particular regional processing country in accordance with subsection (1) only so far as information provided by the country makes it reasonably practicable for the report to do so.


Time and time again, the government say they will do these things and then give themselves a get-out clause so that none of it has to happen. That is why, when we saw the allowance for Manus Island to be used for offshore processing, we did not have the information about what conditions people would be living in, how people would be treated or what services would be provided—because the act gives the minister total discretion as to what information he gives the parliament. For the minister to not give information, he just has to say he does not think it is reasonable. So this whole amendment is basically useless and it will not be getting the Greens' support.

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (12:08):  We have been debating this legislation for two hours and 20 minutes. We are about to excise Australia's entire mainland. We have dealt with amendments that relate to the detention of children on Manus Island. We have dealt with amendments that relate to giving appropriate media access to these detention centres. We have dealt with an amendment in relation to ensuring that Australia's Human Rights Commission has access. There is no evidence that this bill, if passed, will save any lives. In fact, all the evidence is to the contrary. It is going to cost people's lives and damage people who are already suffering from such harm.


This is a bad piece of legislation, an immoral piece of legislation, and all we see is the government and the opposition ramming it through in just over two hours, despite the fact that it was not meant to be on the agenda this morning. We think it is very important for people to understand that this is how desperate both the Labor Party and the Liberal Party are in the race to the bottom on refugees. They have discarded all proper process and are simply ramming this through. The result will mean more suffering, more harm and more damage to refugees who have fled war. It is a pretty low point in this parliament. It is a pretty low point for our country. John Howard could not succeed in getting this done, but Julia Gillard has.

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2013-05-16,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia) (09:50):  I indicate to the chamber that the coalition will not be opposing the Migration Amendment (Unauthorised Maritime Arrivals and Other Measures) Bill 2012. The reason we will not be opposing the bill is that the substance of it is consistent with the coalition's long-held position in relation to the offshore processing regime and, in any event, it is fundamentally the same bill as the one that was introduced by the Howard government in 2006 and, which I note, was passed by the House of Representatives.


The stated objective of the bill is to expand the existing offshore processing regime to apply to all persons arriving on mainland Australia unlawfully by sea. It will replace the concept of 'offshore entry person' with the concept of 'unauthorised maritime arrival'. The effect of the bill is that persons who arrive on Australian soil by boat without a valid visa will be subject to removal to an offshore processing country and will be processed according to that regime—that is, the bill will effectively excise the Australian mainland from the Migration Act. It is intended to be a disincentive aimed at discouraging potential unlawful immigrants from making the hazardous sea voyage to Australia.


While the coalition will not be opposing, and in fact is strongly supporting, the passage of this legislation today—and I note for the record that the coalition voted with the government to rearrange the business of the Senate today to ensure that this bill was given precedence and that the coalition gave up our private senators' time this morning to ensure that this bill is facilitated in a timely fashion—I do believe we need to consider why the government has introduced this bill, given that when the same bill was introduced in 2006 by the Howard government those on the opposite side of the chamber howled in opposition to it. These are the facts that Australia is faced with today.


Five years ago in November 2007, when this Labor government was first elected to office, there were just four people in immigration detention who had arrived in Australia illegally by boat. When the Labor government was elected to office in November 2007, maintenance of Australia's immigration detention network was costing Australian taxpayers less than $100 million per annum. In fact, it was costing approximately $85 million. Today there are well in excess of 15,000 illegal maritime arrivals in Australia's detention system, whether they are on bridging visas in community detention, in alternative places of detention or in the detention network itself. This government's spectacular record of failure in relation to this portfolio worsens when you consider that the number of people who have arrived since November 2007 is 40,772 on 673 boats. It is a fact, and that is one of the reasons whereby the government and Minister O'Connor today came to the coalition quite literally on bended knee and begged us to facilitate the passage of this legislation, which we agreed we would do. It is a fact that Australia is now witnessing what is an unprecedented rate of boat arrivals and that is, without a doubt, the sole reason the government has done an about-face in relation to policy in this area.


April 2013 is now on record as the month with the largest number of asylum seeker arrivals, with 3,300 people arriving by boat in that one month alone. March 2013 saw over 2,500 asylum seekers arrive and even though we are only two weeks into May, we have already seen 1,500 asylum seekers arrive. What that means—and perhaps the reason the government again came to the coalition on bended knee today, with Minister O'Connor begging shadow minister Scott Morrison for his assistance in relation to the facilitation of this legislation through the Senate—is that Australia has witnessed approximately 66 people arriving by boat per day this year. That is solely attributable to this government's grotesque failure in relation to border protection policy. 


This bill was introduced into the parliament by the former Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Mr Bowen, on 31 October 2012. The proposal set out in the bill reflects some but not all of the advice of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers, which recommended that an arrival anywhere in Australia by regular maritime means should result in such individuals having the same status as those arriving at an offshore place which has already been excised from the immigration zone. The effect of this bill will mean that irregular maritime arrivals anywhere in Australia will make that person liable to regional processing arrangements.


Given the hysteria of the government in 2006 when we introduced what is effectively the same piece of legislation—which I believe the government now acknowledges, given they have today come cap in hand to the coalition, is part of a suite of policy measures which indeed does stop the boats—I believe it is appropriate to put on the record comments of those at the time and what the Labor members said in relation to the Howard government's legislation and to note that today they are the ones who are begging us, the coalition who stopped the boats, to now support them in their efforts to restore part of the former Howard government's strong suite of border protection policies, which clearly, by the passage of this legislation, they now admit they were wrong in rolling back. Take, for example, the comments of the former minister for immigration, the minister who in the other place introduced what is effectively the former Howard government's bill. This is what he said back in 2006: 


This is a bad bill with no redeeming features. It is a hypocritical and illogical bill. If it is passed today, it will be a stain on our national character ... If it is passed, it will be repealed by an incoming Labor government.


History now records that it was, in fact, repealed by the incoming Labor government. History also now records the facts I have outlined for the record today—that Australia has now been subjected to an unprecedented number of illegal boat arrivals. Under this government, we are heading towards 41,000 arrivals in 2013, which equates to approximately 66 arrivals per day. 


Despite the fact that Minister Bowen in 2006 took a completely different stance on legislation which had been proven to work and to stop the boats, we see that same minister, now in government, acknowledging that Labor have made one of the greatest—if not the greatest—policy mistakes of all time. They are now backing the coalition to side with them and support what is effectively Howard government legislation.


What did Mr Simon Crean say at the time the Howard government's bill was passed?


The bill is shameful and xenophobic.


   …   …   … 


It is a bill that should be opposed. 


I note that by 2012 Mr Crean had clearly had a change of heart.


What did Mr Anthony Albanese have to say at the time?


This bill is wrong in principle and it is wrong in motivation. 


   …   …   …


This bill is a disgraceful shirking of responsibility by Australia and it must be rejected.


   …   …   …


I reject the bill as being fundamentally abhorrent to everything I believe in …


   …   …   …


It has been a test of the Australian Labor Party and we have risen to the occasion, and that is why we are rejecting this legislation.


Clearly Mr Albanese has also come to the realisation, as have the majority of Australians, that Labor were wrong in 2006 and that they were wrong in 2008 when they repealed the Howard government legislation. But they are right today to come into this place and to ask the coalition to assist them in facilitating the passage of what is effectively the former Howard government's legislation.


Why has the Labor Party done an about-face? Why did the Labor Party—the current minister, Mr O'Connor— come to the shadow minister, Mr Morrison, and effectively beg him to assist Labor in passing this legislation today? These are the reasons. Over the life of the Howard government, 1999 was the year of the greatest number of boat arrivals—86 boats arrived in 1999. In comparison, this year 86 boats arrived just between 1 January and 14 April. The greatest number of asylum seekers arriving in any one year under the Howard government was in 2001—5,550 people arrived in 2001. In comparison, the Gillard government managed to exceed that figure in just the eight weeks covering March and April of this year. 


What did we, the former Howard government, do? We realised we had a problem and we took strong and decisive action, which included the action set out in the bill before the Senate today. What was the result of the former Howard government's strong border protection policies? In 2002, the year after the Pacific solution was introduced, the number of boats arriving in Australia was reduced to zero. In 2003, one boat arrived; in 2004, zero boats arrived; in 2005, four boats arrived; in 2006, six boats arrived; and, in 2007, five boats arrived. The fact of the matter is this: the Labor Party cannot deny that, when they assumed office in November 2007, they inherited a solution from the former Howard government. In August of 2008, they proceeded quite deliberately and arrogantly to wind back the proven border protection policies of the former Howard government. We have now come almost full circle and we stand here today in the Senate implementing—or re-implementing—a further plank of the former Howard government's border protection policies. 


Will this go far enough? Absolutely not. I have put forward a private senator's bill to reintroduce temporary protection visas. That is something which this bill does not do. I would say to those on the other side: if you really are fair dinkum about stopping the boats and if you really do want to return, as you are telling us, to the former Howard government's policies, you must also give urgent consideration to restoring temporary protection visas as part of the suite of policy measures.


There is a difference between the Howard government bill and this bill. One of those differences is—lo and behold—their effectiveness. The government's March 2012 decision to allow all offshore entry persons access to merits and judicial review through the RRT and the courts severely weakens the effectiveness of this bill and will prove to be very costly to taxpayers—bearing in mind that the cost to taxpayers of the government's failed border protection policies is now in excess of $10 billion. When the coalition introduced its bill in 2006, the bill's impact would have been much more significant than that of the current bill and would have denied all asylum seekers access to merits and judicial review. 


Whilst the Labor government have significantly watered down a number of previous coalition initiatives, consequently diminishing the potential impact of this bill, the broad principle of this bill is, as I said at the outset, consistent with coalition policy and we will therefore support it—notwithstanding the gross hypocrisy of Labor. In 2006, Labor were screaming from the rooftops that the very provisions which they have begged us to support today—the very provisions which, under the Howard government, were proven to work—were anathema to them. I commend this bill to the Senate.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2013-05-16,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (10:07):  I rise to speak in opposition to the Migration Amendment (Unauthorised Maritime Arrivals and Other Measures) Bill 2012. The Australian Greens are in strong opposition to the idea of removing Australia's entire mainland from our migration zone. When John Howard, back in 2006, proposed to do this very thing here in this place, not only did we have members of the Labor Party speaking strongly against it; we even had members of the coalition speaking strongly against it. When John Howard proposed to strip all migration law rights away from people based on their arriving on the Australian mainland, one of the reasons that that bill did not end up passing the Senate was that even Barnaby Joyce—




Senator Williams:
  Senator Joyce.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  believed that this was bad policy. Even Senator Barnaby Joyce knew the madness of this policy. It must be pretty bad when you have got Senator Joyce arguing for the rights of refugees and the rights of vulnerable people under basic rule-of-law provisions.


I urge all members in this place to search the back of their conscience and to think about why this is really being put forward and why there is an urgency for it to be rushed through. There is no urgency, of course, except the continued failure of the government's already harsh, inhumane and cruel no advantage rule and offshore processing, which have not worked to stem the flow of people in our region who are desperate to seek protection. The Prime Minister on this issue is always looking for somebody else to blame, and now it is that we have provisions on the mainland that uphold the rule of law—that is bad and that has got to go, according to the Prime Minister and this Labor government. And of course Tony Abbott's opposition are going to support this legislation, because it is their policy. This is the Labor government implementing John Howard's policy and Tony Abbott's policy. That is what is going on here. We do not have to wait until 14 September; we have already got the opposition's policy. The Labor government have done all the Liberal Party's dirty work when it comes to beating up on refugees, dog whistling on immigration and stripping away laws that protect the most vulnerable in our community.


This bill effectively excises the entire mainland of Australia from the ordinary operations of the migration zone so that, wherever somebody may arrive, they do not have the right to seek protection under normal circumstances. This expands the already existing two-tiered system that is in direct contravention of the refugee convention, which clearly identifies that we should not be discriminating against people and their right to protection, care and safety based on their mode of arrival. It is simply wrong. It is unacceptable under the refugee convention. Yet here we are this morning seeing exactly that happening—both the government and the opposition doing away with, violating, the letter and the spirit of the rights outlined in the refugee convention.


As I said, the Howard government had already attempted to do this. In 2001, they set up a system which treated refugees who arrived by boat differently—not to protect them, not to care for them, not to deal in a practical way with their vulnerability and needs. No, no; it was to demonise them, to whip up fear and hatred and to send a signal to the nastiest, darkest parts of our psyche, where we may think that somehow, because somebody is a refugee and had to come by boat, they are a bad person. That is precisely why John Howard changed these rules in 2001 and that is precisely what the Labor government, hand in hand and shoulder to shoulder with Tony Abbott's coalition, are doing today.


This is yet another stark and very, very disappointing example of the government locked in a race to the bottom with the coalition over immigration and refugee policy. Punishing refugees for seeking protection in Australia is the central concept of this bill. Let us not beat around the bush. This bill does nothing to save people's lives. This bill does nothing to protect and help and care for vulnerable refugees, including children. This bill does nothing to help these people and it will not save their lives. This bill is all about punishment and all about whipping up fear and hatred and demonising people because of how they arrived and where they have come from. The fact is that the majority of people who arrive here by boat—whether it is in the already excised zone or the small handful of people who find their way to the mainland—are people who could not come to Australia by plane because they never would have got a ticket without a visa, because of the countries that they come from, because of their need to flee from torture, from persecution, from war. This bill goes right to the heart of discriminating against refugees because of the places they have had to flee.


Of course, as we know, just as happened in 2006, this bill has been widely criticised by a range of legal and human rights experts. This bill went to inquiry, and it was universally condemned. The only supporting evidence to this inquiry came from the government's own department. Not one independent voice in support of this piece of legislation came forward. Not one independent voice of support exists for this legislation.


In fact, let me just go to what the United Nations and their human rights and refugee committees have said in relation to this piece of legislation. We know that the UNHCR in Australia have said that they are extremely concerned that the measures to excise large portions of the territory to set up systems which substantially reduce fundamental refugee protection rights sets a negative precedent internationally.


This is not about building a regional protection framework; this is doing the absolute opposite. This is about gross, bottom of the barrel, crass domestic politics here in Australia. This is about the Labor Party competing with Tony Abbott as to who can be the toughest, the cruellest, the meanest on refugees.




Senator Williams:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I ask Senator Hanson-Young to refer to those in the other place by their correct titles. She started off with 'Barnaby Joyce' instead of 'Senator Joyce', then continued on about 'Tony Abbott'—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Bernardi
):  Thank you, Senator Williams; I understand your point. Before you continue, Senator Hanson-Young, Senator Williams is absolutely correct: you have, on a number of occasions, referred to other members of parliament without their correct titles. You have corrected yourself on one of those occasions, and I should have drawn it your attention earlier. So, please, would you adhere to the Senate standing orders.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. This is crass domestic politics that is based on the Labor Party competing, in a race to the bottom, as to who can be the cruellest, the nastiest, the meanest, the harshest on refugees. A race to the bottom with Mr Abbott's coalition—that is what this piece of legislation is about.


The UNHCR goes on to say that, if each one of the 148 other countries around the world that have signed on to the refugee convention took this attitude and changed their laws in this way, it would undermine the entire convention. This legislation is out of step with not just the letter but absolutely the spirit of the convention. We know that the Refugee Council has said that they are extremely concerned about this as well—that it violates our obligations. It strips away people's rights, and it will likely cause serious harm to people fleeing from persecution and torture. It will cause more harm, more damage, to people who are already fleeing some pretty unsafe and harmful circumstances. That is what the experts are saying.


We know that many of the church groups around the country are extremely concerned about this as well, from a moral perspective as well as a legal one. We have seen Elenie Poulos, the National Director of UnitingJustice, attached to the Uniting Church, say that this is a shameful piece of legislation that undercuts our moral responsibilities as a nation towards vulnerable and oppressed asylum seekers.


This is a bad piece of legislation and is only designed to hurt people and not care for them. There is nothing in this legislation that will save people's lives—in fact, unfortunately, all to the contrary. People's lives are going to be at more risk. People are going to suffer more. Children will not have rights. Despite the need for protection, they will not now have access to lawyers. They will not have any legal assistance at all. They cannot even make a claim for refugee protection under this legislation. They can be sent, of course, offshore to one of the cruel camps—whether that is Manus Island or Nauru or wherever else this government or the coalition decide they want to start dumping vulnerable refugees. This bill exposes vulnerable people to indefinite detention in inhumane and cruel camps.


As to those who may be lucky enough to be put on a bridging visa after suffering in detention, they will have no work rights. They will have no access to proper education or medical services. They will have no way of being able to rebuild their lives and protect their children. In fact, children and families under this legislation will be pushed into poverty even further.


This legislation exposes more people in immigration detention to inadequate legal assistance and legal oversight—in fact, not just 'inadequate'; they have no rights at all. Whether you are the vulnerable family of someone who has been fighting for democracy in Iran or a Hazara family from Afghanistan, you have no rights for proper protection under this piece of legislation.


What is the urgency for us to have to rush this piece of legislation through? It is not going to stop people coming here by boat; we know that. We know that being harsh to people, deterrence policies, do not stop people taking those dangerous journeys when that is the only option they have. We have seen that proven over the last six months.


Back in August last year, we saw this again—the Labor Party implementing the coalition's policies on offshore detention, on stripping out protection and on the no-advantage rule. We were told that was going to slow the boats. It has not slowed the boats at all: we have four times the number of people fleeing to Australia than we did last year. It has not stopped people taking those journeys. It has not saved people's lives.


In fact, the unfortunate thing about all of this is that no-one is safer—no-one is being kept safer or treated better; no-one's rights are being upheld. In fact, the exact opposite is happening: we are now subjecting children to institutionalised child abuse in the detention camps of cruelty on Manus Island. That is the reality of the policies that are coming from this government, backed up by Mr Abbott's coalition. These policies are not saving people's lives; they are not caring for people. These policies and this legislation are subjecting people to further harm and torture.


I will be moving three amendments to this legislation. The first amendment is in relation to allowing for media access to these detention camps that Australians are paying billions and billions of dollars for. We saw the budget come out on Tuesday night and we know that offshore processing is costing Australian taxpayers more than $7½ billion. In fact, if you include this year and the forward estimates, it is costing $10 billion to detain children and their families on Manus Island, in inhumane conditions, damaging them for the rest of their lives—$10 billion. There is of course no media access to these detention centres, because the government do not want the Australian people to see how badly we are treating our fellow human beings. They do not want the Australian conscience to be pricked by the truth of what is going on in these camps. The amendment that I will be moving in relation to that is to allow media access to our detention centres, particularly those offshore on Manus Island and Nauru.


The second amendment is about allowing the Australian Human Rights Commission to enter those camps and be able to inspect them—because we cannot trust either this government or any government run by the coalition to treat vulnerable refugees and their families properly. We know that every time we actually get a glimpse into what is going on in these awful places, we see that people are not being treated right, that it is inhumane, that children are suffering. We should be allowing the Australian Human Rights Commission to go inside and inspect. I ask you, Mr Acting Deputy President: if there is nothing to hide, why not let them in?


The third amendment is a very important one, in relation to removing children and their families from Manus Island. It is a horrible place. It is a cruel place. It is an inhumane place. Even adults should not be there. Vulnerable refugees do not deserve to be treated like animals, as we have seen from the footage that was leaked through the Four Cornersreport only some weeks ago. Children are suffering on Manus Island, and it is time they were brought to the Australian mainland and cared for properly. This amendment will ban any government from being able to detain children, remove children to those awful places of abuse and cruelty—they are inhumane. Those children must be brought to the Australian mainland and cared for.


As a mother I have a responsibility to stand in this place and argue for the rights of those children. I call on every senator in this place to stand up for those children's rights as well, and do what you would want if they were your children.

"Thistlethwaite, Sen Matt",ALP,2013-05-16,"



Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales—Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs and Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs) (10:28):  I thank all senators for their contributions to the second reading debate on the Migration Amendment (Unauthorised Maritime Arrivals and Other Measures) Bill 2012. Dealing with the issue of irregular maritime arrivals has probably been the most difficult public policy issue that our nation has dealt with in the last 25 years. I do not believe that anyone in this parliament believes that Australia should take an immoral or heartless approach to refugees. And certainly our history demonstrates and proves that this nation has been most welcoming of people coming from difficult circumstances, fleeing persecution, fleeing war and settling in Australia.


This government's commitment to supporting refugees coming to this country is highlighted by the fact that we have increased the humanitarian intake of refugees to 20,000—I believe the largest settlement program of any nation throughout the world. But what we cannot allow to continue to happen are events such as those that occurred on 15 December 2010, when 50 innocent women and children drowned in shocking circumstances before the eyes of this nation on the rocks at Christmas Island. We simply cannot allow, as a nation with a heart, those circumstances to occur again.


The Gillard government empanelled a team of experts, headed by Angus Houston, to develop a set of recommendations to try and take the politics out of this very difficult issue and to come up with a workable solution for the long term. That panel consulted and reported, and they came up with 22 recommendations. They made it very clear to the government and to the nation when they made those recommendations that they must be accepted as a whole, a full package—that you could not seek to pick out and implement elements of it. They made it clear that it needed to come as a full package for it to be effective.


This bill delivers on one of those recommendations. It delivers on the advice of the experts that the government consulted to attempt to take the politics out of this issue. That recommendation is recommendation No. 14. It says:


… arrival anywhere on Australia by irregular maritime means will not provide individuals with a different lawful status than those who arrive in an excised offshore place.


That is, irregular arrival by sea anywhere in Australia should make the person liable to regional processing arrangements. That is necessary to ensure the no advantage principle is adhered to. The panel's reasoning in making this recommendation was the need to reduce any incentive for people to take even greater risks with their lives by seeking to reach the Australian mainland to avoid being subject to regional processing arrangements. The report states:


The Panel considers that all possible measures should be implemented to avoid creating an incentive for IMAs taking even greater risks with their lives by seeking to reach the Australian mainland. As a complement to facilities in Nauru and PNG, the Panel recommends the Government bring forward legislative amendments to the Migration Act 1958 so that arrival on the Australian mainland by irregular maritime means does not provide individuals with a different lawful status than those who enter at an excised offshore place, such as Christmas Island.


That is making it very clear to the Prime Minister, to the executive and to the nation what they expected as an effective means for ensuring a deterrent to people-smuggling. The panel also emphasised—and the government has consistently reiterated—that this recommendation in the report is part of an integrated set of proposals. To be effective in discouraging asylum seekers from risking their lives, the incentives and disincentives the panel recommended must be pursued in a comprehensive, coordinated manner. This includes incentives to encourage greater use of regular migration pathways and international protection arrangements and disincentives to undertake irregular maritime voyages, including the application of a no advantage principle and regional processing arrangements. The legislative amendments proposed in this bill are part of that integrated approach.


The bill was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee for inquiry and report. I thank the committee for their report, tabled on 25 February 2013. I thank those who provided submissions and of course those who appeared before the committee. The bill involves complex issues, and I commend the manner in which the committee has captured and reported these complexities. The report states:


… the committee supports the intent of the Bill, subject to one important amendment.


The committee recommended that the bill be amended to require the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship to report annually to both houses of parliament in respect of matters relating to unauthorised maritime arrivals, including arrangements for assessing their refugee claims as well as the arrangements relating to accommodation, health care and education. Additionally, the committee recommended that the minister report on the number of asylum claims by unauthorised maritime arrivals that are assessed and determined to be refugees during the 12-month period. The government amendment that will be moved in the committee stage reflects this recommendation and will require the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship to cause that to be laid before each house of the parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after the end of the financial year.


The government does not support the amendments that have been put forward by the Greens, as that would be contrary to the recommendations of the expert panel, which the government has accepted and is implementing. The bill marks an important further step in giving effect to the recommendations of the panel and will remove yet another incentive for asylum seekers to take greater risks with their lives to reach the Australian mainland. 


In respect of the claim that this is excising the Australian mainland, let me reiterate that this bill does not purport to excise the Australian mainland from the migration zone. The definition of the migration zone is not being amended in this bill. Instead, the bill defines individuals subject to regional processing based on their status as unauthorised maritime arrivals—that is, by arriving in Australia in the migration zone, by sea, without a visa in effect. This is in contrast to the current situation, where an individual is only subject to regional processing if they enter regional Australia in an excised offshore place such as Christmas Island.


In summing up, this government is fully committed to delivering a proper and sustainable regional solution through the full implementation of the recommendations of the expert panel that was led by Angus Houston. No-one should doubt this government's commitment to implementing all 22 of the recommendations of the expert panel to break the people smugglers business model and help to stop people dying at sea. That is how responsible governments develop policy—listening to the advice of experts.


I thank all senators for their contributions to this debate and I commend the bill and the government amendments to the Senate.

The speech read as follows—



INTERACTIVE GAMBLING AMENDMENT (VIRTUAL CREDITS) BILL 2013


This bill aims to address a serious and significant loophole in our current online gambling laws. Online gambling is developing at a rapid pace; it now goes beyond sports betting and online poker to a myriad of different games played through Facebook, on iPhones and internet gaming.


Currently, the definition of 'gambling service' in the Interactive Gambling Act 2001 reads:




(a)


a service for the placing, making, receiving or acceptance of bets; or





(b)


a service the sole or dominant purpose of which is to introduce individuals who wish to 
make or place bets to individuals who are willing to receive or accept those bets; or





(c)


a service for the conduct of a lottery; or





(d)


a service for the supply of lottery tickets; or





(e)


a service for the conduct of a game, where:





   (i
)


the game is played for money or anything else of value; and





   (i
i)


the game is a game of chance or of mixed chance and skill; and





   (i
ii)


a customer of the service gives or agrees to give consideration to play or enter the game; or





(f)


a gambling service (within the ordinary meaning of that expression) that is not covered by any of the above paragraphs.



Currently, under the law, virtual items purchased within a game or in relation to a game are not considered 'items of value' under this definition. That means that many of the games currently operating, which any reasonable person would consider to be gambling, do not come under the regulations set out in the Act.


I was first made aware of this issue when a constituent of mine approached me. He had been playing a game called DoubleDown Casino through Facebook. At the start, players used free virtual chips to gamble on roulette and blackjack. However, as the game progressed, players – including my constituent – had to purchase additional virtual chips with real cash.


The problem came when my constituent tried to cash out his winnings, and couldn't. Despite the fact he had paid real money to gamble, the game would not allow him to exchange the virtual chips he had won for hard currency. He was only able to cash out his winnings for more virtual chips.


At the time, I wrote to the Australian Media and Communications Authority, asking them to investigate the operator for breaches of the Interactive Gambling Act. My belief was that this was a clear example of a gambling service, and therefore prohibited under the Act.


However, ACMA responded that because the chips were virtual and gamblers were therefore not technically playing for real money, DoubleDown was not covered by the definition of 'gambling service' and therefore not subject to the provisions in the Act.


In short, there was nothing ACMA could do.


I also wrote to Minister Conroy, who responded that this matter would be considered as part of his Department's review of the Act. However, no changes were suggested or implemented on this matter once the review was concluded.


This is a clear loophole in relation to online gambling regulation. It is a simple matter of consumer protection, and the fact that this definition in the Act has failed to keep pace with technology, and it doesn't take into account the way many of these sites operate. The current legislation is 12 years old. Given the rapid take-up of online gambling and the expansion of the industry, it needs to be overhauled.


DoubleDown is not a one-off example. On a similar front, Zynga Poker is an online gambling game where players also use virtual items or credits to bet. However, Zynga goes one step further and sells 'gift cards;' in supermarkets and toy stores, which can be used to purchase items within the game. These cards can be purchased, using real money, by children as young as thirteen – or even younger, if that restriction is not enforced at the point of sale.


Zynga, like DoubleDown, does not allow these virtual credits to be cashed out. 


Dr Charles Livingstone of Monash University is an expert in gambling behaviours, and has previously spoken out about his concerns with these kinds of online games and the access children have to them.


Earlier this year, speaking to the ABC he said:




""
They are in a sense preparing kids to find gambling, particularly slot machine or poker machine gambling, an attractive form… It
'
s hard for governments to act when these things emerge but I do think that it is an important priority that they act to ensure that young people do not have access to games which mimic existing gambling opportunities and which have the potential to create a whole new generation of gambling-dependent young folk.
""



We have seen multiple examples of games played through social media or online gaming where buying virtual items with real cash is commonplace. These virtual items become a de facto currency for the game and take on an intrinsic value.


There have even been court cases overseas where people have been charged and penalised for the theft of virtual items.


We are lagging seriously behind in consumer protection measures on this front. These games are genuine gambling activities and involve the loss of real money; in fact, they cannot truly be called 'games' at all.


They need to be appropriately regulated and controlled so that consumers, including children, are protected.


This bill amends the definition of 'gambling service' to specify that 'items of value' include virtual tokens, credits, coins, objects or any similar thing that is purchased within, or as part of, or in relation to, the game.


This will ensure that sites such as DoubleDown and Zynga have to come clean about their activities, and that consumers will know whether they are participating in gambling activities or not.


It will also ensure that these sites are not available to children.


This measure is straightforward and necessary, and it will significantly improve consumer protection and online gambling regulation in Australia.


I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

The speeches read as follows—



NATIONAL DISABILITY INSURANCE SCHEME LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2013


This bill follows up the recent landmark legislation underpinning the first stage of DisabilityCare Australia, the National Disability Insurance Scheme, by making minor clarifying and consequential amendments to complement the main legislation.


The National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013, passed earlier this year, establishes DisabilityCare Australia, —the National Disability Insurance Scheme.


This will enable the scheme to be launched, and DisabilityCare Australia to operate the launch, in four sites across Australia from July 2013 – in South Australia, Tasmania, the Hunter region in New South Wales, and the Barwon area of Victoria – and, from July 2014, in the Australian Capital Territory and the Barkly region of the Northern Territory.


This bill makes minor amendments to the legislation to clarify the policy intention in relevant provisions, and to address minor anomalies and technical errors.


These technical changes will make sure that all of the details intended to be specified in the rules – which are necessary for implementation of the first stage of the scheme – will reflect the principal legislation for the scheme.


For example, provisions that allow rules to be made to prescribe relevant 'criteria' will be clarified to make sure rules can also be made to prescribe 'matters for consideration' or 'factors to be taken into account'.


Similarly, in the case of the early intervention supports, where there is no intention to make rules and where key eligibility criteria are already set out clearly in the legislation, the current rule-making power is being removed to avoid any risk that those provisions would not be available to people who may benefit from them.


The bill will strengthen the audit and risk management framework of DisabilityCare Australia. It is critical that the Board adopts a rigorous approach to oversight of DisabilityCare Australia, ensuring that this historic reform is financially sustainable and will support the wellbeing of Australians with disability for decades to come.


The framework for audit and risk management provides an important assurance that DisabilityCare Australia's operations and risks are being prudently and soundly managed.


Other minor amendments include clarifying the matters to which the CEO must have regard when considering whether to take action to claim or obtain compensation, or take over the conduct of an existing claim. These matters are similar to the matters that the act already requires the CEO to have regard to when deciding whether to require a scheme participant to take compensation action. 


While it is not expected that the CEO will often need to take on or take over compensation claims, the amendments provide clarity to scheme participants and potential participants about what the CEO would need to consider before taking any such action.


The bill also makes consequential amendments to other Commonwealth Acts to complement the National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013.


The bill will establish a new National Disability Insurance Scheme Division of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and require that members appointed to the division have expertise relating to disability or other relevant experience.


The Minister responsible for the scheme will also have to be consulted before a tribunal member can be assigned to the new division.


These requirements will ensure that applications for review of relevant decisions under the scheme are reviewed by tribunal members with appropriate training, knowledge or experience in this specialised area. A robust external merits review system is integral to supporting fair, efficient and effective decision making under the National Disability Insurance Scheme.


Amendments to the social security law will include changes to ensure that amounts paid under the National Disability Insurance Scheme for supports funded under a participant's plan are not taken into account under the social security or veterans' entitlements income and assets tests.


Lastly, among some consequential amendments to the taxation legislation, there will be changes to ensure that payments and benefits provided under the National Disability Insurance Scheme to participants in the scheme are exempt from income tax.


DISABILITYCARE AUSTRALIA FUND BILL 2013




For too long, people with disability, and their carers and families, have lived with inequity and uncertainty.





That is why this Government is transforming disability services by creating and locking in funding for DisabilityCare Australia.





DisabilityCare Australia will provide people with significant and permanent disability across Australia with the support they need. 





The support they have waited too long for. 





It will provide them with choice and control. 





And it will enhance their opportunities for social and economic participation. 



Through the bill the Prime Minster has introduced, the Government will provide a strong and enduring funding stream for DisabilityCare Australia, and provide certainty to people with disability that they will receive support in the long term, the Government will increase the Medicare levy from 1.5 to 2 per cent from 1 July 2014. 




Disability can affect any of us and therefore it affects all of us.





That is why we are asking Australians to make a small contribution that will make a big difference to the lives of over 460,000 people with disability when the scheme is fully rolled out.



It was a Labor Government that introduced the Medicare levy in 1984 to fund Medicare.  


The introduction of Medicare and the Medicare levy ensured equal access to health care for all Australians and demonstrated a commitment by the Labor government to the benefits of universal health care. 


The DisabilityCare Australia Fund Bill is an important part of making DisabilityCare Australia a reality.


Every dollar raised from increasing the Medicare levy will be paid into the DisabilityCare Australia Fund, that we will establish with this bill.


This bill makes it crystal clear that the additional funds raised by the Medicare levy can only be drawn upon to fund DisabilityCare Australia.


The DisabilityCare Australia Fund will be managed by the Future Fund Board of Guardians (the Future Fund Board) who have the experience in successfully managing other Government owned investment funds.


The bill requires that a fixed amount of the money flowing into the Fund each year will be set aside for the States and Territories. 


This amount will be $825 million in 2014-15, one quarter of the amount we expect to raise in that year. 


The annual amount allocated within the Fund to the States and Territories will be grown in future years by 3.5 per cent per year. 


Over ten years, the States and Territories will be allocated a total of $9.7 billion.


Funds will be used to reimburse States and Territories for spending on the scheme once key conditions are met. 


We will formalise those conditions in agreements with the States.


Consistent with the principle that these funds are only to be used for additional costs in delivering DisabilityCare, those conditions will ensure that States can only access funds once they are incurring significant new costs in delivering DisabilityCare.


To support early establishment costs, eligible States will also be able to access some of their annual allocation in 2015-16, 2016-17 and 2017-18.


The bill will also provide the opportunity to cover interim matters to enable DisabilityCare Australia to commence operations from 1 July 2013, through creation of a transitional special account to manage State and Territory government funds until the Board overseeing the National Disability Insurance Scheme Launch Transition Agency is established. 


The transitional special account will also be credited with the Commonwealth's contribution for 2013-14 which will be appropriated to the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. This will provide assurance to State and Territory governments that the Commonwealth's contribution will be spent only on DisabilityCare Australia.


This bill allows the DisabilityCare Australia Fund to receive, hold and invest the additional revenue from the increase in the Medicare levy for the purposes of reimbursing the Commonwealth and States and Territories for their contributions to DisabilityCare Australia. It supports the critical objectives and principles of DisabilityCare Australia.


The Government's plan for DisabilityCare Australia extends well beyond the Medicare levy increase and the DisabilityCare fund.


In the Budget, the Government detailed the long term structural savings that, along with the revenue from the Medicare levy increase, will fully fund DisabilityCare well beyond the forward estimates, even beyond a ten year horizon. 


This unprecedented step of providing long-term funding well beyond the normal four year Budget cycle shows the depth of Labor's commitment to DisabilityCare. 


It shows our commitment to righting the wrongs of too many years of complacency, too many years where we have not given proper regard to the needs of people with significant and permanent disability.


With the secure funding we lock in for DisabilityCare today and for the future, we ensure that come 1 July 2013, DisabilityCare will be here to stay.


MEDICARE LEVY AMENDMENT (DISABILITYCARE AUSTRALIA) BILL 2013


Australia's strong economy and Australia's social safety nets are the envy of the world.


In this Bill, we see Australia at its very best.


In this Bill, we see that we still can be the strong, smart, fair Australia that created the Age Pension and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, Medibank, Medicare and universal superannuation.


In this Bill, we see that there is still a place for collective action to solve those great pressures of life that are too big and complex for individuals and families to solve alone.


In this Bill, we see a nation united in a spirit of concern to strengthen and extend the fair go, to ensure no one is left behind ... 


… we also see a Parliament ready to put the national interest ahead of ideology.


To those who say Australian politics no longer works, I say simply: read the Medicare Levy Amendment (DisabilityCare Australia) Bill.


This is a united embrace of national responsibility and a great act of mutual care and solidarity.


Every week or fortnight, a sliver of the paypacket will go to DisabilityCare Australia: around a dollar a day for the average earner.


But all that money added together from every corner of the nation will be a mighty force for good.


Today we give an assurance to all Australians who live with disability and to those who care for them: DisabilityCare Australia will be here when you need it … election after election, decade after decade, generation after generation.


A new assurance for 410 000 Australians living with significant, permanent disability now and for their families and carers.


Today we also give a new assurance to all those Australians who do not have a disability today but who, through the vagaries of fortune, will come to have a significant, permanent disability in times to come.


For everyone who thinks, ""it couldn't happen to me – could it?"" this Bill brings peace of mind, it brings the knowledge that a scheme as well-designed and stably-funded as Medicare will be here when you need it. 


Let me turn to the detail of the Bill. 


The Bill will increase the Medicare levy by half a percentage point, from 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent, from 1 July 2014.


The Bill also makes consequential changes to the upper phase‑in amount for low‑income taxpayers with income between certain thresholds – as well as to the formula for calculating the amount of a person's Medicare levy liability where a person has a spouse or dependants.


These changes reflect the increase in the Medicare levy.


Low‑income earners will continue to receive relief from the Medicare levy through the low‑income thresholds for singles, families, seniors and pensioners. 


The current exemptions from the Medicare levy will also remain in place, including for blind pensioners and sickness allowance recipients.


A number of other tax rates that include a component for the Medicare levy will also increase in line with this change – these include increases in the rate of fringe benefits tax and excess contributions tax.


These bills will be introduced by my Ministers today and further details of these consequential increases are set out in the Explanatory Memorandum.


Every cent raised by the increase in the Medicare levy will be allocated to a special fund over the next decade – the DisabilityCare Australia Fund.


By law, the fund will only be spent on supporting people with disability through DisabilityCare Australia.


The DisabilityCare Australia Fund will be established by the DisabilityCare Australia Fund Bill 2013, which will be put before the House as part of this package. 


Full details of this fund will be outlined in the explanatory memorandum to that Bill which is to be tabled by the Deputy Prime Minister shortly.


Increasing the Medicare levy will raise approximately $20.4 billion between 2014‑15 and 2018‑19 – amounting to approximately 55 per cent of the total cost of funding DisabilityCare Australia over that period. 


The Commonwealth's share of the fund will go toward our additional contribution to DisabilityCare Australia.


This will cover around 60 per cent of the Australian Government's net new spending on the scheme over the ten years from 2014-15.


In last night's Budget, the Deputy Prime Minister outlined that through this increased Levy and other wise savings, DisabilityCare Australia is fully funded.


DisabilityCare Australia is designed to ensure every Australian with significant and permanent disability, regardless of where he or she lives, gets the care and support they need.


DisabilityCare Australia will end the notorious ""postcode lottery"" for people with disabilities in this country.


I want no more of the unfairness and irrationality by which a person gets vastly different support merely because of where he or she lives or how a disability was acquired.


This requires the commitment and support of State and Territory governments.


The Government will assist the States and Territories with funding their share of DisabilityCare Australia, by setting aside some of the money going into the DisabilityCare Australia Fund.


Over the life of the fund, the States and Territories will be allocated a total of $9.7 billion.


The States and Territories will be able to draw down from the Fund when they meet key conditions for implementation.


DisabilityCare Australia will have full coverage across the Australian Capital Territory by July 2016, in New South Wales and South Australia by July 2018, and Tasmania, Victoria, Queensland and the Northern Territory by July 2019. 


These agreements will see the scheme cover around 


90 per cent of the total Australian population.


The Western Australian allocation from the Fund will be quarantined until we reach agreement with the State.


We encourage the Western Australian Government to join the cause.


All our people deserve the best. 


To ensure that DisabilityCare Australia is fully funded, the Government has implemented a number of other savings measures.


Part of the savings from reforms to the Government's assistance for private health insurance announced in the 2012-13 MYEFO which have not been allocated to the Government's dental package will support DisabilityCare.


Funding will also come from reforms to retirement incomes policy, the phase out of the net medical expenses tax offset and other long-term savings decisions now announced as part of the 2013-14 Budget.


Making a new call upon the finances of Australians is not something that is done without care in this country – the fact is when a levy does happen, there is rightly a very good reason.


Bob Hawke with the Medicare levy.


John Howard with the levy for gun buy-backs.


This Government's flood levy which rebuilt Queensland.


Now, this increase in the Medicare levy to support DisabiltyCare.


Ours has been a fiscally-responsible government.


Offsetting all new spending since 2009, holding expenditure at a level lower than the average seen over the past 25 years.


A levy was not our first choice of funding vehicle for DisabilityCare.


But with the high dollar and the historic anomaly of nominal GDP growth falling below real GDP growth for a sustained period, the revenue write-downs have been unprecedented ... $17 billion for this financial year since the last budget update alone.


In short, the facts have changed.


I am also deeply conscious that the States and Territories face their own fiscal pressures arising from these same complex economic circumstances.


So we want to be able to offer them more support to pay for the scheme – which is why a substantial share of funds raised by this levy will go to the States and Territories.


Most importantly, we've listened to the sound case made by disability support groups for secure, ongoing funding for the national disability insurance scheme.


In a time of burden sharing and wise savings, they are right to want to ensure that DisabilityCare has a sustainable and stable funding stream ... in order to guarantee the security DisabilityCare is designed to bring.


The President of People with Disability Australia, Craig Wallace, has summarised the argument well – the levy will be




An insurance premium for good times and bad ... people
'
s disabilities will not go away the next time we have a surplus.



That's the backdrop against which I introduce this Bill.


That's why the Government not only has bipartisan support for this Bill, we have near-nationwide agreement on this scheme.


Following the ground breaking agreement with New South Wales last December, the other jurisdictions have joined the cause, one by one:


South Australia, the ACT, Tasmania, Victoria, Queensland and most recently the Northern Territory.


That means 90 per cent of Australians are now part of the plan ... leaving only the people of Western Australia still waiting for a decision by their Premier.


People with disabilities and their families have campaigned so long to design and fund a national disability insurance scheme.


Many of those advocates are here with us today – I want to take the time to welcome and acknowledge you all now – and to acknowledge the passion and dedication of so many people with disability, so many families and carers, who have brought the campaign to this point.


In recent weeks, as the momentum you have built has broken through, as we have struck agreements with States and Territories and announced details of the funding, I have seen the hope and anticipation which Australians with disability, particularly young Australians, now share.


The Saturday before last, I travelled to Melbourne to meet Premier Napthine and sign up Victoria to DisabilityCare.


In Melbourne, I saw Sophie, a twelve-year-old girl who lives with Down Syndrome.


As her parents describe her, Sophie ""reads and writes, mucks around on the monkey bars, can be well behaved and badly behaved, runs like a billy goat, and is a budding photographer"".


She took my photo while we were there.


Last week I travelled to Brisbane to meet Premier Newman and sign up Queensland to DisabilityCare.


While I was there, I met Sandy, who is 17 and lives with a physical disability similar to cerebral palsy.


Sandy has big dreams for his future, like any teenager, but his future also has some big needs: mobility aids that cost tens of thousands of dollars, personal care to maintain his hygiene, physical therapy to maintain his muscles and his health.


When I met this young man he handed me a card signed by him and his mates to say thanks for what we are doing for people with disability – a card illustrated by the photo Sophie had taken a week before.


In years to come, DisabilityCare Australia will ensure Sophie and Sandy and so many other young people with disability will have the security and dignity every Australian deserves.


This, above all, is why Australians so overwhelmingly support DisabilityCare.


Over the past six years, the idea of a national disability insurance scheme has found a place in our nation's heart. 


In March, we gave it a place in our nation's laws.


Today we inscribe it in our nation's finances.


The people who've gathered here today from around the country to witness this debate, know what this means.


There'll be no more ""in principle"" and no more ""when circumstances permit"".


There'll be launches, not trials ... permanent care, not temporary help.


DisabilityCare Australia starts in seven weeks – and there will be no turning back. 


FRINGE BENEFITS TAX AMENDMENT (DISABILITYCARE AUSTRALIA) BILL 2013


The Fringe Benefits Tax Amendment (DisabilityCare Australia) Bill 2013 is part of a package of measures increasing the Medicare levy by half a percentage point.


The Gillard Government is proud to be delivering DisabilityCare Australia, the most important social reform since Medicare.


We know this is a reform that's time has come. 


A reform that will deliver significant benefits to people with disability, their carers and families and to the wider Australian community.


DisabilityCare Australia will transform the lives of people with disability, their families and carers. In 2019-20, the first year of full scheme, it will provide around 460,000 Australians with a significant and permanent disability the care support they deserve, regardless of how they acquired their disability.


People with a disability, their families and carers deserve certainty. They deserve the certainty of knowing that they will be supported over their lifetimes, and the certainty that DisabilityCare Australia will be funded over the long term.


That's why the Government is increasing the Medicare levy from 1.5 to 2 per cent. And that is why every dollar raised from increasing the levy will go directly to fund DisabilityCare Australia. The DisabilityCare Australia Fund will be used solely to for spending on DisabilityCare Australia.



This will ensure DisabilityCare Australia has a strong and stable funding stream, replacing the current funding model based on arbitrary budget allocations. 


People with a disability, their families and carers also deserve certainty that they will receive support no matter where they live in Australia. DisabilityCare Australia is a national reform that requires the commitment and support of all State and Territory governments.


To assist the States and Territories, the Government will make a share of the DisabilityCare Australia fund available to the States and Territories. We will make available to the States and Territories $9.7 billion over the next decade to assist in the delivery of DisabilityCare Australia.


People with a disability, their families and carers also deserve certainty that the Commonwealth will fully fund its share of DisabilityCare Australia. That is why we have taken a number of tough savings decisions and will direct those savings to fully fund DisabilityCare Australia.


The Fringe Benefits Tax Amendment (Disabilitycare Australia) Bill contains consequential amendments as a result of the increase in the Medicare levy, contained in the Medicare Levy Amendment (DisabilityCare Australia) Bill 2013. 


Fringe Benefits Tax plays an important role in maintaining the fairness and integrity of Australia's taxation system. 


It places employees who receive fringe benefits on a more even footing with employees whose remuneration consists entirely of salary or wages. It ensures that all forms of remuneration paid to employees bear a fair measure of tax. 


The fringe benefits tax system also ensures that such benefits are counted as income when a person accesses means tested Government financial assistance, such as family tax benefits, ensuring that families are treated equally.


Fringe benefits are taxed at a rate of 46.5 per cent. This is the sum of the top marginal tax rate of 45 per cent plus the current Medicare levy rate of 1.5 per cent. 


The Fringe Benefits Tax Amendment (DisabilityCare Australia) Bill 2013 will increase the fringe benefits tax rate to 47 per cent to reflect the increase in the Medicare levy. This will apply from 1 April 2014 – the start of the FBT year. 


These consequential amendments will help to ensure the integrity of the tax system. 


Further details of the bill are set out in the explanatory memorandum for the package of bills.


In supporting these changes in the Parliament, we show our support for certainty for people with disability, their families and their carers.


We all commit ourselves to this long overdue and much needed reform.


INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT (DISABILITYCARE AUSTRALIA) BILL 2013


The Income Tax Rates Amendment (DisabilityCare Australia) Bill 2013 is part of a package of measures increasing the Medicare levy by half a percentage point.


This bill contains consequential amendments to the Income Tax Rates Act 1986. These are necessary as a result of the increase in the Medicare levy, contained in the Medicare Levy Amendment (DisabilityCare Australia) Bill 2013. 


When a superannuation fund or retirement savings account member does not provide their tax file number, the contributions made on behalf of the member are counted as income of the superannuation fund or the retirement savings account provider. The superannuation fund or retirement savings account provider is then required to pay tax on the contributions where no tax file number has been provided. This helps to ensure the integrity of the tax system.


The rate of the tax imposed on contributions where no tax file number has been provided includes a component which is the current Medicare levy rate of 1.5 per cent.


The Income Tax Rates Amendment (DisabilityCare Australia) Bill 2013 will increase this component from 1 July 2014 to reflect the increase in the Medicare levy from 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent.


These consequential amendments will help maintain the integrity of the tax system. 


The revenue from this package of bills will be used to provide a strong and stable funding stream for DisabilityCare Australia. 


Further details of the bill are set out in the explanatory memorandum for the package of bills.


SUPERANNUATION (EXCESS CONCESSIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS TAX) AMENDMENT (DISABILITYCARE AUSTRALIA) BILL 2013


The Superannuation (Excess Concessional Contributions Tax) Amendment (DisabilityCare Australia) Bill 2013 is part of a package of measures increasing the Medicare levy by half a percentage point. 


The increase in the Medicare levy will help fund DisabilityCare Australia, the most profound piece of social justice policy since Medicare.


This is a watershed moment in our federation of states, our national story. An opportunity to alter the course of the future for millions of Australians that find difficulty in maintaining a basic level of existence which we all take for granted.


The importance, the urgency of this, is not to be underestimated.


Once DisabilityCare becomes a reality, we will never look back. 


We will never look back to a time, a truly primitive time, when the disabled and their carers had to shoulder the burden and fill the gap while legislators sat back and looked at their knuckles, and hoped the problem would fix itself.


I believe this is the greatest cause to come before this chamber for a very long time, and the most important that I have had the privilege to work for.


This is our chance to turn to the almost more than four hundred thousand Australians, their families and their carers that face these daily struggles and say to them `your country will not leave you to fight each day alone`.


We see you. You have worth. And with a bit of help from your people, your society, your tribe, there is a chance things can change.


A better prosthetic may give new chances of work. The help of a specialist, one that was previously unaffordable under the private system, could make a breakthrough that can turn a life around.


This will change lives.


Change families. 


Change the dimension of hope in every community.


No longer do we fill this place with empty rhetoric on this issue. We now put our money on the table. And we ask:


What is the price of an ordinary life?


Under DisabilityCare, it doesn't matter if you were born with it, or the circumstance in which you came to be the way you are. 


What seems like such a basic concept, as old as the Good Samaritan, has taken a lot of work by a lot of people to come to action, fruition, to legislation in this place, on this historic day.


This really is a moment in our history to relish and remember. 


Equality, a truly Labor principle, is the simple goal of this nation changing reform. 


I turn now to the details of the bill.


This bill contains consequential amendments as a result of the increase in the Medicare levy, contained in the Medicare Levy Amendment (DisabilityCare Australia) Bill 2013. 


Contributions to superannuation are subject to a number of different caps, which vary depending on the age and retirement status of the person making the contribution, and on whether the contribution is made out of before or after tax income. These caps exist to ensure that the amount of concessionally taxed superannuation benefits that a person may receive is sustainable and appropriately targeted. 


The amount of a person's pre-tax superannuation contribution that exceeds the concessional cap is currently taxed at a rate of 31.5 per cent. This is the sum of the top marginal personal tax rate of 45 per cent and the current Medicare levy of 1.5 per cent, less the general rate of 15 per cent tax paid by most superannuation funds.


The Superannuation (Excess Concessional Contributions Tax) Amendment (DisabilityCare Australia) Bill 2013 will increase the rate at which tax on excess concessional contributions is payable. 


From 1 July 2014, this rate will increase by half a percentage point to 32 per cent, reflecting the increase in the Medicare levy. 


These consequential amendments will help to ensure the integrity of the tax system. 


Further details of the bill are set out in the explanatory memorandum for the package of bills.


SUPERANNUATION (EXCESS NON-CONCESSIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS TAX) AMENDMENT (DISABILITYCARE AUSTRALIA) BILL 2013


The Superannuation (Excess Non-Concessional Contributions Tax) Amendment (DisabilityCare Australia) Bill 2013 is part of a package of measures increasing the Medicare levy by half a percentage point.


This bill contains consequential amendments as a result of the increase in the Medicare levy, contained in the Medicare Levy Amendment (DisabilityCare Australia) Bill 2013. 


Contributions to superannuation are subject to a number of different caps, which vary depending on the age and retirement status of the person making the contribution, and on whether the contribution is made out of before or after tax income. These caps exist to ensure that the amount of concessionally taxed superannuation benefits that a person may receive is sustainable and appropriately targeted. 


The amount by which a person's after-tax contribution to their superannuation exceeds the non-concessional cap is currently taxed at a rate of 46.5 per cent. This is the sum of the top marginal personal tax rate of 45 per cent and the current Medicare levy of 1.5 per cent. 


The Superannuation (Excess Non-concessional Contributions Tax) Amendment (DisabilityCare Australia) Bill 2013 will increase the rate at which tax on excess non-concessional contributions is payable. 


From 1 July 2014, this rate will increase by half a percentage point to 47 per cent, and will apply to an individual's excess contributions for a financial year. This reflects the half a percentage point increase in the Medicare levy.


These consequential amendments will help to ensure the integrity of the tax system.

SUPERANNUATION (EXCESS UNTAXED ROLL-OVER AMOUNTS TAX) AMENDMENT (DISABILITYCARE AUSTRALIA) BILL 2013


The Superannuation (Excess Untaxed Roll-Over Amounts Tax) Amendment (DisabilityCare Australia) Bill 2013 is part of a package of measures increasing the Medicare levy by half a percentage point.


This bill contains consequential amendments as a result of the increase in the Medicare levy, contained in the Medicare Levy Amendment (DisabilityCare Australia) Bill 2013. 


Contributions to superannuation are subject to a number of different caps, which vary depending on the age and retirement status of the person making the contribution, and on whether the contribution is made out of before or after tax income. These caps exist to ensure that the amount of concessionally taxed superannuation benefits that a person may receive is sustainable and appropriately targeted. 


Excess, untaxed, roll-over amounts are currently taxed at a rate of 46.5 per cent, which is the sum of the top marginal personal tax rate of 45 per cent and the current Medicare levy of 1.5 per cent.


The Superannuation (Excess Untaxed Roll-Over Amounts Tax) Amendment (DisabilityCare Australia) Bill 2013 will increase the rate at which tax on excess untaxed roll-over amounts is payable. 


From 1 July 2014, this rate will increase by half a percentage point to 47 per cent, and will apply to excess untaxed roll-over amounts paid on or after 1 July 2014. This reflects the half a percentage point increase in the Medicare levy.


These consequential amendments will help to ensure the integrity of the tax system. 


The revenue from this package of bills will be used to provide a strong and stable funding stream for DisabilityCare Australia. 


Further details of the bill are set out in the explanatory memorandum for the package of bills.


INCOME TAX (TFN WITHHOLDING TAX (ESS)) AMENDMENT (DISABILITYCARE AUSTRALIA) BILL 2013


The Income Tax (TFN Withholding Tax (ESS)) Amendment (DisabilityCare Australia) Bill 2013 is part of a package of measures increasing the Medicare levy by half a percentage point.


This bill contains consequential amendments to the Income Tax (TFN Withholding Tax (ESS)) Act 2009. These are necessary as a result of the increase in the Medicare levy, contained in the Medicare Levy Amendment (DisabilityCare Australia) Bill 2013. 


Employers are required to pay the withholding tax if they provide their employees with discounted shares or rights and employees have not provided their tax file number or Australian Business Number to their employer by the end of the income year. This helps to ensure the integrity of the taxation of employee share schemes.


The rate of the withholding tax is currently 46.5 per cent, the top marginal rate of 45 per cent plus the current Medicare levy rate of 1.5 per cent.


The Income Tax (TFN Withholding Tax (ESS)) Amendment (DisabilityCare Australia) Bill 2013 will increase this rate to 47 per cent, from 1 July 2014, to reflect the increase in the Medicare levy from 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent.


These consequential amendments will help to ensure the integrity of the tax system. 


The revenue from this package of bills will be used to provide a strong and stable funding stream for DisabilityCare Australia. 


Further details of the bill are set out in the explanatory memorandum for the package of bills.


INCOME TAX (FIRST HOME SAVER ACCOUNTS MISUSE TAX) AMENDMENT (DISABILITYCARE AUSTRALIA) BILL 2013


The Income Tax (First Home Saver Accounts Misuse Tax) Amendment (DisabilityCare Australia) Bill 2013 is part of a package of measures increasing the Medicare levy by half a percentage point.


This bill contains consequential amendments to the Income Tax (First Home Saver Accounts Misuse Tax) Act 2008. These are necessary as a result of the increase in the Medicare levy, contained in the Medicare Levy Amendment (DisabilityCare Australia) Bill 2013. 


Where a first home saver account holder improperly uses the account, the First Home Saver Accounts Misuse Tax applies to claw back the benefit they have obtained.


The rate of the misuse tax is currently 46.5 per cent, the top marginal rate of 45 per cent plus the current Medicare levy rate of 1.5 per cent.


The Income Tax (First Home Saver Accounts Misuse Tax) Amendment (DisabilityCare Australia) Bill will increase this rate from 1 July 2014 to 47 per cent, to reflect the increase in the Medicare levy from 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent.


These consequential amendments will help to ensure the integrity of the tax system. 


The revenue from this package of bills will be used to provide a strong and stable funding stream for DisabilityCare Australia.

FAMILY TRUST DISTRIBUTION TAX (PRIMARY LIABILITY) AMENDMENT (DISABILITYCARE AUSTRALIA) BILL 2013


This bill is part of a package of measures to transform disability services by creating and locking in funding for DisabilityCare Australia, the national disability insurance scheme.


DisabilityCare Australia will change the lives of people with disability, their families and their carers. It will provide the 410,000 Australians with a significant and permanent disability the care and support they deserve, support they have waited far too long to receive.


The Government is also providing certainty. Certainty for people with disability. Certainty for their families and carers. And certainty to all Australians. Certainty that DisabilityCare Australia will be funded in the long term.


The Gillard Government will increase the Medicare levy by half a percentage point, from 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent, from 1 July 2014. This will provide DisabilityCare Australia with a strong and enduring funding stream.


The Government will also ensure that every dollar raised from increasing the levy will go directly to fund DisabilityCare Australia. As part of this package of bills, the Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer introduced the bill that will establish the DisabilityCare Australia Fund. The Fund will hold and invest the proceeds from the increase in the Medicare levy and can only be used to meet expenditure directly related to DisabilityCare Australia.


To ensure that all Australians benefit from this fundamental reform, the Government will make a share of the Fund available to the States and Territories to assist them in establishing DisabilityCare Australia.


Over a ten-year period, the Government will allocate around $9.7 billion of the revenue from the increase in the Medicare levy to the States and Territories to help fund their contribution to DisabilityCare Australia. 


The risk of disability is something that all of us face and the rewards of supporting people with disability will be shared by all. That is why we are asking Australians to make a small contribution to fund DisabilityCare Australia.


For someone earning average wages of around $70,000 this will mean a modest contribution of around 96 cents a day—a small amount that will make a big difference to those with disability, their carers and their families.


Despite this small increase, virtually every taxpayer is still paying less tax now than they were in 2007. 


I will now turn to the details of the bill.


This bill contains consequential amendments as a result of the increase in the Medicare levy contained in the Medicare Levy Amendment (DisabilityCare Australia) Bill 2013. 


The family trust distribution tax is payable where a trustee of a family trust has made a family trust election and a distribution is made to, or a present entitlement conferred on, a person other than the primary individual or a member of their family.


The rate of the family trust distribution tax is currently 46.5 per cent, the top marginal tax rate of 45 per cent plus the current Medicare levy of 1.5 per cent. The alignment with the top marginal rate and Medicare levy minimises the incentive to reduce a person's tax through the use of a family trust.


To maintain this alignment, the Family Trust Distribution Tax (Primary Liability) Amendment (DisabilityCare Australia) Bill 2013 will increase this rate of tax to 47 per cent.


These consequential amendments will help to ensure the integrity of the tax system. 


Further details of the bill are set out in the explanatory memorandum for the package of bills.


TAXATION (TRUSTEE BENEFICIARY NON-DISCLOSURE TAX) (NO. 1) AMENDMENT (DISABILITYCARE AUSTRALIA) BILL 2013


The Taxation (Trustee Beneficiary Non-Disclosure Tax) (No. 1) Amendment (DisabilityCare Australia) Bill 2013 is part of a package of measures increasing the Medicare levy by half a percentage point.


This bill contains consequential amendments to the Taxation (Trustee Beneficiary Non-Disclosure Tax) Act (No. 1) 2007 as a result of the increase in the Medicare levy, contained in the Medicare Levy Amendment (DisabilityCare Australia) Bill 2013. 


Where a share of the net income of a closely held trust is distributed to another trust, the trustee must advise the Commissioner of Taxation of each share of trust income or tax-preferred amounts that is distributed from the trust. If a trustee does not provide this information, they will be liable to pay trustee beneficiary non-disclosure tax. 


The rate of the trustee beneficiary non-disclosure tax is currently 46.5 per cent, the top marginal rate of 45 per cent plus the current Medicare levy rate of 1.5 per cent. 


The Taxation (Trustee Beneficiary Non-Disclosure Tax) (No. 1) Amendment (DisabilityCare Australia) Bill 2013 will increase this rate to 47 per cent, from 1 July 2014, to reflect the increase in the Medicare levy from 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent.


These consequential amendments will help to ensure the integrity of the tax system. 


The revenue from this package of bills will be used to provide a strong and stable funding stream for DisabilityCare Australia. 


Further details of the bill are set out in the explanatory memorandum for the package of bills.


TAXATION (TRUSTEE BENEFICIARY NON-DISCLOSURE TAX) (NO. 2) AMENDMENT (DISABILITYCARE AUSTRALIA) BILL 2013


The Taxation (Trustee Beneficiary Non-Disclosure Tax) (No. 2) Amendment (DisabilityCare Australia) Bill 2013 is part of a package of measures increasing the Medicare levy by half a percentage point.


This bill contains consequential amendments to the Taxation (Trustee Beneficiary Non-Disclosure Tax) Act (No. 2) 2007 as a result of the increase in the Medicare levy, contained in the Medicare Levy Amendment (DisabilityCare Australia) Bill 2013. 


The Taxation (Trustee Beneficiary Non-Disclosure Tax) Act (No. 2) 2007 also imposes a secondary trustee beneficiary non-disclosure tax, which supports the core trustee beneficiary non-disclosure tax, which is contained in Taxation (Trustee Beneficiary Non-Disclosure Tax) Act (No. 1). 


In order to discourage the use of circular chains of trusts to disguise the identity of the final beneficiary of trust income, trustee beneficiary non-disclosure tax is also imposed on the first trustee beneficiary where trust income is further distributed to another trust.


The rate of the trustee beneficiary non-disclosure tax is currently 46.5 per cent, the top marginal rate of 45 per cent plus the current Medicare levy rate of 1.5 per cent. 


The Taxation (Trustee Beneficiary Non-Disclosure Tax) (No. 2) Amendment (DisabilityCare Australia) Bill 2013 will increase this rate from 1 July 2014 to 47 per cent, to reflect the increase in the Medicare levy from 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent.


These consequential amendments will help to ensure the integrity of the tax system. 


The revenue from this package of bills will be used to provide a strong and stable funding stream for DisabilityCare Australia.

"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2013-05-16,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (12:48):  I rise to speak on this package of 13 bills, the first of which is a bill to give effect to an increase in the Medicare levy from 1.5 per cent to two per cent from 1 July next year. There are 10 consequential tax bills. There is also the bill to establish the DisabilityCare Australia Fund, into which the levy proceeds will go. The 13th bill is essentially a housekeeping bill to make a number of amendments to the primary NDIS Act, which was passed in March. 


I am pleased to indicate that the opposition was very happy to facilitate yesterday, in quick time, the passage of this legislation through the House of Representatives—courtesy of conversations between Mr Abbott's office and Ms Gillard's office. For the opposition's part, we will ensure that this legislation is passed in quick time through this place. We have already agreed to exempt this legislation from the cut-off and to see it placed in the noncontroversial section of the chamber's agenda for today. We do so because this parliament does have a shared commitment to a better deal for Australians with disability. In the words of Mr Abbott, the 'NDIS is an idea whose time has come'.


Every senator in this chamber knows very well that the system of support for Australians with disability is broken. When we had the debate on the primary NDIS legislation and when we had the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs look at that legislation, I think all of us had reinforced the arbitrary nature of disability support around Australia.


There is consensus that we do need and will be getting a new system of support that is based on need rather than on rationing, where the entitlement will go to the individual, where the individual will be at the centre and in charge and where they will be able to pick their service provider for aids, equipment and other supports that they may receive. This was the vision of the Productivity Commission and it is the vision of the NDIS. I did see Mr David Bowen last night at the Carers Australia 20th anniversary function. I was hoping that he would leave and make it an early night because he needs all the energy he can possibly muster for the great adventure of which he is at this time the chief steward. I know all senators wish him well in the task that he and his staff have.


It is important to note that the NDIS is also a shared vision not just of the parliament but of every government in Australia and of every opposition in Australia. For its part, the federal coalition has enthusiastically supported each milestone on the road to the NDIS that has reflected the work of the Productivity Commission. We strongly support the six launch sites. We welcome the agreements between the Commonwealth and the states and territories for full jurisdiction-wide rollouts. We supported, as did all colleagues in this place, the NDIS act passed in March.


Mr Abbott demonstrated his personal commitment to Australians with disability and their carers by raising over $1.2 million through the 2012 and 2013 Pollie Pedal charity bike rides. Each year, along the 1,000 kilometre routes, Mr Abbott has met with people with disabilities and with carers, and with the organisations that support them. The next Pollie Pedal will also be in partnership with and raise funds for Carers Australia. For Mr Abbott, his commitment is not just professional; it is certainly personal.


All comments, questions and suggestions by the opposition in relation to the NDIS have been offered in a constructive spirit and in an endeavour to help make the NDIS be the best that it possibly can be. The coalition has stood ready at all times to work with the government and other parties to see the NDIS delivered as soon as possible. The coalition is strongly of the view that with full implementation of an NDIS, it would be nothing short of a new deal for people with disabilities and their carers. We do have to get this right. Because the NDIS is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to deliver a better deal for Australians with disability, because it will unfold over the lives of several parliaments, we think it is important that the NDIS is seen as the property of the parliament as a whole rather than of any individual political party. When I say 'property of the parliament as a whole', that is on behalf of the Australian people.


To get this right will require a high level of consultation and attention to detail, not just now but over the full implementation period—not just in the launch sites but over the period of full jurisdiction and live rollout. That is why the coalition has called for the establishment of a joint parliamentary committee to be chaired by both sides of politics to oversee the establishment and implementation of the NDIS. I am very much of the view that a parliamentary oversight committee would serve as a symbol to the Australian community that all parties were locked in to support the NDIS and that it would provide a non-partisan environment in which issues of design and eligibility could be worked through constructively. I have not hidden my disappointment in the past on the three occasions when the parliament has declined the opportunity to support the establishment of this committee. In fact, I think the parliamentary oversight committee is even more important given the advent of a new tax base in the form of the Medicare levy increase that is before us and given the establishment of the DisabilityCare Australia fund into which the levy proceeds will be put. But I am very pleased that the government has now agreed to the establishment of a parliamentary committee that will operate on a bipartisan basis, and that has come about as a result of the interactions between the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition over the last day or so. So, that is indeed good news. The terms of reference are not as extensive as envisaged in our initial proposition. But, should we form government, that is something that we would certainly address.


Let me reiterate that the coalition has supported the establishment of the NDIS every step of the way. We want it to be a success. We do not want it to be a political football. We want it to be a reality as soon as possible. We want to see it on a secure footing. And the best guarantee for the NDIS in the long term is good economic management, good budget management and a government that prioritises within its means. Economic policy and social policy are sometimes presented as alternatives or as being in competition, but they are not. You need a good economic policy in order to afford a good social policy. The Productivity Commission, for its part, recommended that the NDIS be funded from consolidated revenue. I think their view was that core government business should be funded from core government revenue.


Our view has long been that the problem under the current administration was not that Australians did not pay enough tax but rather that the current administration has not been a good steward of the ample taxes paid. We have long predicted that the government's wrong priorities and waste and excessive spending would in fact compromise their ability to fund the NDIS from consolidated revenue. Until a few weeks ago the Prime Minister was also of the view that the NDIS should be funded from consolidated revenue. In fact, she categorically ruled out a levy, or the need for one, as recently as December. Instead, the government found a range of things to spend money on, and there was not adequate provision for the NDIS; hence the government's levy proposition. Our view in relation to the levy is straightforward. We did not propose a levy. There should not be the need for a levy, and the government is only proposing a levy because they have blown the bank and have failed to prioritise. We on this side do not like tax increases, but we do not think Australians with disability should miss out on the better deal they deserve due to poor decisions by this government. I do not think that would pass the fair go test. This legislation that is before us, all 13 pieces of it, will pass with our support, but we do see the Medicare levy increase as being only a temporary measure until the budget has been repaired and is in strong surplus.


I will put our decision into a broader context. We know that the Productivity Commission did not recommend funding the NDIS through a new tax. We understand that many families are doing it tough and that tax increases are an impost on household budgets. That is why, rather than responding immediately, we took our time and soberly considered the government's proposition to increase the Medicare levy. We do know that the current government's management of the economy and its fiscal approach, and the state of the budget as a result of the decisions they have taken, do not currently allow the NDIS to be funded from consolidated revenue without further borrowings. Australians with a disability and their carers want the confidence that the NDIS means a permanent change in the way our country supports people with a disability. People with a disability should not have to wait any longer than is necessary for the support they need. For these reasons the coalition is prepared to support the government's proposed increase to the Medicare levy.


It is also important to recognise that the Medicare levy increase does not cover the full cost of an NDIS. The levy does not cover the difference between what governments currently spend on disability and the full cost of an NDIS. When you take into account the 25 per cent of levy proceeds that the government will give to the states and territories for 10 years you will note that the levy covers perhaps 40 per cent of the Commonwealth's required contribution to an NDIS in the period after the launch. We continue to call on the government to outline how the remaining 60 per cent of funding will be provisioned. Despite promising before the budget to do so, on the night of the budget the government has as yet failed to outline where the balance of the funds will come from. We will certainly be taking the opportunity of Senate estimates to further explore, unpack and disaggregate some of the funding information which the government provided on budget night.


I do not need to tell anyone that the NDIS is a huge venture of great proportions. According to the Australian Government Actuary, it will have a gross cost of $22 billion in complete form and will require additional contributions from all governments of more than $10½ billion dollars beyond 2018-19. When such a big call is being made on taxpayers they are entitled to know exactly what the NDIS will achieve and who it will support. The government needs to provide greater clarity on that.


The 460,000 Australians who will be supported by the NDIS are entitled to have a full appreciation of the gateway to the scheme. The gateway to the NDIS has a number of elements. There are the eligibility criteria in the act, there are the regulations, known as the NDIS rules, some of which have been released in draft form, and the NDIS national assessment tools, which have not as yet been publicly released.


When looking at the issue of gateways it is important to recognise that the Productivity Commission report has been in the government's hands for two years, that this is a $22 billion scheme and that there is a new tax base being created in the form of the Medicare levy increase that will part fund the scheme. It is important also to consider it against the backdrop that NDIS launch sites go live in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania in six weeks time.


When the opposition indicated we would consider the increase to the Medicare levy we said that the government needed to introduce legislation to establish a fund in which the levy proceeds would be held; the government has done that. We said that the government also needed to legislate to the Future Fund as guardians of the fund, and the government has done that. We also said that the government needed to release the final NDIS rules and the national assessment tool, which has not happened as yet.


When the opposition has raised the issue of the tools and the rules there have been some who have said that the opposition is getting down into the weeds, but I think it is important to recognise that, for Australians with significant disability, the assessment tools and the NDIS rules are not a theoretical mechanism. They are elements which will combine to underpin the opportunities and quality of life for these individuals.


It has also been suggested that people who want to know the eligibility arrangements for the scheme should grab a copy of the act. I do not believe that the Prime Minister, in saying that, seriously contended that Australians with disability should grab a copy of the act, grab a set of the draft rules, hunt down the national assessment tool and try to work it out themselves. I have said before and I will reiterate that I think it would be extremely helpful to potential scheme participants if a series of cameos or worked examples were released so that people with physical, sensory, intellectual, cognitive or neurological impairments could have a handle on their likely eligibility under the scheme. The same goes for people with psychiatric conditions. I do not think it is unreasonable to expect this sort of detail for a $22-billion scheme that is due to commence in about six weeks time.


I will draw a contrast with a another significant reform. When the Howard-Costello government was preparing for the new tax system, the GST, the government of the day produced over 1,000 fact sheets and dozens of cameos and worked examples as to the effects of the tax on every type of household and business. This was done more than a year before the legislation came into the parliament and more than two years before the legislation took effect. I cannot imagine that, when Peter Costello was fielding questions about the new tax system, he ever responded that people should grab themselves a copy of the legislation and work it out for themselves. I think there is a need for some accessible cameos and worked examples in addition to the release of the rules and the national assessment tools. In the absence of some of that sort of information it is difficult to develop a complete picture as to how the scheme will work. I want to be clear: this is in no way a criticism of the staff of FaHCSIA or the transition agency. I think they are working as hard as they can. But that information would be helpful.


The opposition will be supporting this legislation. We look forward to working with all parties to see the NDIS become a reality.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2013-05-16,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (13:08):  I rise today to support the legislation before the Senate to establish a National Disability Insurance Scheme. The Greens are strongly supportive of the scheme and delighted that it is being brought forward and then voted on before we go to an election this year. It is a major reform in this country. We are delighted that it is happening and we are very pleased to stand and support it. We certainly welcome the fact that the Gillard government has moved in this way to provide care for people living with disability, no matter how that disability was acquired, to ensure that people will have daily care and to support delivering basic needs to allow full participation in society.


The legislation represents a combination of a strong community campaign. I congratulate all those campaigners and advocates for the determination and dedication that they have demonstrated over the years. Today is a great day for you, for all of those people out there who have made it their life's work. I congratulate them.


The scheme will support more than 400,000 Australians with a disability, their families and their careers. We know that disability currently affects one in every five Australians and that 95 per cent of Australians will enter the disability community, either temporarily or permanently, at some point in their lives. The scheme will pay for carers to give parents of children with disability a break. I know that everybody will have met or been part of a family trying to support a family member with a disability. It is absolutely essential that people are supported so that they can have a break in order to maintain the ongoing work that they do and to enable them to continue the loving support that they give to their family member with a disability. The increase in the Medicare levy equates to an extra dollar a day for the average income earner and I would suggest that it is a dollar a day well spent.


As disability advocate Stella Young has said, it is hard to think about dollars when it may mean how many showers we get to have per week or whether we can get a mobility aid that will let us leave our houses. That is the practical reality of how to support people so that they can participate in society. I have to say that Stella Young has been a fantastic advocate for this national disability insurance scheme. I welcome the fact that the trials will be beginning in my home state of Tasmania in July. That will be very genuinely appreciated by the Tasmanian community.


The Greens have successfully amended the legislation to allow the national disability insurance scheme to ensure that the other essential services that people living with a disability need do not end or are not curtailed. Those services include transport, housing and education. This means that service providers will be required to continue to provide those services.


I welcome today's announcement that adopts our recommendation from the inquiry that establishes a trial specifically for Aboriginal people living with a disability. The Australian Greens recognise that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people living with a disability often have significant difficulty accessing appropriate services. We welcome the flexibility in the scheme to meet those needs.


I recognise the time constraints on this debate and so I will conclude my remarks by reiterating how pleased the Australian Greens are to have the opportunity to stand here today to support the establishment of the national disability insurance scheme. I congratulate my colleagues for their work in ensuring the amendments to the scheme. I congratulate all the advocates. I congratulate the government for the work that has been done on this. I congratulate my colleague Senator Siewert for her dedication to this and for securing these amendments. I look forward to the passage of the legislation and the pilots starting and the money being made available to support the scheme.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2013-05-16,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (13:13):  I rise to add to the Greens support. I will not take long, because I know that we want this legislation to go through this chamber so that we will have all the foundation pieces in place for a national disability scheme to start rolling out across Australia and so that the launch sites can get going. I have to comment yet again that I am really disappointed that we do not have a launch site in Western Australia because Western Australia has not yet signed up. That is very disappointing. I have had a number of emails from people living with a disability in Western Australia and their carers, people who have been supporting the campaign in Western Australia for a very long time. They have been very outspoken. Those people, like the rest of the people in Australia, want a national disability insurance scheme. They want DisabilityCare to come to Western Australia as well. I urge the Western Australian government and the Commonwealth government to work together to come to a resolution of this impasse. We do not want Western Australians to be missing out on opportunities to get the care and support that other Australians living with a disability will get. People living with a disability in the rest of Australia will get that care and support but unfortunately not those people living in my home state of Western Australia.


This morning I attended—along with the minister and Senator Fifield—the launch of the First People's Disability Network Australia's 10-point plan for the implementation of the NDIS in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. They articulated a 10-point plan very clearly to the Senate inquiry and that is why the issue was picked up in both the majority report and in the additional comments by the Greens—particularly the need to pay special attention to the rollout of the NDIS into remote Aboriginal communities. The first thing they point out in the plan is the need to recognise that the vast majority of Aboriginal people with disability do not self-identify as people with disability. For a start we need to overcome that particular issue. I credit the government for funding the implementation of this plan and the rollout of NDIS in Aboriginal communities. The Barkly Shire will be a launch site. 


It would give me and other Western Australians so much pleasure to know that there was a launch site in Western Australia, especially in one of the areas that the Western Australian government is focusing on with their My Way sites. This sort of assistance for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples would be enormously beneficial, particularly in the south-west of Western Australia for the Noongar community. I say once again to the Western Australian government: 'Get on board and make this happen in Western Australia so that people in Western Australia can enjoy the same care and support that everybody else in Australia is going to have access to. Get over this whole state-rights difference and let's get on with it and build on the strengths that we have in Western Australia already.' 


The Greens will be supporting this legislation; we have supported the principle of the NDIS from day one. We have tried to be as cooperative as possible to achieve the rollout of this scheme. It gives me great pleasure to support this legislation and to be able to see the beginning of the launch sites in a couple of weeks time.

Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland—Minister for Human Services) (13:17):  It is my real pleasure to sum up this debate today. There are 13 bills to deliver DisabilityCare to Australia, but there are also a number of other bills that need to be passed before 2 o'clock, and so my contribution will be short. But the fact that it is short does not indicate our pleasure and pride at getting the legislation through the parliament. 


I commend and thank a number of people. May I thank first senators and especially the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee for the work that they have done to facilitate a number of pieces legislation through the parliament. I particularly want to thank people with disability and their families and carers. The co-design that we have been able to do with those people has been amazing. May I also thank all advocates who over many years have wanted to see this day come. I thank the department officials—all of them, and there are many—for the work that they have done. I particularly want to thank DisabilityCare Australia, the agency that will now take carriage of an idea that had its embryo some 25 or more years ago. I want to place on record my personal thanks to Minister Jenny Macklin, who has steered this work over many years, and to the Prime Minister, who engaged and has become totally committed to improving the lives of people with disability. We have legislation; we have the framework; we have the rules; and now we have the funding. It has been my privilege to be part of this historic social reform. Senators, DisabilityCare Australia's day has come.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:03):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (Senator Ludwig) and the Minister for Science and Research (Senator Farrell) to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today.


Contrary to the slur on me by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, which was not corrected by the President, that I had got the letter and had not passed it on, the letter I was quoting from, from the Minister for National Parks, Recreation, Sport and Racing in Queensland, the Hon. Steve Dickson, was sent directly not only to Mr Burke but also to Senator Ludwig. Those letters were written on Tuesday, and they were also posted on Tuesday. 


That does not get to the substantive issue, which is: why is the Gillard government more interested in growing grass than in the fate of 300,000 live animals? You hear the Greens and the Labor Party carrying on about cruelty to animals—here is cruelty on an unprecedented scale: 300,000 cattle are about to die for reasons of natural calamity, drought, bushfire and the stupid decision of the Gillard government some time ago to ban live cattle exports without any warning.


Forget about relief to farmers, important though that is. It is important, and the Queensland government will be doing what it can to help, but that is another question and I do not want to get distracted. The rules about that, and what relief will do, really will not help the landowners and they certainly will not help the fate of 300,000 live animals. Where are the Greens? I do not even see them in the chamber. I would have thought they would be jumping up and down on their Senate desks asking what the government is doing about the fate of these 300,000 animals that are going to die not a death from having a leg broken or being mistreated for five minutes but a lingering, horrible death from starvation.


The Queensland government—applauded, I might say, by the Queensland RSPCA—has a practical and sensible solution. Their plan is to put these cattle into areas that only recently were locked up by the previous Queensland government and the Gillard government as part of the nature reserve system. They have grass in them and they are in proximity to the areas that have been drought declared. They are suitable for the agistment of cattle. So there is a solution at hand—an easy solution. Sure, we want to preserve in Australia what we need to preserve, and that can be done. But carefully moving these cattle into national reserve systems can save them, and that will help with the financial and social welfare of the people who own those cattle and who are facing bankruptcy, loss of their homes, loss of their businesses and loss of their kids' schooling because of the live cattle ban, exacerbated by a following bushfire and then the drought.


Senator Ludwig says that he innocently misled the chamber, but he did not miss the opportunity of making some specious remark to me. As I say, I cannot understand why the President would pull me up for accusing Senator Ludwig of being a liar but not address his comment. But that is another issue.




Senator Wong:
  He is just a repeat offender.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Wong, I have not called you and I can deal with this matter. Senator Macdonald, you cannot repeat the accusation and, equally, you have to be careful about making remarks concerning the President. It would assist the chamber if you withdraw your last remarks and continue the debate.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I withdraw them, Deputy President. I noted the President quite forcibly stopped me calling Senator Ludwig a certain term, but when Senator Ludwig accused me of being the messenger and holding on to these letters, no apology was sought. Quite frankly, I do not care what Senator Ludwig says about me, but it shows that Senator Ludwig—




Senator Wong:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Is this on a point of order or has he gone back to his—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  No.




Senator Wong:
  This is a continued abuse of points of order by Senator Macdonald, who is incapable of withdrawing graciously. He always has to follow up with a lecture demonstrating just how ungracious he is.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Wong, there was no formal point of order. I dealt with the matter. Senator Macdonald complied with my request and Senator Macdonald is continuing with the debate.





Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I can well understand why Senator Wong will do everything possible to stop me highlighting the fate of these 300,000 live animals, which are going to die a horrible death of starvation because of the actions of Senator Wong's government, the Gillard government, in not allowing the simple, practical solution put forward by the Queensland government, which is in touch with people and understands these issues. I do not want to make politics out of this. I just plead with anyone on the other side who might have any sense of compassion—I do not see any of them there—to do something to assist the Queensland government with a practical response to what is an animal catastrophe.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2013-05-16,"



Senator CROSSIN
 (Northern Territory) (15:09):  I rise to respond to taking note of answers this afternoon. I did think that, two days after handing down one of the most significant budgets in this country, we might have been taking note of the progress of this country and the two major reforms we announced on Tuesday night. Let me take this opportunity to put some facts on the record about grazing cattle in Queensland national parks. Unlike you, Senator Macdonald, I do not have the privilege of any letter from Minister Ludwig or the Queensland government, but I do have a bit of background on this issue. Perhaps for the next couple of minutes we could very quietly and carefully put some facts down.


We know that there has been a call for national parks in Queensland to be used to graze drought-affected cattle. There has been the article in the Australian claiming that our environment minister, Mr Tony Burke, has rejected a plan to let starving cattle loose in conservation reserves and national parks in Queensland. Apparently the article says that that has infuriated the state government and drought-hit graziers. Mr Tony Burke is a former agriculture minister; obviously he makes those statements with some background from his former portfolio. I am led to believe that he has told the Australian that he did not have an interest in helping to wreck the states conservation areas. I have to say that Australia's and Queensland's national parks were established for very good reasons. This form of tenure offers real protection, not to grazing drought-affected cattle but to protect threatened ecosystems and species. So any decision to—




Senator Heffernan:
  Mr Deputy President, I raise a point of order. The growth of the number of feral pigs in national parks is a disgrace.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Heffernan, that is not a point of order.




Senator Heffernan:
  I know it is not. There are800,000 feral pigs in the Northern Territory.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Heffernan, that is a debating point. 




Senator CROSSIN:
  Let us bring feral pigs into the argument. Senator Heffernan, come back! Now you are talking about something I can talk about and that is pig shooting in the Northern Territory. So sit right down because now you are on the program! I actually know about feral pigs and pig shooting in the Territory. You should know that. So come back down!




Senator Heffernan:
  I have got to get out of here!



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Crossin, do not talk across the chamber, please, and do not encourage Senator Heffernan. And Senator Heffernan, you cannot speak while not in your seat.




Senator CROSSIN:
  Senator Scullion could well assist me, not that I have actually been pig shooting.



Opposition senators:  Oh!




Senator CROSSIN:
  Do I look like a sophisticated lady who would go pig shooting? I have shared many a beer with many people, probably at the Humpty Doo pub, swapping stories about pig shooting. Senator Macdonald, if you want to ask questions about pig shooting and starving cattle, I might be able to help you. Lately in the Northern Territory we have had the issue of starving horses. I am giving it my best shot here, seeing that I would really like to have talked about the budget and given that I really want to know whether Mr Abbott this evening is going to commit to the $70 million we have committed to build the hospital at Palmerston in the Northern Territory and the $38 million for a new paediatric ward. That is the crucial issue on my mind today.



As you can well imagine, I am trying to establish the very fine line between protecting national parks and assisting farmers in Queensland, even though they may have 300,000 starving head of cattle. The administration of the EPBC Act is a matter for my colleague Minister Burke and I am advised that he is yet to receive a proposal from the Queensland government. I understand Mr Burke has been clear that national parks should be there for people to enjoy nature and not for cattle grazing. So we have announced the Farm Finance package. We are trying to support Australian farmers and graziers who face enormous challenges, including producers in Queensland. We want to ensure that farmers are equipped to deal with all of the differences they face in the climate, rather than to look for an ad hoc solution to open up a national park in a conservation area. As I said, we announced a national drought reform measure in the budget and that is the Farm Finance package. That is the way to resolve this issue—to support those producers. (Time expired)

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2013-05-16,"



Senator MASON
 (Queensland) (15:14):  What has characterised this government from the word go, going right back to 2007, is the great chasm between its rhetoric—its sparkling rhetoric at times—and its policy implementation. That has been the problem of this government since the beginning. It is always overpromising and it is always underdelivering. Someone else—and it will be a coalition government—will, in the end, have to pick up the pieces. When you go back, it does not matter whether you look at computers in schools, pink batts, overpriced school halls or any of the rest of it—today it is about the NBN—it is the same thing. There is always sparkling rhetoric and there is always underdelivery, tomorrow's headlines being more important than tomorrow's outcomes and tomorrow's achievements. It is spin over substance.


I have always accepted that the Prime Minister, Senator Kim Carr and Senator Chris Evans are genuinely concerned about education, higher education in particular. I accept that they all believe that it is transformative and that they take it very seriously. I have always believed that. But, if you make promises, you must properly fund them; otherwise, it is just empty rhetoric. If you come forward with a profound policy change—and uncapping the number of undergraduate places at Australian universities is a significant policy change—you must adequately fund those places. If you do not, it is merely empty rhetoric and you are leading undergraduate students along a rocky path. They are not being properly resourced. I accept that it is important we encourage kids from disadvantaged backgrounds, kids from rural and regional areas and Aboriginal kids to go to university—but only if the project is properly resourced and quality and standards are maintained. 


In my question today to Senator Farrell, I argued implicitly that funding per student had fallen. I draw the chamber's attention to a publication put out by Universities Australia, A smarter Australia: policy advice for an incoming government. On the final page it says:


Despite recent, significant, and much-welcomed increases, base funding per student has fallen in real terms from 2008 to 2013 by 1.6 per cent, and has fallen 22 per cent since 1995. Without arresting this decline, Australia will continue to fall behind.


That 1.6 per cent fall in real terms was before this budget. This budget cuts funding to higher education across the board by five per cent.


This is the problem. If you want to uncap the system and let many more students come in, you must adequately fund it. It is the worst possible outcome to have kids who are less academically prepared and then to fund the system inadequately. In fact, you really need to do the opposite. What is happening today is that more young Australians who are less academically prepared are going to university, putting far greater stress on the system. You must adequately resource that system; otherwise, what happens? The quality and the standards in our Australian universities fall. I know that every senator in this chamber shares the view that our universities are essential not only as a source of productivity and innovation—key contributors to our economy—but as Australia's largest services export industry. Brand Australia cannot suffer a decline in standards and quality. 


What worries me about the current government's approach is this: if you continue to allow more and more students in and funding declines per student, you will have a decline in quality and standards. That might cause the export industry to decline. That is bad enough, that exports are compromised, but worse is that those students—students the government, Australia, has encouraged to go to university—will not be properly serviced. In the end, it is not only bad economically—although that is bad enough—but very bad socially. Our students deserve much better.

"Thistlethwaite, Sen Matt",ALP,2013-05-16,"



Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales—Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs and Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs) (15:20):  I am pleased that Senator Mason has raised the issue of higher education, animated as his contribution was. When it comes to education there are clear and stark differences between the approach of the Gillard government and that of the opposition. The stark differences are best underlined by the following anecdote.


Last year, I had the good fortune to visit Mungindi, a town on the border between Queensland and New South Wales. I was up there to open their brand-new trade training centre, a $2.5 million investment by the Gillard government in an education pathway for students at Mungindi Central School. Mungindi is a town with deep social problems. It has a very large Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population.


At the conclusion of the ceremony to open the trade training centre—the centre will provide hospitality trade training and metalwork trade training—I was talking to a young Indigenous girl. She was telling me how excited she was about the prospect of becoming a chef. She had finally decided what she wanted to do in life and she was now working hard to become a chef—this was a young girl in year 10. The school had built a vegetable patch out the back of the school, so they were not only teaching the students to cook but teaching them how to cook healthy food. This young Indigenous girl, this year 10 student, was telling me that she now goes home and teaches her mother how to cook healthy food. She was telling me that her mother had never been taught how to cook healthy food. It was not the way that they did things in her family. That is real social change, brought about by this government's investment in vocational education and training in schools for those people who may not be academically minded, providing them with an opportunity to aspire to a form of education that is suitable to their circumstances.


What people have to understand is that the Leader of the Opposition and the Liberal Party, those opposite, have announced that they will cancel the Trade Training Centres in Schools Program should they come to office. They will cancel that program that has been so innovative and has been providing opportunities for young people, like that young Indigenous girl from Mungindi that I spoke to, to get a better education. That is the difference between Labor and the opposition when it comes to education. 


We know that we have a problem with school education in this country. The results demonstrate that Australian students' performance is slipping down the scales internationally when we are compared to other nations. We are slipping as a nation. So we as a government determined that we would deal with this, and we asked the Gonski panel to consult widely on this issue and come up with a set of recommendations. They did. They consulted throughout the country, with academics, with principals, with teachers, with parents and with students, and they developed a new model for funding education in this country. Labor is delivering that model, and we wait to hear, hopefully tonight, what the opposition will say in respect of funding decent education in this country.



Senator Mason raised the point of university education, and I am glad he did, because this Labor government has done more to advance university education and, importantly, the accessibility of university education for students from all backgrounds throughout this country than any other government in this nation's history. We have grown university funding by close to 60 per cent. Through the Commonwealth Grant Scheme, funding for universities has increased from $3.5 billion in 2007 to $5.8 billion in 2010, a 66 per cent increase. We have uncapped university places, so there are now around 150,000 extra students attending university throughout Australia because of the changes that this government made. And we introduced a more generous rate of indexation for higher education funding in 2012, resulting in indexation growth of 3.8 per cent in 2012 and 3.9 per cent in 2013. That is this government's commitment to funding education at all levels within our society. (Time expired)

Senator RONALDSON
 (Victoria) (15:25):  I rise this afternoon to refer to a press release put out by Catherine King, the member for Ballarat in the other place. With great fanfare on Tuesday night, Ms King announced that the budget provided $9.1 million for the Ballarat freight hub. The press release said:


The Federal Budget delivered tonight includes funding of $9.1 million towards Stage 1 …


Then Ms King yesterday said: 'Under this Labor government, the funding is on the table. It is there this financial year.' And on radio 3BA yesterday, I understand, Ms King said: 'The Ballarat freight hub to come into effect next year, which is, you know, only a short, you know—we're almost halfway through the year now, so it's to come into effect next year; in other words, in seven months time.'


So what actually was put into the budget, do you think, Mr Deputy President? What I can tell the chamber is that there is no funding this year for the hub. We know there is no funding. As John Fitzgibbon, the Liberal Party candidate for Ballarat, said, this is an important project, but what Mr Fitzgibbon said, and what I say, is that the minister responsible was being completely untruthful when she said that this would be funded this year. It was an untruth. It is no secret that Ms King is joined at the hip with the Treasurer, Wayne Swan, and with the Prime Minister, Julia Gillard. As we know, she was given an eleventh-hour job because of her support for Ms Gillard. But the reason that she is joined at the hip is that she suffers from the same malaise as the Prime Minister and Mr Swan, and that malaise is: all spin and no substance.


In the time left to me, I will briefly go through the budget papers so that the utter fallacy of Ms King's press release can be seen by all who would like to have a look at it. What Ms King's own department said is this:


Accordingly, after consulting with the State Government and Infrastructure Australia , we are now in a position to release a preliminary schedule of new projects to be funded and delivered over the five year life of our next Nation Building Program (2014-15 to 2018-19). 


There was no funding allocated for this precinct, for this hub, in this year's budget. The very best that Ms King, if she were being truthful about this, could have said was that, if this second Nation Building Program money is funded in next year's budget, then there may be funding allocated between 2014-15 and possibly as late as 2018-19—not in this financial year. It was a complete untruth, a deliberate attempt by Ms King to get herself elected, when everyone knows that Ms Catherine King is now Canberra's representative in Ballarat and she is no longer Ballarat's representative in Canberra. Ms King has abrogated her responsibility to the people of the Ballarat electorate. Fortunately, we have someone there by the name of John Fitzgibbon, the Liberal Party candidate, ready, willing and able to stand up and start representing his community. If Ms King thinks she can get re-elected on the back of a complete untruth about a so-called budget measure, then, quite frankly, I think she is sadly mistaken.


I also want to speak about another broken promise of this government. The member for Eden-Monaro, Dr Michael Kelly—I think he goes by the title of 'Dr' these days—has been running around with the military superannuants for about four weeks before the budget, saying, 'Listen—don't talk about it; I'm going to get this fixed. I'll get this fixed.' Do you think this budget had anything in there for the fair indexation of DFRDB and DFRB military superannuants? No, they did not. So Mr Kelly from the other place— (Time expired)

Australian Government response to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee report: Crimes Amendment (Fairness for Minors) Bill 2011





DECEMBER 2012





Background



On 25 November 2011, the Senate referred the Crimes Amendment (Fairness for Minors) Bill 2011 to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee for inquiry and report. The Committee held a public hearing on 16 March 2012, and released its report on 4 April 2012, with four recommendations. Senator Sarah Hanson-Young prepared a dissenting report, with three recommendations.


The Australian Government Attorney-General's Department (AGD), in collaboration with the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (CDPP) and the Australian Federal Police (AFP), made a joint submission to the inquiry (the Commonwealth submission). Commonwealth officers also gave evidence at the Committee hearing.


The Commonwealth's submission recommended that the Senate should not pass the Bill. In summary, Commonwealth agencies considered the Bill's proposal to impose strict timeframes for age determination and laying charges would not be practical or achievable. The limitations on laying charges would also be inconsistent with section 15B(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1914, which permits the Commonwealth to commence prosecutions for serious Commonwealth offences at any time.


Further, Commonwealth agencies considered the proposed presumption of age and associated detention arrangements would jeopardise the Commonwealth's ability to flexibly manage detainees on a case-by-case basis, taking into account a range of factors in accordance with 'the best interests of the child' principle under the United Nations' Convention on the Rights of the Child.


This paper sets out the Australian Government response to the Senate Committee's majority and dissenting reports.




Government Response: Majority Report





Recommendation 1





The committee recommends that the Australian Government review the Australian Federal Police
'
s procedural and legislative requirements in dealing with persons suspected of people smuggling offences, with a view to facilitating the prompt laying of charges where appropriate.





Agreed in principle.



The AFP has worked hard to reduce the amount of time taken to investigate people smuggling offences and prepare a brief of evidence, setting a benchmark of 90 days to lay charges.



As a result of continuing efforts to reduce time in detention, the AFP advises that for the period from 1 January 2012 to 12 November 2012, the average period of investigation from the date of formal referral of crew by DIAC to the date of charging by the AFP is 74 days.


The Government is committed to further reducing delays in the investigation and prosecution of people smuggling offences. Commonwealth agencies are developing solutions to address delays, including obtaining identity documents from Indonesian consular officials in the first instance, pending a mutual assistance request. These documents may then inform the AFP's decision about whether to give a person the benefit of the doubt about their age, prior to laying charges.


Unfortunately, there are often delays to the investigation process caused by environmental factors, which are difficult to avoid. For example, weather conditions may cause delays in conveying items of evidence, such as mobile phones and GPS equipment, which require forensic analysis by experts and equipment on mainland Australia. There may also be delays in securing interpreters of specific dialects required for interviews or investigations.


In addition, passengers on board people smuggling vessels are sometimes initially unable or unwilling to provide statements, which are necessary to proceed with most people smuggling prosecutions.




Recommendation 2





The committee recommends that the Australian Government introduce legislation to expressly provide that, where a person raises the issue of age during criminal proceedings, the prosecution bears the burden of proof to establish that the person was an adult at the time of the relevant offence.





Agreed.



Under the Migration Act 1958, penalties for aggravated people smuggling offences do not apply to persons where it is 'established' on the balance of probabilities that they are under the age of 18 years. However, the legislation does not specify whether the prosecution or the defence bears the burden of proof.


There has been some inconsistency in the courts as to who bears the burden of proof. However, in practice, the CDPP has assumed the obligation of establishing whether the person is a minor or an adult, in cases where the defendant raises age as an issue.


The Government will consider amendments to the Migration Act that would codify current practice by specifying that the prosecution bears the onus of proof in establishing age, where age is contested during a prosecution.




Recommendation 3





The committee recommends that the Australian Government review options to support the capacity of the legal representatives of persons accused of people smuggling offences who claim to be underage at the time of the offence to gather evidence of age from their place of origin.





Disagree.



Commonwealth agencies facilitate access to legal aid by accused people smugglers as soon as the AFP requests to interview them. Commonwealth funding for legal aid in each State and Territory is provided through the Expensive Commonwealth Criminal Cases Fund. As part of this funding, legal aid representatives are entitled to claim the costs of reasonable disbursements, including costs associated with calling expert witnesses and gathering evidence of a defendant's age in their country of origin. To date, all costs claimed by legal aid commissions, including the costs of travel to Indonesia to collect identity documents, have been approved for reimbursement.




Recommendation 4





The committee recommends that the Senate should not pass the Bill.





Government response: Dissenting Report





Recommendation 1





The Bill be amended to require facilitation of timely access to legal advice, and that regulations require that children are afforded communication with their family.





Agreed in principle.





To address the issue of clients having access to legal advice in a timely fashion, the AFP has amended its practises concerning minors and provides those accused of people smuggling offences the opportunity to speak with legal representatives at the first available opportunity following referral from DIAC.





People smuggling crew held in immigration facilities are permitted to make domestic and international phone calls, and are allowed to try several different numbers until they make contact with their family or friends. These calls last approximately two minutes, to enable them to let the receiver know of their wellbeing. Individuals are permitted further additional time on a case by case basis. Due to poor mobile coverage in some countries, telephone contact is not always possible, which is typically understood by those trying to contact people in particular countries.





Internet access is also provided in immigration facilities after people are accommodated.





The only time phone calls are not attempted on the day of arrival is when a significant number of individuals arrive on the same day, as there is no distinction in the allocation of phone calls between people smuggling crew and other passengers arriving by boat. In situations like this, phone calls are generally completed over two or three days. DIAC considers these phone calls to be very important and it is a priority for these calls to be made as soon as possible.





The States and Territories are responsible for the management of individuals on remand or serving sentences for Commonwealth offences. This includes facilitating communication between detainees with both their families and legal representatives. All jurisdictions allow domestic phone calls, and most allow international calls. A table comparing the facilitation of contact by State and Territory correctional facilities between prisoners and their family or legal representatives is at 
Attachment A
.





Recommendation 2





Item 3 of Schedule 1 of the Bill be amended so that proposed new subsection 3ZQAA(3) of the Crimes Act 1914 provides that the 30 day limit on bringing an application to a magistrate to determine a person
'
s age applies from whichever is first of:





(a) The date the person is taken into immigration detention; or





(b) The date on which the person first asserts that he or she was a minor at the time of the alleged offence.





Disagree.





The recommended amendment does not change the practical effect of proposed new subsection 3ZQAA(3) in its current form.





Currently, the proposed subsection requires investigating officials to make an application to a magistrate to determine a person
'
s age within 30 days of the person being taken into immigration detention. The recommended amendment to the subsection would require the 30 day timeframe to commence on either the date the person is taken 
into immigration detention, or the date on which the person first claims to be a minor; whichever is first.





In practice, a person will very rarely (if ever) be in a position to claim to be a minor 
before
 being taken into immigration detention. This is because immigration detention of people smuggling crew under section 189 of the 
Migration Act 1958
 commences at the point of interception by Border Protection Command (BPC) personnel. Unless a member of a people smuggling crew is able to communicate their age to BPC personnel (or potentially to any Australian Government official) at least one day or more prior to their interception, the commencement date for the application period will always be the date of interception. Accordingly, even if earlier notification of the person
'
s claim was possible, the timeframe would be almost identical.





As such, the Commonwealth
'
s concerns with the provision as set out in the joint submission are still applicable. In particular, the reference to 
'
magistrate
'
 alone excludes the possibility of a superior court judge hearing an application. Further, the proposed provision does not clarify the meaning of 
'
application
'
, which could be referring to the filing of an originating application, the age determination hearing before a magistrate, or both.





In addition, the period of 30 days to conduct an age investigation and make an application to a magistrate is impractical and will be, in some cases, impossible to comply with. The provision also retains the presumption of age in the defendant
'
s favour, which has serious implications where the person is an adult and who, as a result of his claim alone, will automatically be required to be detained with minors.





The Commonwealth notes that other significant issues of concern about the Bill
'
s remaining provisions, as set out in the Commonwealth
'
s joint submission, have not been addressed by the recommendations made in the dissenting report.

Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee Report





Crimes Legislation Amendment (Slavery, Slavery
‑like Conditions and People Trafficking) Bill





March 2013





INTRODUCTION




On 19 June 2012, the 
Crimes Legislation Amendment (Slavery, Slavery
‑like Conditions and People Trafficking) Bill (the Bill) was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee (the Committee) for inquiry and report by 13 September 2012.


The Committee held a public hearing in Canberra on 29 August 2012.


The Bill was passed by the Senate on 27 February 2013.


BACKGROUND




This Bill would amend the existing people trafficking, slavery and slavery-like offences contained within Divisions 270 and 271 of the 
Criminal Code
, the reparations provision in Part IB of the 
Crimes Act 1914
, and make consequential amendments to the 
Proceeds of Crime Act 2002
, the 
Migration Act 1958
 and 
Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979
 as follows:



establish new offences in the Criminal Code of forced marriage and harbouring a victim, as well as standalone offences of forced labour and organ trafficking


seek to ensure that the slavery offence applies to conduct which renders a person a slave, as well as conduct involving a person who is already a slave


extend the application of the existing offences of deceptive recruiting and sexual servitude so they apply to non-sexual servitude and all forms of deceptive recruiting


increase the penalties applicable to the existing debt bondage offences, to ensure they are in line with the serious nature of the offences


broaden the definition of exploitation under the Criminal Code to include all slavery-like practices


amend the existing definitions to ensure the broadest range of exploitative conduct is criminalised by the offences, including psychological oppression and the abuse of power or taking advantage of a person's vulnerability, and


increase the availability of reparations to victims.




Recommendation 1





3.84 The committee recommends that the Attorney-General
'
s Department revise and reissue the Explanatory Memorandum to clarify that the proposed slavery and servitude offences in the Bill apply to circumstances of slavery and servitude within intimate relationships (including marriage and de facto relationships).





On 8 October 2012, the Government tabled an addendum to the Explanatory Memorandum for the Bill in the Senate, which takes this recommendation into account. The addendum makes it clear that the new offences apply irrespective of whether the relevant conduct occurs in the victim
'
s public or private life. Provided the elements of the offence are established, it is immaterial whether the victim and the offender are married or in a 
de facto
 relationship.





A copy of the addendum to the Explanatory Memorandum for the Bill is attached.





Recommendation 2





3.88 The committee recommends that the Australian Government further investigate the establishment of a federal compensation scheme for victims of slavery and people trafficking.





Australia ratified the 
Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children
 (the Trafficking Protocol), which supplements the 
United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime
, in 2005. The Australian Government takes its international obligations, including those under the Trafficking Protocol, very seriously.





Article 6.6 of the Trafficking Protocol states that each Party shall 
'
ensure that its domestic legal system contains measures that offer victims of trafficking in persons the possibility of obtaining compensation for damage suffered
'
. Under Australia
'
s domestic legal system, compensation for victims of crime is generally a matter for States and Territories. Each State and Territory has a victims
'
 compensation scheme, which may be available to victims of people trafficking, slavery and slavery
‑like practices. A number of these victims have accessed compensation from these State and Territory schemes.





As such, the Government
'
s view is that Australia has implemented measures that allow victims to obtain compensation, in accordance with Article 6.6 of the Trafficking Protocol. Given these considerations, the Government does not support establishing a Commonwealth victims
'
 compensation scheme at this time.





Recommendation 3





3.95 The committee recommends that the Australian Government review the People Trafficking Visa Framework and the Support for Victims of People Trafficking Program, and consider establishing an ongoing visa and access to victim support mechanism which is not conditional on a victim of people trafficking providing assistance in the criminal justice process.





Australia
'
s anti-people trafficking strategy (the strategy) is designed to ensure a balance between victim welfare and criminal justice processes. Prosecutions for people trafficking, slavery and slavery
‑like practices rely heavily on witness assistance and testimony, and the complete de-linking of witness assistance and visa provisions from the criminal justice framework may affect the success of trafficking
‑related prosecutions.





The Government is committed to the continuous improvement of the Support for Trafficked People Program (the Support Program), aiming to provide a flexible, compassionate victim-focused program that is tailored to the individual needs of each client. The new funding agreement, commencing from 1 July 2012 with the current service provider, will provide greater flexibility and accountability in the delivery of the Support Program, to meet the individual needs of clients.





Over the life of the strategy, significant enhancements have been made in response to community sector feedback. In particular, a number of changes were made to the strategy in 2009 following extensive consultation with the community. The changes, which are outlined below, are in line with international best practice and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights
'
 Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and Human Trafficking:




enabling all identified suspected victims of trafficking, slavery and slavery-like practices who are unlawful non-citizens to access the Bridging F visa (BVF) irrespective of whether they are assisting police, and extending the validity of that visa from 30 days to 45 days




increasing the initial stage of assistance under the Support Program from 30 to 45 days



reducing the Witness Protection (Trafficking) visa process from two stages to one stage by removing the Witness Protection (Trafficking) (Temporary) visa


including offshore immediate family members in the offer of a Witness Protection (Trafficking) (Permanent) visa


lowering the certification threshold for the Attorney-General to issue a Witness Protection (Trafficking) Certificate from a 'significant contribution' to a 'contribution'



a period of up to 90 days of assistance is now available to victims who are willing but not able to assist with an investigation or prosecution for an offence of trafficking in persons, and




all individuals receive an additional 20 days of support as they leave the Support Program.



To monitor and resolve operational matters, respond to new and emerging issues, and continue to explore ideas for enhancement of the strategy, the Australian Government has established an Operational Working Group, which is comprised of the Attorney‑General's Department, the Australian Federal Police, the Office of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, and the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. The Operational Working Group meets approximately every six weeks.


In addition, the strategy is also regularly reviewed externally by a number of bodies, including through the United Nations. In 2011 the strategy was reviewed both by the UN Special Rapporteur on Trafficking in Persons, especially women and children, and through the Universal Periodic Review process where United Nations Member States' human rights records are reviewed once every four years. Both of those reviews recognised Australia's role as a leader in regional efforts to combat trafficking.


Given these processes, and the extensive consultation on both the Visa Framework and the Support Program which led to enhancements in 2009, the Government does not propose to formally review the Visa Framework or the Support Program at this stage.




Recommendation 4





3.96 Subject to 
Recommendation 1,
 the committee recommends that the Senate pass the Bill.





The Australian Government notes this recommendation.

Australian Government response to the





Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee report:





Detention of Indonesian minors in Australia





DECEMBER 2012





BACKGROUND



On 10 May 2012 the Senate referred the matter of detention of Indonesian minors in Australia to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committees for inquiry and report.


The inquiry considered:


(a) whether any Indonesian minors are currently being held in Australian prisons, remand centres or detention centres where adults are also held, and the appropriateness of that detention;


(b) what information the Australian authorities possessed or had knowledge of when it was determined that a suspect or convicted person was a minor;


(c) whether there have been cases where information that a person is a minor was not put before the court;


(d) what checks and procedures exist to ensure that evidence given to an Australian authority or department about the age of a defendant/suspect is followed up appropriately;


(e) the relevant procedures across agencies relating to cases where there is a suggestion that a minor has been imprisoned in an adult facility; and


(f) options for reparation and repatriation for any minor who has been charged (contrary to current government policy) and convicted.


The Attorney-General's Department (AGD) made a submission to the inquiry in collaboration with the Australian Federal Police (AFP). The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (CDPP) and the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) also lodged submissions.


Officers from AFP, AGD, CDPP and DIAC appeared before the committee on 24 August 2012.



The Committee reported on 4 October 2012, providing seven recommendations to the Australian Government. The Chair of the Committee also presented a minority report with fifteen recommendations. This document provides a coordinated Government response to the inquiry recommendations.




Government Response: Majority Report





Recommendation 1





Subject to the advice of the Office of the Chief Scientist regarding the utility of wrist X
‑rays as an age assessment tool, and noting evidence received by the committee raising significant doubts about this procedure, the committee recommends that the Australian Government consider removing wrist X-rays as a prescribed procedure for the determination of age under 3ZQB of the 
Crimes Act 1914
 and regulation 6C of the 
Crimes Regulations 1990.





Agreed in principle.



On 11 January 2012 the Chief Scientist, Professor Ian Chubb AC, advised AGD on the available scientific methods for determining chronological age. The advice confirmed that wrist X-rays did not allow for precise estimation of chronological age; that results vary with ethnic and socio-economic conditions; and that there were ethical considerations.


The 'observed variation' of two years for wrist X rays, identified by the Chief Scientist, further indicated that the science of wrist X-rays and statistical analysis from that science was a contested issue that required further expert consideration.


Between January and June 2012, AGD consulted further with the Office of the Chief Scientist on a number of age determination issues. This included seeking assistance on identifying available experts to assist the Commonwealth with the science of age determination, in particular to critically analyse the scientific and statistical basis for using wrist X-rays as an age determination procedure.


On 29 June 2012, the Office of the Chief Scientist provided AGD with advice relating to statistics and wrist X-rays from Professor Patty Solomon. In her report, Professor Solomon concluded that there is not enough scientific data in either the Greulich and Pyle Atlas or the TW3 Manual for those experts to draw sufficiently precise inferences of chronological age for young Indonesian males.


In order to address this issue, AGD is considering options for legislative amendments to remove wrist X-rays be removed as a prescribed procedure for age determination in the Crimes Act and Crimes Regulations.




Recommendation 2





The committee recommends that the Australian Government formalise arrangements for the Government of Indonesia to expedite the process of gathering evidence in Indonesia relating to the age of individuals who claim to be minors and are detained in Australia suspected of people smuggling offences.





Agreed.



The Foreign Evidence Act 1994 provides a mechanism for adducing material received from a foreign country in response to a mutual assistance request. The process can be complicated where a request is made to a country where government records, including birth, marriage and other identity records, are not centrally held. Even where a mutual assistance request is urgent and prioritised, it can take up to several months to receive the material sought. This mutual assistance process is assisted by the bilateral mutual assistance treaty with Indonesia, the Treaty between Australia and the Republic of Indonesia on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, done at Jakarta on 27 October 1995.


Since July 2011, the AFP has sought documents from the Indonesian National Police (INP) on a police-to-police basis. Recently the AFP commenced seeking documents from Indonesian consular officials in Australia. Where documents received through these processes indicate the person may be a minor, the AFP considers this material in deciding whether to give the person the benefit of the doubt. However, INP officials have advised the AFP that a mutual assistance request is required to obtain documents for use as evidence in prosecutions (in most cases, documents indicating the person is an adult).


The AFP continues to utilise all avenues available to it to expedite the process of gathering evidence relating to the age of Indonesian individuals detained in Australia suspected of people smuggling offences.


The defendant's legal representatives may also seek to present as evidence documents obtained from Indonesia containing information about the defendant's age or affidavits from relatives. The costs of obtaining this evidence are covered as a disbursement within a grant of legal aid.


Credible documentary evidence is not always available to support the claims of people smuggling crew about their age. Only 55 per cent of Indonesian births were recorded between 2000 and 2008. There are at least three different calendars used in parts of Indonesia, and it is commonly the case that Indonesian crew may not know their age or date of birth, and that there may be no documentation of their age or date of birth.


This recommendation reflects Australia's existing practice for making formal and informal requests for assistance to Indonesia; however any requests by Australia for the process to be expedited would be a matter for Indonesia to consider. It will always take time to obtain documents given the dispersed nature of the Indonesian archipelago, and in some cases documents may not exist.




Recommendation 3





The committee recommends that the 
Migration Act 1958
 be amended to require that individuals suspected of people smuggling offences who claim to be minors be offered access to consular assistance as soon as practicable after their arrival in Australia.





Agreed in principle.



This recommendation reflects existing practice. However, some individuals choose not to accept consular assistance.


Indonesians detained in Australia for people smuggling are able to access consular assistance in accordance with the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (VCCR) and Australia's Arrangement on Consular Notification and Assistance (the Consular Arrangement) with Indonesia, signed on 10 March 2010.


Australia's obligations under the VCCR and the Privacy Act 1988 prevent Australia from providing the personal particulars of any Indonesian national detained in Australia for people smuggling to Indonesian consular officials without that person's consent.


The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) provides the initial notification to the Indonesian Embassy within three days that a SIEV has been boarded by Australian authorities and that Indonesian nationals, normally the crew of the vessel, are believed to be on board.


DIAC advises the Indonesian Embassy when Indonesian people smuggling crew enter immigration detention, are transferred between facilities, or leave immigration detention. Unidentified information (date of arrival, the number of individuals concerned, current location, and whether they are adults or minors) is provided where crew do not provide consent for consular notification.




Recommendation 4





The committee recommends that, in cases where an Indonesian national in immigration detention claims to be a minor, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship must notify the Indonesian Embassy and relevant consular officials of that claim as soon as practicable.





Agreed.



This recommendation reflects existing practice and is not restricted to Indonesian nationals who are detained for people smuggling offences. However, foreign nationals must first sign a consular notification form to agree to have their names released to the relevant consulate, and to obtain consular assistance. Some individuals choose not to accept consular assistance.




Recommendation 5





The committee recommends that DIAC:





- explicitly inform each Indonesian crew member suspected of people smuggling of their right to contact relatives in Indonesia as soon as practicable after their arrival in Australia; and





- take proactive steps to assist all crew who claim to be minors to contact their families in Indonesia within seven days, or as soon as practicable, after their arrival in Australia.





Agreed.



This recommendation reflects existing practice.




People smuggling crew held in immigration facilities are permitted to make domestic and international phone calls, and are allowed to try several different numbers until they make contact with their family or friends. These calls last approximately two minutes, to enable them to let the receiver know of their wellbeing. Individuals are permitted further additional time on a case by case basis. Due to poor mobile coverage in some countries, telephone contact is not always possible, which is typically understood by those trying to contact people in particular countries.





Internet access is also provided in immigration facilities after people are accommodated.





The only time phone calls are not attempted on the day of arrival is when a significant number of individuals arrive on the same day, as there is no distinction in the allocation of phone calls between people smuggling crew and other passengers arriving by boat. For example, in one instance 230 clients arrived at one time and it was not possible to make all 230 calls on that day. In situations like this, phone calls are generally completed over two or three days. DIAC considers these phone calls to be very important and it is a priority for these calls to be made as soon as possible.





Recommendation 6





In accordance with Recommendation 2 of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee
'
s report into the Crimes Amendment (Fairness for Minors) Bill 2011, the committee recommends that the Australian Government introduce legislation 
to expressly provide that, where a person raises the issue of age during criminal proceedings, the prosecution bears the burden of proof to establish that the person was an adult at the time of the relevant offence.





Agreed.



Under the Migration Act 1958, penalties for aggravated people smuggling offences do not apply to persons where it is 'established' on the balance of probabilities that they are under the age of 18 years. However, the legislation does not specify whether the prosecution or the defence bears the burden of proof.


There has been some inconsistency in the courts as to who bears the burden of proof. However, in practice, the CDPP has taken on the obligation of establishing whether the person is a minor or an adult, in cases where the defendant raises age as an issue.


AGD is considering options for amendments to the Migration Act that would codify current practice by specifying that the prosecution bears the onus of proof in establishing age, where age is contested during a prosecution.




Recommendation 7





In accordance with Recommendation 2 of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee
'
s report into the Migration Amendment (Removal of Mandatory Minimum Penalties) Bill 2012, the committee recommends that the Australian Government facilitate and support further deterrence and awareness raising activities in relation to people smuggling offences, with a focus on relevant communities in Indonesia.





Agreed.



At the Australia-Indonesia Leaders Meeting on 3 July 2012, it was noted that Australia and Indonesia will conduct a joint public information campaign in Indonesia to prevent potential crew from being used by international people smuggling networks by helping them to understand the consequences, both in Australian and Indonesian law.


This campaign has commenced with two information sessions held in Bali and Kupang from 17-19 September 2012 for local Indonesian stakeholders and representatives.


The next phase of the awareness raising campaign is currently under development.




Government response: Chair
'
s further findings and recommendations





Recommendation 1





The Chair of the committee recommends that the Attorney-General
'
s Department undertake a review of all cases since 2008 where Indonesian minors may have been detained in Australia on suspicion of people smuggling offences, in order to determine:





- the number of minors who have been inappropriately detained in Australia; and





- the length of time for which those individuals were detained.





Disagree.



On 2 May 2012, the Attorney-General announced a review of convicted crew whose age was raised as an issue at some stage during the investigation and/or prosecution. A total of 28 cases were reviewed after being identified by the Australian Human Rights Commission, the Indonesian Embassy and the CDPP.


On 29 June 2012, the Attorney-General announced that the outcomes of the review were that:


o 15 crew were granted early release from prison on licence as there was a doubt they may have been minors on arrival in Australia


o two crew were released early on parole


o three crew completed their non‑parole periods prior to the commencement of the review and


o eight crew were assessed as likely to be adults on arrival as there was no evidence supporting suggestions they were minors at the time of arrival.


There have been 1115 crew arrive in Australia since 2008. As at 30 November 2012, 197 crew have been returned on the basis that they may have been minors. AGD has reviewed all cases were crew in Australian prisons had been convicted and age was raised as an issue at some stage during the proceedings.




Recommendation 2





The Chair of the committee recommends that the Australian Government, in conjunction 
with state and territory governments, sufficiently resource Australia
'
s eight legal aid commissions to enable legal aid lawyers representing suspected people smugglers who claim to be minors to travel to Indonesia to obtain relevant evidence relating to the age of their clients.





Agreed.



This recommendation reflects existing practice.


Legal aid commissions can seek reimbursement of costs incurred for providing representation to people smuggling defendants (including travelling to Indonesia to seek documentary evidence of age) through the Expensive Commonwealth Criminal Cases Fund, which is administered by the Attorney-General's Department.




Recommendation 3





The Chair of the committee recommends that the Australian Government introduce legislation to appoint an independent legal guardian for individuals suspected of people smuggling offences who claim to be minors, to represent their best interests while their age claims are assessed.





Disagree.



Interviews for individuals suspected of people smuggling who claim to be minors are undertaken in the presence of an Independent Observer who provides support to ensure the well-being of the individual. This applies whether the interview is to determine a person's age, identity or to establish information relevant to their travel to Australia. A legal representative is not present at these interviews.


However, in the criminal investigative context, current practice reflects the need for an independent person or guardian during a criminal investigation. Under s23K of the Crimes Act, if an investigating official believes on reasonable grounds that a person who is under arrest or a protected suspect is under 18, the official must not question the person unless an interview friend is present while the person is being questioned and, before the start of the questioning, the official has allowed the person to communicate with the interview friend in circumstances in which, as far as practicable, the communication will not be overheard.



An interview friend means:


(a) a parent or guardian of the person or a legal practitioner acting for the person; or


(b) if none of the previously mentioned persons is available—a relative or friend of the person who is acceptable to the person; or


(c) if the person is an Aboriginal person or a Torres Strait Islander and none of the previously mentioned persons is available—a person whose name is included in the relevant list maintained under subsection 23J(1); or


(d) if no person covered by paragraph (a), (b) or (c) is available—an independent person.


Indonesian consular representatives are also able to advocate on behalf of Indonesian crew given their consular functions include safeguarding the interests of their minor nationals (Vienna Convention on Consular Relations), provided that the individual accepts consular assistance.




Recommendation 4





The Chair of the committee recommends that the 
Migration Act 1958
 be amended to require that legal assistance be provided to all individuals suspected of people smuggling offences who claim to be minors within three days of their arrival in Australia





Disagree.



Legal Aid Commissions are currently informed when crew arrive in Australia and offer assistance as soon as practicable. However, it is not appropriate to include time frames in the legislation.




Recommendation 5





The Chair of the committee recommends that the government appropriately resource National Legal Aid to station a full-time independent legal aid representative on Christmas Island, to provide legal assistance in person to all foreign boat crew who arrive there suspected of people smuggling offences.





Disagree.





National Legal Aid (NLA) is not funded by governments to provide legal assistance services. NLA is a non-statutory representative group 
comprising the directors of all eight legal aid commissions.





Under the National Partnership Agreement on Legal Assistance Services (NPA), the Australian Government funds legal aid commissions to deliver Commonwealth legal aid service priorities, including certain migration matters. The NPA does not fund legal assistance for external territories. The Legal Aid Commission of Western Australia is funded by the Territories Division of the Department of Regional Australia to provide legal assistance services on Christmas Island. Those arrangements cover the provision of assistance to people who are residents of Christmas Island, and any person on Christmas Island who is charged with a criminal offence.





Recommendation 6





The Chair of the committee recommends that the 
Crimes Act 1914
 be amended to require that an individual suspected of people smuggling offences who claims to be a minor can only be detained in Australia for a maximum of 14 days before being charged or released from detention.





Disagree.



The Government is keen to avoid delays in investigations for persons suspected of people smuggling offences who say that they are minors. The AFP requires adequate time to consider all relevant factors when making a decision to charge a person, and has worked hard to reduce the time taken to investigate people smuggling offences and prepare a brief of evidence, setting a benchmark timeframe of 90 days from interception to laying charges.


As a result of continuing efforts to reduce time in detention, the AFP advises that for the period from 1 January 2012 to 12 November 2012, the average period of investigation from the date of formal referral of crew by DIAC to the date of charging by AFP is 74 days.


The Government is committed to further reducing delays in the investigation of people smuggling offences. Commonwealth agencies are developing solutions to address delays, including seeking identity documents from Indonesian consular officials in the first instance, pending a mutual assistance request. If available, these documents may then inform the AFP's decision about whether to give a person the benefit of the doubt about their age, prior to laying charges.


Unfortunately, there are often delays to the investigation process caused by environmental factors, which are difficult to avoid. For example, weather conditions may cause delays in conveying items of evidence, such as mobile phones and GPS equipment, which require forensic analysis by experts and equipment on mainland Australia. There may also be delays in securing interpreters of specific dialects required for interviews or investigations.


In addition, passengers on board people smuggling vessels are sometimes unwilling or unable to provide statements, which are necessary to proceed with most people smuggling prosecutions.




Recommendation 7





The Chair of the committee recommends that the 
Migration Act 1958
 be amended to require that, where Criminal Justice Stay Certificates are issued in respect of individuals suspected of people smuggling offences who claim to be minors, those certificates should be the subject of periodic judicial review.





Disagree.



A Criminal Justice Stay Certificate (CJSC) operates to stay a non-citizen's removal and does not authorise or provide a legal basis for the non-citizen's detention. As set out in the written submission to the Senate Committee provided by AGD and the AFP, the person is detained pursuant to relevant provisions of the Migration Act (s189 and s250). If a CJSC is in force the Minister of Immigration and Citizenship may consider in his absolute discretion whether it is appropriate to issue a criminal justice stay visa which would entitle the person to be released from detention. The AFP and CDPP are the competent authorities in relation to investigations and prosecutions, and the Attorney-General's delegate may issue at the request of these agencies a CJSC to stay a person's removal. The Attorney-General's delegate necessarily relies on advice from these agencies as to whether the presence in Australia of a non-citizen is required for the purposes of the administration of criminal justice. AGD currently has procedures in place for the review of CJSCs, and in response to a recommendation made by the Australian Human Rights Commission has refined its procedures for review of CJSCs to include guidance on regular follow up with the AFP or CDPP, as relevant, for confirmation of the continuing need for the CJSC to ensure cancellation of certificates promptly once a person is no longer required. The Government considers its existing procedures for review of CJSCs to be appropriate.




Recommendation 8





The Chair of the committee recommends that an individual detained in Australia on suspicion of people smuggling charges who claims to be a minor must be held in community detention rather than immigration detention facilities while their case is considered, unless there is a clear reason why this would be inappropriate.





Disagree.



Under s197AB of the Migration Act, only the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship can approve a community detention placement for people in immigration detention. However, this is a non-compellable power and, in considering whether to make such a determination, the Minister must consider that it is in the public interest to do so. A blanket determination covering all people suspected of people smuggling offences who claim to be minors is inconsistent with the terms of the relevant provisions.




Recommendation 9





The Chair of the committee recommends that the 
Crimes Act 1914
 be amended to require that an investigating official may only make an application to a magistrate or judge to determine the age of an individual charged with a people smuggling offence who claims to be a minor within 30 days of:





- the suspect being taken into immigration detention in Australia; or





- the suspect first making a claim that they are a minor





Disagree.



The proposed time limit of 30 days is insufficient for investigating officers to gather a thorough brief of evidence, particularly where the collection of evidence requires evidence being provided by the person's country of origin. The operational stages of the investigatory and age assessment process are outlined in the response to recommendation 6. Not only would the proposed time limit impact the ability of the AFP's to properly investigate an alleged offence it could jeopardise the ability of defendants to obtain evidence to substantiate their claims.


A person in immigration detention, or in remand in a criminal justice detention facility, can claim to be a minor at any time. It is not always the case that detainees claim to be minors at the point of interception, and it is not uncommon for claims about age to be made after the person has been detained for a period of time. Often challenges to the court's jurisdiction on the basis of age are made late in the proceedings, and in some cases claims about age are raised several times. Some age determination hearings are on the application of the defence. The defence has also, on occasion, asked that age determination proceedings be delayed while the defence gathers information.


The recommendation does not take into account these circumstances, nor does it clarify how the criminal proceedings would be dealt with should these circumstances arise. It is also unclear what should occur if an application for an age determination was not made within 30 days. Age is a fundamental question going to jurisdiction and cannot be ignored regardless of when an application is made.




Recommendation 10





The Chair of the committee recommends that the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions review its procedures to ensure that all age-related evidence in its possession is made available to the court during age determination hearings.




Disagree



Under the policy framework announced on 8 July 2011, the AFP is to request documents containing information about the age of persons who say they are minors from their country of origin as soon as possible. However, the Government notes that it is not always possible to obtain such documentation given that other countries do not have the same requirements for identification documentation as Australia.


Based upon operational experience and expert advice, there are limitations in terms of the reliability of identity documents, as well as challenges posed by cultural and religious practices. As a result there can be issues with the admissibility of documents.


The CDPP's policy in relation to evidence in age determination hearings in people smuggling prosecutions is set out in the CDPP's Director's Litigation Instruction Number 2, which provides:




Evidence



(16) If a matter proceeds to an age determination hearing and the defendant seeks to:


call evidence from the defendant's family or other persons from the defendant's place of origin, whether in person, by audio or by audio visual link; and/or


the defendant seeks to call evidence to make admissible documents that the defendant wishes to tender during the hearing


 the responsibility for making any arrangements to call such evidence will rest with the defendant's legal representatives, however the CDPP will cooperate as much as it is reasonably able to do so with the defendant's legal representatives.


(17) If a witness is unable to give evidence to the Court in person or by audio or audio visual link or if a defendant is unable to call the necessary evidence to make a document admissible, then generally the CDPP will not dispute the admissibility of any affidavits from the defendant's family or from other persons from the defendant's place of origin that the defendant wishes to tender nor the admissibility of any documentary evidence the defendant wishes to tender. It may be appropriate for comment to be made about the weight the Court should give to any evidence.


 (18) The prosecutor may however dispute the admissibility of an affidavit or document; the information contained in the affidavit or document; call evidence or seek to cross-examine on the affidavit or document, if there are very cogent reasons for doing so.


 (19) Any decision to dispute the admissibility of any such affidavits or documents should be discussed with the Deputy Director of the relevant Regional Office, and if necessary, raised with the Director.


This is a very unusual and permissive stance to be taken by a prosecuting entity, which has been taken as a result of practical issues confronting the CDPP in relation to documentary material from Indonesia. The CDPP does not have a similar approach in any other area of its practice.


This position only relates to the material that the defendant wishes to tender. The CDPP cannot require or expect that defence representatives will allow the CDPP to tender documentary material which is not admissible. Accordingly, the CDPP cannot ensure that all age-related material in its possession is made available to the court during age determination hearings.




Recommendation 11





The Chair of the committee recommends that the Australian Government issue an apology to those Indonesian nationals who were detained or convicted and imprisoned in Australia for involvement in people smuggling offences, only to be later released due to concerns that they were minors at the time of offending or upon the completion of their sentence.





Disagree.



In making decisions about investigation and prosecution of people smuggling crew Australian Government agencies act in good faith on the most reliable evidence available at the time. Assessing age is complex and difficult, as noted in the report. People may make claims to be minors at any stage of a prosecution.


Under the Government's current policy, in cases where age is not able to be clearly established, the person being investigated or prosecuted is given the benefit of the doubt and returned to their country of origin without charge. People being removed on this basis may in fact be adults, but they are being returned because there is a doubt whether they are adults or minors.




Recommendation 12





The Chair of the committee recommends that the Australian Government:




- recognise the right of Indonesian minors who were wrongly detained or imprisoned in Australia to be paid appropriate compensation;



- initiate a thorough and transparent process to identify individuals who were wrongly detained, or convicted and imprisoned, in Australia on people smuggling charges, only to be released due to concerns that they were minors at the time of offending or upon completion of their sentence;



- inform these individuals of their right to seek reparation for any periods of inappropriate detention or imprisonment; and



- establish an appropriate administrative mechanism, subject to judicial review, for determining rights violations associated with these cases and enabling compensation payments to be made to these individuals.




Disagree.



The offence of people smuggling applies equally to adults and minors: age is not relevant for this crime. Minors do not belong in adult prisons, which is why on 2 May 2012, the Attorney-General announced a review of convicted people smuggling crew whose age was raised as an issue at some stage during the investigation and/or prosecution. A total of 28 cases were reviewed after being identified by the Australian Human Rights Commission, the Indonesian Embassy and the CDPP.


On 29 June 2012, the Attorney-General announced that the outcomes of the review were that:


o 15 crew were granted early release from prison on licence as there was a doubt they may have been minors on arrival in Australia


o two crew were released early on parole


o three crew completed their non‑parole periods prior to the commencement of the review and


o eight crew were assessed as likely to be adults on arrival as there was no evidence supporting suggestions they were minors at the time of arrival.


Australia has a fair system in place for assessing the age of people smuggling crew who claim to be minors, where all individuals who claim to be minors have their cases assessed on an individual basis. If there is insufficient evidence to establish whether the person is an adult or a minor, the person is given the benefit of the doubt and removed to their country of origin, unless exceptional circumstances apply.


People are free to make claims at any time against any government if they believe that a government has acted wrongly. Governments have a duty to properly consider such claims, as well as to properly defend themselves if such claims have no basis.




Recommendation 13





The Chair of the committee recommends that the Australian Government investigate options for providing culturally appropriate psychological support for Indonesian minors who suffered psychological trauma as a result of being wrongfully detained in Australia on suspicion of people smuggling.





Disagree.



The offence of people smuggling applies equally to adults and minors: age is not relevant for this crime. Indonesian crew of people smuggling vessels will be detained while consideration is given to whether they should be prosecuted for this offence.




Recommendation 14





The Chair of the committee recommends that the Attorney-General
'
s Department request that the states and territories afford persons convicted of people smuggling the right to remit a portion of any income earned in prison to their relatives in Indonesia.





Disagree.



Parliament passed legislation expressly providing that those convicted of people smuggling offences should be liable to repay the costs of their detention. Such people are also liable to pay the costs associated with their removal (see Recommendation 15). State and Territory correctional authorities have been asked to prevent convicted people smuggling crew from remitting money overseas so that DIAC can implement the debt recovery procedures that apply to this cohort under the Migration Act.The calculation of these individual debts can only be finalised once the person is released from custody and the full costs of each case are known. Allowing overseas remittances for this cohort will compromise the outcome of this lawful debt recovery.




Recommendation 15





The Chair of the committee recommends that the Australian Government immediately reverse the policy of seeking to recover the costs of detention and removal from Australia from Indonesian boat crew convicted of people smuggling offences.





Disagree.



The Migration Amendment (Abolishing Detention Debt) Act 2009 amended the Migration Act and removed liability for immigration detention and related costs for people in immigration detention. However, it remains Government policy that those engaged in people smuggling should not profit from such an activity. Hence, those people convicted of people smuggling continue to incur liability for both a detention and a removal debt. The Migration Act allows DIAC to freeze funds of people smugglers, and issue a garnishee notice to a third party, to recover that money as a means of meeting their Commonwealth debt. Under current arrangements, the extent to which removal and detention debts are recoverable depends on whether the person has funds available and the legal basis for the person's detention in Australia. DIAC is currently able to recover both detention and removal debts from crew who on their arrival were detained under section 189(3), because of section 250, of the Act as a suspected people smuggling offender, and who have not subsequently been issued with a Criminal Justice Stay Visa (CJSV). Crew who have been issued a CJSV under past procedures are only able to have debts recovered on a voluntary basis under the same arrangements in the Migration Act that apply to all unlawful non‑citizens who are being removed from Australia.


JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON TREATIES


REPORT 131: TREATIES TABLED ON 21 AUGUST, 11 AND 18 SEPTEMBER 2012


GOVERNMENT RESPONSE



Recommendation 2: The Committee recommends that new and revised extradition agreements should explicitly provide a requirement that the requesting country provide annual information concerning the trial status and health of extradited persons and the conditions of the detention facilities in which they are held.


The Government does not accept this recommendation.


The Government notes that the Committee made a similar recommendation in its Report 110 (Recommendation 4), and the Government's response to Report 110, which was tabled in February 2012, did not accept that recommendation. In considering Recommendation 2 of the current Report, the Government has carefully considered its previous response to Report 110 and the operation of Australia's extradition framework since that response. The Government has concluded that Australia's current extradition arrangements and policies remain appropriate and effective at this time.


The Government reiterates its view that the most appropriate time at which to examine any potential human rights concerns is before extradition occurs, during the extensive review process. This is consistent with Australia's obligations under international human rights law and with international extradition practice. As noted in the Government's Response to Report 110, the extradition process in Australia includes extensive procedural safeguards, which are included in the Extradition Act 1988 and in bilateral treaties. For example, Australia will not extradite a person if there are substantial grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of being subjected to arbitrary deprivation of life, application of the death penalty, or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.


In addition, since the time of the Government's response to Report 110, the Parliament has enacted the Extradition and Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation Amendment Act 2012. This Act contains a number of significant amendments to further strengthen the protections in the Extradition Act 1988. These amendments include a new ground for refusing extradition where the person may be punished, or discriminated against, upon surrender on the basis of his or her sex or sexual orientation, as well as amendments to strengthen protections in situations where a person may be subjected to torture. The Government will continue to closely monitor the operation of Australia's extradition framework, and will examine the need for any further amendments as required.


As noted in the Government's Response to Report 110, the Government has established monitoring mechanisms in relation to Australian nationals who have been extradited overseas. The Government is able to conduct this monitoring because of the consular rights provided for under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and the resources provided to support Australia's consular network. In 2011-12, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade provided consular assistance to 236 Australian nationals serving prison sentences overseas. In addition, when a foreign national is extradited from Australia to a third country, the Government has agreed to formally advise that person's country of citizenship of his or her detention and extradition, subject to that person's consent (noting the constraints on the disclosure of personal information under the Privacy Act 1988).


As also noted in the Government's Response to Report 110, the Government has agreed to include additional information on persons extradited from Australia in the Annual Reports of the Attorney‑General's Department, including information on:


extradition requests granted by Australia and the categories of the relevant offences by reference to the countries which made the request


the number of Australian permanent residents extradited, and


any breaches of substantive obligations under bilateral extradition agreements noted by Australian authorities.


Accordingly, in 2011-12, the Attorney-General's Department Annual Report included the following information:


10 extradition requests were granted by Australia in 2011-12. This included:


   o Jurisdictions to which extradition was granted: United Kingdom (6), Hong Kong (1), Indonesia (1), Ireland (1), United States (1)


   o Offence categories: Child sex and child exploitation offences (4), Drugs (1), Theft and/or fraud (3), Corruption (1), Culpable driving (1)


   o Citizenship of person extradited: Australia (5), Hong Kong (1), Ecuador (1),1 United Kingdom (3),* United States (1)


No permanent residents were extradited in the reporting period.


No breaches of substantive obligations contained in bilateral extradition treaties were noted in the reporting period.

I seek leave to have the second reading speeches incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speeches read as follows—



COURT SECURITY BILL 2013


Federal courts and tribunals, due to their very nature as forums to resolve intractable disputes, bring together people who are in conflict.  Proceedings are often emotionally charged, and can involve actual or threatened violence.  


It is essential that the federal courts and tribunals are supported in their efforts to prevent, as far as possible, security incidents arising on their premises, and to respond quickly and appropriately to control incidents when they do arise.  


Court users, particularly those involved in cases in the Family and Federal Magistrates courts, have the fundamental right to access facilities and have their cases heard without the threat of violence and intimidation. 




Current court security arrangements



Security at most federal court and tribunal premises is provided by contracted security guards, and this has been the case for many years.  


The current legislative framework for security at federal court and tribunal premises is Part IIA of the Public Order (Protection of Persons and Property) Act 1971.  However, this legislation is out of date, in that it assumes the presence of police officers on court premises.  It also does not contain an appropriate range of powers – and safeguards on the exercise of these powers – sufficient to meet the security needs of the modern court environment. 


Security officers are uncertain of their powers to confiscate materials or temporarily detain violent people.




Legislative fra
mework established by this Bill



This Bill contains a comprehensive framework to enable the federal courts and tribunals to manage the wide range of security issues they face in different locations across Australia.  


It allows courts to appoint persons as security officers and authorised court officers and clearly sets out the powers that these officers are able to exercise.  


The powers build on those currently contained in the Public Order Act and those available to the courts under the common law as occupiers of premises.  


The powers include screening and search powers, powers to give certain directions, and a limited range of powers supported by the use of necessary and reasonable force.  


Only appropriately trained and licensed security officers will be able to use force in exercising powers under the Bill, and these officers will only be able to use force in clearly defined circumstances.  


Recognising that security officers may not be present at all court locations, in particular when the courts are in regional circuit locations, the Bill allows authorised court officers to exercise a limited range of basic security powers.  


The Bill creates a number of offences relating to court security, and provides for the administrative heads of the federal courts to seek protection orders on behalf of judicial officers and court staff or in the interests of court security. 


The Bill contains important safeguards around the exercise of powers.  These safeguards include licencing and training requirements for appointed officers, identification requirements, complaints mechanisms, and oversight by the Commonwealth Ombudsman.  


The measures under the Bill balance a person’s right to enter and remain upon court premises, with the right of other court users, judicial officers, court staff and members of the public to a safe and secure court environment.


The Bill has been developed in close consultation with the federal courts and tribunals.  It responds to concerns raised by the heads of jurisdiction of the federal courts that the Public Order Act does not meet the security needs of the modern court environment.  


The Bill is tailored to ensure that the courts can reduce, as far as possible, the risk of security incidents arising on their premises, and to appropriately respond to incidents that do arise.




Police presence for court security



It is expected that courts will continue to call for police assistance to deal with serious security incidents.  


However, events at court premises can escalate with little warning. It is, therefore, vital that there is an effective legislative framework in place to ensure that courts are able to take preventative security measures such as screening, and, where a security incident has arisen, to enable the courts to continue to operate in a safe and secure manner before police arrive.


The Bill has been carefully drafted so as to be flexible to a range of different guarding arrangements.  This is appropriate given the different security needs of different courts and tribunals.




Conclusion



Effective court security arrangements are a critical precondition for the effective administration of justice.


This Bill will modernise the legal framework for federal court and tribunal security arrangements and thereby ensure that our courts and tribunals are safe and secure places for the public to have their disputes heard.


I commend the Bill to the House.


COURT SECURITY (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2013


I am pleased to introduce the Court Security (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2013.


The Court Security Bill 2013 provides a new framework for court security arrangements for federal courts and tribunals.  The new framework will meet the security needs of the modern court environment by providing a range of powers for security officers and limited powers for authorised court officers to ensure that court premises are safe and secure environments.


The Court Security Bill will replace the current security framework for federal courts and tribunals under the Public Order (Protection of Persons and Property) Act 1971, which no longer meets the security needs of the modern court environment.  


This companion Consequential Amendments Bill allows proper implementation of the new framework.


This Bill will achieve this by removing the existing provisions in the Public Order Act that would otherwise overlap with provisions in the Court Security Bill.


Debate adjourned.

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",Nats,2013-05-16,"



Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (15:50):  I feel as if I have given three speeches on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Bill 2013. The issue is that the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act will be utilised to give greater oversight over protection of the aquifers. It is something that we are supporting. I think this is very important for former Gunnedah mayor, John Lyle, for his wife, Suzie, for people such as Xavier Martin, and for other people on the plains around Breeza and other places east of the Condamine River—people who have a serious concern about that. So let's clearly state that we are supporting this. After debate, after lobbying and after working hard on their behalf, we are supporting this.


But I think it also needs to be stated that you can understand the frustration that is held by the government when one of the so-called champions of this, Mr Windsor, seems to want to sit on both sides of the fence. That is clearly understood because he sold his place to a coal miner. He sold it not just for an ordinary price but for an extremely good price—almost $5,000 an acre. He has been highly sensitive about this. We could see that the other day when I was accosted in the media gallery about this issue. He wanted to, as he said, take it outside. Obviously, the impending threat of litigation, which of course you just do not have the resources to do—




Senator Wong:
  You should resign. If all you're going to do is campaign for a New South Wales seat—




Senator JOYCE:
  Senator Wong, you should not interject. You should be polite. Quite clearly, Mr Windsor never went outside of parliament when in the past he accused the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, John Anderson, of bribery. He did not go outside and make that allegation because it was fallacious, wrong and stupid; nor did Mr Windsor go outside and reassert allegations he made about Senator Sandy Macdonald. So it is a bit rich for him to be making statements about a coward's castle, because it is a place where he has resided quite happily a number of times.


I noted in Mr Windsor's letter to the editor on 28 July 2010 that he gave a number of points in seriatim and they run completely counter to the arguments that he is spreading around the district. He gives an explanation for why they could mine coal on his family's place. It has been in his family for I do not know how many generations, but they grew a very good crop of sunflower there, so it must be decent land. He runs this explanation of why coalmining is quite appropriate there but just down the road it is not. The argument was on the premise of the EPBC Act and water aquifers. In fact, he states himself in his letter to the editor:


10. A gravel ridge is the type of land that should be mined, not the fertile land of the Liverpool Plains.


The problem with that is that Shenhua and BHP were looking at mining on gravel ridges and he was one of the people protesting against it. You cannot have it both ways. You cannot decide one day because it works in your favour financially that you agree with mining so you can get paid $5,000 an acre for country which sales data of about that time indicates should get you, at best, $2,000 or $3,000 an acre—so you got way above the market for it—and then stand literally down the road and have a completely different position. It just makes you look like a total and utter hypocrite.


Point 7 of his letter to the editor says:


It is believed there will be an application to extend the Coal Company's mining area at some time in the future—that application may impact on ""Cintra"" land if approval were to be given. The Coal Company has a legitimate right to make such an application.


So he knew full well that his family's place was going to become a coalmine. It is a point of interest as to how that application went. Who approved it and why? A fair question to ask is: which state ministers at that point in time were part of that approval process? There might be nothing to answer for or there might be further questions to ask, but I think that is a fair question that can be asked in this chamber; it is a fair question that needs an answer. If the answer makes sense, the issue rests; but, if the answer does not, further questions need to be asked. That would be fair enough as well.


Mr Windsor says:


4. The Coal Company has purchased a number of properties within what is called the ""zone of affectation"" of mining activities.


5. Most of these properties will not be mined.


Why does he say that? Coalmining companies generally buy country because they have an expectation that there is coal somewhere around it. There may be buffer areas, but most of them will be mined. If you go through Werris Creek now, what you see is a massive mine. If someone had concerns about water tables, they are certainly not showing much concern there. It just seems peculiar that you could say, 'We'll just close our eyes and pretend that mine on the edge of Werris Creek doesn't exist. We'll pretend it's not there.' If you stand behind the mining industry, that is well and good. I believe in the mining industry. I think Australia would be broke without the mining industry, but I have no coalmine on my family's place. There is not one there.


To return to this piece of legislation, we need to make sure that we afford these people protections. A principle that we stand behind with coal seam gas, because a lot of this is pertinent to coal seam gas, is that there will be no coal seam gas extraction on primary agricultural land. If you are getting $5,000 an acre—if that is its true value; if that is really what it was worth—that sounds like primary agricultural land to me. That is a pretty good price. In other areas, you would have to be buying irrigation country for that amount. I do not know how you would go right now—if you were willing to buy land at $5,000 an acre, I reckon you would be buying the best land in the district. In fact, I think you would be buying the best land in the district with a lot of change left over. I do not know why someone would pay you $5,000 an acre. They get the land and you get the money—but anyway.


You should not be mining on primary agricultural land. You should not be destroying aquifers. When they put a coalmine down on a place, they never really questioned it much then. You should not be near—and this is pertinent—to domestic dwellings. I can assure you that this mine on Mr Windsor's place is right on the edge of town. It is right next to a residential area. I used to live there. I lived at 31 Gordon Street, Werris Creek. That was my house—it was the first house I bought for myself and my wife. My local member was Tony Windsor, in state politics at that time, I think. If you are on the land—




Senator Wong:
  So the Senate is just where you give campaign speeches?




Senator JOYCE:
  If you want to make a speech, Senator Wong, you should stand up and make one. Otherwise you are just a rude person.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator Wong:
  Why won't you resign if you can't represent the state of Queensland?



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Wong, stop interjecting.




Senator Cormann:
  Touchy, touchy—worried about the Labor Party in New South Wales!



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order on my left too! Senator Wong, please desist. Senator Joyce, direct your remarks to the chair.




Senator JOYCE:
  Thank you very much, Mr Deputy President. I can understand why some people might want to protect their colleague in the Green-Labor Party-Independent alliance. They have worked very closely together for a number of years. They have been very close, at a state level and at a federal level—at a state level in trying to make sure that their interests are looked after, and at a federal level in making sure that their interests are looked after.


We do not believe it should be on prime agricultural land. If you are selling something for $5,000 an acre, that would sound to me like prime agricultural land, because I do not know where you would be buying land, I really do not, for $5,000 an acre, even today—not for dryland farming. I would say that that would be one of the top prices you could possibly pay. Would that be a fair comment, Senator Heffernan? Senator Heffernan nods. He knows this country.


As far as aquifers go, I reckon putting in a coal mine would raise a few questions. Now, the big one is: should it be next to towns? This mine is on what was Mr Windsor's place. He has got it back now on a peppercorn rent. He also got the next-door neighbour's place on a peppercorn rent. It is an awfully good trick, except the neighbour wanted it back himself on a peppercorn rent—but I think Mr Windsor has got it. It is right next to town, so that is a bit of a problem. The final thing is: a fair return should go back to the landholder. I must admit, he ticked that box. He got that one right. He got a very fair return back to the landholder. So maybe on one issue, a fair return to the landholder, we and Mr Windsor are on the same ticket. We have to make sure that in dealing with this industry we acknowledge that. 


Mr Windsor is working with mining companies. He has sold his place to a coalmining company. He got a very good price for his place and has obviously of late had a very strong working relationship or has been in discussions with Mr Palmer. Good luck to him! That is all right; I have no problems with that. It is clear to see that having a strong working relationship with mining and being the strong benefactor of what has happened in mining makes sense. This is obviously one of the questions that people ask: who were the ministers at the time?




Senator Cormann:
  We have seen a bit of mining in New South Wales lately.




Senator JOYCE:
  Yes. If there is nothing that needs to be answered, that is fair enough. We just need to clear the air; that is all. We just need to clear the air and get it off the cards. It is now very important that this piece of legislation goes through and that the people around Kiruna, the people around Breeza, the people around Nea, the people around Werris Creek and the people around Quirindi clearly understand that we support this legislation—because they will be reading this; you can bet your life on it—and that Xavier Martin, John Lyall and even Tim Duddy understand that we are in support of this legislation. They can communicate to the people of the area that we support this legislation and, in supporting this legislation, that we clearly show that the coalition in New England are trying to work to resolve issues. Hopefully, they will have a strong hand in a future coalition government to continue the work that needs to be done to make sure that we get the proper balance right.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Bill 2013</title>,BILLS,23,1
"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2013-05-16,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (16:03):  I rise to contribute to the debate on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Bill 2013. That is not to be confused with the EPBC Amendment Bill 2012. I have both reports here. They say slightly different things, I admit, from the government's perspective. Nonetheless, I am a member of the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee and, throughout the inquiry into this piece of legislation, the committee received 235 submissions from across industry, environmental groups and community. There was a keen interest in discussing this particular matter.


The bill seeks to amend the EPBC Act by creating a new manner of national environmental significance under the act. Currently, there are eight matters of national environmental significance, including World Heritage properties, Commonwealth marine areas, wetlands, national heritage places and the like. The amendments go to set out requirements and civil offences regarding actions which could have a significant impact on water resources, from coal seam gas to large coalmining developments.


The impact of coal seam gas on regional communities is of great concern to the Nationals and the coalition generally. To get the balance right between farmers, community and the environment is paramount. It is summed up best by the Nationals leader, Warren Truss, in 2011, when he stated:


A properly managed coal seam gas industry represents an unprecedented opportunity for regional Australia. Poorly managed it could tick every box of a social and environmental disaster. 


This is why we have developed some core principles around the development of the industry, in direct response to community concerns.


The core principles go to the heart of the concerns about inappropriate developments. I think Senator Joyce has already touched on these. Firstly, no coal seam gas development should proceed where it poses a significant impact on groundwater or surface water; it has to be safe for the environment. Secondly, prime agricultural land is our most precious asset; its value drives our regional communities and our export industry. We do not want to see any negative impact on that. Thirdly, regional Australia is home to many thousands of locals living in our towns, cities and districts. We think that the development of the coal seam gas industry needs to take the concerns of those householders into account. Fourthly, we believe landowners are entitled to appropriate returns for access to and use of their land that goes beyond mere compensation. Finally, there needs to be a recognition that, as regional communities are the areas contributing to the development of this resource, it is only fair that they receive a fair share of revenue generated by the industry so that they can reinvest that in their communities.


We have been upfront in outlining our desire for appropriate development of this industry, recognising that it also brings much needed jobs and economic stimulus to regional areas. But, again, I reiterate that it must be balanced. That is why we are not opposing this bill. However, there were numerous issues raised throughout the inquiry, which included several suggested amendments that the government could consider. They are sensible amendments, supported by both sides of this debate—those sides being environmentalists and industry. 


Both recognise that there was no consultation in the construction of this bill—that is, with any of the groups involved: farmers, industry or environmental groups. That evidence is borne out in our Senate committee report. This suggests that once again the federal government has sought to play politics instead of being guided by principles. Look at how that particular strategy has gone so far: five years of politics ahead of policy and principles has resulted in bills requiring significant amendment and having unintended consequences, and a legislative agenda that reads like a stakeholder wish list—I would cite the latest tranche of the Fairwork amendments as an example—as the national long-term interest of this nation is butchered on the altar of the Labor Party's desperation to cling onto power. The desire to cling on to power overrides good policy process. There is no regulatory impact statement with this bill; there was no consultation with stakeholders, states, industry, famers or environmental groups. The minister himself stated six months ago that the Commonwealth government had no constitutional powers to make such laws that would seek to regulate coal seam gas—and he was right. Yet the Greens foreshadowed amendments using the executive power under our Constitution, and I look forward to Senator Waters moving those later on in this debate so we can have a conversation about them. But it was clear that the government consulted with someone—their powerful allies and co-conspirators in the ALP government's longevity and negative legislative agenda. These powerful allies in this game of national and moral fiscal malaise are none other than Tony Windsor, the member for New England, and the Greens.


This bill and its process of development has been categorised by haste, lack of consultation, lack of a regulatory impact statement and lack of clarity, which was raised over and over again throughout the inquiry. There is ambiguity about the impact it will have on the process of environmental legislative reform that is already underway that states are having a national conversation about on how we can get better at this as a team. Mr Windsor's determination to support them is a perfect example of this government's determination to hang on to power for as long as it can. It is a very powerful alliance, indeed.


Nobody disputes the importance of getting the balance right. What is a point of debate, as the report rightly states in the government majority section, is that the regulation of coal seam gas is 'primarily a matter for states'. This bill supersedes the cooperative process already in place and already being conducted to deal with the issues of coal seam gas developments. That is precisely why the national partnership on coal seam gas and large coalmining proposals is important—a COAG process working collaboratively with the states to bring state environmental laws up to federal standards without impacting on their sovereignty. It has been, according to stakeholders in the process, circumvented by this bill. I refer specifically to the evidence given to the committee by the NFF representative Ms Kerr.


This process has been time consuming and people have approached it in good faith, but they are now left wondering as to the status of the review due next year and what role that will play. I know the Greens do not like state parliaments. Our federated structure is an anathema for them—ironic, really, as they sit here in the states' chamber in federal parliament.


As Senator Birmingham noted in his contribution to this debate, the coalition supports the work of the independent scientific committee as it provides up-to-date advice to both state governments, who are tasked with approving and assessing coal seam gas developments, and, indeed, the federal minister on matters deemed appropriate. This is a good initiative; we support it. To make the coalition out to be environmental vandals because we support scientific oversight and a collaborative approach to the national partnership on coal seam gas which brings the stakeholders together makes the hypocrisy of the Greens and Mr Windsor clear.


I recognise that the development of the coal seam gas industry in New South Wales is a significant issue to local landowners and communities; however, using the federal EPBC Act as a method for riding roughshod over the rights of states to regulate what occurs within their boundaries is an abuse of Commonwealth power. As Fiona Simson, President of NSW Farmers, stated to a question about her preferred option for how to deal with the issues of coal seam gas development in New South Wales:


My preferred option, and our association's preferred option, remains that the state government provide the protections that it promised it would prior to coming into office. We feel that that could quite easily happen through some of the instruments are currently in place—by making the aquifer interference policy enforceable, for instance.


Mr Gregson from the New South Wales Irrigators' Council said:


I think it would be our preference if New South Wales were to revisit its perspective and make its good set of rules applicable to at least someone so that we do not have to have the difference between the two jurisdictions.


It is clear, I think, that harmonisation is the way forward, rather than regulating all to fix one.


It may be news to the Greens that some states have taken a different approach to mining development. I would like to highlight one such state involved in this debate which has taken a different approach, one reflective of the coalition's stance on the development of our regions with respect to the mining industry—my home state of Victoria. It will now be subject to additional legislation and regulation and will be unable, if the Windsor amendment is passed, to seek bilateral agreements with the Commonwealth simply because New South Wales could not get it right. There is no coal seam gas production in Victoria and still no confirmed commercial reserves. However, the Victorian government is taking a very careful approach to the issue of coal seam gas and is determined not to rush into anything. It will not put at risk the water aquifers, agricultural production and liveability that are the hallmarks of the magnificent regional areas of Victoria. It has taken a strong, responsible approach to managing issues associated with coal seam gas. While further work is being undertaken at a Commonwealth and state level to better understand and manage the prospect of coal seam gas development, the state coalition has taken decisive action to protect local communities, including: a hold on approvals to undertake hydraulic fracturing as part of onshore gas exploration; a hold on the issuing of new exploration licences for coal seam gas; and a ban on the use of BTEX chemicals in hydraulic fracturing in Victoria.


This action is in addition to Victoria's already tough regulatory framework that includes Victoria's environmental protection policy under the Environment Protection Act 1970, which does not allow discharge from exploration and mining activities that will pollute groundwater. The Victorian state government is responsibly investigating approaches to ensuring both ongoing gas supplies and energy security with respect to natural gas development. That includes unconventional sources such as tight gas, shale gas and coal seam gas.


While some in the community would like to see the government permanently ban these industries, the state government does not believe that is a responsible approach. Despite the potential economic benefits of unconventional gas, protection of the environment is the state government's first priority. It goes right against the claims of the Greens that somehow state governments are subject to a conflict of interest around the approval of coalmining activities in terms of the state royalties they collect. But the Victorian state government has taken the sensible approach by participating in the national partnership conversation and is looking at what has happened under previous and current governments in Queensland and New South Wales. It is looking at a way to better regulate the development of the coal seam gas industry, and particularly its impact on regional communities. To legislate for all and to regulate all because of the bad behaviour of a few undermines all the potential good that could come from appropriately developed coal seam gas projects.


I would like to briefly mention Labor's record in Victoria. Licences to explore for coal seam gas have existed in Victoria for the last 12 years. It was the former Labor government that granted those exploration licences. Over 70 per cent of the 24 current exploration licences were issued under the former Labor government. Fracking was last approved and undertaken under the former Labor state government in 2009. It is interesting that Senator Cameron is not here spruiking the track record of the New South Wales Labor government on this issue. I look forward to him arriving in the chamber and standing up for the decisions made by the former New South Wales state Labor government with respect to mining development and more specifically to coal seam gas development throughout regional New South Wales. And where are Queensland senators? I am looking—Senator Feeney, Senator Brown, but no Queensland senators from the Labor Party. Senator Waters, I am more than happy if you want to stand up and spruik former Premier Bligh's track record on approvals and assessment of coal seam gas projects in Queensland, but I am guessing you will not be wanting to do that. Correct. Any Queensland Labor senators should head on down. We would love to hear your take on coal seam gas mining project development approvals and assessments in Queensland. 


It is a bit rich that this bill is before us now. The fact is the concerns outlined by Senator Birmingham and the issues canvassed throughout the committee's report are specific to some state governments and that was made very clear in the evidence, but not all state governments—and not even a majority of state governments, just a handful. Here we are legislating in an area where we do not know what the unintended consequences are. There is ambiguity around definitions, which I hope to get to. A number of issues were raised during the inquiry that are not dealt with in the bills or in the amendments before us. Regarding the issues raised, I will touch on three, and they are clarity, overriding state processes and unintended consequences.


Clarity in definitions is important, and it is particularly important when writing laws—because lawyers get paid a lot of money to argue about what various clauses and words mean. The definitions frame and define what and whom is covered by various pieces of legislation. Submitters from both sides of this debate were concerned about the lack of clarity in this bill. The specific classic was what defined 'a water resource' under this legislation. Was it any dry gully? Did it refer to any water resource? Apparently, it did. Tracey Winters had this to say:


But the effect of this bill is to extend water resources—for example, a dry gully, every dry gully in the country, because a watercourse is defined as every watercourse, whether it is flowing or not. So this bill would make every dry gully in the country a matter of national environmental significance. 


Even so, the government's committee report stated that:


It is most unlikely that all dry gullies would be included.


But once it is law, it is law. While Senator Cameron and other senators who support the majority report into this piece of legislation might think that it is enough to put a line in a Senate committee report that it is unlikely that dry gullies would be considered a water resource under this piece of legislation, I would prefer to see that articulated in the bill, because once it is law it is law. I wonder what the perspective of our catchment management authorities, our local farmers and local councils would be if this were the case. I guess we can leave it for the lawyers to sort out.



There was no clarity either around whom is affected. What do large coalminers look like? A lack of transparency continued about how far the trigger should go. Should it cover other industries? I was particularly interested in this aspect. At the moment it only covered coal seam gas and large coalmining industries but it was of particular concern to the National Farmers Federation that this particular trigger could end up covering other types of regional industries. Apparently, according to Mr Knowles from Economists at Large, it should apply to other industries. It absolutely should. In fact, when he was asked to apply this trigger to agriculture, Mr Knowles said he thought it was a 'logical and equitable approach to take'.The whole push behind this is not just for coal seam gas and large coalmining developments but also for any industry's impact on a water resource, however that is defined. Why should the farmers in Western Australia or South Australia or Victoria or Tasmania be subjected to this ambiguity? Because the government needed once again the political support of Windsor and Waters. This was not one of the recommendations of the Hawke review—the massive review of the EPBC Act. It was not there. The experts did not find it there. It was not part of the government's response to the review. So, the government had the opportunity to say: 'You know what? We think we should do this. We think this should be how the EPBC should look.' 


Did the government put it in their response? No, they did not. I may be cynical! The refusal to work with the states and stakeholders towards an agreed national response to the very real challenges that the coal seam gas industry and its development pose for regional communities changed when the politics changed. Waters and Windsor wanted it as a wedge—that is clear—and Burke brought it on.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Fawcett
):  Order! Senator McKenzie, I remind you to refer to members and senators by their correct titles.




Senator McKENZIE:
  Minister Burke brought it on. Clearly, we will be backing regional communities, as we always do. I have appreciated the opportunity to highlight once again this government's inept handling of the legislative process—the rushed and reckless approach to regulation as they conspire against the national interest and our institutions, and against their own stated objectives with respect to environmental legislation, in an effort to maintain their hold on power, hand in hand with their most complicit allies, Windsor and the Greens.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I remind senators that at 4.30 the debate on this bill will be interrupted to move to general business.

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2013-05-16,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (16:23):  In speaking on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Bill 2013, I have to say what a lot of politics has been dragged into this whole debate. Yesterday I listened to Senator Waters talking about food security. The Greens do not care about growing food, and their history proves that. Go back to the Native Vegetation Conservation Act—of which Senator Heffernan would be well aware—which the then Premier of New South Wales, now Senator Bob Carr, brought into New South Wales to stop farmers ploughing even country that had not been farmed for 10 years. They could have grown some wheat crops on it. They could have grown more food. New South Wales could have yielded a lot more food to human consumption. But no—the Native Vegetation Conservation Act brought that to a complete stop, and it was driven by the Greens in the New South Wales parliament. Then Premier Bob Carr said his government would be the greenest New South Wales had ever seen. That he was. He cuddled up to the Greens and put all the environmental costs on to the farmers.


It is interesting that it was the then minister, one Kim Yeadon—John Laws used to call him by his full name, Kimberley Maxwell Yeadon—one of Premier Carr's senior staffers, who drove the SEPP 46 and then the Native Vegetation Conservation Act, with no compensation to farmers when they could not grow food, driven by the Greens. And who was one of the chief advisers? One Senator Penny Wong. That is where she came from, in her pre-Senate life. This was a Greens-Labor stooge of a policy to blame those terrible farmers, those 'environmental vandals', as they refer to the farmers—who actually feed everyone in Australia plus millions of other people around the world.


That is what has come into this whole debate, once again: politics. It is not about the environment; it is about politics. We have seen the Greens just recently up at Liverpool Plains, the fly-in fly-out visitors to regional Australia. None of them live out there.




Senator Di Natale:
  I do! Get it right.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  I did not realise—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  You will ignore the interjections, Senator Williams.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  I will ignore the interjections. Put it this way: none of them live up near Liverpool Plains. If Senator Di Natale lives in regional Australia, he would be a rarity in that group, I can assure you. On 25 April, an article in the Namoi Valley Independent said:


Greens leader Senator Christine Milne is questioning why Shenhua Watermark Coal was granted a coal exploration licence on farmland that she believes could be vulnerable to water contamination from mining.


What is amazing is that this delegation led by Senator Milne did not go and visit Shenhua Watermark Coal:


Shenhua Watermark Coal issued a statement yesterday, saying it had not been consulted about the visit or asked to provide a tour of the proposed mine site.


Don't go and look at the facts; let's play politics with the issue. The article said:


It said when the company did invite the delegation to visit, the request was rejected.


Shenhua also said in its statement:


'This is extremely disappointing as our tour would have allowed her to see first hand how the project is avoiding any disturbance on the region’s black soil Liverpool Plains and highly productive acquifers which are used by local farmers … 


Contrary to Ms Milne’s comment, the Watermark Project is actively managing the farms we have acquired and the overall loss of agricultural output will be minimal as a result of mining.'


I have spent all of my life in rural Australia, and being a member of the National Party of New South Wales I know we are the last people who want to see any damage done to the Liverpool Plains or any other farming country in Australia. There is very little of the sort of magnificent country of the Liverpool Plains, about three per cent, on this planet.


This bill is giving more authority to the federal government, but we on this side of the parliament supported the $150 million scientific study. We actually got the amendments through the Rudd government, from this place—despite the bashing we got from some—that said you could not mine coal seam gas in the Namoi Valley until a water study was carried out. It was the coalition that pursued that and, in conjunction with the Labor Party, we achieved that. So they could not move from exploration to mining without a water study being carried out. It was the Labor Party and the coalition that put that in place. The Greens opposed it because they wanted the water study done before exploration. If that were the case, no exploration would ever be done. Let's be fair dinkum here. The four-wheel-drive utes and tractors that people drive around their farms are not made out of tree bark and leaves; they come from mining. That is why mining has served our country well, as has agriculture. Mining represents a finite resource. Agriculture represents a renewable resource that will hopefully go on for as long as mankind lives on this planet.


But the problem is the politicisation of this issue. The Nationals leader, Warren Truss, made it quite clear when he announced our five-point plan for coal seam gas in November 2011. We said:


No coal seam gas development should proceed where it poses a significant impact to the quality of groundwater or surface water systems—


or the environment more generally.


Prime agricultural land … must be protected from activities that destroy its capacity to deliver food security …


We know that some in this place like to just lock it up for national parks. We have seen the record of the Labor Party and the Greens on that. We could go to Toorale Station, Senator Heffernan, couldn't we? Ninety-three thousand hectares of good grazing country and good farming country—with some irrigation—is now a national park. Our coal seam gas policy continued:


Coal seam gas development must not occur close to existing residential areas …


Landowners are entitled to appropriate pecuniary returns for access to their land …


The regions that deliver much of the wealth from coal seam gas developments deserve to see a fair share of the generated revenues reinvested in their communities …


That is what was put out a long time ago and has been stated for a long time now. We have made it quite clear where we stand on this. We must tread with extreme caution. One thing we cannot do in this place is destroy the environment for future generations, especially the land and water needed to grow food. If you do not have healthy soil, you do not grow healthy food. If you do not have healthy food, you do not have healthy humans. It is actually a health issue.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! It being 4.30 pm, the debate is interrupted.

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",Nats,2013-05-16,"



Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (15:50):  I feel as if I have given three speeches on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Bill 2013. The issue is that the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act will be utilised to give greater oversight over protection of the aquifers. It is something that we are supporting. I think this is very important for former Gunnedah mayor, John Lyle, for his wife, Suzie, for people such as Xavier Martin, and for other people on the plains around Breeza and other places east of the Condamine River—people who have a serious concern about that. So let's clearly state that we are supporting this. After debate, after lobbying and after working hard on their behalf, we are supporting this.


But I think it also needs to be stated that you can understand the frustration that is held by the government when one of the so-called champions of this, Mr Windsor, seems to want to sit on both sides of the fence. That is clearly understood because he sold his place to a coal miner. He sold it not just for an ordinary price but for an extremely good price—almost $5,000 an acre. He has been highly sensitive about this. We could see that the other day when I was accosted in the media gallery about this issue. He wanted to, as he said, take it outside. Obviously, the impending threat of litigation, which of course you just do not have the resources to do—




Senator Wong:
  You should resign. If all you're going to do is campaign for a New South Wales seat—




Senator JOYCE:
  Senator Wong, you should not interject. You should be polite. Quite clearly, Mr Windsor never went outside of parliament when in the past he accused the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, John Anderson, of bribery. He did not go outside and make that allegation because it was fallacious, wrong and stupid; nor did Mr Windsor go outside and reassert allegations he made about Senator Sandy Macdonald. So it is a bit rich for him to be making statements about a coward's castle, because it is a place where he has resided quite happily a number of times.


I noted in Mr Windsor's letter to the editor on 28 July 2010 that he gave a number of points in seriatim and they run completely counter to the arguments that he is spreading around the district. He gives an explanation for why they could mine coal on his family's place. It has been in his family for I do not know how many generations, but they grew a very good crop of sunflower there, so it must be decent land. He runs this explanation of why coalmining is quite appropriate there but just down the road it is not. The argument was on the premise of the EPBC Act and water aquifers. In fact, he states himself in his letter to the editor:


10. A gravel ridge is the type of land that should be mined, not the fertile land of the Liverpool Plains.


The problem with that is that Shenhua and BHP were looking at mining on gravel ridges and he was one of the people protesting against it. You cannot have it both ways. You cannot decide one day because it works in your favour financially that you agree with mining so you can get paid $5,000 an acre for country which sales data of about that time indicates should get you, at best, $2,000 or $3,000 an acre—so you got way above the market for it—and then stand literally down the road and have a completely different position. It just makes you look like a total and utter hypocrite.


Point 7 of his letter to the editor says:


It is believed there will be an application to extend the Coal Company's mining area at some time in the future—that application may impact on ""Cintra"" land if approval were to be given. The Coal Company has a legitimate right to make such an application.


So he knew full well that his family's place was going to become a coalmine. It is a point of interest as to how that application went. Who approved it and why? A fair question to ask is: which state ministers at that point in time were part of that approval process? There might be nothing to answer for or there might be further questions to ask, but I think that is a fair question that can be asked in this chamber; it is a fair question that needs an answer. If the answer makes sense, the issue rests; but, if the answer does not, further questions need to be asked. That would be fair enough as well.


Mr Windsor says:


4. The Coal Company has purchased a number of properties within what is called the ""zone of affectation"" of mining activities.


5. Most of these properties will not be mined.


Why does he say that? Coalmining companies generally buy country because they have an expectation that there is coal somewhere around it. There may be buffer areas, but most of them will be mined. If you go through Werris Creek now, what you see is a massive mine. If someone had concerns about water tables, they are certainly not showing much concern there. It just seems peculiar that you could say, 'We'll just close our eyes and pretend that mine on the edge of Werris Creek doesn't exist. We'll pretend it's not there.' If you stand behind the mining industry, that is well and good. I believe in the mining industry. I think Australia would be broke without the mining industry, but I have no coalmine on my family's place. There is not one there.


To return to this piece of legislation, we need to make sure that we afford these people protections. A principle that we stand behind with coal seam gas, because a lot of this is pertinent to coal seam gas, is that there will be no coal seam gas extraction on primary agricultural land. If you are getting $5,000 an acre—if that is its true value; if that is really what it was worth—that sounds like primary agricultural land to me. That is a pretty good price. In other areas, you would have to be buying irrigation country for that amount. I do not know how you would go right now—if you were willing to buy land at $5,000 an acre, I reckon you would be buying the best land in the district. In fact, I think you would be buying the best land in the district with a lot of change left over. I do not know why someone would pay you $5,000 an acre. They get the land and you get the money—but anyway.


You should not be mining on primary agricultural land. You should not be destroying aquifers. When they put a coalmine down on a place, they never really questioned it much then. You should not be near—and this is pertinent—to domestic dwellings. I can assure you that this mine on Mr Windsor's place is right on the edge of town. It is right next to a residential area. I used to live there. I lived at 31 Gordon Street, Werris Creek. That was my house—it was the first house I bought for myself and my wife. My local member was Tony Windsor, in state politics at that time, I think. If you are on the land—




Senator Wong:
  So the Senate is just where you give campaign speeches?




Senator JOYCE:
  If you want to make a speech, Senator Wong, you should stand up and make one. Otherwise you are just a rude person.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator Wong:
  Why won't you resign if you can't represent the state of Queensland?



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Wong, stop interjecting.




Senator Cormann:
  Touchy, touchy—worried about the Labor Party in New South Wales!



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order on my left too! Senator Wong, please desist. Senator Joyce, direct your remarks to the chair.




Senator JOYCE:
  Thank you very much, Mr Deputy President. I can understand why some people might want to protect their colleague in the Green-Labor Party-Independent alliance. They have worked very closely together for a number of years. They have been very close, at a state level and at a federal level—at a state level in trying to make sure that their interests are looked after, and at a federal level in making sure that their interests are looked after.


We do not believe it should be on prime agricultural land. If you are selling something for $5,000 an acre, that would sound to me like prime agricultural land, because I do not know where you would be buying land, I really do not, for $5,000 an acre, even today—not for dryland farming. I would say that that would be one of the top prices you could possibly pay. Would that be a fair comment, Senator Heffernan? Senator Heffernan nods. He knows this country.


As far as aquifers go, I reckon putting in a coal mine would raise a few questions. Now, the big one is: should it be next to towns? This mine is on what was Mr Windsor's place. He has got it back now on a peppercorn rent. He also got the next-door neighbour's place on a peppercorn rent. It is an awfully good trick, except the neighbour wanted it back himself on a peppercorn rent—but I think Mr Windsor has got it. It is right next to town, so that is a bit of a problem. The final thing is: a fair return should go back to the landholder. I must admit, he ticked that box. He got that one right. He got a very fair return back to the landholder. So maybe on one issue, a fair return to the landholder, we and Mr Windsor are on the same ticket. We have to make sure that in dealing with this industry we acknowledge that. 


Mr Windsor is working with mining companies. He has sold his place to a coalmining company. He got a very good price for his place and has obviously of late had a very strong working relationship or has been in discussions with Mr Palmer. Good luck to him! That is all right; I have no problems with that. It is clear to see that having a strong working relationship with mining and being the strong benefactor of what has happened in mining makes sense. This is obviously one of the questions that people ask: who were the ministers at the time?




Senator Cormann:
  We have seen a bit of mining in New South Wales lately.




Senator JOYCE:
  Yes. If there is nothing that needs to be answered, that is fair enough. We just need to clear the air; that is all. We just need to clear the air and get it off the cards. It is now very important that this piece of legislation goes through and that the people around Kiruna, the people around Breeza, the people around Nea, the people around Werris Creek and the people around Quirindi clearly understand that we support this legislation—because they will be reading this; you can bet your life on it—and that Xavier Martin, John Lyall and even Tim Duddy understand that we are in support of this legislation. They can communicate to the people of the area that we support this legislation and, in supporting this legislation, that we clearly show that the coalition in New England are trying to work to resolve issues. Hopefully, they will have a strong hand in a future coalition government to continue the work that needs to be done to make sure that we get the proper balance right.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2013-05-16,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (16:03):  I rise to contribute to the debate on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Bill 2013. That is not to be confused with the EPBC Amendment Bill 2012. I have both reports here. They say slightly different things, I admit, from the government's perspective. Nonetheless, I am a member of the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee and, throughout the inquiry into this piece of legislation, the committee received 235 submissions from across industry, environmental groups and community. There was a keen interest in discussing this particular matter.


The bill seeks to amend the EPBC Act by creating a new manner of national environmental significance under the act. Currently, there are eight matters of national environmental significance, including World Heritage properties, Commonwealth marine areas, wetlands, national heritage places and the like. The amendments go to set out requirements and civil offences regarding actions which could have a significant impact on water resources, from coal seam gas to large coalmining developments.


The impact of coal seam gas on regional communities is of great concern to the Nationals and the coalition generally. To get the balance right between farmers, community and the environment is paramount. It is summed up best by the Nationals leader, Warren Truss, in 2011, when he stated:


A properly managed coal seam gas industry represents an unprecedented opportunity for regional Australia. Poorly managed it could tick every box of a social and environmental disaster. 


This is why we have developed some core principles around the development of the industry, in direct response to community concerns.


The core principles go to the heart of the concerns about inappropriate developments. I think Senator Joyce has already touched on these. Firstly, no coal seam gas development should proceed where it poses a significant impact on groundwater or surface water; it has to be safe for the environment. Secondly, prime agricultural land is our most precious asset; its value drives our regional communities and our export industry. We do not want to see any negative impact on that. Thirdly, regional Australia is home to many thousands of locals living in our towns, cities and districts. We think that the development of the coal seam gas industry needs to take the concerns of those householders into account. Fourthly, we believe landowners are entitled to appropriate returns for access to and use of their land that goes beyond mere compensation. Finally, there needs to be a recognition that, as regional communities are the areas contributing to the development of this resource, it is only fair that they receive a fair share of revenue generated by the industry so that they can reinvest that in their communities.


We have been upfront in outlining our desire for appropriate development of this industry, recognising that it also brings much needed jobs and economic stimulus to regional areas. But, again, I reiterate that it must be balanced. That is why we are not opposing this bill. However, there were numerous issues raised throughout the inquiry, which included several suggested amendments that the government could consider. They are sensible amendments, supported by both sides of this debate—those sides being environmentalists and industry. 


Both recognise that there was no consultation in the construction of this bill—that is, with any of the groups involved: farmers, industry or environmental groups. That evidence is borne out in our Senate committee report. This suggests that once again the federal government has sought to play politics instead of being guided by principles. Look at how that particular strategy has gone so far: five years of politics ahead of policy and principles has resulted in bills requiring significant amendment and having unintended consequences, and a legislative agenda that reads like a stakeholder wish list—I would cite the latest tranche of the Fairwork amendments as an example—as the national long-term interest of this nation is butchered on the altar of the Labor Party's desperation to cling onto power. The desire to cling on to power overrides good policy process. There is no regulatory impact statement with this bill; there was no consultation with stakeholders, states, industry, famers or environmental groups. The minister himself stated six months ago that the Commonwealth government had no constitutional powers to make such laws that would seek to regulate coal seam gas—and he was right. Yet the Greens foreshadowed amendments using the executive power under our Constitution, and I look forward to Senator Waters moving those later on in this debate so we can have a conversation about them. But it was clear that the government consulted with someone—their powerful allies and co-conspirators in the ALP government's longevity and negative legislative agenda. These powerful allies in this game of national and moral fiscal malaise are none other than Tony Windsor, the member for New England, and the Greens.


This bill and its process of development has been categorised by haste, lack of consultation, lack of a regulatory impact statement and lack of clarity, which was raised over and over again throughout the inquiry. There is ambiguity about the impact it will have on the process of environmental legislative reform that is already underway that states are having a national conversation about on how we can get better at this as a team. Mr Windsor's determination to support them is a perfect example of this government's determination to hang on to power for as long as it can. It is a very powerful alliance, indeed.


Nobody disputes the importance of getting the balance right. What is a point of debate, as the report rightly states in the government majority section, is that the regulation of coal seam gas is 'primarily a matter for states'. This bill supersedes the cooperative process already in place and already being conducted to deal with the issues of coal seam gas developments. That is precisely why the national partnership on coal seam gas and large coalmining proposals is important—a COAG process working collaboratively with the states to bring state environmental laws up to federal standards without impacting on their sovereignty. It has been, according to stakeholders in the process, circumvented by this bill. I refer specifically to the evidence given to the committee by the NFF representative Ms Kerr.


This process has been time consuming and people have approached it in good faith, but they are now left wondering as to the status of the review due next year and what role that will play. I know the Greens do not like state parliaments. Our federated structure is an anathema for them—ironic, really, as they sit here in the states' chamber in federal parliament.


As Senator Birmingham noted in his contribution to this debate, the coalition supports the work of the independent scientific committee as it provides up-to-date advice to both state governments, who are tasked with approving and assessing coal seam gas developments, and, indeed, the federal minister on matters deemed appropriate. This is a good initiative; we support it. To make the coalition out to be environmental vandals because we support scientific oversight and a collaborative approach to the national partnership on coal seam gas which brings the stakeholders together makes the hypocrisy of the Greens and Mr Windsor clear.


I recognise that the development of the coal seam gas industry in New South Wales is a significant issue to local landowners and communities; however, using the federal EPBC Act as a method for riding roughshod over the rights of states to regulate what occurs within their boundaries is an abuse of Commonwealth power. As Fiona Simson, President of NSW Farmers, stated to a question about her preferred option for how to deal with the issues of coal seam gas development in New South Wales:


My preferred option, and our association's preferred option, remains that the state government provide the protections that it promised it would prior to coming into office. We feel that that could quite easily happen through some of the instruments are currently in place—by making the aquifer interference policy enforceable, for instance.


Mr Gregson from the New South Wales Irrigators' Council said:


I think it would be our preference if New South Wales were to revisit its perspective and make its good set of rules applicable to at least someone so that we do not have to have the difference between the two jurisdictions.


It is clear, I think, that harmonisation is the way forward, rather than regulating all to fix one.


It may be news to the Greens that some states have taken a different approach to mining development. I would like to highlight one such state involved in this debate which has taken a different approach, one reflective of the coalition's stance on the development of our regions with respect to the mining industry—my home state of Victoria. It will now be subject to additional legislation and regulation and will be unable, if the Windsor amendment is passed, to seek bilateral agreements with the Commonwealth simply because New South Wales could not get it right. There is no coal seam gas production in Victoria and still no confirmed commercial reserves. However, the Victorian government is taking a very careful approach to the issue of coal seam gas and is determined not to rush into anything. It will not put at risk the water aquifers, agricultural production and liveability that are the hallmarks of the magnificent regional areas of Victoria. It has taken a strong, responsible approach to managing issues associated with coal seam gas. While further work is being undertaken at a Commonwealth and state level to better understand and manage the prospect of coal seam gas development, the state coalition has taken decisive action to protect local communities, including: a hold on approvals to undertake hydraulic fracturing as part of onshore gas exploration; a hold on the issuing of new exploration licences for coal seam gas; and a ban on the use of BTEX chemicals in hydraulic fracturing in Victoria.


This action is in addition to Victoria's already tough regulatory framework that includes Victoria's environmental protection policy under the Environment Protection Act 1970, which does not allow discharge from exploration and mining activities that will pollute groundwater. The Victorian state government is responsibly investigating approaches to ensuring both ongoing gas supplies and energy security with respect to natural gas development. That includes unconventional sources such as tight gas, shale gas and coal seam gas.


While some in the community would like to see the government permanently ban these industries, the state government does not believe that is a responsible approach. Despite the potential economic benefits of unconventional gas, protection of the environment is the state government's first priority. It goes right against the claims of the Greens that somehow state governments are subject to a conflict of interest around the approval of coalmining activities in terms of the state royalties they collect. But the Victorian state government has taken the sensible approach by participating in the national partnership conversation and is looking at what has happened under previous and current governments in Queensland and New South Wales. It is looking at a way to better regulate the development of the coal seam gas industry, and particularly its impact on regional communities. To legislate for all and to regulate all because of the bad behaviour of a few undermines all the potential good that could come from appropriately developed coal seam gas projects.


I would like to briefly mention Labor's record in Victoria. Licences to explore for coal seam gas have existed in Victoria for the last 12 years. It was the former Labor government that granted those exploration licences. Over 70 per cent of the 24 current exploration licences were issued under the former Labor government. Fracking was last approved and undertaken under the former Labor state government in 2009. It is interesting that Senator Cameron is not here spruiking the track record of the New South Wales Labor government on this issue. I look forward to him arriving in the chamber and standing up for the decisions made by the former New South Wales state Labor government with respect to mining development and more specifically to coal seam gas development throughout regional New South Wales. And where are Queensland senators? I am looking—Senator Feeney, Senator Brown, but no Queensland senators from the Labor Party. Senator Waters, I am more than happy if you want to stand up and spruik former Premier Bligh's track record on approvals and assessment of coal seam gas projects in Queensland, but I am guessing you will not be wanting to do that. Correct. Any Queensland Labor senators should head on down. We would love to hear your take on coal seam gas mining project development approvals and assessments in Queensland. 


It is a bit rich that this bill is before us now. The fact is the concerns outlined by Senator Birmingham and the issues canvassed throughout the committee's report are specific to some state governments and that was made very clear in the evidence, but not all state governments—and not even a majority of state governments, just a handful. Here we are legislating in an area where we do not know what the unintended consequences are. There is ambiguity around definitions, which I hope to get to. A number of issues were raised during the inquiry that are not dealt with in the bills or in the amendments before us. Regarding the issues raised, I will touch on three, and they are clarity, overriding state processes and unintended consequences.


Clarity in definitions is important, and it is particularly important when writing laws—because lawyers get paid a lot of money to argue about what various clauses and words mean. The definitions frame and define what and whom is covered by various pieces of legislation. Submitters from both sides of this debate were concerned about the lack of clarity in this bill. The specific classic was what defined 'a water resource' under this legislation. Was it any dry gully? Did it refer to any water resource? Apparently, it did. Tracey Winters had this to say:


But the effect of this bill is to extend water resources—for example, a dry gully, every dry gully in the country, because a watercourse is defined as every watercourse, whether it is flowing or not. So this bill would make every dry gully in the country a matter of national environmental significance. 


Even so, the government's committee report stated that:


It is most unlikely that all dry gullies would be included.


But once it is law, it is law. While Senator Cameron and other senators who support the majority report into this piece of legislation might think that it is enough to put a line in a Senate committee report that it is unlikely that dry gullies would be considered a water resource under this piece of legislation, I would prefer to see that articulated in the bill, because once it is law it is law. I wonder what the perspective of our catchment management authorities, our local farmers and local councils would be if this were the case. I guess we can leave it for the lawyers to sort out.



There was no clarity either around whom is affected. What do large coalminers look like? A lack of transparency continued about how far the trigger should go. Should it cover other industries? I was particularly interested in this aspect. At the moment it only covered coal seam gas and large coalmining industries but it was of particular concern to the National Farmers Federation that this particular trigger could end up covering other types of regional industries. Apparently, according to Mr Knowles from Economists at Large, it should apply to other industries. It absolutely should. In fact, when he was asked to apply this trigger to agriculture, Mr Knowles said he thought it was a 'logical and equitable approach to take'.The whole push behind this is not just for coal seam gas and large coalmining developments but also for any industry's impact on a water resource, however that is defined. Why should the farmers in Western Australia or South Australia or Victoria or Tasmania be subjected to this ambiguity? Because the government needed once again the political support of Windsor and Waters. This was not one of the recommendations of the Hawke review—the massive review of the EPBC Act. It was not there. The experts did not find it there. It was not part of the government's response to the review. So, the government had the opportunity to say: 'You know what? We think we should do this. We think this should be how the EPBC should look.' 


Did the government put it in their response? No, they did not. I may be cynical! The refusal to work with the states and stakeholders towards an agreed national response to the very real challenges that the coal seam gas industry and its development pose for regional communities changed when the politics changed. Waters and Windsor wanted it as a wedge—that is clear—and Burke brought it on.

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2013-05-16,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (16:23):  In speaking on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Bill 2013, I have to say what a lot of politics has been dragged into this whole debate. Yesterday I listened to Senator Waters talking about food security. The Greens do not care about growing food, and their history proves that. Go back to the Native Vegetation Conservation Act—of which Senator Heffernan would be well aware—which the then Premier of New South Wales, now Senator Bob Carr, brought into New South Wales to stop farmers ploughing even country that had not been farmed for 10 years. They could have grown some wheat crops on it. They could have grown more food. New South Wales could have yielded a lot more food to human consumption. But no—the Native Vegetation Conservation Act brought that to a complete stop, and it was driven by the Greens in the New South Wales parliament. Then Premier Bob Carr said his government would be the greenest New South Wales had ever seen. That he was. He cuddled up to the Greens and put all the environmental costs on to the farmers.


It is interesting that it was the then minister, one Kim Yeadon—John Laws used to call him by his full name, Kimberley Maxwell Yeadon—one of Premier Carr's senior staffers, who drove the SEPP 46 and then the Native Vegetation Conservation Act, with no compensation to farmers when they could not grow food, driven by the Greens. And who was one of the chief advisers? One Senator Penny Wong. That is where she came from, in her pre-Senate life. This was a Greens-Labor stooge of a policy to blame those terrible farmers, those 'environmental vandals', as they refer to the farmers—who actually feed everyone in Australia plus millions of other people around the world.


That is what has come into this whole debate, once again: politics. It is not about the environment; it is about politics. We have seen the Greens just recently up at Liverpool Plains, the fly-in fly-out visitors to regional Australia. None of them live out there.




Senator Di Natale:
  I do! Get it right.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  I did not realise—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  You will ignore the interjections, Senator Williams.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  I will ignore the interjections. Put it this way: none of them live up near Liverpool Plains. If Senator Di Natale lives in regional Australia, he would be a rarity in that group, I can assure you. On 25 April, an article in the Namoi Valley Independent said:


Greens leader Senator Christine Milne is questioning why Shenhua Watermark Coal was granted a coal exploration licence on farmland that she believes could be vulnerable to water contamination from mining.


What is amazing is that this delegation led by Senator Milne did not go and visit Shenhua Watermark Coal:


Shenhua Watermark Coal issued a statement yesterday, saying it had not been consulted about the visit or asked to provide a tour of the proposed mine site.


Don't go and look at the facts; let's play politics with the issue. The article said:


It said when the company did invite the delegation to visit, the request was rejected.


Shenhua also said in its statement:


'This is extremely disappointing as our tour would have allowed her to see first hand how the project is avoiding any disturbance on the region’s black soil Liverpool Plains and highly productive acquifers which are used by local farmers … 


Contrary to Ms Milne’s comment, the Watermark Project is actively managing the farms we have acquired and the overall loss of agricultural output will be minimal as a result of mining.'


I have spent all of my life in rural Australia, and being a member of the National Party of New South Wales I know we are the last people who want to see any damage done to the Liverpool Plains or any other farming country in Australia. There is very little of the sort of magnificent country of the Liverpool Plains, about three per cent, on this planet.


This bill is giving more authority to the federal government, but we on this side of the parliament supported the $150 million scientific study. We actually got the amendments through the Rudd government, from this place—despite the bashing we got from some—that said you could not mine coal seam gas in the Namoi Valley until a water study was carried out. It was the coalition that pursued that and, in conjunction with the Labor Party, we achieved that. So they could not move from exploration to mining without a water study being carried out. It was the Labor Party and the coalition that put that in place. The Greens opposed it because they wanted the water study done before exploration. If that were the case, no exploration would ever be done. Let's be fair dinkum here. The four-wheel-drive utes and tractors that people drive around their farms are not made out of tree bark and leaves; they come from mining. That is why mining has served our country well, as has agriculture. Mining represents a finite resource. Agriculture represents a renewable resource that will hopefully go on for as long as mankind lives on this planet.


But the problem is the politicisation of this issue. The Nationals leader, Warren Truss, made it quite clear when he announced our five-point plan for coal seam gas in November 2011. We said:


No coal seam gas development should proceed where it poses a significant impact to the quality of groundwater or surface water systems—


or the environment more generally.


Prime agricultural land … must be protected from activities that destroy its capacity to deliver food security …


We know that some in this place like to just lock it up for national parks. We have seen the record of the Labor Party and the Greens on that. We could go to Toorale Station, Senator Heffernan, couldn't we? Ninety-three thousand hectares of good grazing country and good farming country—with some irrigation—is now a national park. Our coal seam gas policy continued:


Coal seam gas development must not occur close to existing residential areas …


Landowners are entitled to appropriate pecuniary returns for access to their land …


The regions that deliver much of the wealth from coal seam gas developments deserve to see a fair share of the generated revenues reinvested in their communities …


That is what was put out a long time ago and has been stated for a long time now. We have made it quite clear where we stand on this. We must tread with extreme caution. One thing we cannot do in this place is destroy the environment for future generations, especially the land and water needed to grow food. If you do not have healthy soil, you do not grow healthy food. If you do not have healthy food, you do not have healthy humans. It is actually a health issue.

What I said at the time was accurate.


Since that time I have been advised that a letter was sent by the Queensland minister for national parks, Mr Dickson, to my electorate office in Brisbane.

At the end of question time Mr Burke's office advised my office that the proposal had not been received at his post office box, or by fax or email at either his electorate or parliamentary office. 


In the normal course of events, the letter having been sent to my electorate office in Brisbane today, it would have been sent overnight for tomorrow. In view of the fact that I wanted to make sure that the record was accurate I asked for leave to make a statement—in the normal course of events I would have brought it to the attention of the Senate after the next question time but that will not be for some time.

Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria) (16:31):  I move:


That, in order to preserve the integrity of the sporting experience and protect Australian children, the Senate notes the need for law reform, including measures such as:


(a) banning the broadcast advertising of live gambling odds for sports betting;


(b) banning the advertising of sports betting services on television and radio during children’s viewing hours, before 9 pm; and


(c) banning the paid promotion of sports betting services by sporting commentators and their guests during sports broadcasts.


It is fair to say that Australians love sport—it is at the centre of our culture and we are indeed a sporting country. We love to play sport, we love to watch sport. From playing backyard cricket at Mum's to packing the stands of the MCG for the AFL grand final, sport is part of the fabric of our lives. It has played an important role in my own life. I vividly remember as a 10-year-old swimming for the Preston swimming club diving into the ice-cold water of the 50-metre outdoor swimming pool on St Georges Road in Preston each Sunday morning, looking at the stopwatch and trying to beat my personal best time. I remember growing up in Reservoir, in the northern suburbs of Melbourne, and the fierce rivalry of the Dredge St versus Tormey St cricket matches. I remember Dad being confused about the strange game of AFL and wanting his boy to play soccer, and cheering from the sidelines during my stint at the North Reservoir soccer club. I remember coming to love that strange game from the moment, downstairs on a fuzzy black-and-white television, I watched my beloved team, the mighty Tigers, thrash Collingwood in the 1980 grand final. It was a journey that led me to play VFA footy, firstly with Coburg—incidentally under the tutelage of Phil Cleary, a former member of this parliament—and later with the Oakleigh football club.


My football days are over and in my middle age I have discovered other pursuits—the joy of surfing, along with my colleague Senator Whish-Wilson; I cycle when I can; I play a bit of golf; I enjoy the odd game of cricket. When I do roll the arm over it is with the Deans Marsh Swamp Rats who, like many country sporting teams right around regional Australia, are an integral part of the local community. My experience is no different from that of many Australians. It is why we make sport a priority in public policy. The Commonwealth spends over $170 million each year on elite sports through the Australian Institute of Sport, and Australia is famous around the world as a sporting nation. Despite being a small country we are consistently near the top of the Olympic medal tally. Over the years we have been world champions at cricket, we have led the tennis world and we now have an Australian golfing champion in Adam Scott. We have come mighty close to beating the world's best in the game of soccer. 


I understand that some people worry that we are a nation that is too obsessed with sport and that this obsession overshadows more important, more noble pursuits such as the arts and sciences.




Senator Xenophon:
  Sport is noble.




Senator DI NATALE:
  Yes, sport is noble and participation in sport brings many good things, such as the tremendous health benefits of physical activity and learning to work in a team environment and to respect rules and the umpire's final decision. Sport is a great leveller. It does not matter who you are or where you come from, sport brings people together to share in the sheer joy of it. That is not to say that we cannot do better to resource and recognise the great achievements of our artists or our scientists. We can and should do both. After all, it was the Greeks who gave us the marathon and the Olympics along with Aristotle, medicine and the foundations of our modern democracy. 


Because Australians love sport so passionately, it is big business. Our major sporting codes such as Australian rules football and rugby league have billion-dollar television deals. The Collingwood Football Club alone recorded a profit of almost $8 million last year. The huge profits and increasing professionalism of our major sporting codes have their downsides. Personally, I could do without the hype associated with going to a game of football—overseas imports such as home and away jumpers that change each year just to bring in more revenue and breaks in play being filled with a blast of music over loudspeakers. I find it more than a trifle irritating, and sports like AFL are such great tests of strength, athleticism and endurance that they do not need those sorts of embellishments to survive.


There has been another much more important, more insidious and more corrosive change to our major sporting codes in recent years. It is now virtually impossible to watch any major sporting contest in this country without being urged to bet on the outcome either during the advertising breaks or by commentators during the event. Statistics reinforce the size and scope of the problem. Online betting, of which sports betting is a major component, has risen from $2.4 billion in 2007 to almost $10 billion in 2012. It is estimated that billions more are wagered by Australians on unregulated, offshore gambling sites.


Until recently gambling was over there; it was the domain of bookies and horse racing; it was done in pokie venues and casinos. But now it is over here; it is everywhere; it is playing an increasing role in our major codes. Because of the potential for harm, there are serious questions to be answered about just how much we want gambling to be part of sport.


I accept that having a bet is part of Australian culture and betting on sport is an enjoyable activity for many people, but for those who become problem gamblers it can be incredibly destructive. It has become increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to avoid repeated exposure to betting advertisements and gambling odds when watching sport. The number of sports betting ads on free-to-air TV quadrupled in the last two years. In 2012, there were 528 different ads collectively broadcast more than 20,000 times.


There has also been a blurring of the line between commentary and advertising when it comes to gambling. The recent inclusion of a certain ubiquitous bookmaker, who is now appearing on the ground during rugby league coverage, has caused outrage amongst sports fans. Fans of all sports have noticed a growing link between sports and gambling companies. At best, they find it irritating; at worst, they worry about the impact it will have on their kids. This barrage of ads is making parents worried about whether a day at the footy or turning on the rugby is still an appropriate family activity.


   A recent inquiry by the Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform looked into the issue. We heard some disturbing evidence. For instance, researchers who interviewed children found that advertising is working on them. Kids can name two or three sports betting companies, those companies whose advertisements they have seen hundreds of times. I have personally heard from parents who have had children write odds onto their own artwork depicting the footy or quote odds before a match. Let us remember this is a product aimed strictly at adults. But the fact that it is worming its way into the consciousness of children has many people worried, including me. I want my kids to be collecting footy cards, not recounting the odds of their favourite player winning the Brownlow Medal. 


Gambling is not a harmless product. It is fun for some, but problem gambling costs the community dearly. It destroys lives. It leaves kids unfed, it breaks marriages and homes are lost. For a product with this potential for harm there is a very clear role for government to regulate. I do not propose a ban. I think it is perfectly appropriate that an activity that is so popular remains legal. Banning it would just drive it to unregulated markets overseas or to black markets onshore, leaving those sports open to corruption.


On the other hand, not regulating it could lead us down a dangerous road. If we do not act now, gambling will become so enmeshed in sport that we will never again separate the two. That can only have one consequence: more problem gamblers. We have tried self-regulation. Nearly two years ago the government gave an ultimatum to the industry regarding the repetition of live odds during sports: 'Either sort yourselves out and curb the practice or the government will act.' A year later, they reached an agreement and broadcasters have since publicised updates to their codes of conduct. These new codes are comical when compared to the extent of the problem. Promotion can continue as before during scheduled breaks; there will still be live betting odds; and, worse still, there is nothing stopping bookmakers and betting company representatives appearing during commentary sections of the broadcast.


 These codes do not fix the problem. They allow the nexus between televised sport and gambling to continue its current trajectory—more exposure, more linking, more problem gambling, betting becoming an integral part of the game. The scope of the problem and the path we are on raise real potential for harm to children. We are still gathering evidence but it seems obvious that kids for whom gambling has become a normalised part of life are more likely to gamble later in life. That has been the experience of other harmful products such as tobacco. They will gamble and gamble heavily. Problem gambling behaviour is the inevitable result. That is why the time has come for this parliament to step in, to do something to curb this harm.


The motion before the chamber lists several important reforms that will help mitigate this potential harm. They are simple steps. They will not place an undue burden on industry but will start to disentangle gambling from sport. We must stop the brainwashing of children. Children are not the ostensible targets of gambling ads. The industry claims that they are not trying to recruit new customers from among their ranks. So it is right that children be the first priority of new reforms.


One obvious reform to prevent the over-exposure of children to these ads is to limit the times at which they may be broadcast. The loophole that allows gambling ads to be broadcast at any time of the day, so long as they are part of a sports broadcast, must be closed. How would we feel if gambling ads popped up during morning cartoons—next to the ads for Barbie dolls and Coco Pops? We would not accept it. But this is the situation we have now when it comes to the broadcast of live sport. The proposal to ban gambling ads before 9 pm is therefore a sensible one. Adults will still see the ads—the industry can continue to advertise—but the number of children exposed to these ads will be significantly reduced.


The broadcast of live odds is one of the most intrusive ways for sports betting companies to promote their service. It is an inducement to gamble right then and there. As I said before, these numbers are noticed by children, many of whom now think that it is just part of the way the game works. There is no reason we should allow this barrage of numbers to continue. Sports betting companies can tell us to have a punt, but they do not need to be listing the odds to do it. So we should stop this practice completely.


The other important and necessary reform is to end so-called 'cash for comment'. The development that has generated the most outrage with sports fans is the inclusion of bookies as part of the editorial team. It must be a lucrative business, because the reaction of fans to the appearance of Tom Waterhouse on the rugby league broadcast was astonishing, It unleashed a torrent of fury. The goodwill this has cost the broadcasters and the sporting code is enormous. Many people have expressed their outrage to me personally and the social media light up any time this happens. 


The broadcasters have contended that, by changing the logo on Tom Waterhouse's microphone, the distinction between commentator and sponsor is now crystal clear. But, for a young kid watching a game of footy, Tom Waterhouse the bookmaker is no different from Tom Waterhouse the commentator. When I saw a photograph of Mr Waterhouse signing kids' jerseys after a match, I have to say that was the last straw. The intent of the code is to separate commentary from betting—to separate the commentators from the bookmakers. But children are not equipped to make that distinction. How could they if that sort of sporting broadcast is all they have ever known? It comes on top of the constant repetition of sports betting brand names at every opportune moment in the commentary. We have to stop this practice and we have to start talking about the sport instead of the betting. 


The time has come for this parliament to take action. We can very easily legislate to stop this bombardment of betting odds. We can very easily legislate to close the loophole that lets ads run when kids are most likely to be watching. We need to turn sport back over to the experts, to the sports tragics and to the fans and not give it over to the bookmakers and the spruikers. 


We are at a crossroad when it comes to sport. If we do not act now, a trip to the footy ground will soon be like a trip to the racetrack. We have the opportunity to take action. These are simple reforms, they are necessary reforms and they are popular reforms. With the stroke of a pen, we can let the sport do the talking and not the bookmakers. By passing legislation to implement these reforms, the parliament would be setting us back on the path to preserving the sports we love.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2013-05-16,"



Senator STEPHENS
 (New South Wales) (16:48):  I congratulate and thank Senator Di Natale for bringing this issue before the Senate. I share his concern about the extent to which the broadcast of live odds for sports betting is becoming an insidious practice. It drives me demented during sports broadcasts, especially during free-to-air television programs on a Sunday afternoon when I am trying to watch my footy team. I totally agree that it is a practice which intrudes on the fun that comes from sitting down with your family and supporting your local team. It certainly takes the notion of betting on two flies on a wall to a whole new level. That is what wagering used to be about, but now it has become a multibillion-dollar global industry that many people cannot resist. It is irritating in the extreme to be constantly bombarded by ads which actively encourage people to bet online or to use their smartphones. As such, it is a practice that I absolutely discourage.


It also worries me that the broadcast of live odds for sports betting is a honey pot for those who want to exploit athletes or animals or encourage match fixing. Seriously, what does it mean when someone can get live odds on whether the third conversion attempt will be unsuccessful? It is a big temptation for criminals and creates a risk that sporting codes have to get their heads around. Some codes have been dealing with these things for years—fighters taking a dive in the third round, soccer players feigning injury or horses being drenched, as we saw last week in Tamworth. We all recognise how easy it is to exploit such things through dodgy real-time gambling options.


Senator's Di Natale's motion seeks to ban the broadcast of all live odds for sports betting, ban gambling advertising before 9 pm and ban promotion of gambling by commentators during sports broadcasts. But, unfortunately, Senator Di Natale's motion is trying to shut the gate after the horse has bolted, if you will pardon my pun. Parliament and all levels of government have expressed concern to the broadcasting industry, which has finally acknowledged the level of community concern about the promotion of live odds during sporting broadcasts and has agreed to amend their codes of practice. 


I think the broadcasting industry has been shamed into action to claw back the leeway it has given to sports betting agencies and to adopt what we have seen in America and some European countries for years. The industry now wants to demonstrate that it can respond through voluntary codes of practice and has agreed that there will be no promotion of live odds by commentators at any time during sports broadcasts 


There will be no advertising of live odds during play, with clearly identified ads restricted to scheduled breaks in play such as half-time. Let us see if this is enough to curb the blatant behaviour of sports-betting promoters.


While the broadcasting industry has agreed to this action, I think that the role of government is to acknowledge how gambling is pervasive in our society and to try to address the issue of problem gambling in a more holistic way. In the Monthly magazine, back in 2011, Jonathan Horn wrote:


Neil Evans is the public face of Centrebet. His organisation will accept a bet on pretty much anything. Their federal-election markets garner such coverage that Evans is occasionally referred to as a ‘political analyst’. Centrebet has released markets on the national unemployment rate, the colour of Queen Elizabeth’s hat at her grandson’s wedding, and the World Sauna Championships held in Finland. On the flip side, their plan to offer betting on the permutations of the Australian stock exchange was recently rejected by ASIC.


Thank heavens for that, I would suggest. The article continues:


In March 2008, with James Packer’s Crown Limited bankrolling it, Betfair won a unanimous High Court decision which deemed it unconstitutional to prohibit bookmakers from advertising in one state and operating in another. Suddenly there were no state boundaries, the shackles were off and the land grab was on. “It was the most important thing to happen in 150 years of bookmaking in Australia,” says Betstar’s Alan Eskander. “It kick-started the life-cycle of our industry.”


…   …   …


Their market was voracious, if untapped. Australians are the most fearless gamblers in the world. A recent report in the Economist indicated that, on average, every adult Australian loses just under $1300 per year. As a nation, we drop $22 billion per year on the punt, nearly five times what we spend on foreign aid. “Australians love it,” Eskander says. “It’s how we’ve been brought up, it’s part of our culture, part of our folklore.”


In many respects, of course, Mr Eskander is right. We love two-up. Generations of Australians bet on the Melbourne Cup. We take lottery tickets. But what has happened since 2011 has taken betting to a whole new level.


So what are our responsibilities as legislators? Do we seek to legislate for good behaviour? Do we seek to regulate the industry? Do we seek to ban gambling, driving it underground and back to the good old days of SP bookmakers? Technology will beat us every time if that is the approach we take. We are not a nanny state. We expect people to be responsible for their actions and we acknowledge too that, for people who develop a gambling addiction, we need to take action and provide support. But the sporting bodies, the broadcasters and the gambling industry have an important role to play to ensure our sports do not become swamped with gambling messages, to the point where sport and gambling are seen as one and the same. Just like Senator Di Natale, I have had many, many people contact me about that blurred boundary. No-one wants the conflation of gambling and sport—not the sports, not the Australian government and certainly not the community, which is making it clear that enough is enough. The government is acting to ensure that something is done about it, working with the broadcasters on amendments to the broadcasting industry coregulatory codes of practice, which are enforced by ACMA.


On 22 June last year, Minister Conroy announced that the government and the commercial and subscription broadcasters had reached an agreement on reducing and controlling the promotion of live betting odds during sports broadcasts, and state and territory governments had committed to looking at the steps they can take to limit promotion of live odds at sporting grounds, such as on scoreboards or by ground announcers. The amendments to the code which have been developed between industry and the government will prohibit commentators from promoting any live odds at all during a broadcast and 30 minutes before or after the match begins and ends. They will restrict the promotion of odds to scheduled breaks in play such as half-time during the rugby or quarter-time in the AFL or at the end of a set of tennis. That means there will be no promotion of live odds when the match is actually in play. The amendments will also provide that the promotion of odds during a scheduled break in the play must be by a clearly distinguishable gambling representative. The proposed amendments to the code were released for public consultation on Monday, 22 April, for a four-week period, so I encourage anyone who has concerns about this to visit the websites of Free TV and ASTRA to have their voices heard, loud and clear.


Since the agreement between the government and the broadcasters last year establishing these principles, broadcasters have largely abided by them, even though the amended codes are not yet in place. That was until, as Senator Di Natale rightly tells us, the Tom Waterhouse advertisements and activities hit our screens with a vengeance this year. When Mr Waterhouse appeared in the first round of the NRL on Nine, I was dumbfounded. This was a step too far, in my view and, from the reaction everywhere else, in the view of most Australians. In his first-round NRL appearance, Waterhouse appeared to be a part of the commentary team and sat on the panel with the other commentators, providing comments on the game itself as well as promoting live odds, and he did not have any visible signs that he was representing Tomwaterhouse.com.


In March the NRL admitted to the Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform that 'the lines were a little blurred' in that incident. A little blurred indeed! The NRL's General Manager of Strategic Projects, Mr Mattiske, conceded that it was hard to tell whether or not Mr Waterhouse was part of the commentary team, and he said changes had now been made. He said:


… it is plain that, in the first round of the competition, the lines were a little blurred. 


But:


… now… there is a very clear distinction between the commentary team and the promotion of sports betting.


Another witness to the inquiry said that Mr Waterhouse:


… now appears alone. There is a Tom Waterhouse microphone and big logo on the screen saying that he's an online bookmaker. … There is a significant change in the format of that.


I wonder if that is going to be enough. The broadcasting industry and the sports industry are very keen to try to take further action to amend the code and to try to use a mandatory process to do that. The government, I think, are taking this view: to give credit where it is due, where the industry has said it is going to take action we will wait and see how these codes work before we consider to rush to legislate. There could be a role, too, for state and territory governments to place similar restrictions on other forms of advertising within their jurisdictions—as I said before, such as the promotion of live odds at the sporting grounds or during sporting events. 


But it should be even easier for the public to find information about that code of conduct. For example, it could be advertised on TV channels during the sports broadcasts and, while it is important that the public has an adequate opportunity to comment on the code, it is also important to make sure that those comments, and any expressions of concern, are not simply recorded but are actually addressed—that action is taken or change is made to the code to address community concern.


I go back to Senator Di Natale's question: can a 12-year-old distinguish between a sports commentator and Tom Waterhouse talking about the game? I do not think that many young kids can, and I would like to see that—as Mr Mattiske said, in answer to a question asked of him by Senator Xenophon about whether there was a conflict of interest in brokering a deal with Mr Waterhouse while at the same time trying to regulate sports gambling—'The integrity of the competition is our utmost priority. We would not allow any arrangements to threaten that.'


In fact, what we do know is that that activity by Mr Waterhouse would have been a breach of two of the restrictions in the code once it was implemented: the restriction on commentators and their guests promoting live odds; and the requirement for live odds to be promoted, when permitted, by a clearly distinguishable representative of a gambling organisation. As Minister Conroy said to the industry in 2011: lift your game; we are going to take action on this. And the broadcasters and the sports, to their credit, have responded to that. So what we want to see—and these are the changes to the codes that have been proposed and are being consulted on right now—is that commentators spruiking live odds, or gambling advertisements displaying the odds on television of who will kick the next goal after the last one was scored, cannot creep back into sports broadcasts.


It is an insidious change to the way in which we all think about community sports in Australia. It is an insidious and insulting change. It is one that I think threatens the way in which Australians react to their community sports and it is something that the government is very keen to ensure is eliminated. But we do not support the notion of actually legislating this ban.


Senator Di Natale's proposal, which goes to the issue of banning the advertising of sports betting services on television and radio during children's viewing hours before 9 pm, does actually go to prime-time television sports broadcasts, and therefore is something that we cannot support. We will watch and wait and ensure that the voluntary codes that are being proposed and entered into by the broadcasting industry are actually activated and that they are effective.

"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2013-05-16,"



Senator HUMPHRIES
 (Australian Capital Territory) (17:03):  I want to make a brief contribution to this debate, in the light of the fact that other senators wish to also speak. I want to make the point that the coalition shares some of the concerns that Senator Di Natale has placed on the table about the pervasiveness and effect of gambling, particularly sports betting, on Australian society. We acknowledge that there is a proportion of the community which will be susceptible to messages about gambling which will lead them to make decisions unhealthy for themselves and their families. As a community, we need to be cognisant of that harm, we need to be able to develop a response to that harm and we need to constructively change the environment in which that harm occurs so as to minimise the likelihood that people are placed in that position.


Having said that, like Senator Stephens, who has spoken in this debate already, we share a sense of concern at the response exhibited in this motion by the Greens to simply regulate this area in order to be able to solve this problem. It seems to be the case with the Australian Greens that there is no social problem too big or too small that is not capable of being remedied or cured with a healthy dose of regulation.


We acknowledge that sometimes some regulation is necessary, but we take the view that the case needs to be made, based on evidence, for that to occur. With great respect, Senator Di Natale in this debate has not demonstrated that case. He has pointed to a number of attempts that have been made in the Australian community to rectify these problems, but he is happy to dismiss those as being ineffective, even though—for example, in the case of the gambling industry's own attempts at self-regulation, only recently beefed up—the evidence is not yet available as to whether that is an effective means of dealing with these problems.


The Greens, I think it is fair to say, from the very outset of this debate have supported and promoted regulation as almost the first line of defence or the first line of attack in this area, and they are prepared to ensure that that agenda is prosecuted, notwithstanding the lack of evidence that it may be the solution to these problems. I say this as a representative of a party which has a proud record of action in the area of regulating, if necessary, to prevent social harm. Indeed, it was the Howard government which first regulated the effect of the operation of online gambling on Australian society. Indeed, when it made those decisions to regulate online gambling, it was the first government in the world to regulate online gambling—to the extent that that is possible. I believe it is appropriate for us to consider steps like that, based on evidence—not based on an impulse to want to impose rules on communities that otherwise may be able to find solutions to problems that afflict them and their customers.


Only a little over a year ago the coalition released a discussion paper on gambling reform, which made a number of important suggestions about ways of improving the response to harm in the Australian community relating to gambling. One of those suggestions was to do with restricting access to live betting odds—action which has, of course, since been taken up by the industry through self-regulation. Senator Di Natale, in his remarks, I think somewhat underplayed the extent to which the industry itself has been prepared to pick up these issues and address them through a self-regulatory approach, backed by ACMA, the communications agency, to make sure that there is an effective means of protecting the Australian community.


In the course of his remarks, Senator Di Natale made the point that a licensed person can come on air, during a live-broadcast game, and announce odds. Senator Di Natale would perhaps not be aware that the recent draft code of practice that has been developed by the industry—by the industry, not by government—has made it very clear that that cannot occur. The code allows for licensed people to make announcements about betting odds before a game, or during scheduled breaks, but not while a game is in play. That, again, is an initiative of the industry itself.


Senator Di Natale's motion makes reference to the need to ensure that we ban 'the paid promotion of sports betting services by sporting commentators and their guests during sports broadcasts'. He may also not be aware that the code makes it clear that the commentators cannot make such comments.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  They can! Have you watched the Footy Show?




Senator HUMPHRIES:
  You will have your chance to wrap up this debate later on. 




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Cameron
):  Order! Senator Humphries, don't engage across the chamber; just ignore the interjections.




Senator HUMPHRIES:
  I will do my very best, Mr Acting Deputy President. So the very issues that Senator Di Natale raises in his motion are in fact being addressed by the Australian sports betting industry. And so it should, because this industry depends upon a measure of goodwill by the Australian community, by the punters who participate in these services, and I believe they want to play in a way which gives people a sense that they are honourable and decent players in a marketplace. I would submit that it is in their interests that they provide for that kind of self-regulation where appropriate, and I believe that is what they are attempting to do.


I note that the draft code of practice, which I referred to a moment ago, is presently out for public comment. The opportunity for public comment closes on 21 May—next week. Once a code of practice through that process is determined then it has to be registered by ACMA. So, again, it is an initiative of the industry but it has the backing of Australia's media regulator—and that is an appropriate arrangement.


Senator Di Natale made reference in his speech to the corrosive effect of sports betting and advertising of sports betting odds to children. I would agree with him that we need to take special care to ensure that children are not adversely impacted by such advertising. But, again, I think we need to be careful not to exaggerate the effect of that kind of phenomenon. Information presented to the recent inquiry into gambling reform by Free TV suggested that children aged between five and 17 made up less than 12 per cent of the total viewing audience of any of the top-10 sporting events in 2012, excluding the Olympic broadcasts. Of those children who were watching, the majority were co-viewing with an adult—around eight in 10 in the five-to-12 age group—so there is an opportunity there for parental guidance of children who might see that kind of advertising.


ASTRA, representing the pay-TV industry, in its own submission to that inquiry said that, on the basis of evidence they were able to produce, children under 18 comprised a very small proportion of the audience for live sporting events on subscription TV. They said  that, of the 50 most-watched live sports broadcasts shown on STV in 2012, children under 18 comprised just 11.3 per cent of the total combined audience for those broadcasts, with less than one-third of those—or 2.3 per cent of the total audience—being children under 18 watching without an adult present.


Now, I accept that that still represents a large number of children who may be exposed to this kind of harm but, as is always the case, it is important to make sure that we do not deal with the problem in a disproportionate way. The restriction on the freedom to impart information to people able to maturely and carefully accept and use that information is a right that people have—one we should be very careful to withdraw merely because we have identified that some people may suffer some harm from that fact.


The coalition, as I have said, has demonstrated a concern about this by putting together a discussion paper from its working party. The working group on coalition reform has that information available online, and I suggest that those people who are looking for some innovative approaches look at that report. We welcome recent moves by the commercial television and radio industries, and the subscription television industry, to address community concerns regarding live odds in sports through a revised code of practice which prohibits the promotion of live odds while a sporting event is in play. The code deserves to be considered by the public, and for comment to be made and considered, before a final version of the code is promulgated.


We take concerns about the promotion of live sports odds very seriously. We are concerned about making sure that children are protected, but we also believe it is important not to rush to conclusions. With the greatest of respect, the motion that Senator Di Natale has put forward today does rush to a conclusion before all the evidence is available. The coalition would not support the motion which is before the Senate tonight.

",Senate,<title>MOTIONS</title>,<title>Gambling</title>,MOTIONS,25,1
"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2013-05-16,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (17:15):  I will speak only for a short period of time tonight because I respect that there is a large list of speakers who are very passionate about this issue and would like to talk on it tonight. It is interesting—Senator Stephens talked about Australian culture, and there is no doubt that having a punt and having a bet is synonymous with Australian culture. Probably the best book I have ever read on Australian culture, and possibly one of the best books ever written in this country, is Cloudstreet,by Tim Winton. Just about everyone in this chamber has probably read it. I certainly hope they have. It is a fascinating book. It is a juxtaposition of two families—the Lambs family and the Pickles family. Sam Pickles, a man who loses his hand, is a really interesting character to follow in the book. Essentially his life is a constant struggle against a gambling addiction. It is fascinating to read about his gambling addiction. It is an addiction which so many Australians suffer from, and it is quite easy to understand why.


It suggests that a person will only get control over their gambling when they have started to make progress in working on the big worries in their lives, such as boredom, failure et cetera. It also suggests that a lot of Australians have strong values of not giving up easily and not quitting when the going gets tough and also have very strong competitive drives. These factors tend to work against problem gamblers, leading them to keep going until all their money is gone. The interesting thing about Cloudstreet is that what Sam Pickles used to look forward to was when the races occurred. That stimulus was what he required in his life. We know it is the same with the pokies. The stimulus that drives the problem of addiction to pokies is the noise, the flashing lights and so on.


The stimulus is obvious when you think about online gambling, but the next phase is to see gambling on television, in an area of content that Australians love and are totally attached to, including children, which is sports games. Why are we so fascinated with sport? It is a big part of our culture. Most of us grow up playing sport. If you have an addiction then it is quite obvious that while you are watching sports games it is going to be very hard to get away from that addiction and that stimulus is going to be in front of you the whole time.


I have discovered a couple of interesting things about sports gambling which suggest that it is possibly going to be an even more pervasive problem than other types of gambling, such as casino gambling. There was a really good article recently in LiveScience by Professor Ghose. He talks about a large study done by Tel Aviv University in Israel, and quotes from a statement by a study co-author:


""Sports gamblers seem to believe themselves the cleverest of all gamblers. They think that with experience and knowledge—such as player's statistics, manager's habits, weather conditions and stadium capacity—they can predict the outcomes of a game better than the average person,""


He goes on to explain a very large study that he did in the UK around soccer. In the end he came to some startling conclusions:


""Casino gamblers are more appropriately characterised as obsessives, because they have less belief in themselves, and know that they will lose sooner or later. But they gamble anyway because they feel they need to,"" Dannon said.


By contrast, sports gamblers may need tailored cognitive therapy that rids them of the belief that they have more control over the outcome than they really do. 


I was interested in that conclusion, so I went looking for real-life examples of severe problem addiction with sports gambling.


Probably the best story that I read was an article from the Roar, 'How sports gambling cost me love'. It was by Hayley Byrnes, who was married to a rugby league player. She talks about the culture within sport of sports players being addicted to sports gambling. She said:


I personally have spent the darkest of hours with a sports gambling addict. Without delving into too much personal detail out of respect to this person, I can however say that for over four years I battled weekly with a live in boyfriend’s gambling addiction.In the end we both lost.


… … …


It wasn't until one night in bed after a few weeks of living together with my partner that I started to have any indication there could be trouble in paradise. As we lay in bed, he sat up next to me, eyes fixed on the laptop.


""What are you doing on that so late?"" I mumbled.


""Oh just watching a tennis bet,"" he replied. 3am rolled around and he was still up, eyes glued to that screen watching live tennis scores like a heroin addict waiting for his next delivery.


The article goes on to say that eventually this couple did seek therapy. In that therapy, after not talking for the first two therapy sessions, her partner talked about the very first time that he gambled:


… as a 16-year-old kid he was led into the TAB by fellow teammates, unbeknownst to him at the time that one bet would cost him his football career, friendships and his first love.


It was a very compelling story about real lives.


I think Senator Humphries said gambling causes 'some' harm. I think even single individuals and single lives being ruined by gambling addiction is a lot of harm. There is plenty of evidence to show that there is more than some harm in our community. The risks are very real that we might see gambling addiction normalised, especially if we see it in sports advertising, which kids can watch. I want to use the word 'stimulus' again, because that is what we know drives, or certainly helps facilitate, gambling addiction. On television at quarter time, at half-time, after the game and of course before the game, there is the temptation, the stimulus, to get people interested in laying a bet, in gambling. I do not have the compulsion myself, and I know lots of people who have healthy habits in terms of laying bets. But addiction, whether it is gambling, alcohol or heroin, is all the same. It is a physiological problem that is very difficult for people to combat and it takes a lot of effort to overcome.


We talk about the need for regulation. It is my understanding that the voluntary code on odds has been in place now for a couple of months and—let's make this very clear—it has been complied with. We recognise that, but the problem is still there. Nothing has changed. The advertising is still there and the odds are still there. Online betting has risen from $2.4 billion spent in 2007 to almost $10 billion in 2012. In 2012, 528 individual ads were put forward which were collectively broadcast more than 20,000 times. This is big money. The TV rights for AFL is big money—it is huge money. Why do TV companies pay big money? It is obvious: they want eyeballs on the screen. What comes with eyeballs? Ratings. What comes with ratings? Advertising spend. This is all about how TV broadcasters can get advertising spend. It is obvious that, when there is a new, developing market out there—online gambling and sports gambling especially—tied directly to individual sports programs, it is going to be a big market and there is going to be lots of money in it.


My experience with large profits being available to both broadcasters and betting companies is that it spells trouble in terms of regulation, particularly self-regulation. Even the Liberal Party, who understand free-market economics, must recognise that there is a role for government to play when markets fail. One way we classically talk about market failure is when there are costs associated with a particular business activity. The costs associated with gambling are severe in lots of different areas when it comes to its impact on our community. We have looked at it right across the board. Where we see these costs associated with a productive activity, in this case a service, the government has a role to make sure those costs are minimised or those companies pay for those costs.


That is certainly not the Greens' understanding of the system at present, and that is why this motion has been moved by Senator Di Natale—to take very strong action and to not rely on a voluntary code that we do not believe has worked. It is time for regulation. We believe banning all live sporting odds is very important. We also believe that advertising should occur after 9 pm, when we know most children will not be watching advertising. We want to avoid this problem being normalised. We certainly want to see a ban on cash for comment, which, once again, to use Senator Stephens's comment, blurs the lines between what is sport and what is gambling. That is something we certainly cannot afford to introduce into our culture in this country.

"Furner, Sen Mark",ALP,2013-05-16,"



Senator FURNER
 (Queensland) (17:25):  I rise this evening also to speak on this notice of motion on sports betting reform. In his introduction, Senator Di Natale hit the nail on the head when he said that Australians love sport. That is pretty well right—we love our sport. What goes with sport in Australia? Australians love a flutter. They love a bet. You know, Mr Acting Deputy President, that in the next couple of weeks the greatest game of all, the State of Origin, will be played between New South Wales and that great state of Queensland.




Senator Mason:
  And we'll win again, won't we, Mark!




Senator FURNER:
  We will win again—I will take that interjection! Every year I have a bit of a flutter. I have a flutter with some of my friends in the chamber here—




Senator Polley:
  You have friends?




Senator FURNER:
  I do have some friends—as well as some of the people who work around this place and some of my staff, because it is in the nature of Australians to have a harmless flutter. But what has been raised tonight is correct: the addictions need to be recognised, when people take their gambling habits way too far. Both the Greens senators and Senator Stephens, I think, earlier indicated the problem with gambling in this country. Problem gamblers lose on average $21,000 a year. You would wonder how they can survive in their households or their communities with those sorts of losses in a year. That is why this government is acting decisively on this issue.


The government is taking action to reduce the promotion of live odds during sports coverage. Working with the broadcasting industry, we have proposed amendments to their codes of practice. Under those principles agreed between industry and the government, there will not be promotion of live odds by commentators at any time during a sports broadcast. That is what is being proposed, will be implemented and, I am convinced, will be successful in addressing this issue with live odds during sports coverage. There will also be no advertising of live odds during play, with clearly identified ads restricted to scheduled breaks in play, such as half-time. The government preference generally is for action to be taken through the co-regulatory framework to broadcasting regulation. For now, the government will evaluate the effectiveness of measures proposed by the broadcasting industry before considering any further action such as legislation in this space. For this reason, we do not support the Greens' motion at this time.


The government recognises that problem gambling and the relationship between sport and gambling is a serious issue. We have acted and we continue to act across a range of portfolios to address this issue. We understand the concerns in the community that Senator Di Natale proposes to address and has raised here this evening. Sporting bodies, broadcasters and the gambling industry all have an important role to play to ensure our sports do not become swamped with gambling messages to the point where sport and gambling are seen as one and the same. No-one wants that—not the community, not the sports and not the Australian government. So, once again, under the principles agreed between industry and the government, there will be no promotion of live odds by commentators at any time during a sports broadcast.


More broadly, this government has legislated to reform poker machine regulation. As we know, the legislation requires precommitment technology to be available on every one of Australia's 200,000 poker machines, introduces a voluntary precommitment system to help players set limits and keep track of their spending, and introduces a maximum daily withdrawal limit of $250 on ATMs in gaming venues. The government's minister, Senator Conroy, in March of 2013 responded to the review of the act that governs online gambling: the Interactive Gambling Act 2001. He has committed to the development of a national standard for harm minimisation and consumer protection for online gambling. He is working with the states and territories on a harmonised approach to regulating in this space.


Government has acted to stamp out match-fixing in sport. In 2011, the Gillard government reached an agreement with states and territories to introduce a national policy on match-fixing in sports. The government recognises that problem gambling is a serious issue, which is why we support responsible advertising by broadcasters and industry. That is why we have taken action to ensure that the promotion of live odds in sports broadcasts is reduced and controlled. The promotion of live odds during sporting events is unacceptable. The Commonwealth government has taken action to reduce and control the promotion of live betting odds during sport coverage.


The federal government has worked with the broadcasters on amendments to the broadcasting industry co-regulatory codes of practice, which are enforced by the ACMA. On 29 June 2012, the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy announced that the Australian government had secured an agreement with commercial and subscription broadcasters to reduce and control the promotion of live betting odds during sports broadcasts. State and territory governments have also committed to look at the steps. They could take on a limited promotion of live odds on sporting grounds, such as on scoreboards or by ground announcers. People do not want odds shoved in their face when watching sport, and that is where these new restrictions address this issue.


This agreement, which was struck last year, forms the basis upon which the broadcasters have promised amendments to their codes of practice. Looking at how the proposed amendments restrict the promotion of live odds, the amendments to the code will prohibit commentators from promoting any live odds at all during the broadcast and 30 minutes before and after the match begins and ends. It will restrict the promotion of odds to scheduled breaks that are played during a sporting event, such as: half-time at the rugby, quarter-time at the AFL or at the end of a set in tennis. This means there will be no promotion of live odds when the match is actually in play. That is the last thing I want to see during a State of Origin match. It will also provide the promotion of odds during a scheduled break in play, where it will be clearly distinguished by gaming representatives.


Since the agreement between the government and the broadcasters in June last year that established these principles, broadcasters have largely abided by them—although the amended codes are not yet in place, with the exception of the Tom Waterhouse incidents. The amendments to the codes have been proposed by the broadcasters and were released for public consultation on Monday, 28 April for a period of four weeks. We encourage interested members of the public to go to the websites of the peak bodies for broadcasting Free TV, ASTRA and pay TV to find out more. If people choose, they can make a written submission to express their views on the proposed amendments. The amendments will then be submitted to the ACMA and, if approved, will be registered and enforced by the regulator.


The radio industry, through Commercial Radio Australia, publicly released its proposed amendments for comment in December last year. The consultation window for CRA's amendments has now closed. So the government's preference, in general, is for action to be taken through a co-regulatory framework for broadcasting regulation.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2013-05-16,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (17:33):  I am grateful to Senator Back for giving me this opportunity to speak. I promise to keep it down to eight minutes; I will do my very best to keep it within eight minutes. I support Senator Di Natale's motion and congratulate him for bringing it on. This proposal, in the bill that he has introduced recently, mirrors many of the proposals that I put in a bill that I introduced in this chamber in June 2011—the more, the merrier. To me, it will be a great day when we have a bill from either the coalition or the government, or both, mirroring what Senator Di Natale is trying to do and what I have been trying to do. It is because enough is enough: we have gone too far in relation to this.


This is a very serious issue. I refer members to the evidence given by Associate Professor Samantha Thomas, from the University of Wollongong. She is an expert researcher, who has researched the impact of this sort of pernicious, insidious gambling advertising on children. Her studies and surveys are extensive. In a snapshot: parents are concerned that kids are talking about the odds and not the games. There is an increase of embedded memories, if you like, of advertising, where kids remember it. That is very disturbing. That kids are able to recall the brand name of gambling companies—children who are six, eight, 10 or 12 years old—is very disturbing.


We also have a situation with young men, where odds talk is being embedded into conversations as part of the culture. Young men feel pressured into gambling because of this pernicious advertising. Gambling is now part of the peer group: if they do not participate in it, they are not part of that group. That is sickening. Let us clear this up once and for all—and perhaps Senator Di Natale will have an opportunity to sum up the debate: the new whiz-bang proposed code, which is being proposed now, still allows for advertising before the game, of odds being spruiked before the game and at quarter-time, half-time, three-quarter time and after the game. It just stops those live odds. It is better than nothing—it is better than a kick in the head—but it does not deal with the issue, which is that we are being bombarded with gambling advertising. You will still be able to see the ads for the various gambling companies—Sportsbet, Sportingbet, Tom Waterhouse or whomever—during a game. Kids can see that as well.


That is very, very important. We must tackle this. What I proposed back in 2011, and what Senator Di Natale is proposing now, is not extra regulation, as Senator Humphries has characterised it. It is about closing a loophole. Currently, under the Commercial Television Code of Practice, the situation is that you cannot have gambling advertising during G-rated periods, but there is an exemption for news, current affairs and sporting programs. It is for sporting programs where the greatest impact is felt. This is about closing a loophole. You should not have the odds being broadcast and you should not have gambling advertising during G-rated periods. This is the fundamental issue.


There is an inquiry about this. It is public knowledge that there is an attempt to get Tom Waterhouse to appear before the inquiry. I cannot comment to say anything other than that, but I would welcome him appearing. I would like to take a moment or two to quote what former Wallabies great, author and commentator Peter FitzSimons said in his column on 24 April in the Sydney Morning Herald. It is headed 'Waterhouse's submission is a joke that's not funny'. I will just quote a few paragraphs from that. It starts off with Mr FitzSimons saying:


Bring it in tight, Tom Waterhouse. Yes, yes, yes, it is me again, and no, I don't have particularly hard feelings because you're suing me for defamation at the moment. Nothing personal, what?


Nevertheless, because of that legal action, I have of course tried to temper my remarks when it comes to your statement to the joint select committee on gambling reform on Tuesday, where you robustly defended your ubiquitous presence on sports broadcasts across Australia, asserting your right to flog your sports betting operation as you please.


So let me, as delicately as I can muster, as carefully as possible, choose my words delicately ... with malice towards none ... with charity to all:


If you wrote the statement to the select committee, give yourself an uppercut. If someone wrote it for you, pretend you're Mark Bouris on Celebrity Apprentice and say loudly: ""You're fired.""


In that statement, you say you have, ""No intention of targeting children through our advertising ...""


What are the kids then? Collateral damage? Whether or not the kids are specifically ""targeted"" by your company is hardly the point? The point is that they ARE hit, regardless. The point is that while the government has the brains to have a ban on gambling advertising on programs children are likely to be watching, there remains the ludicrous exception of sport, which millions of Australian kids watch for hours on end!


The point is that because of this exposure gambling chat in the playground is now endemic, and many young Australians think that gambling is glamorous instead of the brain-dead loser pursuit it actually is. So you didn't specifically target them? So what?The outcome is equally devastating—a time-bomb that will go off when they have more than their lunch money to lose.


I congratulate Peter FitzSimons for those comments which reflect the overwhelming opinion out there in the community.


I spoke to Peter FitzSimons about his columns. He gets overwhelmed by the number of comments and people writing in to him or tweeting him. There is a strong, visceral community reaction to this. There is a revulsion about the way the odds are being rammed down our throats. When six-, eight- and 10-year-olds are talking to their parents in their homes about the odds and not about the game then you know we have gone too far. That is why we need to ban gambling advertising during G-rated periods.


I note what has been said about overregulation. But in May of last year I did a joint press conference with the opposition leader, Tony Abbott. I was very happy to do that joint press conference with him on the issue of online gambling. Statements that the opposition leader made about how we have gone too far were a very pleasing development. I disagree with the opposition leader on his stance on poker machine reform, but we have a lot of common ground in terms of online gambling. I do not think that what this motion is about, what my bill in 2011 was about or what Senator Di Natale's recently introduced bill was about is that far away from the comments of the opposition leader. The opposition leader's comments are very much in line with overwhelming community opinion.


We have had enough. Leave kids alone, for goodness' sakes. We have a ban on G-rated programs having gambling advertising, but there is an exemption for sporting programs. Let us close that exemption down. If the opposition and the government will not come on board, that is fine because I will make sure right up until 14 September, election day, that this is an issue. I will thank you both for giving me an issue to fight the election on. But I would rather it not be an issue. I would rather there be some unanimity in this chamber to reflect the overwhelming community opinion that we need to do something about what has become an insidious activity that is damaging our kids. Give us a break. Let's support a ban on gambling advertising and on the odds being pushed down our throats so that we can protect our kids.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2013-05-16,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (17:41):  I appreciate the opportunity to comment on the motion put by Senator Di Natale. I have listened very carefully to the comments around the chamber. There is absolutely no difficulty. There is a unanimous view from everybody that we do not want to see a circumstance in which children are placed at risk.


However, recognition has not been given, in my view, by Senator Di Natale or Senator Xenophon to the voluntary action by those who actually produce and present this type of material. I speak, of course, of the draft code of practice regarding the promotion of live odds in sports coverage. We have a circumstance in which that document is out for public comment at this very moment. I do not know how many comments there have been, but I understand that it closes for comment on 21 May, which is only the beginning of next week. So we should have information very, very quickly as to what the reaction of the public is to the voluntary code that has been put into place by those, both from Free TV and subscription television, who actually present sports broadcasting to the Australian community.


I would just like to reflect for a moment on what the size of the audience is—the size of the audience of children under the age of 18. This was advice presented to the Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform this year by those two groups—Free TV and ASTRA. The Free TV figures are that around 12 per cent of the audience at home watching TV are between the ages of five and 17, with the balance being adults. Interestingly enough, between 70 per cent and 80 per cent of those children under the age of 17 are in the company of adults. The figures presented by the other organisation, ASTRA, were very similar.


Gambling is something which I am not associated with. I was involved in the horseracing industry for many, many years as a veterinary surgeon. Senator Mason would be interested to know that very early in my career an old fellow said to me, 'Chris, the only way you will make money following horses is with a broom and shovel.' I took that on board and I believed it, and I am very happy to say that neither my wife and I nor any member of our family is afflicted.




Senator Mason interjecting—





Senator BACK:
  I went into politics, but it took me some years, Senator Mason, before I did. The point I want to make very, very strongly is that there is a responsibility of parents and of carers toward the attitudes, the actions and the behaviours of children. I disagree with Senator Di Natale, because we are not going to wipe out this risk to children by totally banning—certainly until nine o'clock at night—the advertising of sports betting services on television and radio. In my view there is a responsibility of carers, of adults, of parents, of grandparents and of those responsible for children's behaviours and attitudes to influence them in relation to the wider community. We are assaulted these days, as you know, with vast media. We have smart phones, and people can gamble in any location using their smart phones. The other point that I want to make in relation to that comment is that there is not only online gambling in Australia but also operations overseas, which the Australian government has limited capacity to regulate.


Having been a member of the gambling reform committee from the time it was established, when Mr Wilkie originally sought the agreement of the Prime Minister to put it in place—and Senator Xenophon has always been active and involved in that—I have had it brought home to me, and my experience tells me, that if you deny people one form of gambling, if they want to gamble, they will find another way. The last thing we want is for people to be participating in uncontrolled, internet accessed gambling overseas where we have no control at all. We have no knowledge of where these participants are and we have no capacity as an Australian community to protect them. Of course nobody wants to see problem gambling in adults and we certainly do not want to see it in children.


I spent a good deal of my early life in the goldfields area of WA where two-up was a tradition—



Senator Mason interjecting—




Senator BACK:
  not necessarily to the extent that it is now, Senator Mason—and there has not been an epidemic of gambling as a result of children growing up in families where their parents may have tossed pennies.


When I look at this voluntary code there does seem to be some confusion. This voluntary code says in the appendix:


(2) During a Live Sports Broadcast, a Licensee must ensure there is no Promotion of Live Odds:


(a) by a Commentator at any time; or


(b) during Play.


I support that 100 per cent as I am sure others do. I have heard Senator Di Natale and Senator Xenophon question it and say that it is irrelevant because there is quarter time and half time in the case of Australian Rules and three-quarter time and half time in the other code north of the border. The simple fact of the matter is that, as we all know, during those periods of time in the household, or wherever else sport might be watched, it is the case that people move around, go out to get a drink, go to the toilet, or converse, and that may well be the time in which they discuss what the progress of the game is. For us to stand up here and support a total ban does not make common sense to me.


Of course, it is not just the voluntary code that will come into operation. Once it is in its final form it will be the subject of review and will then be the subject of registration by the Australian Communications and Media Authority, ACMA. It may be into the future—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, to Senator Di Natale—that over time this is not seen to have achieved its goal or been strong enough in its objectives. Let us not rush into this. This is the best situation at the moment, in which industry has voluntarily, at short notice, determined to put this code of practice into place.




Senator Di Natale:
  It has done nothing.




Senator BACK:
  It is not doing nothing. I, for one, want to see the code come into existence in its final form. The coalition, of course, have a proud record when it comes to being the first to legislate to control online gambling in this country. As my colleague Senator Humphries said, we were the first in the world to so do. We are not blind to where the responsibility lies or where the opportunities lie. I say in conclusion—to allow colleagues the opportunity to comment—that I do not support the motion but certainly, as Senator Xenophon quite rightly said in reflecting his comments with our leader Mr Abbott, 'It is an issue which definitely requires control. Children have to be protected, but we have not yet got to the nanny state.'

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2013-05-16,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (17:50):  I rise to make a contribution in this debate. I listened carefully to the outline of the issue from Senator Di Natale in relation to the outrage amongst sports fans. I cannot entirely agree with that. In my own household at least one non-sports fan does not like it, but, whenever I am enjoying a barbecue and watching the football, most of the other people are quite interested—but they are adults.


The argument is that there is a barrage of ads, disturbing evidence that kids can identify sports betting agencies and that the consciousness of children is being altered or informed. Well, that is just a very successful advertising campaign. That happens with breakfast cereals and with Coca-Cola, and it happens with everything.  So I do not think you can say that sports betting is the cause of their altered consciousness; it is advertising that does it. The reality is that we will have a whole generation growing up in front of very large, interactive smart TVs with smart phones. Prohibition is not the way forward. We are a nation that stops for Melbourne Cup Day. There are sweeps in every school, in every workplace and in almost every household.


As Senator Stephens said, we are a nation of voracious gamblers. We do have a significant number of problem gamblers and we do not want to increase that number of problem gamblers. We certainly do not want to encourage children to commence betting below the legal age or to have an appetite for betting. But, if you have ever taken your son to the Rugby League or the football, you would know that tickets have always been sold on the first try-scorer. You bought your ticket—in those days it might have cost 20c—and if you had the right number you won a prize: a meat tray or whatever. This type of betting on sports has been around. What we are experiencing now is the insidious nature of technology. We have smart phones and smart apps—download a smart app, get Tom Waterhouse on your iPhone or your other type of smart phone.


I understand the sincerity that, in particular, Senator Xenophon brings to the debate. He is absolutely right: he will campaign until there is no breath left in his body on these issues, because that is in his nature and that has certainly been his demonstrated track history. The reality is that we need to look at what the government is actually doing. The government is indeed taking action to reduce the promotion of live odds during sports coverage. We are working with the broadcasting industry who have proposed amendments. They have responded to community concerns. They have a very big and growing business. In their view, they have to get their act together, otherwise legislation could be introduced that will restrict their opportunity, but I do not believe they are out there trying to get kids to bet. I certainly do not believe that.


Under principles agreed between the industry and the government, there will be no promotion of live odds by commentators at any time during a sports broadcast. There will be no advertising of live odds during play, with clearly identified ads restricted to scheduled breaks in play, such as at half-time. The government's preference in general is for action to be taken through the co-regulatory framework of broadcasting regulation. For now, the government will evaluate the effectiveness of the measures proposed by the broadcasting industry before considering any further action, such as this type of legislation. In this space and for this reason we do not support, and I do not support, the Greens bill at this time. 


The government recognises that problem gambling and the relationship between sport and gambling are very serious issues. We have acted and continue to act across a range of portfolios to address these issues. The concern that has been expressed here today, targeted towards one particular betting agency because he is the most highly visible agency and has made a real success of his business in a very short space of time, is probably flawed. We need to address the fundamentals.


I do not mind if my grandchildren learn about betting, because if you learn about betting you basically learn about losing. You do not get odds of 10 to one because it is a sure thing. You get odds of 10 to one because there is a nine times chance of losing. I do not think you can hide people, children or otherwise, away from the real world and then at the age of 18 turn them out for someone else to cultivate into a gambler. I do not mind having exposure at the right times. I do not think it is appropriate before the PG sort of rating period. I do not think we should be advertising gambling, as someone has already said in the debate, in the cartoon hours, but there is no doubt that kids will be watching football and nine o'clock is not going to stop them from watching football. If a game is scheduled to go a bit later, there are plenty of households in which children below the age of 18 or below the age of 10 do not go to bed until midnight. There are plenty of households which are fanatical about the round-ball game. A lot of that is played in the middle of the night. I do not think an arbitrary curfew is the answer to this. I think education is the answer. I am not all that convinced that this exposure is 100 per cent detrimental. It may be detrimental to a certain number of very vulnerable people, but they will probably have that vulnerability with or without this type of activity by betting agencies.


Sporting bodies, broadcasters and the gambling industry all have an important role to play to ensure that our sports do not become swamped with gambling messages. At the end of the day, you want to see your team win. If you happen to bet on the way through and you are of a legal age, I do not have a problem with that. I do not think any government will ever change that ability. If you are of a legal age, your team is in the running and you want to have a punt, it will be available to you. What has attempted to be the subject of this debate is whether we have a younger and more vulnerable group of consumers who have been groomed and turned into problem gamblers. I do not think there is any evidence to say that is the case.


I heard Senator Back's story about growing up in Kalgoorlie. I grew up in the Northern Territory. Someone else mentioned that two flies could be bet on. I am certain that there have been occasions when I have been tempted to bet on one of those flies. It has not made me a problem gambler, it has not made my children problem gamblers and I do not have any friends or family who have turned into problem gamblers, and we have had exposure to gambling—of a legal nature and perhaps of a more dubious nature—throughout all our growing up years.


What is really intriguing is whether having a smart TV or an iPhone—the ability to download a betting app to an iPhone and link it to a credit card or a betting account and to bet at any time—is essentially more addictive than what has always been the case, where you can walk to a TAB or an outlet like that to place a bet. I have a TAB very close to where I live and on occasion I have gone there and made a bet. I have noticed younger punters coming in and trying to pick a whole range of options regarding betting on the AFL, soccer, golf or whatever, but if they have sat down, worked out what they can afford to lose, filled out the correct ticket and are over 18, I am not sure that there is a problem. How they got to that stage seems to be what this debate is about. As people get to the legal age of being able to drink, vote, represent the country in the Army or go to the TAB, or bet in whichever way they want, I am not sure that regulations are ever going to change any of that. I am not sure that we can put up legislation or amendments in this place to have the effect that some people in this place want.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (20:00):  Mr Deputy President, before we deal with the tabling of the speech by the Leader of the Opposition, I seek leave to make a very short statement in response to a statement that Senator Ludwig gave by leave at 4.30 pm. 


Leave granted.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I thank the Senate. During question time today Senator Ludwig denied that he and Mr Burke, and indeed the Gillard government, had received a proposal from the Queensland government in relation to the grazing in Queensland national parks of 300,000 drought affected cattle. Senator Ludwig came to the chamber at 4.30 this afternoon and said that he was also advised that the date recorded for the receipt of the letter that the Queensland government alleged they sent was recorded as 16 May. Senator Ludwig said that his ministerial and electorate office staff had searched fax machines and emails and they have not found a copy of a fax or an email sent from the Queensland government. He also went on to say:


I note that a letter was addressed to Mr Burke at a post office box in Roselands in New South Wales. At the end of question time Mr Burke's office advised my office that the proposal had not been received at his post office box, or by fax or email at either his electorate or parliamentary office.


I have before me copies of emails from the Queensland government to Mr Burke at Tony.Burke.MP@aph.gov.au, dated Tuesday 14 May at 1.54 pm, sending a copy of the letter making the application for help that I referred to today. A similar letter was at the same time emailed to Senator Ludwig.


The fact that Mr Burke last night told the media that he had been approached, and he commented on the application, I think proves the fact that Mr Burke did actually receive that, contrary to what Senator Ludwig said in question time and contrary to what he said at 4.30 this afternoon in his statement by leave to the chamber. 


Mr Deputy President, I will seek leave in due course to table this email from the Queensland minister's office to Mr Burke, dated 14 May 2013 at 1.54 pm. I conclude this statement by indicating that at 4.52 this afternoon my office received confirmation from the Queensland government that the emails had been delivered on Tuesday, with a copy of their email logs. I do not quite understand what that means, but apparently it is proof in jargon that the email to Mr Burke was received. I also understand—I am not sure how people can do this—that Senator Ludwig himself obtained the same email log at 4.48 pm, having made his speech denying all knowledge of the email in the Senate approximately 10 minutes before.

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (20:51):  Several months ago I spoke in this chamber about the opposition's slide towards Tea Party style tactics. I cited evidence showing that this development has distorted the coalition's decision-making on policies of national importance and led to a limitless strategy of obstructionism and defiance. In deciding to fight every day in Tea Party mode no tactic has been deemed too petty or excessive. This week the coalition reached a new low by denying a pair to a mother, Michelle Rowland, who was trying to return home and care for a sick 14-month-old child. Like the rest of Australia I was stunned that the coalition had sunk this low.


It is not just the coalition's stance on key issues or mean-spirited political tactics that we should be concerned about. It is something even more fundamental: the denigration of political debate in Australia that is being driven by the opposition leader and his team.


In America, this sort of shrill, fear-driven campaigning led to the tragic shooting of United States congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. How much further will the opposition leader go until his tactics lead to a similar disaster occurring in Australia? Already the political narrative, relentlessly pursued by the opposition leader and shadow Treasurer, has unleashed responses in some sections of the public that are honestly quite frightening. This can be largely attributed to the fact that coalition politicians are free to associate themselves with Tea Party style protests which place a premium on ignorance, and disregard informed decision or discussion of policy or leadership. We should never forget Tony Abbott's call for a 'people's revolt', which saw a series of aggressive demonstrations and a new type of political extremism in Australia. The alternative leader of this country was standing proudly in front of 'ditch the witch' placards at a time when death threats were sent to Independent MPs. That is the calibre of the opposition.


At one anti carbon price rally in July 2011, some participants suggested to the shadow Treasurer that Australians should 'take up arms against the government'. What sort of hysterical, pitchfork-carrying nonsense is this? The look on Joe Hockey's face was one of alarm at just what his party has unleashed in Australia. Now it is out of control and these voices are growing louder. We saw it when the protesters swarmed outside Minister Albanese's electorate office in Sydney and hurled abuse at him, calling him 'a maggot', amongst other things. Members of the coalition, including the member for Indi, Sophie Mirabella, were right there next to the protestors carrying placards that read, 'Tolerance is our demise,' and 'Carbon dioxide is not pollution'.


Perhaps the worst offender has to be the Consumers and Taxpayers Association, CATA—the group responsible for many of these hate filled public events in recent times. This includes the protests featuring the infamous 'ditch the witch' placards I mentioned a moment ago. Although Tony Abbott has since distanced himself slightly, in March this year we still had Barnaby Joyce and Liberal member for Hughes, Craig Kelly—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! You need to refer to people in the other place or here by their correct titles.




Senator POLLEY:
  My apologies. Senator Barnaby Joyce and Liberal member for Hughes, Craig Kelly, were proudly addressing a 'rotten to the core' rally. I should not have to remind Senator Joyce and Mr Kelly that this group has covered themselves in glory on numerous occasions over the last couple of years. The group's spokesperson stated publicly that the furore over Alan Jones's 'died of shame' comment was an overreaction and that Jones was the subject of cyber-bullying. They have hurled abuse at the elected Prime Minister of this country during question time. They have perpetrated climate change denialism. The list goes on, and the coalition is right next to them every step of the way.


This trend of extremism and political activism embraced by the coalition comes at a huge cost to Australia. Tony Abbott has sought to consistently undermine the government's efforts to reasonably manage the Australian economy and has done this in part by lowering the tone of the debate at every turn. Remember, it was Labor's response to the global financial crisis that saved hundreds of thousands of jobs and small businesses in this country. It was praised by Noble prize-winning economists and ensured that Australia did not slide into recession. Our economy has a gold-plated AAA credit rating. This is the envy of countries around the world, but all we have heard from the opposition is a series of breathtakingly stupid comments. We had the shadow Treasurer saying that the Australian economy is 'flatlining', even though it has grown considerably. He also regularly implies that running a $1.5 trillion national economy is not dissimilar to running a household budget. This is of course part of a wider trend when it comes to the economy and a range of other issues, as senior coalition leaders try to sound like everyday people. If I hear Tony Abbott say the words 'fair dinkum'—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! You need to refer to someone in the other place by their correct title.




Senator POLLEY:
  If I hear Mr Abbott say the words 'fair dinkum' one more time, I will vomit. We also need to consider that the coalition's fixation on ignorance is damaging Australia's strong international reputation as a progressive and dynamic middle power. When Euromoney magazine awarded its prestigious Finance Minister of the Year award to Treasurer Wayne Swan, the shadow Treasurer basically threw his toys out of the pram. Let's not forget that he made several telling remarks, including this gem when discussing past winners. He said:


In 2001 there was a Pakistani finance minister. That is quite an extraordinary one, that one.


If the shadow Treasurer had conducted any semblance of research, he would have found that the Pakistani minister in question could have headed Citibank in New York. Instead, he returned to Pakistan to institute successful economic reforms. Extraordinary indeed!


Sometimes it seems that every time the opposition leader opens his mouth, he tarnishes the country's image. He has publicly lamented the fact that the Prime Minister will not 'lie down and die' and stated that the science behind climate change is 'absolute crap'. Even his own party cringed when he said in September last year that the Prime Minister should be talking to the Indonesian president in Jakarta rather than 'swanning around in New York talking to Africans'. How embarrassing! This was despite the fact that the Prime Minister was attending the annual four-day assembly of the United Nations, which was also attended by the president.


Mr Abbott and senior members of his party have been raising the bar of stupidity, and it is to the detriment of the political discourse in this country. This means that moderate members of the Liberal Party are quickly becoming an endangered species. They must look on in horror every time they witness their leader pursue his chief strategy: 'Give me the prime ministership or I will wreck the joint.' There is no nuance, no thoughtful opinion, no well-constructed arguments or invitation to challenge the merits of an idea. Instead they rely simplistically on mantras like 'stop the boats' or 'great big new tax.' It is vicious, crude and cheap, and it demonstrates that the Abbott coalition is a political soulmate of the Republican Party.


The Liberals' strategy is to make politics a policy-free zone, and by unleashing their attack dogs and fomenting this culture of ugly protest the opposition has redefined political demonstrations in Australia. How on earth has this come to be? And tonight, when we heard the budget in reply, what did we get? We got more of the same negativity, denying that there is any need to address climate change. It was more of the same, and we know on this side, as the Australian public already know—and we will educate them—about the challenges ahead they will face under any incoming coalition government, and that is their attacks on Australian workers and what they will do in bringing back Work Choices mark 3. We know what Tony Abbott's history was when he was the minister for health. He gutted the health department by a billion dollars. (Time expired)



Opposition senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator Fierravanti-Wells:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order. Three times you have brought Senator Polley to order. she has been totally and utterly disrespectful. She could at least, in her diatribe, refer to Mr Abbott by his proper name.



The PRESIDENT:  Order! Resume your seat. There is no point of order.
