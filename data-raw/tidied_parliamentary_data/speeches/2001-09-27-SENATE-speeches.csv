I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I seek leave to incorporate the tabling statement in Hansard
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
Madam President, on behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit (JCPAA), I present the Committee's Report No. 387—Annual Report 2000-2001.  Under the Public Accounts and Audit Committee Act 1951, the JCPAA is required to prepare a report on the performance of its duties during the past financial year.  I will briefly discuss the Committee's highlights for the year.
Since the Financial Management and Accountability (FMA) Act, the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies (CAC) Act and the Auditor-General Act, came into effect on 1 January 1998, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit has completed a systematic review of the effectiveness of this suite of legislation.  The Committee's reports on Corporate Governance Arrangements for Government Business Enterprises, and on the operation of the FMA and CAC Acts tabled last financial year were complemented by the Review of the Auditor-General Act 1997 which has just been completed and tabled as the Committee's Report 386.
Madam President, the JCPAA is proud of its work as the linchpin in accountability between Parliament and the people.  It has been responsible for raising public standards in risk management, accountability and corporate governance.  It has been the driving force for the introduction of accrual accounting in Commonwealth agencies.  The Committee has been in the vanguard on these matters—a fact recognised both in Australia and overseas.  The Committee's reports have been consulted widely and many of its recommendations have been adopted by governments of the day.
The JCPAA Chairman has been asked to speak in a number of forums and to participate in a number of conferences.  Indeed I represented the Chairman and delivered a speech on `Ecology of the Public Accounts Committee' to a CPA Study Group on Public Accounts Committees in Toronto, Canada in May this year.
One important change which illustrates the Committee's pre-eminence has been the change to the Committee's responsibility in 1997 when the Auditor-General reported to the Committee as the representative of the Parliament.  The Committee has been diligent in its pursuit of developments which would facilitate the Auditor-General's programs.  One breakthrough has been the gradual inclusion into agencies' contracts, of the Auditor-General's possible need to access third party premises in his own right to examine relevant documents.
Recent Committee inquiries into public service agencies have demonstrated shortcomings with respect to contract management.  Such findings are significant in an environment where many government services have been subject to commercial contestability and contracting out, and in which responsibility for successful risk management has been devolved to agency heads.  The Committee embarked on an inquiry into Contract Management in the Australian Public Service in an attempt to identify systemic problems in contract administration and to develop better practice standards which can be applied across agencies.
The Committee also held public hearings and collected evidence on the Commonwealth Community Education and Information Program.  As a result of this inquiry, the Committee developed and tabled its revised Guidelines for Government Advertising, Report No. 377 in September 2000.
Following the tabling of the Auditor-General's Report No. 38, 1999-2000, Coastwatch—Australian Customs Service, the Committee reviewed the effectiveness of the existing Coastwatch organisation, the challenges it faces, and examined options for the future.  The Committee concluded that the organisation was performing well and had successfully detected and co-ordinated the interception of illegal entry vessels in northern Australian waters.
In its Coastwatch report, the Committee noted that the problem of people smuggling needed to be dealt with on an international level by addressing the issue in the source countries.  This approach is currently being undertaken by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and their respective Departments.
Recent Committee Auditor-General report reviews have found that accountability and risk management in agencies could be improved.  However, the Committee did note that there had been improvements in contract administration among some agencies.
As part of its responsibility to consider the budget estimates of the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO), the Committee was briefed on the performance of the office by the Independent Auditor.  The Committee resolved to ask the Independent Auditor to prepare a performance audit of ANAO as part of his routine audit responsibilities.  This request was repeated in a recommendation in the Committee's report on the Auditor-General Act 1997, tabled in September 2001.
Finally, Madam President, in this financial year, the Committee hosted the 6th Biennial Conference of the Australasian Council of Public Accounts Committees (ACPAC) in Parliament House, Canberra during 4-6 February 2001.
In addition to representatives of public accounts committees and Auditors-General from the Australian States, Territories, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea, observers from Canada, Papua New Guinea, South Africa, Fiji, Hong Kong and the United Kingdom were present.  It was decided to expand the forum to admit Canada and South Africa as members, if they so wished.
Madam President, the Chairman has asked me to thank my colleagues on the Committee who have dedicated their time and effort to various inquiries and to reviewing the Auditor-General's reports throughout the 2000-2001 period.  As well, I would like to thank the secretariat involved in the inquiries.  The JCPAA has had a busy year in 2000-2001 and is justifiably proud of its work.
Madam President, I commend the JCPAA Annual Report 2000-2001 to the Senate.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-09-27,"—I seek leave to incorporate my speech in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
The Jurisdiction of the Federal Magistrates Service Legislation Amendment Bill 2001 will amend the Migration Act 1958 to give jurisdiction to the Federal Magistrates Service in matters under Part 8 of the Migration Act.
This jurisdiction will be concurrent with the jurisdiction of the Federal Court. 
The bill will also remove the restrictions on the Federal Magistrates Service hearing migration matters under the ADJR Act and hearing appeals in relation to migration matters under the AAT Act.  
The Government has stated that many migration matters are of a routine nature and would be suitable for the Service.
In considering this bill it is necessary to make reference to the system for migration and refugee appeals as a whole—which this bill seeks to further modify.
Current system of migration and refugee appeals
The current system is under pressure because of the lengthy delays that occur in determining refugee matters.  Generally, unsuccessful applicants for asylum pursue every avenue of appeal. This means that those people who have not made out genuine claims of asylum can spend very long periods—sometimes years—in detention, prior to being deported back to their country of origin. These lengthy periods cause great psychological and physical pressures. 
Litigation costs stemming from the defence by the Department of Immigration of appeals lodged in the Federal and High Courts and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal by applicants in migration and refugee matters have now reached $15m per annum. The costs (some $104 per person, per day) associated with maintaining asylum seekers in detention who use the appeals process also places a heavy financial burden on the Commonwealth.
Accordingly, not only is it in the national interest but also in the interest of those people who claim refugee status, that applications and appeals should be dealt with as fairly and as quickly as possible.
Currently, determinations of refugee status are made by a delegate of the Minister for Immigration. Where the person is determined not to be a refugee, an application is then made for review of that decision to the Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT). Unsuccessful applicants then have two avenues of further appeal.
The first avenue of appeal is to the Federal Court under a restricted range of grounds specified in Part 8 of the Migration Act. An appeal from the decision of the Federal Court can then be lodged with the Full Court of the Federal Court. An application for special leave to appeal to the High Court can also be made.
The second avenue is directly to the High Court under section 75(v) of the Constitution—known as the “original jurisdiction” of the High Court. In practice, applicants usually choose one of these avenues, but not both.
The Migration Act currently prohibits the High Court remitting refugee matters to any other court for review. This means that the judges of the High Court must themselves sit in judgment on matters involving applications for refugee status. 
This is placing enormous pressure on High Court judges who now spend considerable time hearing these low-level migration matters rather than attending to the proper business of the Court as the nation's highest court of appeal, namely Constitutional issues, the application of the general criminal law and the ever-burgeoning complexity of commerce related legislation.
Judicial Review Bill
This week the Senate passed [will pass] the Migration (Judicial Review) Bill 1999.
Its effect will be to abolish all avenues of judicial review of decisions made by the Migration Review Tribunal and Refugee Review Tribunal.  It seeks to achieve this by enacting a “privative clause” which would have the effect of severely limiting the types of appeals which can be heard by the Federal Court and the High Court. 
There is substantial legal opinion that the attempt to exclude the jurisdiction of the High Court in migration matters would be unconstitutional. This is because there is an explicit guarantee in the Constitution that the High Court has authority to hear applications for judicial review. 
While a Constitutional challenge to the bill is likely, Labor has agreed to pass the bill so that the matter will be able to be tested. In the event that the High Court rules that the “privative clause” is not consistent with the Constitution, a Labor government would consider the position again at that time.
This Bill
This bill confers jurisdiction on the Federal Magistrates Court to hear appeals under the Migration Act.
With the passage of the Judicial Review Bill, this bill has only limited effect.
This legislation will give the Federal Magistrates Court concurrent jurisdiction to hear appeals with the Federal Court on those few migration matters which will continue to be appealable. 
One problem with the legislation, despite the government's professed goal of reducing layers of appeal, this bill will actually introduce an extra layer of appeal. Applicants who choose the Federal Magistrates Court to hear their case will then be automatically entitled to a further appeal to the Federal Court.
Essentially, this will create more opportunities for unsuccessful applicants to delay the resolution of their cases by introducing yet another layer of appeal.
For these reasons, Labor remains skeptical that the measures introduced by the government will have a positive effect on addressing the backlogs in the resolution of migration matters.
We put to the Minister for Immigration an alternative proposal—in the form of amendments to the Judicial Review legislation—which we believe would have been far more effective.
A “One Stop Shop” for judicial review of migration and refugee applications
Labor's amendments would have provided for fair and expeditious review of applications while discouraging the bringing of applications which have no merit.
Labor's amendments would have retained judicial review, but only allow applicants a single opportunity for judicial review in the Federal Magistrates Court. There would be no right of appeal from a decision of a Federal Magistrate.
The amendments also gave the FMC jurisdiction to hear those matters which currently can only be heard by High Court because the High Court is prohibited from remitting those matters to other courts.
Some applicants would elect to seek a review of the decision of the Migration Review Tribunal or Refugee Review Tribunal in the original jurisdiction of the High Court—as is presently the case. However, Labor's amendments would have allowed the High Court to send those directly cases to the Federal Magistrates Court for a decision. 
It is envisaged that the High Court would refer all but the most exceptional cases to the Federal Magistrates Court so that, either way, the matter will be heard in the Federal Magistrates Court and dealt with fairly and quickly.
Labor's amendments also introduced new rules designed to discourage lawyers and migration agents from encouraging applicants to make appeals which have no reasonable prospect of success.
These rules would allow a court to impose a personal costs order of up to $5000 on an adviser who encourages a person to make an appeal which has no reasonable prospects of success. Body corporates will be liable for a fine of $10000.
This measure was designed to discourage advisers from exploiting applicants by urging them to take up appeals which, while without foundation, result in considerable further delay, expense and create unreasonable expectations of remaining in Australia.
The Minister rejected these suggestions, which Labor put forward in a spirit of bipartisanship.
Conclusion
The bill which is before us—the Jurisdiction of the Federal Magistrates Service Legislation Amendment Bill 2001—only has a limited effect.
It invests the Federal Magistrates Court with a jurisdiction co-extensive with the Federal Court in a very limited range of migration matters.
Labor agrees that there will be cases currently heard by the Federal Court which can appropriately be dealt with at the Federal Magistrates level.
Labor supports the passage of the bill.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-09-27,"—I seek leave to incorporate a letter from the National Vice President of the Institution of Engineers Australia's, Ken Mathers, which I have shown to the other parties. It puts the point of view from engineers that this legislation is going to be against the interests of the members of that institution. I would like it recorded that that concern is there and has not been resolved by amendments to the legislation.
Leave granted.
The letter read as follows—
The Institute of Engineers Australia
National Office
19th September 2001
Dear Senator Brown,
There is an issue that is currently affecting around 8,800 of our 60,000 members that I am seeking your assistance to resolve.
The issue of concern for these 8,800 engineers relates to the treatment of contractors under the Alienation of Personal Services Income Act. The Institution supports measures that ensure a fair tax system, but is concerned that engineering practitioners who genuinely act as contractors are not being treated as such because of this legislation.
The legislation limits work related deductions for income generated by personal services, even where that income is earned through a company or partnership. Engineering contractors gain their income from offering their individual personal effort and skill, which is based on their qualifications and experience. The nature of a small engineering contracting business means that these engineers, more often than not, are unable to pass the three tests set out in legislation. Amendments to the legislation are currently before, Parliament Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) 2001. However, these amendments do not in any way resolve the main issue for engineering contractors.
We are seeking an amendment to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No 6) 2001, so that some, if not all the issues currently affecting our members can be resolved.
We would like your help and support in putting forward our proposed amendment so that it can be debated in Parliament and ultimately included in the Bill. Attached are details of the impact of the current situation on engineering contractors. If you require further information, please contact Mr Malcolm Palmer on (02) 6270 6581.
Yours sincerely
Ken Mathers
National Vice President, Public Policy and Representation

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2001-09-27,"—This is, as has been introduced, Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 2001. This bill has not in this chamber been debated for its second reading. Given the constraints of time that we are under, I want to draw the chamber's attention to a speech made by my colleague Mr Kelvin Thomson in the House on this bill. This is not my normal procedure. Certainly, this chamber is entitled to hear the opposition's position on a bill such as this from the opposition in this chamber. However, I do seek the chamber's indulgence, as there are some time pressures upon us. Rather than having me simply repeat a similar point of view in my own words, the opposition's position was adequately set out in the House and, by drawing attention to it, I would like to mark the spot in the Hansard for this chamber by indicating the reference to our full position as set out there. I do so, acknowledging that that is not an entirely satisfactory way of proceeding but seeking everyone's indulgence and consideration based on the time pressures upon us.
That having been said, it is appropriate for me to draw the attention of the chamber to the nature of the amendments to the tax acts that this bill seeks to encode. This bill is a general bill, an omnibus bill, and therefore scoops up a lot of what might be regarded as technical amendments to at least five discrete sections of the tax act: one is a section covering the tax treatment of religious practitioners; another is that part of the tax act relating to a change in the status of constitutionally protected superannuation funds.
In the explanatory note relating to this legislation, chapter 3 refers to `CGT event E4'—that is, capital gains tax event E4. Because that may be opaque, let me provide a little more explanation. I do so, knowing that ignorance of the law is not a defence. All of us obviously know what this means and, because we do, I know that you will be simply checking my words to see whether it matches your considerations. But the explanation of CGT event 4 is a payment by a trustee to a beneficiary of a trust that is not assessable income of the beneficiary, may reduce the cost base of the beneficiary's unit or interest in the trust, and the amendments that are being proposed here are amendments to prevent CGT event 4 applying to payments out of CGT discount, and to correct the treatment of certain capital gains passing through a chain of trusts. The amendments deal with payments of non-assessable amounts associated with building allowances, and minor amendments are also made.
As I say, apart from that, this bill deals with the tax treatment of gifts and contributions, and also of information and communications technology, et cetera. That is the nature of this bill. I do not have a lot more to say about it but I do want to say a few words about the first part of this bill, that relating to religious practitioners. This is where it is appropriate to refer to the deductibility of entities for gifts—that is, the gifts part of this bill—as the deductibility includes, as well, political parties.
People in this chamber will know that the Labor Party has in question time raised many serious questions concerning the evasion of the GST by the Queensland Liberal Party in the seat of Groom. I do not wish to canvass that and the events surrounding the Minister for Small Business, Mr Macfarlane, in any detail, because we are on the record about that. I notice in the press today there is further reporting of documents seizure and investigation in that case. The obvious political point that we have made consistently is that we have a GST in this country by courtesy of the government. The major coalition partner is the Liberal Party, and a Liberal Party branch is here actively seeking to evade its tax obligations—and now we have a report of an investigation and the seizure of documents.
While all this is well documented, it does raise the question of whether there is a view being taken here—which we believe there is—that it is appropriate for the Liberal Party to evade the tax while all the rest of us have to pay it. But, with respect to that broader issue, what the proper legal treatment of GST input tax credits is and how they should be properly dealt with at law is a matter which I have also referred to at some length. I might indicate—and I draw the attention of the parliamentary secretary to this—that I have in my possession an opinion by barristers and solicitors about what the proper treatment is, and I can pass it over if he wishes. I simply wish to table it in the parliament, and that would conclude my remarks. But as I say, we have expressed our views on the record at some considerable length.
—I am sorry; I was distracted. What document is that?
—I am sorry, I did note that you were distracted. I did not want to take the fact that there is other business to consider as a reason to try to slide something through. That is not what I would try to do. I was referring simply to the position that we have argued. The document that I wanted to examine—
 (Senator Murphy)—I think it would be useful for Hansard, Senator Campbell, if you have a question that you ask it through the chair and the response to be through the chair. Senator Cook, if you want to table a document you need leave to do that.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President, but I will do the unusual thing in these circumstances and protect Senator Campbell. He was distracted. I was talking about this matter. Let me now correctly identify the document. It is a legal opinion headed `re GST input tax credits advice'. It is an opinion on the proper treatment in circumstances like those that apply in the Groom FEC case.
—Are you seeking leave, Senator Cook?
—I acknowledge that I have not shown the document to the parliamentary secretary. I am quite happy to pass it over to him to do that. 
—The attendants might take the document to Senator Campbell and he can consider it whilst you continue your speech.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I think this is a matter of considerable public interest. This is a legal opinion on this matter. It is not law; it is a view of what the law might be. Nonetheless, we regard it as a substantial opinion and germane to the public debate on the issue of tax avoidance and how the GST is properly implemented. As a consequence, it is the sort of thing that ought to be found in the records of a parliament where these matters of public interest are canvassed and debated. It can be dealt with in that respect. That is one of the reasons I seek leave to table this legal opinion.
—Is leave granted?
—I cannot give leave at this stage.
—Leave is not granted at this stage.
—I understand that call. Will you give leave at some stage? Will it be a matter of a few minutes before you find—",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 5) 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2001-09-27,"—by leave—Normally what happens—and Senator Cook knows this; I am not saying that he is trying to breach protocol—is that you have some time to consider documents. What we have here is a letter to Mr Robert McClelland, a member in the other place, from Higgins Barristers and Solicitors and signed by Mr Walter Hawkins. This person has been briefed by a Labor Party member of parliament to give some advice in relation to some facts that have been set out in relation to the Queensland division of the Liberal Party. 
So you have a Labor Party politician briefing a lawyer on a whole range of so-called facts. Individuals are mentioned ad nauseam in this. It is clearly a highly political document comprising 26 pages. It mentions a whole range of people outside this place. I regard it as basically inappropriate for me to be asked, within literally a matter of seconds, to consider whether or not this should be tabled. I think if Senator Cook wants this published for the purposes of a political campaign against the Liberal Party then he should publish it outside. He may be confident that this does not damage the reputations of individuals. I cannot be confident of that from looking at it in a few seconds or a few minutes. I think you have to be fair to those individuals outside. If you are confident that it does not damage their reputations then I suggest that you publish it outside where those people would have defences. So I refuse leave. If Senator Cook wants to take it further and insist on trying to table it, then I am happy to have it taken up later. But at this stage I will be refusing leave.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 5) 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2001-09-27,"—I take that as a refusal to provide leave. I thank the parliamentary secretary for making that clear. I also note that, in doing so, he has made some remarks about what this document contains. I have no issue that it actually relates to a legal opinion from a firm of solicitors, Higgins Barristers and Solicitors. They were briefed by the shadow Attorney-General, Mr Robert McClelland, on what we believe to be the facts in the case of GST avoidance by the Liberal Party branch in the seat of Groom. 
I accept that this is a document over which there may be political debate. That is something that the parliamentary secretary has said. I think it is true that this is a document over which there may be political debate. I think, though, that the question for this chamber is: is it a document that ought to be validly circulated as an assessment of the legal position, based on the facts that have been provided? We are on the cusp of an election, and this is a matter of public interest. Therefore, documents relating to it are matters that ought to be discoverable in the public interest. I have not sought to incorporate the document in Hansard, as that would mean that Hansard would set out all of the document. So the length of the document is not germane to this discussion. I do not accept the fact that it runs for 26 pages as a reason not to have it tabled. Tabling simply consists of placing it on the table and incorporating it in the records of this parliament without taking up endless pages of Hansard.
There are some parts of this document that I do think the public should be aware of. Let me just refer quickly to some of those and I will conclude my remarks. For example, in clause 2.16.6 of this opinion, the author, a qualified legal counsel, says:
In the present circumstances there is evidence from which an intent to defraud the Commonwealth of revenue may be inferred.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. Firstly, I thought I had an agreement with the managers, leaders and whips of the Australian Labor Party that we would try to progress these bills. It is quite appropriate, obviously, to have a few political flicks around the ear on whatever issue you want. But we are now running seriously behind schedule to complete the bills in the way in which the leaders and whips agreed yesterday. Perhaps Senator Cook can be relevant under standing orders. I draw your attention to the standing order in relation to relevance. The only reference to the GST in the entire omnibus bill, which is Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 2001 before us—and I refer to the general outline at the front of the bill—is `activities done in pursuit of a vocation as a religious practitioner and as a member of a religious institution'. That is the only reference to the GST in this bill. I think Senator Cook should be required to make his remarks succinct, firstly, to comply with standing orders but, more importantly, to comply with what I regard as very important undertakings that have been given by the Australian Labor Party—in fact, by all parties and Independents in this place—to ensure that we progress these bills as soon as we can.
 (Senator Murphy)—Senator Campbell, I hear what you say. The issue of the allocation of time is not a matter that you would raise on a point of order; that is something to be determined between the parties elsewhere. With respect to the issue of relevance, I am sure that Senator Cook heard your point and will make his comments relevant to the bill.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I will be quick because what Senator Campbell says is correct: there has been agreement to expedite these matters.
—Yes, and I do not intend to take a lot of time. I do indicate that, in the interests of expediting these matters, I have effectively referred to the speech of my colleague in the other place as the speech I might deliver now.
—Yes, I take those interjections. They are fair points, and I do acknowledge that. I do believe that I will not detain the chamber for very long and I do believe these remarks are relevant to the legislation before us. Going on with clause 2.16.6 of this opinion:
In the present circumstances there is evidence from which an intent to defraud the Commonwealth of revenue may be inferred. Deceit and concealment is evidenced by the instructions to the Caterer to “reverse” the transaction and reissue an invoice to the Queensland Division. Once the invoice had been reissued, the Queensland Division proceeded to claim the input tax credit in its December BAS ...
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. This issue, as much as it is of political relevance, is not relevant to this bill before the chamber. I ask you to draw Senator Cook's attention once more to the standing order in relation to relevance.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on the point of order: it is relevant.
—To save time, I think I can say that this bill, as I am informed by the clerk, has a long title. I am sure that Senator Cook is aware of that and is endeavouring to make his remarks relevant to the bill.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. It has a long title and it is an omnibus bill. It is a bill under which all elements of the Tax Act can be debated and talked about. But, as the parliamentary secretary has said, there is a particular provision here that refers directly to the GST. In that respect, I am talking about an application of the GST and a legal opinion about how that should be provided. I would hate there to be any suggestion from the other side that, because this is politically inconvenient for them, they would try and quash the ability of this parliament to hear these relevant views. Let me conclude where I was up to:
... the Queensland Division proceeded to claim the input tax credit in its December BAS, thereby prejudicing the ATO's legal right to revenue.
Also, in clause 2.17.8, it states:
As indicated above, there is evidence of an agreement to use dishonest means in the circumstances which led to the instructions to the Caterer to “reverse” the transaction. On the facts, once the transaction had been reversed and a new invoice issued, the Queensland Division asserted as true its entitlement to the input tax credit. The evidence supports the view that subsequent actions taken by the Queensland Division—with the agreement of the Groom FEC—were, by ordinary standards, dishonest.
Furthermore, although the ATO was subsequently repaid the amount of the GST input tax credit which had been claimed, actual loss is not an element.
Just further at 2.18.4:
Consequently, a statement to a taxation officer would include information included in a BAS lodged with the ATO pursuant to Division 31 of the GST Act. Importantly, a BAS includes a declaration that the information given on the form is true and correct. This declaration is signed by a person duly authorised. By declaring the Queensland Division was entitled to an input tax credit for the catering services, a statement was made to a taxation officer by an officer of the Queensland Division which was clearly incorrect.
Let me bring this to a conclusion with just three other references. At 2.18.10 the opinion states:
Consequently, having regard to the terms of section 8K of the Taxation Administration Act 1953, where the amount of input tax credit claimed in the Queensland's Division BAS was wrong an officer of the Queensland Division would have made a false statement to a taxation officer and there would be prima facie evidence of the commission of an offence. That there may have been no fraudulent or wilful intent would not be relevant.
It further states at 2.18.12:
It is not apparent from the material brief whether the Queensland Division was or was not a corporation at the relevant time, but if it were, there may be potential for it to be prosecuted under the Act.
At 2.18.16 it then states:
The Queensland Division of the Groom FEC has received advice as to whether it was permissible for the Queensland Division to claim the input tax credit in its December 2000 BAS. An available inference is that, by failing to heed this advice, the Queensland Division acted with disregard and indifference. A conclusion may then be open that it was reckless in stating that the information contained in the BAS was true and correct.
Finally, at 3.1, in `Conclusions', it says:
The material referred to certainly points in the direction of a scheme or schemes having being entered into to which the anti-avoidance provisions of Division 165 of the GST Act applies. As to the commission of a criminal offence, it is necessary to establish all the elements of any offence alleged, including any relevant intent, beyond a reasonable doubt. In the absence of any opportunity to personally interview all the relevant participants, I would not, on the available material alone, attribute criminal conduct as such to any of them or to any body, whether incorporated or not. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to conclude, on the facts as understood, that there is a body of material suggestive of possible criminal conduct which would warrant a proper investigation by the authorities charged with investigating such matters. Ultimately, any decision to prosecute would have to be made having regard to all the circumstances, including any appropriate prosecution policy which may be applicable.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 5) 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-09-27,"—This is a minor omnibus bill with important consequences for the individual concerned. Once again, it is needed, with respect to religious practitioners, to resolve an issue where conflicting legal situations result in tax outcomes which are not necessarily beneficial. I think the government's treatment of this improves matters considerably. I am reminded of the situation in Western Australia, where the state government at one stage tried to get around workplace relations laws by stating that police officers were not employees. As many people realise, you cannot instruct a policeman or policewoman. They have the right to carry out their duties in terms of their judgment and that means that they cannot be told not to arrest somebody if they wish to do so. That is to prevent there being any improper interference with them carrying out their duties. The government was trying to avoid some employee obligations by saying that they were not employees because they were acting on their own. In this case, you have got religious practitioners who, in the way in which they were functioning, were to be regarded as businesses and were to register for the GST and all sorts of other things. The government is fixing that up and quite properly so. We support that. Their summary of the new law in the explanatory memorandum puts it particularly well. It says:
Under the ABN and GST law, activities performed by a religious practitioner, as a religious practitioner of a religious institution, will be taken to be the activities of the religious institution (and not the activities of the religious practitioner). Consequently, a religious practitioner will not carry on an enterprise by performing these activities. The result will be that these religious practitioners will not be eligible (or need) to register for GST or an ABN for these activities.
This is obviously very sensible. The explanatory memorandum goes on:
Under the PAYG withholding arrangements, an entity will be required to withhold from payments made to a religious practitioner for any activity or series of activities done as a religious practitioner of a religious institution. This will only apply if the paying entity makes the payment in the course or furtherance of an enterprise. 
In other words, they are going to be treated for tax purposes as employees, not as businesses, and that is smart. The second area of the bill is about who else should be on the gifts or contributions schedule, and there are some useful additions. There is a change in the status of constitutionally protected superannuation funds which facilitates the change for those that elect to become taxed superannuation funds. That will mean that those members who have changed status will be treated similarly for income tax and superannuation surcharge purposes. There is an item on information and communications technology. Schedule 5 of the bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to exempt from income tax the income of a non-profit society or association established for the purpose of promoting the development of Australian information communications technology resources. There are a few good items in here to do with capital gains, the treatment of religious practitioners as employees, superannuation funds, gifts and contributions, and information and communications technology. We will be supporting the bill without amendment.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2001-09-27,"—I table the supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government amendments to be moved to this bill. This memorandum was circulated in the Senate today. I move:
That the committee does not insist on its amendment to which the House of Representatives has disagreed.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2001</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-09-27,"—The Greens insist on the amendment that was made to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2001. We do so because, while government amendments have gone some way towards protecting the interests of land-holders who make a covenant on their land, in the case of the Tasmanian regional forest agreements—where money is given to land-holders to protect their bush blocks as areas of prime environmental value—they have not gone as far as we intended when I first brought this matter up before the Senate in November last year and then moved to bring in an amendment which is echoed in the Labor amendment to this bill.
It is a complex matter, but what is not understood here is that the money given under the regional forest agreement is not for a loss in the value of the land when a conservation covenant goes on. I think we are going to live to see the time when the value of land goes up because it is protected, not down. We know in Tasmania that when people actually cut down their bush blocks the value of that land, and indeed the value of adjacent properties, falls. So it is the disturbance or woodchipping of an area that leads to a loss, not the protection of it.
The problem is that under the regional forest agreement, where a landowner is given a consideration for protecting the bush block, that consideration is still subject to the capital gains tax. That is what the amendment sought to remove. As far as I know, this is the only case, out of the 850 pages of the tax act, where that capital gains tax provision has been levied. It is done so under the argument that the government is gaining a right through giving that money to the landowner who is protecting the area under the regional forest agreement.
The Greens vehemently object to landowners who are doing the right thing under the regional forest agreement being taxed. If you knock down a bush block and put in a plantation with a monoculture where the forest once was, you get a tax write-off for that. But, if you protect your forest block and you get a consideration which helps you to perhaps put in fencing and have a 20-year management plan, you get hit with a capital gains tax. That is a very clear disincentive to landowners who want to do the right thing and are actually making a gift to the nation through protecting rare and endangered species on their bush blocks. That is why we insist on this amendment made in the Senate which went to the House of Representatives.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

31-5  Deduction for entering into conservation covenant
	(1)	You can deduct an amount if:
	(a)	you enter into a *conservation covenant over land you own; and
	(b)	the conditions set out in subsection (2) are met.
	(2)	These conditions must be satisfied:
	(a)	the covenant must be perpetual;
	(b)	you must not receive any money, property or other material benefit for entering into the covenant;
	(c)	the *market value of the land must decrease as a result of your entering into the covenant;

Note:	You must seek a valuation of the change in market value from the Commissioner: see section 31-15.
	(3)	The amount you can deduct is the difference between the *market value of the land just before you entered the covenant and its decreased market value just after that time, but only to the extent that the decrease is attributable to your entering into the covenant.
Note:	You can spread the deduction over a 5 year period: see Subdivision 30-DE.
	(4)	For the purposes of paragraph (2)(a), a covenant is treated as being perpetual even if a Minister of a State or Territory has a power to rescind it.
	(5)	A conservation covenant over land is a covenant that:
	(a)	restricts or prohibits certain activities on the land that could degrade the environmental value of the land; and
	(b)	is permanent and registered on the title to the land (if registration is possible); and

Insert:
104-47  Conservation covenants: CGT event D4
	(1)	CGT event D4 happens if you enter into a *conservation covenant over land you own.
	(2)	The time of the event is when you enter into the covenant.
	(3)	You make a *capital gain if the *capital proceeds from entering into the covenant are more than that part of the *cost base of the land that is apportioned to the covenant. You make a *capital loss if those capital proceeds are less than the part of the *reduced cost base of the land that is apportioned to the covenant.
Note:	The capital proceeds from entering into the covenant are modified if you do not receive anything for entering into the covenant: see section 116-105.
(4)	The part of the *cost base of the land that is apportioned to the covenant is worked out in this way:

*capital proceeds from entering into the covenant
*Cost base of land   x




Those Capital proceeds plus the *market value ofthe land just after you enter into the covenant
The part of the *reduced cost base of the land that is apportioned to the covenant is worked out similarly.
	(5)	The *cost base and *reduced cost base of the land are reduced by the part of the cost base or reduced cost base of the land that is apportioned to the covenant.
Example:	Lisa receives $10,000 for entering into a conservation covenant that covers 15% of the land she owns. Lisa uses the following figures in calculating the cost base of the land that is apportioned to the covenant:
	The cost base of the entire land is $200,000.
	The market value of the entire land before entering into the covenant is $300,000, and its market value after entering into the covenant is $285,000.
	Lisa calculates the cost base of the land that is apportioned to the covenant to be:





$200,000 x 10,000 ÷

10,000 + 285,000

 = $6,780





Exceptions
	(6)	*CGT event D4 does not happen if:
	(a)	you did not receive any *capital proceeds for entering into the covenant; and
	(b)	you cannot deduct an amount under Division 31 for entering into the covenant.
Note:	In this case, CGT event D1 will apply.
	(7)	A *capital gain or *capital loss you make is disregarded if you *acquired the land before 20 September 1985.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2001-09-27,"—I move the second reading amendment standing in my name:
At the end of the motion, add:
		“but the Senate:
	(a)	recognises the right of people to move between states as fundamental to the Federation;
	(b)	recognises the limited transport options available to people travelling to and from Tasmania across Bass Strait; and
	(c)	is of the view that a National Highway or National Sea Highway should be declared across Bass Strait; and
	(d)	calls on the Government to at least offset the effect of this legislation by providing an air travel subsidy of $10 per airline passenger travelling to and from Tasmania”.
There is a need for the government and for all of us to do something in respect of those former employees of Ansett. This is a measure designed to achieve that end. I have, as have many of us, travelled on Ansett on many occasions both when I became a member of parliament and previously. The staff have always been very impressive: courteous, dedicated and eager to provide travellers with whatever was needed to make the journey pleasant and comfortable. I do understand, and I know we all do understand, the extreme disappointment about what has happened to Ansett. We all feel their pain and understand their expressions of concern. We do have a responsibility, I acknowledge, to help them in whatever way we can. However, as a Tasmanian senator I do have some concerns about the impact of these measures on Tasmania.
My constituents of Tasmania have three choices when it comes to travelling between states: you fly, you sail or you stay at home. Persons going to Tasmania have the same choices. Road travel by bus or car and rail travel are not options for Tasmanians or for others wanting to travel to and from the state of Tasmania. We are already suffering from a greatly reduced air service, and this levy, while small in itself, will nevertheless impose a further burden on travellers to and from Tasmania.
My views on improving access to Tasmania are well known. I have supported the work of the National Sea Highway Committee, which is made up largely of dedicated Tasmanians with support from Tasmanian industry and commerce. It has been attempting to have sea travel across Bass Strait fully equalised so that the costs are the same comparatively as for crossing any other state border. I do hope that the government and others are listening to them. After all, it needs to be recognised that the right of people to move between states is, surely, fundamental to our federation.
I realise also that there are other regional areas which have been seriously affected by the collapse of Ansett. I do not believe it has been helpful at all to try to blame this on the government. That is nonsense. I do commend the government for deciding to assist. I just raise this question of the circumstances of Tasmania and commend the second reading amendment to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>AIR PASSENGER TICKET LEVY (IMPOSITION) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-09-27,"—I thank Senator Harradine for bringing this amendment forward. I wholeheartedly support it. It does go right to the heart of the difficulties that he has outlined for Tasmanians as against people in other states, in particular section (d) of his amendment:
	(d)	calls on the Government to at least offset the effect of this legislation by providing an air travel subsidy of $10 per airline passenger travelling to and from Tasmania.
As you will know, Mr Acting Deputy President Murphy, that is very important. Senator Harradine said that that is a further disincentive to people travelling to and from Tasmania. It is not only a cost on Tasmanians but a regressive levy as far as Tasmania's tourism industry is concerned. Tough times are ahead. The tourism industry has been knocked for a six by the collapse of Ansett and by prevailing economic conditions as well, and there are 18,000 to 20,000 Tasmanians directly relying on it.
The $10 levy is an absolute further disincentive for people to travel to Tasmania and then back again. The government would be very wise to heed this amendment of Senator Harradine's, because it removes that disincentive. That is good not just for the airline travellers themselves but for a whole host of small businesses in Tasmania which are facing extremely tough times. There is no doubt that quite a few of them will go to the wall. I thank Senator Harradine for this amendment and I totally support it.",SENATE,<title>AIR PASSENGER TICKET LEVY (IMPOSITION) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2001-09-27,"—I reluctantly oppose Senator Harradine's second reading amendment. I support and understand the principle. Senator Harradine may be aware that in my speech in the second reading debate on the Air Passenger Ticket Levy (Imposition) Bill 2001 and the Air Passenger Ticket Levy (Collection) Bill 2001 more generally I made the point that we Democrats had in fact explored the option of exempting all regional and isolated air services from the ticket tax, partly for the reasons that Senator Harradine has outlined, but we found that that offended section 99 of the federal Constitution and thus could not do it. Perhaps Senator Harradine found that too and that is why he has structured his second reading amendment in terms of a refund.
But I would argue, speaking here for my own state, that there are many places in the vast state of Western Australia that are just as, if not more, isolated and remote as is Tasmania from the mainland. Places such as Wiluna and Leinster and Kununurra in the far north-west of Western Australia are to some degree places of tourism industry but more often places where many workers are located in terms of mining interests. If we were going to look at a rebate on the ticket tax for reasons of disadvantage, then my own state would have an equal claim to that put today by fellow senators who are Tasmanians. On that basis, if we were going to have a rebate of any nature it should be uniform right across the nation in terms of the more regional and isolated flights rather than being quarantined to Tasmania. On that basis, while understanding what Senator Harradine was trying to achieve, I reluctantly oppose the amendment.",SENATE,<title>AIR PASSENGER TICKET LEVY (IMPOSITION) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2001-09-27,"—The opposition will not be supporting this amendment, and I shall just place on the record our reasons. I do not think there is any great offence taken to paragraphs (a) and (b) of the amendment moved by Senator Harradine. In respect of paragraphs (c) and (d) there are some consequences that we would prefer to think through, firstly, in terms of the immediate impact in terms of a declaration of national highways and, secondly, for the reasons just outlined by Senator Greig, that there are large parts of this country suffering immediate disadvantage because of the collapse of Ansett Airlines. Many parts of the country are more remote and more distant from the main centres of Australia than Tasmania is from the mainland, and they are all suffering equal harm. It appears to us that this amendment has a range of consequences for the future which we are unsure of and do not wish to entertain at this stage. The final reason is that the amendment has just been circulated—I am advised by the relevant shadow minister that we have not seen it—and on the basis that we have not had time for consultation with the office of Senator Harradine we are unable to support it.
Amendment not agreed to.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-09-27,—I would like to record my opposition to the legislation.,SENATE,<title>AIR PASSENGER TICKET LEVY (IMPOSITION) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2001-09-27,"—Recent events in the United States have highlighted the need for a strong intelligence service. Threats to national security come not just from foreign countries but also from other organisations such as terrorist groups, as we have seen all too clearly. If Australia is to protect itself from this threat, it must have good intelligence on which we can rely. Good intelligence is necessary for the effective functioning of a range of government departments, most notably those in the areas of foreign affairs and defence. If Australia's security is to be protected, we cannot simply rely on information provided by overseas agencies. We must have our own intelligence and we must be able to critically analyse the intelligence we receive from other sources. This bill deals with a number of agencies involved in providing intelligence services to the Australian government. Significantly, the bill establishes a statutory basis for ASIS, outlining its functions and applicable accountability mechanisms. We Democrats support setting these matters out in legislation. We concur with the report of the Samuels and Codd royal commission which stated that:
ASIS carries out important functions in the national interest. Its operations are usually sensitive and potentially controversial. It is no longer appropriate that the formal conferral of authority for the exercise of these functions should be the exclusive province of the executive arm. The existence of ASIS should be endorsed by Parliament and the scope and limits of its functions defined by legislation.
This bill will bring ASIS into line with similar agencies in the US, the UK, New Zealand and Canada which are governed by legislation. The bill also deals with the Defence Signals Directorate—DSD—detailing its activities and the relevant accountability mechanisms. ASIO, which is already a creature of statute, is also dealt with by the legislation, although in less detail.
Intelligence is an increasing priority for governments and it is appropriate that there should be stringent monitoring as funding increases. An example of the cost of such intelligence is the US aggregate budget, which in 1998 was a staggering $US26.7 billion. While Australia does not spend as much—around $110 million per year, with an additional $11 million over four years allocated in the last budget—keeping the government accountable for its intelligence spending is definitely an advantage offered by the proposed bill.
The new laws contemplate the role that the intelligence services will play in guiding Australian governments through the 21st century. Traditionally, intelligence officers existed to protect national security by investigating the capabilities and activities of wartime enemies or nations perceived as a threat. But the modern emphasis for Australian intelligence now includes foreign relations and economic espionage in protecting Australia's broader international interests.
However, we Democrats and other critics have expressed some concern that not all was well with the proposed new laws. The Australian Democrats, together with other critics and commentators, recognise the broad immunities conferred by the original bill upon agencies and their operatives, predicting that these new powers will come with an increase in the possibility of abuse. The original bill allowed ASIS and DSD employees to be immune to Australian and international laws with apparent and inadequate defined parameters. If they breach laws as they apply in Australia in the course of their duties, the only limitation is that the illegal actions must be in the proper performance of an agency function. The obvious problem with this provision is the difficulty in deciding what constitutes proper performance. The original bill also provided for ASIS agents to break the law in properly doing their job. But, with the inherent secrecy of ASIS, where an impropriety occurs we may never know about it or, if we do, there may be no-one who can do anything about it.
The original bill allowed for the setting up of a committee to oversee and review the agencies in question, but that committee as then proposed was hamstrung by being expressly prohibited from reviewing any operational matter or procedure adopted by the agencies. The question was: if such a committee were formed, who would be on it, given the levels of secrecy required and the need to avoid any perceived or real political bias? One thing for certain, this overseeing committee should be independent of government but still answerable to parliament.
Following exhaustive and comprehensive Senate committee scrutiny that involved much public involvement and transparency, the now resulting bill is a far improved, better managed, better coordinated and more strongly civil libertarian package that largely addresses the concerns first expressed by the Democrats. The Democrats support this legislation to spell out the activities and responsibilities of our intelligence services. It is important that such legislation is balanced, taking into account the special needs for secrecy in intelligence services but also the demands of the community and parliament for an appropriate accountability framework. We believe that properly considered and constructed legislation can enhance the standing and accountability of our intelligence services.
Part 2 of the Intelligence Services Bill 2001 sets out the functions of ASIS. They include obtaining intelligence about the capabilities, intentions or activities of people or organisations outside of Australia, conducting counterintelligence activities and liasing with the intelligence and security services of other countries. The key function of ASIS is to collect foreign intelligence for the purpose of the promotion of Australia's interests and its security. It is an important qualification that in performing its functions ASIS must not plan for or undertake paramilitary activities involving violence against the person or the use of weapons. ASIS is an important part of the intelligence community. In the financial year 2000-01, it had a budget of $42.6 million, a significant proportion of the $120 million estimated as the overall expenses on security and intelligence services. It is appropriate that its functions now be spelt out in legislation and subject to proper review.
To enhance accountability, the bills propose a new joint parliamentary committee. The new committee will replace the parliamentary Joint Statutory Committee on ASIO. Its jurisdiction will be expanded to include ASIS and DSD and will have functions which are different in some respects. The scope of the committee's terms of reference will be quite limited. It will review the administration of expenditure by ASIO, ASIS and DSD and will consider any matter referred to it by the minister or by a resolution of either house of parliament. It will not be authorised to review the intelligence gathering priorities of agencies within its jurisdiction, it will not review information provided by a foreign government where the government does not consent to the disclosure of that information, and it will be precluded from reviewing a range of other operational matters.
Scrutiny of intelligence services always involves compromise. The full public accountability normally insisted on in relation to government agencies may not be appropriate in the case of intelligence services. Nonetheless, no government agency is above the law and none may be permitted to act entirely outside the scope of parliamentary review. The Democrats welcome the inclusion of ASIS and DSD in the provisions relating to the parliamentary joint committee. We will follow with interest the activities of the committee, with a view to determining whether further refinement of the legal relationship between it and the intelligence agencies is necessary at some point in the future.
The bill imposes a number of limitations on the activities by intelligence agencies. A crucial limitation to which I have referred earlier is that ASIS must not plan for or undertake paramilitary activities or activities involving violence against the person or the use of weapons. Other limitations include the following: ASIS and DSD must not perform police or law enforcement functions except in limited circumstances where such activities are incidental to the performance of other legitimate functions; ASIS and DSD may not undertake any activity unless it is necessary for the proper performance of their functions; ASIS and DSD must develop rules regarding the manner in which they communicate information about Australian citizens which respect the privacy of those citizens; and ASIS and DSD may only engage in activities in the interests of Australia's national security, foreign relations or national economic wellbeing as they are affected by the capabilities, intentions or activities of people or organisations outside Australia. Some of these limitations are very broad, but nonetheless they offer a useful guide to the limitations on the activities of the agencies. This is preferable to the current state of uncertainty.
However, the Democrats remain concerned about the broad amenities conferred by the bill upon agencies and their operatives. There is potential for these immunities to be abused, particularly given the secrecy surrounding the activities of these agencies. The Australian Democrats is a party that is committed to accountability and a party that strongly opposes secrecy in government.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2001-09-27,"—The Labor Party is supporting Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2001. The bill amends a number of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business portfolio statutes to ensure conformity with chapter 2 of the Criminal Code Act 1995. This process has been occurring across portfolios, giving Commonwealth criminal offences a standard formulation of the elements of fault, burden of proof and penalty. My main purpose in addressing this bill today is to draw the Senate's attention to, and indeed reiterate, the basis of our support of this legislation, which is that this bill does not—and I stress, does not—create any new offences or remove any existing offences. The Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, Mr Abbott, gave the following undertaking in the House's Main Committee. He said:
I am grateful for the comments of the member for Dickson and I can assure her that this bill does not create any new offences. It does not actually deal with penalties at all in respect of occupational health and safety. It does not change the effect of existing offences. What the bill aims to do is clarify the effect of existing offences and ensure that they operate in exactly the same way after the application of the principles of the code as they have always operated. I understand from my departmental officers that we have advice from the Attorney-General's Department that that is the effect of the bill.
On this basis I commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,"<title>EMPLOYMENT, WORKPLACE RELATIONS AND SMALL BUSINESS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (APPLICATION OF CRIMINAL CODE) BILL 2001</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,33,1,speech

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2001-09-27,"—The opposition supports the application of the Criminal Code Act 1995 to the relevant acts administered within the Defence portfolio. We support the necessary amendments to ensure that there is compliance and consistency with the general principles of the code. Accordingly, we are in fact supporting this bill. Obviously the Criminal Code and this bill have particular relevance to the Defence Force Discipline Act. We believe it is important that the offence-creating provisions of the DFDA will be set out in a consistent format so that Defence Force personnel can easily understand them and so that those in the ADF who are not legally qualified but responsible for enforcing many of the DFDA provisions are able to do so effectively.
The opposition supports the measures to modernise and improve Defence legislation and in particular, as I have indicated, to bring the operation of the DFDA into line with civilian criminal law. In short, because of the time constraints we have, I indicate that we are happy to support a bill which is consistent with other bills which achieve similar objectives across a range of portfolios and which we believe will give ADF personnel greater certainty, greater protection and greater confidence under the criminal law.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (APPLICATION OF CRIMINAL CODE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,34,1,speech

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2001-09-27,"—The Australian Democrats are committed to deepening an innovation culture in Australia. We recognise that the development of human and intellectual capital is basic to the success of an innovation society in a global knowledge economy. That means we need robust intellectual property systems that allow for incentives for investment in developing intellectual property, and that enable the rapid diffusion of intellectual property while balancing the needs, of course, of community and consumers. 
The Patents Amendment Bill 2001 strengthens the current patent system. The principal reasons why this needs to be done are that, under the current arrangements, Australian patents are susceptible to costly challenge and there is an increasing risk that Australia will become a dumping ground for patents that do not cut the mustard in other jurisdictions, thus limiting Australian R&D. Currently, about 90 per cent of Australian patents are held by non-Australian entities. 
In our view, there are a number of defects in this bill, and we will be moving a series of amendments to it. Our primary concerns are as follows. Firstly, there is an unreasonably high threshold for patents due to the bill's widening of the scope of the required prior art base that a person skilled in the art is likely to possess. The expansion creates interpretative difficulties as patents could be knocked out if applicants were unfamiliar with, say, a Mongolian journal article. However, it goes beyond the Ergas review's recommendations that knowledge should be limited to that which a skilled person could reasonably expect to know, understand or find. We also will move amendments in relation to an onerous and potentially costly requirement for applicants to provide the commissioner with all searches of the prior art, even if not directly related to the application. This could have major compliance and cost consequences for large research institutions and universities such as the CSIRO. I am delighted that the government have acknowledged and recognised these concerns. They have indicated support for five of our amendments which go to those problems—that is, Democrat amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6. 
In addition, the bill allows the introduction of a grace period by regulation to coincide with the commencement of the bill. The intent is to ensure that prior publication, for example in an academic journal, would no longer defeat a patent application because it was in the public domain prior to the application. The concern is that Europe has not instituted or recognised such a mechanism; thus implementation could damage Australian patent applications. The regulation does not form part of the bill before us, but I would like to place it on the record that, while the Democrats support the concept of a grace period, we are likely to disallow any instrument that introduces it prior to the resolution of this particular issue in Europe.
—You cannot disallow it—
—I re-emphasise that government officers and Democrat officers have worked particularly well on this legislation, so I am not quite sure what that interjection was about. There is a further amendment which I understand the government will not be supporting. That is an amendment—as many in the chamber would be aware—that I have moved previously. Certainly my predecessor, Senator John Coulter, has done so. I have also moved a private member's bill seeking to prohibit the patenting of genes and gene sequences. I have placed on record many times before in this place my concerns that we would allow that—that there would be some exclusivity and patenting of genes and gene sequences. I still urge the chamber to consider debating the private member's bill, which I think I tabled back in 1996. I know that Senator Harradine and other backbenchers on both sides of the parliament have, over the years, indicated support for that private member's bill, but to this day it has not been debated—and certainly not supported.
I understand the government today will not be supporting that, but it remains an issue of concern that genes and gene sequences can be patented. The amendments before us would prevent that from occurring. I make it clear for the record, however, that provided one or other of the processes—the processes by which genes are extracted from the cells, the processes by which the extracted genes are manipulated or the specific uses to which the genes may be put—shows the qualities of novelty or inventiveness, qualities that are required under the act, in sufficient degree, they would be patentable. I am sure the government and others understand that distinction, given that they are not prepared to debate that private member's bill or support the amendment. I endorse that amendment and commend it to the chamber, because in this day and age we should be putting protective mechanisms in place to ensure that people's genes, DNA—and certainly gene sequences—cannot be owned exclusively, cannot be patented. It is a very straightforward amendment; I hope it gets support from the chamber.",SENATE,<title>PATENTS AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,37,1,speech

I had a small outburst— Senator Stott Despoja is nodding—but just for the record we need to know it is the Senate that actually agrees, even if one individual moves to disallow a regulation. Now that I have got that off my chest I feel better! 
 (Senator George Campbell)—You are appropriately admonished, Senator Stott Despoja!
—You have got to pay attention to detail. I was on the Regulations and Ordinances Committee for a long time, and it is a very important factor for me. Despite just having chastised Senator Stott Despoja, I put on the record the government's appreciation for the work that the Democrats have done with the government. I have been advised that they worked constructively with the government to finetune the measures contained in the Patents Amendment Bill 2001.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2001-09-27,"—I seek leave to incorporate a speech on behalf of Senator Carr.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
This Bill amends the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 to provide extra funding as announced in the “Australians Working Together” package released on 2 April.
The Bill provides additional funding for projects involving partnerships between communities, industry and education providers, and support for vocational learning for indigenous secondary school students.
It is estimated that around 1600 students will be assisted between 2002 and 2004 through expenditure of $6 million on early intervention strategies based on the Polly Farmer Foundation `Gumala Mirnuwarni' project in the Roebourne area of Western Australia. This project, which began in 1997, has been improving educational outcomes, with average attendance for project students better than the school average for all students, both indigenous and non-indigenous.
The Bill also provides another $2.6 million which will be used to support vocational education in schools, entry-level skills training, individual mentoring by local business and community leaders, and case management, according to the particular needs of communities.
Another $2.86 million will be provided through this legislation over three years to offset the impact on non-profit Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations of changes to the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986.
Without this assistance, these organisations would be disadvantaged by the changes to Fringe Benefits Tax arrangements, which restrict the eligibility of charities and other non-profit organisations to tax concessions on no more than $30,000 worth of benefit per employee. The additional funding in this Bill will help non-profit Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations to continue to attract appropriately-qualified staff through competitive salary packages.
A recent study, commissioned by the Department of Health and Aged Care, found that the FBT changes, if not offset by additional funding, were likely to bring about staff cuts and/or program reductions.
The ALP supports this legislation in its provision of additional funding to assist Indigenous education and training, but we place on record our concerns about the impact this Government's changes to ABSTUDY have had on participation in tertiary education by indigenous Australians.
In 1998, the Minister announced changes to ABSTUDY which he said would “open up more opportunities for Indigenous students to access a wider range of assistance to achieve better education and employment outcomes”. He insisted that the changes would be budget neutral, a proposition which defied logic, given the reductions in payments for mature age students which were involved. Now we have the proof that the Minister, in making his budget neutral claim, was either being extremely naive or was seeking to mislead.
Expenditure on tertiary ABSTUDY fell by more than $5 million between 1999 and 2000, when the changes were implemented, and the total number of indigenous tertiary students in receipt of ABSTUDY fell by 1,568.
This information comes from the Minister's own Department, in response to a number of questions about indigenous education during the Senate estimates process in June this year.
The Department's figures also show that, in 2000, the proportion of indigenous students in higher education fell from 1.2 per cent in 1999 to 1.1 per cent.
In response, DETYA advised that in 2000, the number of indigenous students enrolled in higher education was 7,350 - 651 fewer than in 1999.
They also advised that the number of commencing students was 3,510, which was 630 fewer than in 1999.
Participation of indigenous Australians in vocational education and training also fell in 2000: from 3.1 per cent in 1999 to 3.0 per cent.
There has been, therefore, an across-the-board fall in indigenous participation in post-secondary education and training.
The Department said in its written response that “We are unable to confirm the reason for the decline and are undertaking further research into the issue”.
It is extremely difficult to escape the conclusion that the cuts to ABSTUDY are directly responsible for this disastrous decline in participation, among one of the most educationally disadvantaged groups in our community.
Since records began, the trend has been positive, albeit slow. Now this Minister, and this Government, can claim the dubious honour of actually setting back indigenous education and taking away opportunities from some of our citizens who need the greatest help.
It is time this Government—which is wasting $172 million this year alone in advertising itself—got its priorities right, and looked at the real needs of Australia and Australians.
I would like to ask the Minister what that further research has revealed, and whether he can deny that his own punitive changes to ABSTUDY provide the only valid explanation of this significant reversal of a trend of increasing participation which extends back as far as records go.
He dismissed claims that the cuts in support to mature-age students would lead to declines in the numbers of indigenous students, and insisted that the changes were budget neutral.
Now we have information from his own Department which shows that the critics were right and the Minister wrong.
Of the $8.6 million in extra program funds provided by this Bill, $5 million has already been taken from ABSTUDY.
The Opposition will be supporting this Bill. But we would like more honesty and integrity from the Government and the Minister in dealing with the serious problems facing Indigenous Australians.",SENATE,<title>INDIGENOUS EDUCATION (TARGETED ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,38,1,speech

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2001-09-27,"—I am delighted to take a few seconds to speak on the Abolition of Compulsory Age Retirement (Statutory Officeholders) Bill 2001. I know it is non-controversial, but I have to say `Hallelujah!' because, when I sat on the other side of the chamber, every time a bill came in—whether for the maritime museum authority or the national museum authority—with a compulsory retirement age for holders of statutory positions, Senator Baume, I think it was, and I moved a clause systematically, bit by bit, to get rid of that dreadfully discriminatory clause. We were told over and over that it could not be done and we were told over and over that we could not get rid of the compulsory retirement age for public servants. In two parliamentary sessions, one after the other, I put up private member's bills.
A perfect example is the National Maritime Museum. They had an ex-naval officer with enormous experience on the board who had to retire at 65 and who was not able to continue being a holder of a statutory office. It seemed to me to be a ridiculous system in this day and age when people live longer, when they are healthier and when they have a wealth of experience, they can give back to the community—for example, in positions on statutory boards, government boards and the like and in institutions such as the National Library, the Maritime College and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. When I look at all the institutions listed here—there are pages of them—no wonder Senator Baume and I could not get through them all. Every time one of these came up in the chamber and we had a chance to amend it, we did it. Now in government we have been able to include the whole lot. 
I was responsible for the government's response to the International Year of Older Persons. As a result of that year, we have seen enormous changes to attitudes to older people. The community is much more accepting and much more positive about the contribution older people can make. During our consultations right round Australia, older people kept saying to us—they did not ask for more money—`What we want is to be seen positively, to be seen as contributors rather than as takers.' In this bill we are saying to people, `Yes, you have got ability; yes, you have got something to contribute; yes, we have listened to those consultations and we have responded.' I do not often say this about bills, but I am delighted to commend this bill to the chamber.",SENATE,<title>ABOLITION OF COMPULSORY AGE RETIREMENT (STATUTORY OFFICEHOLDERS) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,42,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2001-09-27,"—I would also like to speak briefly on the Abolition of Compulsory Age Retirement (Statutory Officeholders) Bill 2001. The opposition supports this bill. It amends acts which specify compulsory age retirement limits for statutory officeholders by repealing provisions that prevent the appointment of a person over a certain age or for a term that would continue beyond a certain age. We note that the amendments will affect neither the term of existing statutory officeholders appointed before the bill commences nor federal judicial appointments or ADF personnel.
The opposition supported the Public Service Act 1999, which had the effect of removing compulsory age retirement from the Australian Public Service. We see the changes in this legislation as complementing that measure in the Public Service Act. It is overdue, as Senator Patterson said, and is a welcome recognition that age is often an artificial barrier.
—The closer you get, the more you understand it.
—I am getting closer and closer, Senator Patterson. The only thing I can say is that it is at the same rate as everybody else. It is important to say that older people can and do make as valuable a contribution as anyone else in a variety of statutory positions. It is for those reasons that the bill is commended and supported by the opposition.",SENATE,<title>ABOLITION OF COMPULSORY AGE RETIREMENT (STATUTORY OFFICEHOLDERS) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,42,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2001-09-27,"—The Democrats support the Abolition of Compulsory Age Retirement (Statutory Officeholders) Bill 2001, too. We have always supported sensible legislative change to remove discrimination on the basis of sexuality, gender, race, religion and, in this case, age. The bill abolishes legislative provisions in Commonwealth acts that set compulsory retirement age limits—commonly 65 years of age for statutory officeholders. One pressing issue facing Australia is the need to retain the expertise and life experiences brought to workplaces by older Australians. Statutory officeholders are selected on the basis of specialist expertise or knowledge, and some statutory officeholders reach the age of 65 or are older.
The value of older Australians to society and to the workplace was recognised last year in parliament with the third Senior Australian of the Year award. Last year's winner, Professor Freda Briggs, was a proud campaigner against mandatory retirement age. In her role as an educator, author, scholar and ambassador, Freda has ceaselessly and passionately worked towards her vision to provide a safer and more caring world for children. 
Freda Briggs was born in England in the 1930s. Her childhood was lost to the years of war, impoverishment and rationing. Her first job as a filing clerk paid 3 for a 48-hour week. In 1975, Freda and her family moved to Australia so that she could take up the position of Director of Early Childhood studies at the State College of Victoria—a pioneering position and the first course of its kind in Australia. In 1980, Freda was appointed Foundation Dean of the De Lissa Institute of Early Childhood and Family Studies; in 1991, as Associate Professor of Childhood Development at the University of South Australia; and, in 1994, as a professor—a position she continues to hold after winning an appeal against mandatory retirement.
Freda paved the way for many older Australians to retain their positions after the age of retirement. She recalls that many eyebrows were raised when she was given an employment contract for the post of professor that would take her up to 71 years of age. This was the first time at the university that a professor was contracted beyond the age of retirement. A tireless advocate for children, she still travels the country voluntarily to provide advice on issues relating to the educational needs of veterans' children. She also travels extensively through Asia and the Pacific, at her own expense, consulting on humanitarian aid organisations. Since the age of 60, Freda has published more than a book a year and continues to publish extensively in international journals. 
I thought I would mention Freda as one prime example of how older Australians have much to give. In fact, if compulsory retirement in the Senate was 65, we would possibly have to force the retirement of six senators in this place—I will not name them. 
The need for action on age discrimination has been noted for some considerable time, but the legislation has been a long time in coming. In launching the report Age matters: a report on age discrimination in July 2000, Chris Sidoti, as human rights commissioner, commented:
For over 10 years federal governments of both political persuasions have talked about this but done little. The situation now is that the Commonwealth lags far behind every state and territory in protecting people from discrimination based on age ... it's time to catch up. 
The government should be congratulated for catching up, for changing the discriminatory practices that existed in legislation that go against the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The Democrats will indeed support this bill and will continue to support any legislation that reduces discrimination, be it based on gender, sexuality, race, age or religion. 
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Bill read a second time, and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate.",SENATE,<title>ABOLITION OF COMPULSORY AGE RETIREMENT (STATUTORY OFFICEHOLDERS) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,42,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2001-09-27,"—Before being interrupted earlier, I was speaking to the ASIS bill and, in summing up, saying that we Democrats do remain concerned, to some degree, about the broad immunities conferred by the bill upon agencies and their operatives. There is potential for these immunities to be abused, particularly given the secrecy surrounding the activities of these agencies. The Australian Democrats is a party that is committed to accountability and a party that strongly opposes secrecy in government. Intelligence agencies are in many respects the most secretive and most unaccountable of all government agencies. Their ability to abuse their position of trust is a natural cause for concern. However, they clearly have a genuine need to maintain a degree of secrecy. 
We acknowledge that this legislation is a step forward in the legitimisation of our intelligence agencies. All major government agencies should be established under statute with the authority of parliament. Intelligence agencies are no different in this regard and the Democrats welcome the establishment of a statutory foundation for the ASIS and DSD for the first time. There is nothing wrong with bringing the Australian secret services under statute. Indeed, there is finally open recognition of the role that these specialist practitioners play in protecting all Australians. But where we are setting the rules for such a dangerous game, these rules should include absolute checks and balances, especially when a mistake could cost lives. We support the bill. ",SENATE,<title>INTELLIGENCE SERVICES BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,43,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2001-09-27,"—I am pleased to speak on the Intelligence Services Bill 2001 and cognate legislation. These bills will place Australia's foreign intelligence collection agencies—the Australian Secret Intelligence Service and the Defence Signals Directorate—on a statutory basis. The legislation will also establish a new joint parliamentary committee to oversee the administration and the expenditure of ASIS and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. As a result of an amendment to the bill in the House of Representatives, the new joint committee will also cover DSD. Labor is strongly committed to putting both ASIS and DSD on a statutory basis and making them subject to appropriate parliamentary oversight. In the context of the recent horrific terrorist attack in the United States, it is important to note that this legislation will enhance the effectiveness of Australia's intelligence agencies in dealing with threats to our national security. 
These bills were introduced into parliament on 27 June this year and referred to the Joint Select Committee on the Intelligence Services. That committee was chaired by Mr Jull. The shadow minister for foreign affairs, Mr Brereton, served as the deputy chair. Together with Mr Brereton, six Labor members and senators served on the committee: Mr McLeay, Mr Melham, Mr O'Keefe, Senator Ray and me. I think this committee worked very well and it is appropriate during this speech on the second reading of the bill in the Senate that I acknowledge the contribution of committee members. It was undertaken in a cooperative spirit—a spirit of bipartisanship. I do not often say that about committee work but, when it can be genuinely said, it ought to be genuinely said. That is the case with this particular committee.
Senator Ray mentioned when the committee report was tabled that Mr Jull had done a very good job as chairman and the committee secretariat had also done a excellent job in producing a substantial report, I suspect, in record time. Labor members of the committee proposed a wide range of recommendations to improve the bill and enhance its accountability mechanisms. All Labor recommendations were adopted by the select committee, which produced a unanimous and bipartisan report tabled and debated in the Senate on 27 August. I am pleased that the government has very substantially accepted all but one of the 18 recommendations of the joint select committee. The government has accepted the major recommendation of the Labor committee members concerning measures to limit the bill's immunity provisions, to enhance its privacy measures and to include the Defence Signals Directorate in the scope of a new joint parliamentary committee. I also understand that the government put forward amendments in response to Labor recommendations dealing with possible ASIS and DSD intelligence activities concerning Australian persons. 
As Senator Ray handed me this note—thank you, Senator Ray—I did detect a certain hint from him in relation to the way the Senate might be able to proceed with its business. Never let it be said that I require the subtlety of Senator Ray; I was intending to take that course of action anyway. I even made a promise to the officials that I would, Senator Ray. Before I take the step of incorporating the remainder of my remarks, given the circumstances, I was going to indicate the approach that the opposition had adopted when undertaking a constructive approach to important legislation like this dealing with the underlying issues of how best to protect Australia's security. Labor did view the central bill as it had been originally drafted. Two have been quite unsatisfactory. We believed that the original bill failed to provide adequate safeguards for the rights and privacy of Australian citizens at home and abroad. The committee's bipartisan report provided a way forward, and I am pleased that the government has seen its way clear to adopt the thrust of the committee's recommendations. The amendments that the government proposed in response to the joint select committee's report will provide a much improved legislative framework and accountability regime for ASIS and DSD operations. 
It is not normally my approach to incorporate—in fact, for me, it is almost unprecedented—but given, firstly, the nature of the debate on this bill which, as I have indicated is bipartisan in its nature and, secondly, the pressure on the time we have in the Senate program it is my intention now, having made those brief but, I hope, important introductory remarks to my speech in this second reading debate, to seek leave to incorporate the remainder of what I think would have been, if I had delivered it, an outstanding contribution—
—You are trying your luck now!
—I thought that you would be sufficiently generous, Senator Patterson. I seek leave to incorporate the remainder of my speech.
 (Senator Calvert)—Is leave granted?
—No.
—Leave has not been granted, so I intend now to punish Senator Ray. 
—I cannot recognise that interjection because the person was not sitting in his own seat.
—Senator Faulkner ought always to watch behind rather than opposite.
—I have learned that over the years the hard way, I can assure you.
Leave granted.
The remainder of Senator Faulkner's speech read as follows—
The Intelligence Services Bill 2001 draws extensively on provisions and precedents drawn from the 1979 ASIO Act and the United Kingdom's Intelligence Services Act 1994. The bill interfaces with the ASIO Act and the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 1986. 
The primary functions of ASIS and DSD are defined in sections 6 and 7 of the bill as obtaining intelligence about the capabilities, intentions or activities of people or organisations outside Australia and communicating such intelligence in accordance with the government's requirements. 
ASIS is also empowered to conduct counterintelligence activities and liaise with foreign intelligence and security services. DSD is further empowered to assist Commonwealth and state authorities with respect to information security issues and cryptography and communication technologies. 
Section 11 of the bill provides that ASIS and DSD are to perform their functions `only in the interests of Australia's national security, Australia's foreign relations or Australia's national economic well-being' and only to the extent that these matters are affected by the capabilities, intentions or activities of people or organisations outside Australia. ASIS and DSD functions do not include police functions or law enforcement. 
Section 12 of the bill provides that ASIS and DSD must not undertake any activity unless the activity is necessary for the proper performance of their functions or authorised or required by another act. 
This evening I would like to highlight a number of features of the bill which have been of concern to Labor and which the government has agreed to amend. 
Subclause 6(1)(e) of the bill further empowers ASIS to undertake such other activities as the responsible minister directs relating to the capabilities, intentions or activities of people or organisations outside Australia. 
This subclause is intended to provide a degree of flexibility for the government in its tasking of ASIS. It will allow the government to modify ASIS' functional activities, under very limited conditions, should the need arise. Subclause 6(2) details these limited conditions. 
The responsible minister must consult other ministers with related responsibilities prior to directing ASIS to undertake any other activities under subclause 6(1)(e).The minister must be satisfied that there are arrangements in place to ensure there are defined limits to the activity in question and that acts done in relation to the activity must be reasonable. A direction under subclause 6(1)(e) must be in writing. 
Very importantly, subclause 6(4) provides that, in performing its functions, ASIS must not plan for or undertake paramilitary activities or activities involving violence against the person or the use of weapons. 
The joint select committee recognised the necessity for the `other activities' provisions of subclause 6(1)(e) and endorsed the constraints imposed by the bill, especially the prohibition on violence against the person and paramilitary activities. 
However, in order to establish an appropriate measure of parliamentary accountability, the select committee recommended that the bill be amended to require the responsible minister to advise the new joint parliamentary committee of the nature of any other activities to be undertaken by ASIS. The government has accepted this recommendation. 
The government has also proposed an appropriate definition of `paramilitary activities' as `activities involving the use of an armed unit, or other armed group, that is not part of a country's official defence or law enforcement forces'.
A major issue of concern to Labor that arose during the select committee's deliberations was the scope of possible ASIS and DSD intelligence collection related to Australian persons. Sections 6 and 7 of the bill will empower ASIS and DSD to obtain information in respect of foreign persons and organisations overseas and Australian persons and organisations overseas. 
In evidence to the select committee, both ASIS and DSD emphasised that, in the normal course of operations, neither agency targets Australian citizens overseas for intelligence collection. Both agencies stated their purpose as being foreign intelligence collection. They also emphasised the significance of the nationality rules that place constraint on the handling of information relating to Australian citizens that may be obtained incidentally in the course of foreign intelligence operations. 
Both ASIS and DSD did acknowledge, however, that, in certain limited circumstances, it could be appropriate and permissible under current practice to collect intelligence concerning an Australian person overseas.
While this may not be common practice, intelligence collection activities focused on Australian citizens and organisations overseas will be allowable under the bill. The communication of such intelligence would be subject to rules made by the responsible minister in accordance with section 15 and having regard to the need to ensure that the privacy of Australian persons is preserved as far as is consistent with the proper performance by the agencies of their functions. 
It is clearly possible to envisage circumstances in which intelligence collection related to an Australian person would be appropriate and desirable. An Australian person engaged in terrorist activities overseas is one obvious possible example. However, reliance on the nationality rules, which are not incorporated into the bill and can be changed by responsible ministers, appears to us to be an insufficient long-term safeguard for the privacy and the interests of Australian citizens overseas. 
This is especially so when comparison is made with the stringent legislative controls on covert intelligence collection within Australia for national security purposes that are in the ASIO Act 1979, the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 and the Telecommunications Act 1997. 
Accordingly, at the initiative of Labor members, the joint select committee recommended that the bill be redrafted to include a requirement for specific ministerial authorisation of any intelligence collection, or other activities relating to Australian persons for such collection or other activities, to relate to national security and that such authorisations not exceed six months duration, unless renewed by the minister. Such an approach would be broadly comparable to the special powers warrant provisions of division 2 of the ASIO Act 1979.
The government has accepted the overall thrust of these recommendations; however, developing an acceptable definition of national security has proved fraught with difficulty. We can all put forward definitions of national security, but it is very difficult to achieve agreement on a definition that is sufficiently inclusive to cover relevant contingencies but not so expansive as to open the door to undesirable possibilities. 
It is also noteworthy that the term `national security' is used without definition in no fewer than 53 other acts of parliament and 22 separate regulations. In these circumstances, the government has asserted that a definition of national security in this bill could have uncertain and wide-ranging implications for other legislation.
Following very constructive and detailed discussions that the Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs had with the Director-General of ASIS, Mr Allan Taylor, the Director-General of ASIO, Mr Dennis Richardson, the Director of DSD, Mr Ron Bonighton, and officers of the various agencies and the Attorney-General's Department, an alternative approach has been developed. 
Instead of trying to define `national security', new clauses specify precisely the circumstances in which a minister may give an authorisation concerning an Australian person. This approach is to be set out in proposed new subclauses 8(1) and 9(1)(a) and (1)(b), which will require ASIS and DSD to obtain ministerial authorisation under section 9 before undertaking any activity for the specific purpose of producing intelligence on an Australian person who is overseas or before undertaking an activity that will have, or is likely to have, a direct effect on an Australian person overseas.
Before a minister gives an authorisation for an ASIS or DSD operation specifically directed towards, or likely to directly affect, an Australian person overseas, the responsible minister will have to be satisfied that the person in question is or is likely to be involved in one or more of a limited number of activities. I will list these activities for the benefit of the Senate. They are: 
·	activities that present a significant risk to a person's safety; 
·	acting for, or on behalf of, a foreign power; 
·	activities that are, or are likely to be, a threat to security; 
·	activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or the movement of goods which are or would be subject to Australia's defence export controls; 
·	committing a serious crime by moving money, goods or people; 
·	committing a serious crime by using or transferring intellectual property; or 
·	committing a serious crime by transmitting data or signals by means of electromagnetic energy. 
A number of aspects of this new approach are of significance. The proposed new subclause referring to activities that present a significant risk to a person's safety covers risk of death, injury, kidnapping or imprisonment. An Australian person engaged in terrorist activities overseas, whether directed against our nation or any other country, would clearly be a legitimate intelligence target. 
The term `foreign power' will have the same meaning as in the ASIO Act 1979—that is to say, a foreign government, an entity directed or controlled by a foreign government or a foreign political organisation.
`Acting for or on behalf of a foreign power' will include Australian persons holding office in or working for a foreign government or a foreign political organisation. Mere membership of a foreign political party will not in itself amount to acting for or on behalf of a foreign power. `Security' has the same meaning as in the ASIO Act 1979; that is, the protection of Australia from espionage, sabotage, politically motivated violence, promotion of communal violence, attacks on Australia's defence system or acts of foreign interference. 
The proposed new subclause referring to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the movement of goods subject to Australian defence export controls will effectively cover Australian persons who may be engaged in nuclear, chemical or biological weapons proliferation or in conventional arms trafficking. This provision is clearly in the interests of both our national security and international efforts to combat proliferation in terrorism. 
`Serious crime' will be defined as conduct that, if engaged in within or in connection with Australia, would constitute an offence against the law of the Commonwealth, a state or a territory punishable by imprisonment for a period exceeding 12 months. All authorisations of intelligence activity under the proposed new subsection 9 will be subject to the restrictions of section 11 that provide that the functions of the agencies can be performed only in the interests of Australia's national security, Australia's foreign relations or Australia's national economic wellbeing. 
Thus, for example, authorisation of activities for the specific purpose of collecting intelligence on an Australian person suspected of involvement in a serious crime must also relate to Australia's national security, foreign relations or national economic wellbeing. People-smuggling would be covered, as it relates to an aspect of national security, that is, our border control.
It is also of note that the proposed new subsection 9 will require the agreement of the Attorney-General for any intelligence activity concerning an Australian person and a threat to security as defined by the ASIO Act. The involvement of the Attorney-General is an additional safeguard, and this provision will preserve the existing relationship between ASIS and DSD on the one hand and ASIO on the other. It further mirrors ASIO's foreign intelligence collection role inside Australia, which is subject to authorisation by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Defence.
Overall, these proposed new provisions provide a satisfactory framework to give effect to the intention of the joint select committee recommendations and provide appropriate limits and safeguards on intelligence activity concerning Australian persons. 
In the absence of an overall definition of `national security', the government has also agreed to Labor's proposals for two new clauses which, drawing on comparable provisions of the ASIO Act, make it clear that the agencies have no role in respect of legitimate Australian political activity. To be incorporated in sections 11 and 12 of the bill, these new provisions include an explicit statement that the functions of the agencies do not include undertaking any activity for the purpose of furthering the interests of an Australian political party or other Australian political organisation. 
Furthermore, both the Director-General of ASIS and the Director of DSD will be duty-bound to take all reasonable steps to ensure their agencies are kept free from any interference or considerations not relevant to their legislated functions and that nothing is done that might lend colour to any suggestion that either agency is concerned to further or protect the interests of any particular section of the community or to undertake any activity beyond their legitimate roles.
Potentially extensive immunities from civil and criminal liability for ASIS and DSD under section 14 of the Intelligence Services Bill and division 476.5 of the associated act were the subject of lengthy consideration by the joint select committee. ASIS and DSD asserted that immunities were required on the grounds of global technological change and Australian laws that impose unintended constraints on intelligence collection overseas. Labor members of the joint committee spent considerable time exploring precisely what activities the immunity provisions would cover and how immunity might work in practice.
The joint select committee report made a number of important recommendations that will significantly narrow the potential scope of the immunities provided by the bill and establish safeguards and protocols for their operation. In this, the joint select committee was assisted by the valuable drafting input of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. 
Amongst other safeguards, the committee recommended that the bill be amended to make it clear that the immunity provisions do not permit any act inside Australia which ASIO could not do without proper authorisation under the ASIO Act 1979, the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 or the Telecommunications Act 1997. Such a measure will ensure that there is no backdoor for covert intelligence collection in Australia outside the established legal checks and balances. 
The committee further recommended that the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security have the responsibility of certifying that an act has been done in proper performance of an agency's functions and may therefore be covered by the provisions of section 14. 
The government has accepted these recommendations and made amendments to both the Intelligence Services Bill, division 476.5 and the Cybercrime Bill. The government has also accepted the recommendations of the joint select committee that protocols for the operation of section 14 and division 476.5 should be developed and approved by responsible ministers and the Attorney-General and that these protocols should be provided to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security before the commencement of this legislation. 
Overall, these proposed amendments and accompanying measures should provide a satisfactory framework for the operation of immunities for ASIS and DSD operations.  
With regard to other provisions of the bill, the government has accepted the select committee's recommendation that arrangements for briefing the Leader of the Opposition about ASIS are the same as those relating to ASIO. 
The government has also accepted a range of recommendations by the joint select committee to ensure that the new joint parliamentary committee will operate along the same lines as the present joint committee on ASIO. The new joint parliamentary committee will not deal with operational matters but will have oversight in relation to expenditure and administration. It will have a significant oversight role in relation to the privacy rules, protocols and the operation of section 14 immunities and any direction to ASIS to undertake other activities.
The government has also accepted Labor's recommendations that the scope of the committee's functions be expanded to include the Defence Signals Directorate. Parliamentary scrutiny of DSD is, we know, highly desirable. The joint committee will consequently be known as the Joint Parliamentary Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD. With these amendments, this bill will significantly enhance parliamentary oversight of Australia's intelligence collection agencies.
One joint select committee recommendation not accepted by the government relates to the provisions excluding operational activities and subjects from the functions of the new joint parliamentary committee. Section 30(3) of the bill provides that the functions of the committee do not include `reviewing particular operations that have been, are being or are proposed to be undertaken by ASIO or ASIS'. The joint select committee report recommended deletion of the words `have been' from the subclause. As this relates to operational matters, albeit in the past, Labor does not consider it imperative to press for the acceptance of this recommendation. 
Operation of the legislation will require careful scrutiny. Should Labor be elected to government at the forthcoming poll, we will commission a review of the operation of the act after two years.
In the context of the terrible tragedies in New York and Washington, some commentators have suggested that democratic societies must sacrifice civil liberties and privacy in the interest of national security. Labor does not believe this is the case. With the major amendments proposed, this bill shows that it is possible to strike a proper balance between accountability and transparency and the secrecy required for effective operations in the national interest. 
The bill has been greatly improved by the amendments that have been proposed by the Select Committee. Labor has initiated them, and we are pleased to have played a part in that. We will be very pleased to support the outcome. We will have achieved this through both sides of politics working through important national interest issues in a very constructive and bipartisan fashion. It is a matter of regret that that has not always been the case in the government's handling of some other recent national interest legislation in this Parliament. 
The Labor Party will support this legislation.

"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2001-09-27,"—My question is to Senator Kemp, the Assistant Treasurer. Can the minister confirm that on page 46 of the ANTS package the Treasurer, Mr Costello, promised that the GST would `ensure that all Australians—especially low and moderate income families—have much stronger incentives to work and save'? Can the minister explain then why the household savings ratio was 5.2 per cent when Mr Howard came into office in March 1996 but has fallen to 3.1 per cent in the June quarter this year?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Living Standards</title>,Questions Without Notice,44,1,question
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2001-09-27,"—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. If, as the government claims, the GST has been so successful in lifting incentives to save, could the minister explain why credit card debt has now risen 21 per cent since the introduction of the GST and has increased from $6.7 billion in February 1996 to $18.7 billion in July this year—an astounding 178 per cent increase since the election of the Howard government? Could the minister also explain why the average credit card debt has blown out from just $964, when the Howard Government was elected, to almost $2,000 per card in July this year? Isn't that because the GST has put a squeeze on family budgets and led to massive job losses, particularly in the retail and housing sectors?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Living Standards</title>,Questions Without Notice,44,1,question
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2001-09-27,"—There are two aspects to that question—the relationship with what was promised in the ANTS package and the assistance that was given to low and middle income families. Let me say, Senator, this government has delivered on its promise.
—Wrong.
—I refer Senator Sherry to a recent study by NATSEM which showed in fact the very substantial gains that Australian families made as a result of tax reform. It is not surprising, to be quite frank, that that would happen, because tax reform delivered the largest tax cuts in Australian history. The tax reform included a special package for families of the order of $3 billion. So those benefits alone were able to deliver very substantial gains to Australian families after allowing for the effects of the GST. It is not hard to see that many families will be $40, $50 or $60 a week better off as a result of the ANTS package.
But when you look at the macro scene, you can also see how this government has been able to deliver very substantial gains to Australian families. To Senator Hogg I point out that one of the biggest gains has come through the lower interest rates that have been delivered. When we came into government, the home mortgage rate was 10 per cent-plus; it is now under seven per cent. The difference that this makes, Senator Hogg, on an average mortgage is very, very considerable indeed. So that is another way that we have been able to deliver for Australian families.
I have mentioned the tax changes which assisted Australian families and the interest rate changes which have assisted Australian families. Another area where we have assisted Australian families is that of real wages, which have increased under this government. Senator George Campbell, in a very important study that he did on this issue, pointed out that one of the great failings of the former Hawke and Keating governments was that real wages fell in a number of years. In fact—and I think Senator George Campbell would certainly confirm my comments, because I have read his study carefully—real wages barely increased in 13 years under Labor. Let me just summarise: we have the very big tax changes which have helped Australian families, the interest rate changes which have helped Australian families and the real wages increase which has also helped Australian families.
The savings ratio—which was the second part of the question—jumps around from quarter to quarter. If Senator Hogg viewed the statistics over a period of time, he would see how that particular ratio has jumped around from quarter to quarter. But I think we have been able to deliver—and this government takes real pride in this—real benefits to Australian families. As for the final benefit—I do not know that I have time, perhaps Senator Hogg could ask me a supplementary—that is another very important area where we have been able to deliver substantial gains to Australian families. As my time is on the wing, perhaps if I could have a supplementary I could add to the answer.

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2001-09-27,"—The other point to mention is the very large rise in job creation under this government. Madam President, I refer Senator Hogg to a report issued in August by the Reserve Bank of Australia which, among things, dealt with the issue of household debt. The report did point out that—and I am quoting from the Reserve Bank report fairly I think—the increase in household debt was to levels comparable with other developed countries. The important point that the Reserve Bank made was that the increase in household debt has been accompanied by a substantial increase in household wealth, particularly financial assets. One of those areas we can point to is the very strong rise in super, and Senator Sherry knows very well that one of the great growth sectors under this government has been superannuation.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2001-09-27,"—My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. Is it a fact that our humanitarian program, including the relatively small number of our refugee intake, has not changed for several years? Given the situation in the world today, where there is an increasing number of refugees around the world, is the government intending to increase that figure in the near future? Could the minister also indicate what improvements are being made to the detention centre system to avoid situations like the situation concerning a Vietnamese girl that occurred just recently?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Refugees</title>,Questions Without Notice,46,1,question
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2001-09-27,"—Madam President, I ask a short supplementary question. This death occurred within the last few days. Is the minister aware that the death of the young girl occurred after she had been in a distressed state and crying for over a period of three or four days and was obviously in need of special care? Is the minister making a special investigation as to whether that special care was offered?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Refugees</title>,Questions Without Notice,46,1,question
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2001-09-27,"—I thank Senator Harradine for that question. The question of the intake of refugees into Australia has been the subject of comment lately. In particular, in today's Australian there was an article which quotes a spokesman for the minister as saying that increasing the humanitarian program from 12,000 places would be considered as `part of an international response' to the Afghan refugee crisis. 
I can say that the government is monitoring closely the current refugee situation in Afghanistan and neighbouring countries. Our current view is that the most timely and cost-effective means of alleviating the situation is by providing financial and other aid to countries neighbouring Afghanistan which are sheltering fleeing Afghans. This month the government has agreed to provide an additional $14.3 million to assist in alleviating the situation of displaced Afghans. It is the government's view that there should be an international effort to resettle Afghan refugees as a result of the current crisis. Australia, as it has done in the past, will of course play its part in any burden-sharing exercise. I would stress to Senator Harradine that this is being monitored closely by the government. It is a serious situation, and one which the government is concerned about.
In relation to the death that Senator Harradine referred to, I am advised that there was a death at the Villawood Immigration Detention Centre in the early hours of 26 September this year. I understand that the circumstances surrounding that death are being investigated by the New South Wales police. The cause of death has not yet been determined and, of course, the matter has been referred to the coroner. The government will closely monitor that inquest and ascertain the circumstances surrounding that death and if there is anything that can be done by the government to avoid any future risk in regard to that. 
In relation to the mandatory detention that we have in this country, we have adopted, consistent with the UNHCR's guidelines and conclusions concerning the detention of asylum seekers, appropriate circumstances for the detention of those people. I might add that in Woomera there is a pilot scheme being considered by the minister regarding the detention of women and children. Of course, the government treats that with concern, and we are monitoring how that pilot program is developing. But, in relation to that particular death, though, I do not think I can really say much more than that. We will be following the coroner's inquest closely.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Refugees</title>,Questions Without Notice,46,1,answer

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2001-09-27,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) in response to questions without notice asked by Senator Lundy today relating to information technology outsourcing.
What an interesting day it is today. The question I asked of the coalition government related to the extraordinarily overpriced items as part of the Australian Taxation Office IT outsourcing deal. It is not actually surprising that this information is coming to light now, by virtue of leaks to newspapers, because the coalition have got so much to hide. All these horror stories are now going to come filtering out. Through the last two years, through a Senate inquiry and through Senate estimates, the coalition have gone to great lengths to prevent information and detail about these IT outsourcing contracts from coming to light, including the need for an interim report into the IT outsourcing Senate inquiry dealing with the issue of commercial-in-confidence. It is not surprising that they are putting so much effort into hiding this information, because now we find that in just one of these deals the government are paying six times the market retail price for IT services and products. In another case we had documented, they are paying more than double the price of significant items in IT outsourcing. It begs the question: what else is overpriced within these contracts?
I would like to focus specifically on the answer provided by Senator Kemp when he used a brief provided, presumably, by the Australian Taxation Office. He said things like, `This is on balance the best offer,' and, `It is appropriate that they go for recognised brand names,' and, `These products can be delivered anywhere any time.' In other words, the government has been captured by a contractor and is being forced to pay way over the market price, and it cannot justify it in any other way than by admitting that it has been caught out promoting an arrangement where no savings are being made and government departments are being forced to pay way over market price.
This issue of IT outsourcing and these horror stories we now see coming out will just get the government into further trouble. By virtue of the Australian National Audit Office report and the independent Humphry inquiry, we know that the government was completely caught out in putting in place a very bad arrangement on behalf of many agencies and departments. We know now that between now and the election, and presumably after the election if Labor is fortunate enough to gain the support to win government, we will have to go through and sort this mess out. I ask the coalition now, `Why don't you come clean and show us what is in these contracts and show us just how much Australian taxpayers are being ripped off by these deals?'
It is also worth making mention of the alleged savings arising out of these contracts. Today, we have heard that the government is paying way over market price for a whole range of IT products and services. That does in fact stack up with the findings of the Australian Audit Office which said the government is not making the savings that they have claimed and are not achieving the service outcomes that they have claimed. In fact, despite the government pretending or claiming that they were going to make $100 million worth of savings out of a $500 million contract, investigations of the taxation department show that that contract will barely make $40 million of that $100 million dollars of savings—40 per cent of the promises put forward by Minister Fahey. Indeed, the Audit Office report found that they were making barely half of those savings.
In their inability to actually deliver savings, they have managed to create a circumstance where the tax office has effectively been captured by a multinational corporation providing these IT deals for the next five years. It is also worth focusing on the fact that the savings claims by the coalition are no longer able to be substantiated in any way at all. It has got to the stage now—and I note that Senator Eggleston is probably going to speak on this matter—that despite the government's continued insistence that IT outsourcing in some way has a future, we know by virtue of so many independent reports that they blew it significantly. It was with some satisfaction that we saw the coalition government do their own backflip in ditching their outsourcing policy—at the urging of the opposition, I am proud to say.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2001-09-27,"—It must be very amusing for people to listen to a member of the Australian Labor Party here, on 27 September, five days after the anniversary of the Centenary House lease, the greatest waste of taxpayers' money in contractual—
—Tell us about it.
—I am feeling as if I should, Senator Hill. It is the greatest waste of taxpayers' money in an outsourced contract that you will ever find. The Australian Labor Party built a building and through a shonky deal—proved to be shonky by a royal commission, if you read the report—is now reaping a nine per cent annual increase. Every year on 23 September, under a shonky deal between the Australian Labor Party and the Auditor-General, the rent goes up. On Sunday 23 September, this very week when Senator Lundy has the audacity to get up in this place and talk about a computer contract, the rent went up by $400,000 for one year—a $400,000 rent rise. Rents are not rising at the moment around the place but, regardless of what happens to rent, it goes up by $400,000. And another nine per cent next year and another nine per cent the year after. In fact, they are getting $36 million in cream sieved out of the back pockets of taxpayers through this shonky Centenary House lease.
As Senator Abetz has made very clear, all you need to do to end that rort—the biggest rort in Australian political history bar none—is one single phone call from Mr Flip-Flop, Mr Kim Beazley. He needs a ticker and he needs a 45c phone card to make one phone call to the Auditor-General and say, `We will be fair about this.' Australians believe in a fair go and they believe in a fair rent. If you are a landlord ripping off a tenant in the suburbs of Australia, any politician on both sides will stand up and say, `That is unfair. We should have a mediation; we should have a fair rent. If there is a disagreement, bring in a mediator; bring in a valuer and strike a fair rent.' But if it is the Australian Labor Party ripping off people in every suburb in Australia—stealing $36 million out of their back pocket—they say no. This is a man with no ticker. He talks about fairness but when we ask him to be fair to the Australian taxpayer he says, `No. I want the $36 million in the Australian Labor Party's coffers.' What a joke and what a disgrace.
And this senator opposite has the audacity to come into this place and talk about the price of computers. That senator voted to try to ensure that there was a 22 per cent tax on every single computer in this nation. If you were a person struggling on low to middle income earnings and you wanted to get into the Internet economy, Senator Lundy was going to say, `We will take 22 per cent on top of the cost of the computer.' If you wanted to buy yourself a modem, she was going to keep a 22 per cent tax on the modem. And on the CD-ROM drive and on any single piece of computer equipment. The Labor Party's policy is a 22 per cent tax on computers. And they talk about Knowledge Nation. What a great way to encourage people to get into the Internet economy: put a 22 per cent tax at the gateway! The hypocrisy is astounding.
Senator Lundy actually said we saved $40 million in this project. That was not enough for her. What she wants and what the Australian Labor Party want is to bring all of the IT outsourcing back in again. They do not particularly care about savings; what they care about are jobs for their friends in the CPSU. The government have created a burgeoning and booming IT industry in Canberra. Canberra has become one of the leading IT economies on the globe. There are more Internet connections per capita in Canberra than in virtually any other city in the world—more than New York; more than Washington; more than London. We have an Australian home bred IT industry that is now providing services to the world.
The Australian Taxation Office, which Senator Lundy wants to pick on, is one of the greatest departments in the world when it comes to providing services online. Australian taxpayers and Australian businesses have reaped the benefits of the IT outsourcing because Australians can now lodge their tax returns online and save themselves money, and businesses can lodge their tax returns online. The ATO is a leading IT provider in Australia and a leader in terms of providing government services online right around the world. I congratulate the ATO for that. Instead, from Senator Lundy we get this carping, whingeing, whining opposition to an office that is actually a leader in the IT world.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-09-27,"—We are taking note of the answers to questions to Senator Kemp. I want to refer to the question that I asked today that Senator Kemp, as usual, did not answer, and that relates to the huge increase in tax revenue on superannuation funds in this country. I refer to the final budget outcome 2000-01 yesterday released by the Treasurer, Mr Costello. This is the government's own document. If we look at that document, on page 87 we see that the revenue raised from taxation on superannuation in one year went up from $3.9 billion to $5.3 billion. So this government is collecting an extra $1.4 billion in tax in one year off Australian superannuation funds. The worst aspect of this is that the increase in tax this government is collecting from Australian superannuation—an extra $1.4 billion in tax—reduces the final retirement income of contributors.
It gets worse. If we look at the government's final budget outcome, we see that the government are fond of claiming—and it is false—that they are a low tax government. The facts show in this document that this is the highest taxing government in Australian history outside wartime. Let me just give a couple of examples. In the revenue raised in the last financial years, income tax went down. I agree with the government; they cut income taxes. The revenue from income tax on individuals went down from $76.5 billion to $74 billion. The revenue from income tax as a result of the government's tax cuts went down by just over $2.5 billion. The government also got rid of the wholesale sales tax, which collected $15.5 billion. So they got rid of $15.5 billion in wholesales tax, and there was a $2.5 billion reduction in income tax. That adds up to about $18 billion in tax reductions or removal of taxes.
But they replaced those with the GST. We have had an $18 billion reduction in tax from income on individuals and the wholesale sales tax. What did the GST collect? It collected $23.8 billion. They reduced taxes by $18 billion and then introduced the GST, which collects $23.8 billion. If we look at this document, there are two levels of significant dishonesty about the presentation of these papers. What the government does not disclose and what Senator Kemp avoided at all costs to mention was that a large part of the reason we have a $1.4 billion increase in taxation on superannuation is the new tax—they called it a surcharge—that this government introduced in 1997. Most Australians do not know about this new tax on their superannuation, because most Australians do not, unfortunately, look at their superannuation accruals and see that the tax rate has gone up. The so-called surcharge that they introduced is one of the reasons why the tax take on superannuation has gone up.
I have referred to the GST and I have referred to the total tax collections. If we look at page 83, we see that the traditional measure of determining the level of tax take by the Commonwealth government is taxation revenue as a percentage of gross domestic product. It is 21.8 per cent, but they exclude the GST. They exclude their own new tax from the table of tax revenue as a percentage of gross domestic product. This government boasts that the GST is a growth tax. It is certainly that; it is a growth tax. One of the big problems with the GST is that the compensation for the GST is static. You have static compensation for the GST, but the GST is a massive growth tax, and that is why taxes under this government have now reached, if you include the GST, 23.8 per cent of gross domestic product.

"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2001-09-27,"—What a whole lot of gobbledegook. Isn't it amazing? To listen to Senator Sherry now, one would suspect that within the next few days the Labor Party will come out and say, `We are going to get rid of the GST.' Oh, no, it is quite the reverse: `We are going to keep the GST.' More importantly, if you just listened to Senator Sherry then, you would think that the revenue from the GST came to the Commonwealth government. At no time did I hear Senator Sherry mention one syllable of the fact that every single solitary cent raised by the goods and services tax goes to the states. The state Labor government in Western Australia, the state Labor government in Queensland, the state Labor government in Victoria, the state Labor government in New South Wales, the state Labor government in Tasmania, the territory Labor government in the Northern Territory—that is where the GST goes.
Isn't it fascinating? Senator Sherry did not mention one single syllable about that, and yet there is not one state Labor premier who is saying, `Get rid of the GST, we do not want it.' Oh, no, it is quite the reverse. They signed on faster than Flash Gordon to the GST and they want it. That is why Mr Beazley is keeping it. Then you would go further and suggest, `Maybe they're going to be serious about this roll-back nonsense. Let's wait and see what the policy is.' I have been keeping a little list for quite some time of the issues on which the Labor Party have been bleating that there should not be any GST. Let us see if they roll back GST on things like children's solar swimsuits, all the sanitary products, trucks, cars, petrol, local government, charities, deposits, insurance, clothing, shoes, beer, registration levels, levies, libraries—there is not a GST on libraries, mind you, but they kept on about taxing libraries, that is how much they know about it—swimming pools, sportsgrounds, hats, printing, books, et cetera. Let us wait and see whether all of those things are going to have roll-back attached to them. These are some of the things that have been talked about so extensively here as being so inequitable that we should not have a tax on. Let us test the temperature. Here we are, presumably on the last day of sitting before the election is called, and still the Labor Party have not said what they are going to roll back.
Let us take as an example the last one that I mentioned—books. Dear little Senator Stott Despoja has said, `That's the most important thing that you can roll back goods and services tax on. We'll just take the tax off books.' Wacky-doo! Let us have a look at that proposal. If you want to take the tax off books, it is not just a case of taking the tax off books: you have to take the tax off books, magazines, booklets, pornography, stationery, newsletters, books on CD-ROM, online books, academic journals, diaries, cookbooks, year books, books on tape, newspapers—and on it goes. It is not just a book; it is all those sorts of different books. 
But it goes further than that because there are people who actually produce books. This is how little the Democrats and the Labor Party understand the whole tax system. If you exempt books per se—all sorts of books, magazines and so forth—then you have to look at how you exempt publishers, bookstores, newsagents, paper manufacturers, ink suppliers, photographic studios, stationers, tourist shops, online bookshops, universities and schools—and on the list goes. Let us see if the Labor Party is really fair dinkum about this roll-back on books. Let us see Senator Stott Despoja, in all her years of maturity and understanding the tax system and business, explain her way out of taking a tax off books.
—She supported the GST.
—No, she did not support the GST. She voted against the GST. Senator Stott Despoja voted against it, and she thinks books are the most important thing. Let us see her explain how the roll-back on books is going to occur, because it includes all those other commodities. The next few weeks will be very interesting. Having kept a very careful list of the things that have been raised in this place, I will be very interested to debate on the campaign trail exactly what Labor are going to roll back, how they are going to roll it back and how they are going to compensate people.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2001-09-27,"—I wish to take note of the answer given by Senator Kemp to Senator Cook in relation to what is now commonly called the GST scam in Minister Macfarlane's electorate of Groom. Some time ago, on 27 August, the Canberra Times reported:
Prime Minister John Howard has referred the Queensland division of the Liberal Party to Tax Commissioner Michael Carmody for a full audit—to “demonstrate it has nothing to hide on taxation matters”.
But we now have a notice, pursuant to section 65 of the Taxation Administration Act 1953, to the Liberal Party in Queensland requiring two things: firstly, `for the purpose of applying a new tax system, Goods and Services Act 1999, in relation to the Liberal Party, to give evidence'—in other words to call them in to give evidence; and, secondly, `to further direct them to produce those documents described in the schedule which are in your custody or under your control'. We now have an audit which seems to have gone further than a simple `we'll audit the books and you'll provide full cooperation' scenario. The tax office raid begs the question: why is there no full cooperation from the Queensland Liberals? Why does the ATO feel it necessary to issue a notice to get the Liberal Party in Queensland to produce and to give evidence in relation to the Groom GST scam? Was it necessary? It seems that the ATO felt it was extremely necessary to get to the bottom of this, so you wonder whether or not there is the full cooperation that Mr Howard has outlined. Are people producing everything that they might have in their possession? Have they gone to the extreme of saying, `Perhaps we are not going to cooperate'? Those questions remain unanswered.
We heard from Senator Kemp about this, and it was a very circumspect answer when you look at it. He said—and I am happy for him to correct me—`The ATO has spoken to some people in Groom. It is an audit and the ATO will do what it has to do.' His answer did not really go much further than that. So what we are left with is a tax raid in the Groom electorate in Queensland, trying to get to the bottom of this shocking fiasco involving the only business, it seems, that is not paying the GST. This is all during a period when Minister Macfarlane, as the Minister for Small Business, has been trying to announce a small business plan. We do not have a plan from him; what we have, it seems, is the Queensland Liberal Party as the only organisation in the country still able to use the ultimate GST simplification of simply avoiding the tax.
Senator Hill was a little more forthcoming on this when he answered a question I asked him on 28 August. He indicated that there would be a full audit and that the results of that should be made public. We hope not only that it will be made public—and we have not heard anything to that effect yet; they have not produced any documents yet—but that they will then provide what the ATO report provides so that the public can judge for themselves what the GST scam of the Liberals in Queensland is all about. It is a sad and sorry time when we find Minister Macfarlane, it seems, being part of a scam to avoid GST instead of getting on with the plan to ensure that the GST is made simpler and fairer. 
The denials by this government are starting to sound extremely hollow. We were told it was an audit, but it seems that the audit is a little bit more than that. We are now hearing that the matter has gone further—into a demand for evidence and information to be provided—so it makes you wonder about the denials from the other side. (Time expired)

The statement read as follows—
This is the final report of the Committee on its inquiry into the disposal of Defence properties.
On 3 January this year, the Committee presented, out of sittings, an interim report which dealt specifically with the disposal of the Artillery Barracks, Fremantle.  The Defence Estate Organisation (DEO) had proposed a priority sale of the site to the University of Notre Dame and the relocation of the Army Museum of Western Australia to Hobbs Hall at Irwin Barracks, Karrakatta, Perth.  These proposals had generated considerable public and political opposition and were the reason for the reference to this Committee.  
The Committee recommended that the Artillery Barracks be transferred to the Western Australian Government and that Defence review its proposed move of the Museum from the Barracks to Hobbs Hall.  The Committee is pleased to note that the Commonwealth Government did offer the Barracks to the Western Australian Government and that Defence decided to leave the Museum at the Barracks.
The Committee's terms of reference included not only terms which dealt specifically about the Artillery Barracks but also those which focussed more generally on the way DEO disposes of surplus Defence properties.
Earlier this year, the Committee conducted inspections in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne of sites that either had been divested by Defence or were in the process of disposal.  It also took evidence in those cities and in Canberra.  It also used the evidence taken in the latter part of last year in relation to the disposal of the Artillery Barracks, Fremantle.
One of the elements of the DEO disposal process that the Committee criticised in its interim report was the lack of adequate consultation with stakeholders in the disposal of the Artillery Barracks, Fremantle.  The Committee, however, made no recommendations until it was able to consider DEO's consultation processes in the second half of the inquiry.
The Committee found that where DEO consulted with stakeholders early in the disposal process and where there was no fundamental difference of opinion between both sides on the nature of the redevelopment, the sale process appeared to proceed smoothly. In the case of Ermington, the Residents Committee went further by making suggestions to DEO, which were adopted as part of the redevelopment plan. This co-operative approach allowed all parties to have some ownership of the redevelopment, which facilitated the disposal process.
Even if DEO begins its consultative process with a clean slate and is prepared to listen to stakeholders, it is likely, in many cases, that the views of the stakeholders are in conflict with DEO's ultimate goal of optimising revenue. Where there is a strong difference of opinion between DEO and stakeholders as to the end use of a property once it is no longer owned by the Commonwealth, consultation seemed to break down.
Overall, it is very clear, however, that DEO's consultative processes leave much to be desired, particularly in respect of sites where there is no fundamental agreement over the planned redevelopment. Inevitably, there will be disagreement over the future of some sites, whether it is the nature of the proposed use to which they are to be put, or for the protection of heritage or environmental values. In such cases, consultation should be increased, not reduced.
The Committee notes that DEO is already obliged to consult stakeholders (including residents in the local area) in the disposal of surplus properties and recommends that DEO fulfils its obligations in respect of all properties for which it has responsibility for their disposal.
The Committee also recommends that DEO continues to consult stakeholders throughout the disposal process.
The Committee noted that, in respect of a number of properties, DEO undertook some development of them before sale to increase the sale price.  
In considering this issue, the Committee noted that pre-sale development of surplus Defence properties is not government policy and did not have the support of the Department of Finance and Administration. It was, however, not inconsistent with government policy. The Committee came to the view that it does not object in principle to DEO adding value to properties and increasing revenue for the Commonwealth and Defence. However, in undertaking development of a property prior to sale, DEO should consider carefully the extent to which it develops a property, the nature of that development and the revenue likely to be obtained from that development. DEO should remember that its function is to sell surplus properties and not to become a community planner. DEO is very dependent on consultants to conduct developmental work and, arguably, does not have the expertise within its own ranks to oversee it, particularly should consultants misjudge the extent or nature of a proposed development. While Mr Corey believed that DEO had sufficient experience to manage the development work, DEO is also dependent on retention of that experience, particularly at senior levels.
The Committee's guarded acquiescence to DEO's development of properties before sale is also based on DEO taking greater cognisance of State government, local government and other community views. The Committee does not believe it is in Defence's interests for DEO to try to secure the last dollar out of a sale when, by doing so, it alienates a lot of people and organisations. That is not to say that DEO should capitulate in the face of differences of opinion on its development strategy in each and every case where such criticism occurs. It should, however, try to be more accommodating of stakeholders, when they have particular concerns about specific DEO proposals, than seems to have been the case. Ultimately, it is the local government and the community that have to live with the decisions made about the end use of a divested Defence property.
Although DEO should, where possible, seek to get market value for properties, there is a strong argument in support of concessional sales for relatively low value properties where protracted sales, as a result of disputes with councils or residents, are not in the interests of Defence. This applies particularly to sites where there might be Defence-related activities but not restricted to those sites. The DEO disposal units are not staffed sufficiently to deal with protracted sales and, even from a financial point of view, an early settlement avoids all the staff, consultant and ancillary costs of a long and drawn out sale. 
The Committee also believes that Defence cannot afford to alienate communities by trying to sell small properties for an end use incompatible with the interests of those communities. Defence depends on positive perceptions of Defence. Once Defence alienates a community, it may have longer-term ramifications for Defence, such as for Defence recruiting. The dogged pursuit of the dollar at community expense may, therefore, be false economy. 
Where a property has or is proposed to have a function associated with the military, such as a military museum or a cadet depot, the Australian Defence Organisation, including the new Defence Cadet Directorate (and not just DEO), should give special consideration to the continuation or commencement of such functions through priority or concessional sales. 
With the move away from capital and regional cities, the ADF needs other means to have a presence in those cities, so that the ADF is not removed entirely from community consciousness. What might be revenue foregone in the short term might be more than compensated for in less tangible ways in the longer term. The housing of military-related activities in heritage-listed former Defence buildings provides a link to our military heritage.

One of the elements of the DEO disposal process that the Committee criticised in its interim report was the lack of adequate consultation with stakeholders in the disposal of the Artillery Barracks, Fremantle.  The Committee, however, made no recommendations until it was able to consider DEO's consultation processes in the second half of the inquiry.
The Committee found that where DEO consulted with stakeholders early in the disposal process and where there was no fundamental difference of opinion between both sides on the nature of the redevelopment, the sale process appeared to proceed smoothly. In the case of Ermington, the Residents Committee went further by making suggestions to DEO, which were adopted as part of the redevelopment plan. This co-operative approach allowed all parties to have some ownership of the redevelopment, which facilitated the disposal process.
Even if DEO begins its consultative process with a clean slate and is prepared to listen to stakeholders, it is likely, in many cases, that the views of the stakeholders are in conflict with DEO's ultimate goal of optimising revenue. Where there is a strong difference of opinion between DEO and stakeholders as to the end use of a property once it is no longer owned by the Commonwealth, consultation seemed to break down.
Overall, it is very clear, however, that DEO's consultative processes leave much to be desired, particularly in respect of sites where there is no fundamental agreement over the planned redevelopment. Inevitably, there will be disagreement over the future of some sites, whether it is the nature of the proposed use to which they are to be put, or for the protection of heritage or environmental values. In such cases, consultation should be increased, not reduced.
The Committee notes that DEO is already obliged to consult stakeholders (including residents in the local area) in the disposal of surplus properties and recommends that DEO fulfils its obligations in respect of all properties for which it has responsibility for their disposal.
The Committee also recommends that DEO continues to consult stakeholders throughout the disposal process.
The Committee noted that, in respect of a number of properties, DEO undertook some development of them before sale to increase the sale price.  
In considering this issue, the Committee noted that pre-sale development of surplus Defence properties is not government policy and did not have the support of the Department of Finance and Administration. It was, however, not inconsistent with government policy. The Committee came to the view that it does not object in principle to DEO adding value to properties and increasing revenue for the Commonwealth and Defence. However, in undertaking development of a property prior to sale, DEO should consider carefully the extent to which it develops a property, the nature of that development and the revenue likely to be obtained from that development. DEO should remember that its function is to sell surplus properties and not to become a community planner. DEO is very dependent on consultants to conduct developmental work and, arguably, does not have the expertise within its own ranks to oversee it, particularly should consultants misjudge the extent or nature of a proposed development. While Mr Corey believed that DEO had sufficient experience to manage the development work, DEO is also dependent on retention of that experience, particularly at senior levels.
The Committee's guarded acquiescence to DEO's development of properties before sale is also based on DEO taking greater cognisance of State government, local government and other community views. The Committee does not believe it is in Defence's interests for DEO to try to secure the last dollar out of a sale when, by doing so, it alienates a lot of people and organisations. That is not to say that DEO should capitulate in the face of differences of opinion on its development strategy in each and every case where such criticism occurs. It should, however, try to be more accommodating of stakeholders, when they have particular concerns about specific DEO proposals, than seems to have been the case. Ultimately, it is the local government and the community that have to live with the decisions made about the end use of a divested Defence property.
Although DEO should, where possible, seek to get market value for properties, there is a strong argument in support of concessional sales for relatively low value properties where protracted sales, as a result of disputes with councils or residents, are not in the interests of Defence. This applies particularly to sites where there might be Defence-related activities but not restricted to those sites. The DEO disposal units are not staffed sufficiently to deal with protracted sales and, even from a financial point of view, an early settlement avoids all the staff, consultant and ancillary costs of a long and drawn out sale. 
The Committee also believes that Defence cannot afford to alienate communities by trying to sell small properties for an end use incompatible with the interests of those communities. Defence depends on positive perceptions of Defence. Once Defence alienates a community, it may have longer-term ramifications for Defence, such as for Defence recruiting. The dogged pursuit of the dollar at community expense may, therefore, be false economy. 
Where a property has or is proposed to have a function associated with the military, such as a military museum or a cadet depot, the Australian Defence Organisation, including the new Defence Cadet Directorate (and not just DEO), should give special consideration to the continuation or commencement of such functions through priority or concessional sales. 
With the move away from capital and regional cities, the ADF needs other means to have a presence in those cities, so that the ADF is not removed entirely from community consciousness. What might be revenue foregone in the short term might be more than compensated for in less tangible ways in the longer term. The housing of military-related activities in heritage-listed former Defence buildings provides a link to our military heritage.

Leave granted; debate adjourned.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,53,2,speech
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2001-09-27,"—The Intelligence Services Bill 2001 before us at the moment proposes for the first time to put ASIS and DSD under legislative control. There was a similar bill drawn up in 1995 on the basis of the Samuels and Codd report that looked at all aspects of ASIS. That legislation did not proceed, mostly for lack of time. There were two delays with it, however. Firstly, some of the penalties involved in the bill caused some controversy that had not been resolved and, secondly, the government of the day had a desire to see whether D-notices could be resurrected as an effective method of protecting agencies. I was actually given the responsibility of convening a meeting of most of the editors of newspapers and television and radio stations and I did so in 1995. I found on that occasion that, whilst there was an agreement in the macro that certain matters of a high security basis should be protected, there was no real commitment because if any one of those organisations—and I think that the Australian Broadcasting Corporation was the worst—came across such material they would use it and scoop the others. I basically reported back to government that I thought D-notices were dead.
This legislation has appeared in its current form five years later—I do not know why the interregnum. I do not know why a five-year gap occurred in taking this matter forward. I suspect one of the reasons was in some of the evidence given to the committee: that Mr McLachlan spent two years trying to resurrect D-notices. If that is the case, I am partly at fault: I should have briefed him on the absolute uselessness of attempting to do so. What took him two years of failure to do took me only a day because I realised that D-notices were no longer available. Nevertheless, this legislation came forward. The government's response to this legislation was to set up a joint select committee to look at it. It was a very sensible act, I thought, by the government, to have an all-party, both-chamber committee examine the legislation and report back to the parliament. Tight time lines for reporting were put on us but, nevertheless, we needed only one brief extension before we reported to this parliament.
Let me tell you what test the committee put on this bill. Most of the committee members understood the quality of individuals that we have heading up our security organisations. We know that Mr Dennis Richardson from ASIO is a talented, dedicated public servant with a very high sense of integrity, exactly the same qualities shared by Mr Taylor, who heads ASIS. Mr Bonighton from DSD is a very esteemed public servant and Mr Bill Blick, as Inspector-General, is one of the most talented public servants I have met. So all the stars are in alignment here: we have excellent individuals in charge of all our security agencies. So do you know what test we put to this bill: what if they were not there? If we did not have that quality there, how can the legislation then protect the rights of Australian individuals? It is true to say that the committee made some recommendations to government to tighten up certain sections of the bill. I previously publicly acknowledged that we were assisted in that process by the officials from ASIS, ASIO and DSD. We did not run into a bureaucratic wall of resistance; we raised issues and they responded. We were able to bring down a report that did recommend several changes, tightening up for the most part. As a result of that, the report that came into this chamber was a unanimous report. 
The aims of the legislation are to give a legislative basis to ASIS and DSD. The legislation outlines for the first time ever, other than by way of ministerial instruction, what the functions of these agencies are. It also places limits on agencies and specifies those in the legislation. The one potential area of controversy is that this legislation does give some immunities to ASIS employees and their agents in terms of some aspects of Australian law. It is not carte blanche: they are prescribed and highly necessary if ASIS is to do its job properly. This legislation very tightly defines them and I think that in no way could one argue that this infringes on the civil liberties of Australian citizens.
The legislation also provides for parliamentary oversight for ASIS and DSD, and this is most welcome. Previously, the only area for oversight was ASIO. We now have three of the key agencies being oversighted by the same committee, and I confidently predict DIGO will join them as soon as their miscellaneous legislation comes before this chamber. Then over time, even though it is not as urgent, ONA and DIO will come before the committee. Therefore, we will have a committee very similar to the British or US oversight. I welcome that.
I also welcome the fact that there is slightly more power given to that committee to oversight the agencies. It is true to say that the ASIO committee, especially in a technical sense, was fairly highly restricted in what it could look at. But I think that, as that agency develops a trust with the committee, we can get more genuine parliamentary oversight—which is not just of benefit to the parliament but of benefit to the agencies as well, as the confidences build. As far as I know, in the years that the ASIO committee has existed, it itself has never revealed any confidences that have been given to it, and I hope that is always the case.
Let me say one other word about the current international situation. People have raised in the media the failure of intelligence agencies to predict the events in New York and Washington. I have to say that this is based on the fallacy that intelligence agencies can know everything. They simply cannot know everything. It is impossible. It is equally difficult in the modern era, with so much concentration on technology, because your average terrorist knows not to use the phone or a high frequency radio or anything else. So you cannot expect intelligence agencies, through SIGINT at least, to pick up on these things. From the more extreme organisations, it is very hard to get human intelligence fed into the system. So before we condemn these agencies, let us not set the bar too high or at an impossible height. It is simply not possible for them to predict everything.
I want to talk briefly about bipartisanship in this area. This country has had a pretty good track record in that regard, and it is something I would like to see fostered further. I have said previously that bipartisanship is not about agreeing on everything but about agreeing on the broad and general principles and, especially in this area of security, extending trust to what are tantamount to our political opponents—and that is how it should be, especially in this area. We have to extend a degree of trust. In return, a degree of responsibility is extended to the opposition, through briefings of the Leader of the Opposition and through our participation on oversight committees. That should be fostered.
Every now and then, out of political opportunism, someone breaks ranks. I think that is a great pity. For instance, on 30 August this year, a parliamentary secretary, someone who is sworn in on the Executive Council, described Labor Party members, the entire caucus, in the following terms:
They are traitors to Australia. They are not fit to govern and they are certainly not even fit to be in the parliament.
I have been in this chamber for 20 years and I have never in that time asked for any description of me to be withdrawn. I have dished it out and I have copped it. No matter what has been said, I have never got up on my feet and asked for something to be withdrawn. This, of course, was not said within a parliamentary chamber; this was said at a doorstop outside this parliament. I am here to tell you, Madam Deputy President, that I resent being called a traitor, and so does every member of my political party resent being called a traitor. We have many faults; we have many foibles. It is proper and justified to criticise and analyse us on a whole range of areas. But I have never seen any evidence that any member of the Labor Party in this 38th Parliament is a traitor to this country—never in any way whatsoever.
I am deeply disappointed that no person in leadership in the Liberal Party has publicly rebuked that parliamentary secretary for that statement. I could imagine that, if anyone in the Labor Party described any of our colleagues in the Liberal or National parties as traitors, the Leader of the Labor Party would be on the phone within five seconds, demanding that they go outside and retract. So this sort of attitude does not promote bipartisanship. Fortunately, I think it is an isolated view, a view which has not necessarily found any sympathy in the rest of the coalition parties. But if I thought that this individual had only made one mistake, we have only to move on to the second statement. By the way, I especially resent being called a traitor by a former National Party member of this parliament who transferred over to the Liberal Party. I do not like being called a traitor by someone who, out of political opportunism, switched political parties for his own careerist ambitions. Leaving that aside, we then had the statement on 19 September 2001. This relates to the bill, because our agencies have the very crucial role, much more enhanced in the last two weeks, of trying to deal with the threat of terrorism. What do we get from Mr Peter Slipper, parliamentary secretary? We get the following statement:
It is not beyond the realms of possibility that the Taliban regime could well be sending people to Australia as terrorists under the guise of illegals.
I know that one or two members of the ministry have hinted at that but have never batted on with it. It has been a sort of throw-away line. But this statement represents the culmination of two or three doorstops. I could go through paragraph after paragraph of the different doorstop interviews and show similar statements being made. Basically, is there any evidence for this? I am not going to embarrass our security organisations by asking them about it or revealing any briefings I may have received. What I want is for Mr Slipper to put down some evidence. What he is doing is combining two very emotive issues: illegal asylum seekers and the terrorist events of 11 September. What crass political opportunism; what grubby politics that is. It really sickens me.
Can you imagine someone in Afghanistan as a potential terrorist wanting to infiltrate Australia. So what do they do? They walk down the Khyber Pass, all the way to Pakistan; they spend six months in a refugee camp in Pakistan; they then try to devise a way of getting to Indonesia; and they then get on a leaky boat, having paid between $3,000 and $30,000. They risk the high seas. They get intercepted by an Australian patrol boat and get transferred to Woomera for one or two years, where they are rigorously cross-examined in detail about their past, and then they go on and become part of a terrorist cell in this country. I would have thought that they would have either bought a false passport or, indeed, probably applied for a visa and flown in here by business class in 12 hours time. Why wouldn't they? You would have to say, even though you cannot sift between what is true and what is false, that the emerging evidence in the US is that nearly all these terrorists entered the US legally or on false passports. I do not recall one of them applying for refugee status in the United States.
The crass linking of these two issues—illegal asylum seekers and potential terrorists—is political opportunism at its worst, and this parliament should reject it. It does not contribute to a bipartisan attitude on security issues to do this. It is the worst false analysis. What Mr Slipper has done is just false analysis. It has not promoted the public debate. I really should not spend any more of my time on someone I regard as an absolutely worthless political individual.
Let me commend the government for bringing this legislation forward. Let me thank them for setting up a select committee. Let me thank them for being so open-minded to accept the unanimous recommendations of the committee. The government have handled this issue extremely well. It is a sensitive area, yet we have not had large public revulsion on the bill. They are to be congratulated, and I wish the bill a speedy passage.",SENATE,<title>INTELLIGENCE SERVICES BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,55,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2001-09-27,"—The government acknowledges and thanks the opposition for its support for the Intelligence Services Bill 2001 and the Intelligence Services (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2001, which go to the very heart of the national interest of Australia. As Senator Ray has mentioned, there has been a history of a bipartisan approach to these matters. For the future, the government and, I am sure, the opposition would want that to be the case. I acknowledge the comments made in relation to these bills. 
It is important legislation which deals with the functions and responsibilities of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, the Defence Signals Directorate and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. The legislation provides an appropriate balance between the ability of ASIS and DSD to conduct their functions and the limited immunities necessary for this. It also provides desirable oversight and essential accountability for the agencies and protects the rights of Australians while maintaining the secrecy necessary to protect operations, sources and staff. 
These bills have been examined in detail by the Joint Select Committee on Intelligence Services. The committee, comprising coalition, Labor and Democrat members—many from this chamber—adopted a clear bipartisan approach. The committee was given considerable information about the work of these agencies so that it was able to make balanced and educated judgments about the legislation. The committee made 18 key recommendations, and the government accepted substantially all but one of the recommendations, which resulted in some 70 amendments to the legislation. These amendments have greatly enhanced this proposed legislation. On behalf of the government, I thank the members of that committee, particularly those who are members of the Senate, for their hard work and their support for the work of the intelligence agencies at this critical time. I commend the bills to the Senate.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2001-09-27,"—I move:
That the committee does not press its request for an amendment not made by the House of Representatives.
The situation is that this very important bill, the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2001, has been rejected by the opposition. It is an important bill which provides funding for establishment grants. If this legislation does not pass through the Senate now, those schools who are affected by the legislation will not receive the payments that they are legally entitled to next week. This morning in the House of Representatives the shadow minister said, `Our highest priority is needy schools throughout Australia, whether they are in the government or the non-government sector.' On 6 August this year, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Kim Beazley, said in a personal explanation:
... the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs has said ... that I am threatening the funds to Catholic schools and to low income private schools. We are not; we support the grants that go to those schools.
If that is what the Leader of the Opposition said, and if he means it, now is the chance for the opposition to prove it. Without speedy passage of this bill, new schools will be denied their entitlements, which will defeat the purpose of the grants in assisting new schools with their recurrent costs in their formative years.
Next Monday will be 1 October and, unless Labor changes its mind, the 54 new non-government schools with an entitlement for an establishment grant will not be able to be paid it. I give some examples. The Nyikina Mangala community school in the Kimberley will not receive $4,500 owed to it—a great concern to the people in that community. Some might regard that amount of money as small, but to a community school like that in the Kimberley it is indeed a large amount of money. The Lumen Christi Catholic College in the Eden-Monaro electorate will not receive its $17,750. The Bentleigh Chabad Jewish Day School in the Hotham electorate will not receive its $6,000. The Living Faith Lutheran Primary School in the Dickson electorate will not receive its $23,792.
We have here a situation where this funding has been blocked from reaching these needy schools. This is a situation where Labor's amendment has no justification. Of the specific schools initiatives in this year's budget, 87 per cent of the funding is directed to the 69 per cent of students in the government sector, demonstrating the government's commitment to government schools. I said that when this was last before the Senate. On a proportionate basis, this is $50 million more than government schools could expect on the basis of their enrolments—$20 million more than is being requested by the opposition in this request. Total funding for government schools in 2002 is $2.2 billion, some $669 million or 43 per cent more than Labor provided in its last year of office. In the four years to 2004, total funding to government schools will be around $9 billion.
These schools are legally entitled to these payments; it is now up to Labor to decide whether or not they are going to get them. I appreciate that Senator Carr has been passionately involved with the education sector and deeply committed to it. In fact, I would say that he has shown a great deal more commitment than others in his party have shown. I would urge him to reconsider this and to look at just some of the examples I have mentioned as being indicative of the plight of these schools and of the effect that the non-passage of this bill will have—because it will stop that funding reaching those needy schools.
I again commend the bill to the Senate and urge senators opposite to reconsider their position and, in particular, to have regard to these schools. I am pleased to see that Senator Allison from the Democrats is here in the chamber, and I would also ask the Democrats to reconsider their position and have regard to these schools. These schools are not wealthy schools; they have parents who are average, ordinary Australians, who have made a choice to send their children to these schools. That is a choice that the government believes they should be allowed.",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2001</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,56,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2001-09-27,"—The opposition's view on these matters has been spelt out and detailed in the previous contributions I have made. So, given the hour and the pressure of business that is before us, I will not go through the entire case again. But I will state a couple of matters. First of all, the government says that the opposition are blocking the funding. That is not true—it is just not true. We are proposing here that a request be made to the House of Representatives for an additional $30 million for public education. It is not a request that blocks money; it is a request for increases in money for the public education system. The government can ensure that these payments that are due can be made next week by agreeing to the request. It is pretty straightforward. It is the government that is choosing not to make those payments. Presumably, given what the minister has said today, it is the government that is choosing to withdraw the bill. That is the threat being made to us: that the government will withdraw this bill. The actions of the government are the responsibility of the government. It is our job as an opposition to draw attention to the deficiencies in the government's policy. No doubt we will have plenty of opportunity to do that in the run-up to this next election, which I understand is to be announced in a few days. This will be a matter that will be debated in the community at large, and we are more than happy for that matter to be pursued.
The government says that it does enormous amounts to assist government education. That is the argument. Whatever statistics the minister reads out there, he cannot get around the basic fact that the level of funding in real terms, in real dollars, has not kept pace with enrolments in the government education system, the public education system. The Commonwealth contribution towards public education in 1996 when this government took office was 43 per cent—43 per cent of the total outlays for the Commonwealth went to the public education system. By 2004, under the policies being pursued by this Liberal government, this conservative government, that figure will fall to 34.8 per cent. So there is a drop in the Commonwealth contribution towards public education from 43 per cent in 1996 to 34.8 in 2004. That is the measure of the government's commitment to public education. The statistics are very clear on that; they have been reaffirmed by Commonwealth department officials time and time again through the procedures of this parliament. I have been persistently pursuing this issue. It is very difficult to get statistics that can actually be measured over a period of time, and that is one of them. Seventy per cent of Australians choose to send their children to public educational facilities, yet under this government's policies those facilities receive 34 per cent of the education resources coming from the Commonwealth government. That is the measure of the Commonwealth's commitment, and that is a fact that needs to be borne in mind.
What our requests do is reinforce Labor's policy of saying that we are in the business of providing resources from the public purse, on the basis of need, to all Australians. It is an evening-up measure, a small token—$30 million in an education budget of billions. This government cannot agree to a request to increase public education spending by $30 million when it is increasing, under this bill, the amounts of money going to non-government schools for this particular allocation by 330 per cent. It is pretty straightforward that the government's priorities are wrong.
—They spend more on ads.
—You are quite right, Senator Forshaw. This government spends more advertising—for political purposes—its claimed achievements than it is prepared to spend on this particular measure. That is the sense of priority perhaps we should be having a look at. 
My second concern is the administration of this program. I will not go over it again other than to say this: I think it is wrong, in public policy terms, for a Commonwealth government of any persuasion to rely upon a state administrative instrument to administer Commonwealth programs. That is what is happening here. When we cut through all the palaver, what is happening is that the Commonwealth says that if the state registers a school—no matter in what circumstances it registers the school—it automatically gets access to this program, when you have a situation where public document after public document highlights that the school is in fact not a new school but a campus of an existing school or a school that has changed its name and is therefore outside of the guidelines. 
We have the answer that was handed back to me today, and I thank the minister for honouring the commitments that were made yesterday for the answers to be delivered. We are talking about schools such as the Brighton Montessori School, which applied for Victorian registration in 1998. At its special general meeting on 20 April 1999, the school amended its statement of purpose to include the word `school' where previously the word `kindergarten' had appeared. A kindergarten is not eligible, but if you change the name from `kindergarten' to `school' then you make it eligible and it gets registration as a school. That is the thrust of the answer that you have given me. I asked about another school—the Fern Valley Montessori School—and whether it had operated before. The department was not aware of it; therefore, it must not have happened! 
We have schools that are having 25-year reunions and we are being told that these are new schools. It is not reasonable. A commonsense approach would say to you that the Commonwealth, if it had the capacity, could do the job. It no longer has the regional structure; it no longer has sufficient officers to be able to properly do the job of protecting Commonwealth revenues, not to mention the fact that I do not think too many of the Commonwealth officers are encouraged to look behind the registration of these schools. We have a problem. We have got a Commonwealth program effectively at the mercy of a state administrative instrument—the registration of schools. I think that is wrong. There are numerous examples which suggest to me that the evidence is very strong that the schools are receiving money outside of the guidelines, but because there is this legal fiction that they are a new school because they have got state registration the Commonwealth argues that it is a bona fide payment.
—Let the bill through and challenge it later.
—The government has the opportunity to let the bill through, Senator. The government has the option of accepting the request and it is choosing not to. I have demonstrated the argument quite clearly. It is a mistake that the government has pursued this line of logic. Payments can be made to schools next week if the government accepts the request. We cannot support your motion here today, Minister. We will not be supporting your motion here today. We remind the schools that we are committed to making payments on the basis of need. We will not be withdrawing from that position. We will not be supporting the government's position on this until such time as the government agrees to the request for an additional $30 million to public education in this country.

Resolution reported; report adopted.",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2001</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,56,1,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2001-09-27,"—The Motor Vehicle Standards Amendment Bill 2001 was recently considered by the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee. Mr Acting Deputy President, as I am sure you and all senators are aware, the committee has been very busy in the last couple of weeks dealing with a number of pieces of legislation that have been introduced into this parliament at the eleventh hour by the government. This is one of them. As I speak, I know the references committee is sitting to deal with another important matter. 
The legislation committee sat last Thursday and again on Monday of this week to hear evidence from quite a number of witnesses who had made submissions on the bill. Indeed, even though there was only a very short time for advertising the committee's hearings, the committee nevertheless received over 50 submissions from a range of interested groups. These included submissions from the major manufacturers and retailers in Australia, such as Ford Australia, as well as from small businesses who are involved in the importation, modification and retail of imported used vehicles. These also included evidence from two associations that represent such businesses—namely, the Vehicle Importers and Converters Association of Australia and the Australian Auto Importers and Manufacturers Association.
The committee took the opportunity to examine as best it could, given the tight timetable, the impacts of this legislation. I want to say at the outset that the opposition support the bill, and we do so for good public policy reasons which I will come to shortly. But I also repeat that it is unfortunate that the committee did not, and the Senate does not, have more time to consider some of the implications of this legislation which, if the claims come true, could have a serious impact upon small businesses in this country. 
The Motor Vehicle Standards Amendment Bill 2001 will amend the Motor Vehicle Standards Act 1989. It will fundamentally change the nature of the scheme that exists at the moment under which used vehicles are allowed to be imported into Australia. The changes are set out in the committee's excellent report, which was tabled yesterday, I think. I will not go into detail about the various changes the legislation makes, but I can summarise that by stating that the bill will establish a register of specialist and enthusiast vehicles—referred to as SEVS. That register will list those makes and models of vehicles that will be able to be imported into Australia as used vehicles in the future. In turn, that list will identify the range of models of used vehicles that can be imported and subjected to modifications, such as changing from left-hand to right-hand drive and so on, to ensure that they comply with Australian safety standards and can then be registered and sold for use in Australia.
A second key element of this change will be to require that any such vehicle will need to be inspected by registered automotive workshops on a vehicle by vehicle basis. Currently what happens is that vehicles can be imported under what is known as the low volume scheme and, once a particular type of vehicle has been approved for compliance and then sale as a used imported vehicle, all other vehicles that fit into that category or that type are recognised as having a blanket approval. The new system will ensure that registered automotive workshops will inspect such vehicles. That will be done, as I have said, on an individual vehicle by vehicle basis—a major improvement on the current administration. It is acknowledged by all the witnesses who appeared before the committee that the bill will have a significant effect in limiting and indeed reducing the number and types of used vehicles that will be able to be imported into Australia in the future.
I summarised a moment ago what the major changes to the legislation are as contained in this bill. I would also like to summarise the major arguments that are put forward in favour of the legislation. Firstly, it has been argued by the Department of Transport and Regional Services, which appeared before our committee, and by the major motor vehicle manufactures in Australia that there has been a huge increase in recent years in the number of used vehicles being imported into Australia under the current arrangements.
It is further argued that, if that rate of increase is allowed to continue, it will have serious effects on the viability of the Australian vehicle manufacturing industry. The committee was provided with statistical evidence from the Department of Transport and Regional Services, which was also reflected in the submission from the Department of Industry, Science and Resources and backed up by the motor manufacturers, that used vehicle imports into Australia have increased from 1,037 in 1993 to over 16,800 in 2000. That is a substantial percentage increase. The statistics set out in chapter 2 of the committee's report show that the major growth in the number of used vehicles that have been imported into Australia is to be found in passenger motor vehicles, which increased from 992 in 1993 to 10,094 in the 2000. Further, there has been a substantial growth in four-wheel drives such as Toyota Surfs and Nissan Toranos. The figures there show an increase from three such used four-wheel drives being imported into Australia in 1993 to some 5,705 four-wheel drive vehicles being imported in 2000.
This, it is argued, is a substantial increase which could have an effect upon the future viability of our manufacturing industry. We were also told that similar increases had occurred in New Zealand and that they had had a major impact on the New Zealand retail market for new cars and also on the sale of used vehicles which had started out as new cars in New Zealand. Whilst we were presented with that statistical evidence, and it is clear that there has been a major increase, I am not entirely convinced that the disastrous impact predicted by the industry if the scheme were allowed to continue unchecked would necessarily come about.
I say that because, whilst we were being told in the committee hearing—and this is contained in the arguments put forward by the government for this legislation in the second reading speech and in the explanatory memorandum—that this dramatic increase in the number of imported used vehicles was going to have a deleterious effect upon the future of our own local vehicle manufacturing industry, we at the same time have been hearing on a regular basis from Senator Minchin, the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, that there has been, in fact, a tremendous growth in the vehicle manufacturing industry in this country, that our exports have increased and that sales of new vehicles have increased. They both cannot be right.
Unfortunately, that is an area that has not really been explored sufficiently because of, as I said, the lack of time available to the committee. Whilst I make that observation, there is nevertheless no doubt that imported used vehicles coming into this country in increasing numbers must be having some effect and will have some effect upon our local industry. This is particularly important because there is a substantial element of unfair competition involved. If, for instance, the vehicles that are being brought in here as imported used vehicles and then modified for compliance are in the nature of specialist or enthusiast vehicles, then clearly it will not have a major effect. We are talking here about vehicles that are imported for individual buyers who have a particular interest in owning such a vehicle, whether it be a sports car or whatever.
But of course if the vehicles that are being brought in here are competing against either new vehicles or used vehicles that are sold in the normal course of events, then there is a potential major problem for the Australian industry. The unfairness in the competition in that regard comes about because those used vehicles, particularly those four-wheel drives or standard passenger vehicles that are imported into Australia as used vehicles, come into this country without all of the charges and other costs that are applied to the vehicles sold under what is known as the full volume system. That means that the vehicles can be imported at a much cheaper cost, then modified and sold at a much cheaper price than vehicles that are locally manufactured, sold as new vehicles and then enter the used car market here in Australia. That is certainly a concern that we have, to ensure that there is not unfair competition arising from a scheme which was originally designed for a limited number of vehicles to be available as specialist or enthusiast vehicles.
The argument put forward in support of changing the current arrangements is that there has sprung up an industry of what is called `backyard dealers' who operate largely unfettered. That, in turn, raises serious concern about the safety standards of the vehicles that are being on-sold in the Australian market after being modified. That is the major reason why the system of registered workshops has been proposed, I understand—to ensure that we are not allowing cars that do not really comply with our strict safety standards to go onto the market here in Australia as used vehicles.
It is also important to note that, as we were told in the committee hearings, a lot of cars are being imported from Japan as used vehicles, particularly in recent years. The picture has been put to us that, after around two to four years of use, cars—which had been bought as new vehicles in Japan—are very hard to get re-registered in Japan. It seems that a lot of these vehicles, because they cannot continue to be used in Japan, end up being sold as vehicles for importation into Australia. Certainly the strong implication of that is that we have a system of what could be described as `dumping' of those vehicles onto the Australian market. That is a matter of concern and we think that that needs to be tightened up.
I have to say as a matter of criticism of the government that some of these problems have occurred because of slack administration of the current system. It appears, certainly to me, that more resources need to be allocated under this new system to ensure that those backyard operators are driven out of business so that the legitimate small businesses importing used vehicles into this country can exist as appropriate businesses in this limited market. 
So we find that, on balance, there is much merit in supporting the passage of this bill, but we are not entirely convinced—I am certainly not entirely convinced—that all of the arguments that were put to us by the vehicle manufacturing industry did not contain a certain degree of exaggeration. We are prepared to support this bill but we are concerned, as I think has been acknowledged by the department, that some legitimate small businesses may become unviable as a result of the passage of the bill. We recommend that the department look very closely and monitor the impact of this scheme over the next 12 months to two years to ensure that legitimate businesses that have been operating quite appropriately under the current arrangements do not get driven out of business because of these changes. 
The government has provided for a time period of up to 7 May 2002 next year to enable those businesses with current approvals to switch over to looking at importing vehicles that will be on the new list in order to cope with the changes. I am concerned that that may not be enough time and I hope that, if it appears that some of those legitimate businesses are going to fold because of these changes, that time period will be looked at and possibly extended. 
The final point I make is that, whilst even the organisations representing the legitimate businesses—that is, the importers of used vehicles; the Vehicle Importers and Converters Association and the Australian Auto Importers and Manufacturers Association—indicated support for the legislation, they drew attention to some serious concern with the regulations. The draft regulations have only recently become available and the committee had access to them, but they are quite lengthy and detailed. The industry had a only limited time to look at those regulations. The committee notes—and this is a unanimous recommendation of the committee—at the conclusion of its report: 
Further consideration is required relating to certain aspects of the regulations and the committee intends to make supplementary comment to the Senate on the regulations. 
I wholeheartedly support that and I ask the minister—and the government, in the remaining short time that it has available to it as the government—to take that on board. When we are back here in government in a few months time we will certainly be giving effect to that recommendation of the Senate committee with regard to the regulations. So with those remarks I indicate the opposition will support the passing of the bill.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2001-09-27,"—I seek leave to incorporate a speech on the second reading of this bill for my colleague Senator Aden Ridgeway. 
Leave granted. 
The speech read as follows—
The motor vehicle industry plays an essential role in the Australian economy. Not only is it a major employer, but it has become a major exporter and important provider of training for thousands of Australian young people.
Providing the Automotive industry with a stable environment in which to invest and grow is an important objective. So to is the need to provide Australian consumers with access to cars they desire at the lowest sustainable prices.
The Motor Vehicles Standards Amendment Bill goes some way towards providing improved certainty and choice in the Australian automotive industry.
In introducing the Bill, the government advised that its purpose was to:
`balance the government's commitment to the local automotive manufacturing industry, full volume importers, franchised motor vehicle dealers, importers and converters of used vehicles and consumers of genuine specialist and enthusiast vehicles.'
The government also said that it sought to:
`return the low volume scheme to its original intent of catering for the importation of genuine specialist and enthusiast vehicles and to prevent unchecked growth in the importation of used vehicles that are very similar to vehicles already marketed in full volume.'
While the Democrats support these intentions, we are not convinced that this Bill is as effective as possible in striking the right balance.
The Bill is important because it effects a large number of Australians, both directly and indirectly. It is estimated that around 400 individual businesses will be affected by the tightening of used car import eligibility.
The number of second hand passenger motor vehicles imported in Australia in 2000 exceeded 10,000. While this is only a small percentage of the Australian car market. it is, without doubt, a significant niche market.
The Democrats have a range concerns with the Bill. The Australian Democrats, like the majority of members of the Committee, are concerned at recommending the passage of the legislation. The main reasons for this view are the difficulties in being able to properly scrutinise the legislation at short notice and to assess the competing claims of the submittees who have given evidence to the Committee.
Similarly, the Australian Democrats are concerned at the apparent absence of a direct relationship between the legislation and the regulations. In particular, much of the government's policy proposals are contained within the regulations and not the main body of legislation. In this regard, I foreshadow a number of amendments that will be moved by the Democrats.
First, we propose to remove the requirement that a “registered automotive workshop” be a corporation. By referring to `entities' compliance cost will be reduced.
Second, we propose to change the definition in Section 13 D(1) by adding the words “that is not a model of a variant of a model of a standard vehicle”. This brings the scheme back to the recommendations of the Taskforce investigating the Act.
Third, we seek to delete term “Specialist and Enthusiast Vehicles” and replace it with “Low Volume Imported Vehicles”.
The Democrats have a range of other concerns that we feel have not, as yet, received, sufficient attention. In particular, the Australian Democrats are of the view that a `1800' telephone number for parts is essential to protect consumer interest. In our minority report we recommend that the Government make participation in the service compulsory and consider providing a small grant to promote and expand the service.
The issue of insurance companies refusing insurance on vehicles is a serious matter. This needs to be urgently investigated, and questions asked as to why companies are refusing policies.
Furthermore. the regulations should also be the subject of extensive review before being enacted. For the Senate to play its proper role in providing oversight of legislation it important that regulations are available for close scrutiny at the time of the Bill.",SENATE,<title>MOTOR VEHICLE STANDARDS AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,57,1,speech

Introduction
The Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill 2001 and the Bankruptcy (Estate Charges) Amendment Bill 2001 were introduced in the House of Representatives on 7 June 2001.
In introducing the principal Bill, the Attorney-General stated that bankruptcy had been devised “as a shield that might be used, in the last resort, by an impecunious debtor to seek relief from his or her overwhelming debts. Over the years, some unscrupulous debtors have learned to use bankruptcy as a sword to defeat the legitimate claims of their creditors”.
That sentiment—the idea that bankruptcy is used by the rich rather than the broke—has been on the rise over the previous year given the prominence which has been given in the media to high-profile bankrupts, including a number of lawyers who appear to be living the high life while officially being bankrupt—some of them more than once.
If the bankruptcy law is being abused, it is appropriate that it be reviewed and amended to ensure that loopholes cannot be exploited.
Labor certainly supports those measures in the Bill which will make it harder for otherwise well-off people who are using bankruptcy improperly.
However, despite the hype generated by the Attorney-General, there is little in this Bill which will have any substantial impact on cracking down on the top end of town.
To the contrary, much of the `reform' is squarely directed at low income people who are forced to go into bankruptcy because they can't pay the debts they have incurred.
It is a Bill which is typical of a government that protects the greedy, not the needy.
Background
The last major overhaul of bankruptcy legislation was in 1996, shortly after the Coalition came to office. The 1996 Bill was substantially based on Labor's 1995 Bill and incorporated amendments recommended by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation committee in September 1995.
This Bill does a number of things.
It repeals the existing optional 7 day cooling-off period introduces a mandatory 30 day cooling-off period.
It gives Official Receivers a discretion to reject a debtor's petition where it appears that, within a reasonable time, the debtor could pay all the debts listed in the debtor's statement of affairs and that the debtor's petition is an abuse of the bankruptcy system.
It abolishes early discharge from bankruptcy.
It will make it easier for trustees to lodge objections to a person's discharge from bankruptcy and harder for bankrupts to sustain challenges to objections.
It clarifies that a bankruptcy can be annulled by the Court whether or not the bankrupt was insolvent when a debtor's petition for bankruptcy was accepted. 
It doubles the current income threshold for debt agreements, to allow and encourage many more debtors to choose this particular alternative to bankruptcy. 
Other changes proposed by the Bill streamline the operation of the Act or are a consequence of the Insolvency and Trustee Service of Australia (ITSA) having become an executive agency.
The Bankruptcy (Estate Charges) Amendment Bill 2001 amends the Bankruptcy (Estate Charges) Act 1997 to exempt any surplus in a bankrupt estate from the scope of the realisations charge, remove current payment obligations for the interest charge and the realisations charge if the amount otherwise payable is less than $10 in a charge period, close some charge-avoidance opportunities and simplify some machinery provisions of that Act.  These amendments are technical and facilitative in nature and Labor will support them.
While Labor supports the need for bankruptcy reform, there are a number of aspects which are less than satisfactory which I now wish to touch on.
Consultation
First, concerns were expressed during the Senate Committee hearing on this Bill that, in drawing up the reforms, the government paid little attention to those organisations who most closely represent the interests of those people for whom the bankruptcy legislation exists—low-income people.
When somebody comes to the realisation that they can't meet their debt repayments—it may be that they have too many credit cards and they just can't cope with the financial situation in which they find themselves—one of the first people they often see is a financial counsellor.
These people are at the coalface of our personal insolvency system. Often, by visiting a financial counsellor, it is possible to provide people with assistance to budget their way out of debt. Other times, the only option is bankruptcy.
I would have thought that, in framing a personal insolvency system, one of the most important groups of people to listen closely to would be financial counsellors. But the Wesley Community Legal Service expressed its view that “financial counselling organisations were not consulted properly” and that “proper consultation with interested and relevant community based welfare organisations did not occur but rather lip service was paid to a few select organisations.”
The detailed provisions of the Bill—which are targeted more at the low-income bankrupts who are in over their heads than the bankrupt barristers who sit back in their harbourside mansions—reflect that lack of interest in the experience of financial counsellors. As the Wesley Community Legal Service submitted, the Bill will “disadvantage many of the poor in society and their families” while debt collectors stand to gain.
That is a shocking indictment of a government which has professed to govern for all Australians but instead has been caught time and time again knocking down those who are least able to stand up for themselves.
Cooling off period
While Labor will support the government's proposal to repeal the existing optional 7 day cooling-off period in favour of a mandatory 30 day cooling-off period, this proposal will not come without potential problems.
First, it should be noted that not all debtors are subject to the cooling off period.
Debtors excluded from the requirement for a cooling off period are:
·	partnership debtors;
·	deceased estates;
·	debtors who carried on a business at any time in the 30 days preceding the petition;
·	debtors the subject of a creditor's petition or of a specified legal proceeding which is scheduled for substantive hearing within 60 days of the date of the debtor's petition; and
·	debtors who, in the 12 months before petitioning, unsuccessfully attempted to make alternative arrangements under the Act.
One of the effects of these exclusions is that, while business people who go broke will not be required to conduct further negotiations with creditors in the 30 days subsequent to lodging a bankruptcy petition, low income creditors—who make up the bulk of the work performed by ITSA—will.
As the Law Council of Australia pointed out, it is difficult to see the need for what they described as “a complex and administratively difficult procedure which will act as a condition precedent to becoming bankrupt”.
In fact, the Law Council of Australia went further then this—to seriously doubt that these provisions would have any positive effect for those who it is most intended to benefit—the creditors:
“What will happen is that people will simply file their debtor's petition, go away and forget about it, and 30 days later they will be bankrupt and they will be none the wiser and the creditors will be none the better off.”
While this is one scenario, credit counselling groups have raised the spectre that the amendment will lead to greater harassment of genuinely broke individuals by debt collectors within the 30 day period.
Credit counselling agencies are already stretched to the limit will be even further tested by clients who come back to seek assistance during this 30 day period when approached by creditors to withdraw their bankruptcy petitions and to make alternative arrangements.
In this respect, the proposals probably fail to give full weight to the fact that bankruptcy is already an absolute last resort for people who are unable to pay their debts. The fact that bankruptcy carries with it very serious consequences not only in relation to one's own creditworthiness for years to come, but also the social stigma, means that it is genuinely a last resort and not entered into lightly. ITSA already provides information to potential bankrupts on a range of less draconian alternatives to bankruptcy.
While the government has not made out a convincing case either for the need for an extended cooling off period or its likely effectiveness, Labor will not oppose this change. We will, however, be very interested to see whether in the next few years it has any positive effects on arresting the rate of bankruptcies throughout Australia.
Early discharge
The Bill also proposes to abolish the provisions which allow early discharge for low income bankrupts.
The first point to make is that those who will be affected by this measure will be among the most vulnerable in our society. Therefore you would think that the government should present compelling evidence why it is necessary for the good operation of bankruptcy law in this country that the provisions be abolished.
The government has not made a convincing case at all for the abolition of early discharge.
Administrative early discharge provisions were introduced in 1992 in response to concerns that low-income earners did not have any real capacity to avail themselves of the existing early discharge provisions that required an application to the Federal Court. At that time, only a very small proportion of bankrupts availed themselves of the early discharge provisions, because of the costs involved with making an application to the court. In almost all cases where early discharge was sought, the order was granted. 
In respect of early discharge, the second reading speech tabled by Senator Bob McMullan on 22nd August 1995 stated:
“Commonly, persons who succeed in obtaining orders for discharge have become bankrupt as a result of failed business activities, and seek early discharge so as to enable them to resume such activities. These are usually also persons who have the capacity to contribute to the estate from income, but do not do so. The proposals in the Bill will restore equity to the operation of the early discharge system, and the eligibility and disqualification criteria are designed to ensure that where a person has become a bankrupt because of commercial culpability, he or she is disqualified from early discharge.”
Under the current early discharge provisions, a bankrupt may apply for early discharge after 6 months from the time when he or she files a statement of affairs with the Registrar. 
The eligibility criteria are that:
·	the bankrupt has no or insufficient divisible property to enable a dividend to be paid,
·	the bankrupt has not disposed of property in a transaction that is void against the trustee, and
·	the bankrupt earns an income that is less than the actual income threshold amount applicable to him or her at the time the application for early discharge is made. 
Disqualifying criteria include where:
·	the bankrupt has previously been a bankrupt;
·	the unsecured liabilities of the bankrupt exceed 150% of his or her income in the year prior to the date of bankruptcy;
·	more than 50% of the bankrupt's unsecured liabilities are attributable to the conduct by the bankrupt of business activities; and
·	the bankrupt has given false or misleading information about his or her assets, liabilities or income. 
From these qualifications and disqualifications, it is clear that the abolition of the early discharge provisions will only affect low-income earners and only in respect of their first bankruptcy. 
Early discharge is not available in respect of second and subsequent bankruptcies. 
There is no evidence that these provisions are being abused.
Public hearings by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee into the Bills were characterised by a complete lack of evidence as to the need for the abolition of the early discharge provisions. Mr Donald Costello, Acting Adviser, Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia, who provided evidence to the Committee on the policies underlining the proposed changes, summed this up when he said:
“There are no statistics which would be available to help make a decision as to whether or not early discharge is an appropriate regime to have. All we can provide is feedback from Credit Union Services Corporation of Australia Ltd, which is a significant lending group representing a substantial number of credit unions, plus persistent correspondence from mainly small business creditors over the years who say that it is too easy for people to walk away from their debts.”
I believe that the abolition of these provisions is actually an expression of this government's attempt to divide Australians by scapegoating the most disadvantaged.
I am confident that Australians will reject the negativity of this government—just as Northern Territorians rejected attempts by Brian Burke to divide the Northern Territory community by running on race issues.
The key feature of the early discharge provisions is that they were designed to deal with the increasing number of consumer bankruptcies which were due “more to misfortune than misdeed”.
This is happening to Australians across the country. With an explosion in the use of credit cards over the last decade, more and more people have access to easy credit and more and more people are running into financial trouble—so much more so now that Australians are faced with paying an extra 10% on everyday items whenever they go to the cash register.
And what is this government's approach? Instead of recognising that their policies have forced greater financial hardship on individuals and small businesses—and in many cases sent them to the wall—this government is now in denial that people run into debt trouble not because they are irresponsible about spending their money because the pressure on them is so great that they are driven into debt.
In introducing this Bill, the Attorney-General said:
“The provisions were targeted at a new category of bankrupt—consumer debtors with low asset backing who over-extend and then cannot repay their debts. However, many believe that bankruptcy in this group is due more to lack of financial responsibility than to misfortune.”
This is a cold and heartless statement from a cold and heartless government—one which has inflicted so much hardship on struggling Australians and which then seeks to blame them for that hardship.
Well, Australians are sick and tired of this heartless government, and they are responding to Labor's message that more needs to be done to improve their living standards, to increase their access to public health services. Labor will not blame struggling Australians for the hardship that this government has visited upon them. We recognise the problems they are facing and will act to fix them.
So Labor does not support the heartless philosophy behind the abolition of these early discharge provisions and believes that no compelling justification has been advanced for their abolition.
Instead, Labor will seek to amend the Bill to retain the early discharge provisions but to allow early discharge only after two years.
This proposal will create a greater incentive for potential bankrupts to enter into alternative arrangements—such as debt agreements—to avoid bankruptcy while still providing some relief for low-income debtors who have bitten off more than they can chew by virtue of the increased difficulties forced upon them by this government.
Offence of incurring debts in two years prior to bankruptcy
The Bill also seeks to amend section 265(8) of the Bankruptcy Act, which provides that:
A person who has become a bankrupt and, within 2 years before he or she became a bankrupt and after the commencement of this Act, has contracted a debt provable in the bankruptcy of an amount of $500 or upwards without having at the time of contracting it any reasonable or probable ground of expectation, after taking into consideration his or her other liabilities (if any), of being able to pay the debt, is guilty of an offence and is punishable, upon conviction, by imprisonment for a period not exceeding 1 year.
The Bill proposes to amend this section by removing the minimum threshold requirement of $500.
The government says that the amendment will prevent the situation arising where a person could not be prosecuted where, before bankruptcy, they went on a spree and ran up a number of debts of less than $500 each but who at the time had no “reasonable or probable ground or expectation of being able to pay the debt”. 
The government also claims that the amendment will bring the Bankruptcy Act into harmony with the equivalent Corporations Law provision.
Labor's concern is that the abolition of the threshold may result in the prosecution of debtors who have incurred small debts—of amounts less than $500—for example, in respect of unpaid utility bills or overdue rent payments. 
This is more evidence that the government is out of touch with the basic needs of struggling Australians. The inability to meet the costs of these necessities of life should not result in the possibility of prosecution. 
While there is an interest in bringing the insolvency law into harmony with the Corporations Law, the approach should not be inflexible. After all, corporations do not have to incur basic personal expenses necessary to live. People do.
Accordingly, Labor will seek to amend the section so that a person cannot be prosecuted for incurring a debt in respect of a reasonable or necessary personal or household expense without any reasonable ground of expectation of being able to pay the debt.",SENATE,<title>BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,58,1,speech
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2001-09-27,"—This is a busy day. It is the final day on which debate is taking place in this house and in this parliament. The Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill 2001 and the Bankruptcy (Estate Charges) Amendment Bill 2001 deal with very important legislation. I see some representatives of ITSA here, and I pay tribute to them for the work they have done over the years. Bankruptcy is a difficult business in the sense that it tries to balance the need to have debts paid and for people to be responsible for the positions they put themselves in and at the same time it tries to get people back to a normal life so that they can go on free of debt and obligations. There are great issues of what is morally right as well as what is financially right in those areas, and I think over the years that has been kept in mind.
The Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee prepared a report on these bills, and it is in keeping with the usual high standard that has been set by the committee. On this occasion the committee was chaired by Senator Payne. Observations were made, and I want to take some time to mention one particular aspect. Those who gave evidence to the committee did so in a splendid way, but there were two groups who gave evidence that I want to mention: the Wesley Community Legal Centre and the West Heidelberg Community Legal Service. Both of those groups had some concern about how this legislation will affect the sorts of people they act for—that is, the people who are struggling within this community, struggling with their finances and struggling with their social position, because money problems also bring social problems. I want to talk about those two groups, the Wesley Community Legal Centre and the West Heidelberg Community Legal Service. I want to say something about them because they represent a group of institutions and people in society who do splendid work for people in need, for people who are disadvantaged, for people who are not as fortunate as you and I, Mr Acting Deputy President, or as fortunate as all those who are in this chamber. Even though we are pressed for time on a day such as this, I think some time should be taken to acknowledge the work that a whole series of people and a whole series of groups do throughout society. For example, the churches have committees and institutions which do tremendous work, and I wish to acknowledge that. When we come back to a new parliament I will use some occasion to name some of these people.
On a topic such as bankruptcy it is not only, as it were, the large companies, the large banks and the people who are dealing with large sums of money that count, but also those who are affected by bankruptcy laws but are very modest in circumstance or, indeed, almost in abject poverty. So I take this occasion to mention those people, to mention those institutions and to mention those groups that go about trying to help not only society as a whole but also particular parts of it so that society as a whole may become a better and fairer place.",SENATE,<title>BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,58,1,speech

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-09-27,"—I seek leave to have my speech on the Mass Marketed Tax Effective Investment Schemes incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
I would firstly like to thank the members of the Committee secretariat.  Thank-you to Peter Hallahan, Alistair Sands and Sarah Bachelard.  
This was a lengthy inquiry.  It was complex inquiry and aspects of it were very emotional.
I want to reiterate that the Committee accepts that the great majority of investors in these schemes were not aware of the tax mischief in the schemes—to put it simply, they are not tax cheats.  They are ordinary Australians trying to provide for things like their retirement and the cost of educating their children.
Along side the financial burden which has fallen on many people as a result investing in these schemes, the act of being branded a tax cheat has been the most distressing aspect of this whole mess.
I visited Kalgoorlie about 6 weeks ago.  You only need to sit down with a few of the residents who invested in the schemes and chat with them on a one-to-one basis to realise that these people do not deserve to be penalised and they don't deserve to be involved in this debacle. 
A significant aspect of the inquiry was seeing the emotional damage that these schemes have caused.  They have caused substantial financial harm to many people and that is a matter of dollars and cents.  I understand that officers of the tax office are trained and expected to protect the revenue and work by the rule and not by emotions.  
As a Committee that is trying to determine a solution to these problems, I think it was necessary for us to understand all aspects of what those involved have experienced.  That ranges from understanding the nature of the schemes and the amounts involved, to the collection methods of the ATO and then to the emotional trauma that has damaged families.
In arriving at the recommendations contained in the report the Committee has searched high and low to find solutions that minimise the burden on the taxpayers whilst at the same time recognising some tax must be paid.
My sincerest congratulations and thanks extend to the Chair, Senator Murphy.  I know that Senator Murphy has taken it on himself to be as generous as he could to the disaffected taxpayers whilst at the same time being realistic about what the government would accept and what was fair to taxpayers generally.
I anticipate that the Committee may be criticised from both sides—some saying that the recommendations are too lenient and other that they don't go far enough.  To those people I would say that this was a tremendously difficult inquiry.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-09-27,"—I seek leave to have my speech on the Mass Marketed Tax Effective Investment Schemes incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
I would firstly like to thank the members of the Committee secretariat.  Thank-you to Peter Hallahan, Alistair Sands and Sarah Bachelard.  
This was a lengthy inquiry.  It was complex inquiry and aspects of it were very emotional.
I want to reiterate that the Committee accepts that the great majority of investors in these schemes were not aware of the tax mischief in the schemes—to put it simply, they are not tax cheats.  They are ordinary Australians trying to provide for things like their retirement and the cost of educating their children.
Along side the financial burden which has fallen on many people as a result investing in these schemes, the act of being branded a tax cheat has been the most distressing aspect of this whole mess.
I visited Kalgoorlie about 6 weeks ago.  You only need to sit down with a few of the residents who invested in the schemes and chat with them on a one-to-one basis to realise that these people do not deserve to be penalised and they don't deserve to be involved in this debacle. 
A significant aspect of the inquiry was seeing the emotional damage that these schemes have caused.  They have caused substantial financial harm to many people and that is a matter of dollars and cents.  I understand that officers of the tax office are trained and expected to protect the revenue and work by the rule and not by emotions.  
As a Committee that is trying to determine a solution to these problems, I think it was necessary for us to understand all aspects of what those involved have experienced.  That ranges from understanding the nature of the schemes and the amounts involved, to the collection methods of the ATO and then to the emotional trauma that has damaged families.
In arriving at the recommendations contained in the report the Committee has searched high and low to find solutions that minimise the burden on the taxpayers whilst at the same time recognising some tax must be paid.
My sincerest congratulations and thanks extend to the Chair, Senator Murphy.  I know that Senator Murphy has taken it on himself to be as generous as he could to the disaffected taxpayers whilst at the same time being realistic about what the government would accept and what was fair to taxpayers generally.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-09-27,"—As much as I would like to give a lengthy speech on Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) 2001, which I think at the end of every sitting I have dropped into the habit of doing—for good reason, I might say—
Honourable senators interjecting—
—If you want to debate it, get Robert Hill, the leader of yours, back.
—Order!
—Can't keep his word.
—Doesn't keep his word.
—Cannot be trusted.
—Senator Carr, please—
—Hill the rat; simple as that! Not the first time; won't be the last!
—He's off and leaves other people to scab on his word.
—Order! I am trying to call Senator Sherry to speak.
—My colleagues are obviously a little bit worked up about our great success in moving these amendments.
—Madam Chairman, on a point of order: at no stage in the proceedings have I actually heard what bill we are dealing with.
—We are dealing with Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6).
—As I was saying, it seems that at the end of every session over the last year and a half we have been dealing with GST legislation of some sort or another and I have found myself speaking on it. I do not think I am going to be speaking as late tonight as I have on previous occasions. I can recall a 6 o'clock in the morning speech and a 2 o'clock in the morning speech, dealing with the 1,800-odd amendments we have had to the GST since 1 July last year. This chamber has dealt with 1,800 amendments to the GST since 1 July last year! Those GST amendments that have been moved and supported by the Democrats in the Senate chamber have of course included a wide range of roll-back. They have included amendments on beer, caravan parks, charities and swimming lessons. Senator Kemp well remembers the debate we had here at 6 o'clock in the morning about swimming lessons. At the government's initiative, we rolled back the GST on swimming lessons. There has been one series of roll-backs after another by this government on the GST.
I was very pleased today that the Labor Party, with the support of the Democrats—and I will come back to that briefly—was successful in its amendments to the GST in a number of areas. The Labor Party amended the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) 2001, which we are currently considering, in respect of the GST on funerals, caravan park rents and women's sanitary products. I am a bit reluctant to say this, but we did have a worthy contribution from the Australian Democrats, who have discovered GST roll-back all of a sudden. The Democrats discovered GST roll-back and supported the Labor amendments that were successfully moved to this bill, and the worthy contribution they made was in regard to lactation devices.
—It was a `lact' of grace!
—Thank you, Senator. I did not know a great deal about lactation devices until July or August last year, when my wife and I had a baby. Since then, I have learnt a lot more about lactation devices than I would normally have considered necessary. So moving an amendment to make lactation devices GST-free was a worthy contribution from the Democrats. It is important to touch on the Labor Party amendment on funerals, from a Tasmanian perspective. The Liberal Party in Tasmania have endorsed the candidates for their Senate ticket, and I will not go into all the horrible details. Senators Abetz and Watson are well aware of those.
—Why not?
—No, I am not going to do that. I am going to stick to the issue, which is funerals. The Liberal Party have endorsed the national president of the Funeral Directors Association as Liberal Senate candidate on their ticket in the forthcoming federal election.
—He would be a dead cert, wouldn't he?
—I will just conclude on this point. The Liberal Party have endorsed the national president of the Funeral Directors Association, and when our leader announced the commencement of roll-back on funerals about two weeks ago, we were very pleased indeed to see the national president of the Funeral Directors Association, who is a Liberal Senate candidate in the forthcoming election, endorse Labor Party policy. Endorsement from Mr Parry, a Liberal Senate candidate, was a great start to roll-back, and I congratulate him on coming out and supporting Labor policy.
The amendments we moved in the areas that I have outlined were supported by the Australian Democrats. I have a very brief comment about the Australian Democrats. After the Lees-Howard deal on the package that they supported on the GST last year, there seems to have been something of a conversion among the Democrats. I will not go into the detail of that, it is pretty horrible for the Democrats, and I know that it is the last evening of the session—
—It's nearly night. It's shifting from evening into night.
—Yes, it is shifting from evening into night. But we are very pleased to see that the Australian Democrats have suddenly discovered Labor's roll-back on funerals, caravan park rents, women's sanitary products and lactation devices. We are very pleased. It is just a pity that at the time they did their deal with the government the Australian Democrats did not identify the serious problems the GST was going to cause for a wide group of people in the community. I will leave my comments about the Democrats at that point.
Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) 2001 is important. It contains a number of very important provisions including the alienation of personal services income, the extension of listed investment and the tax treatment of HIH rescue payments. Having successfully moved a number of amendments in respect of GST roll-back, with Democrat support, if we now insist on our GST amendments, the bill will probably be defeated and the important matters I have just mentioned will be defeated along with it. Given we are so close to an election and the electorate will be considering the issue of the GST, among others, the Labor Party will not be insisting on its amendments. In a few weeks, whenever we know the date, the Australian electorate will make a decision about GST roll-back and the areas we successfully moved amendments to will, I am sure, be included in our roll-back package, which will have further detail released. I am not aware of that detail, but certainly funerals, caravan park rents, women's sanitary products and lactation devices are a good start. So the Labor Party, as I indicated, regards as important the amendments in relation to contractors, the HIH rescue package and some tax changes in respect of local governments, and we will not insist on our amendments and will allow the legislation to pass.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 6) 2001</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,68,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-09-27,"—I will put on the record the Democrats position in relation to this: given that Labor have just indicated that they will not be insisting on these amendments—their amendments and indeed the Democrats amendment to this bill that were passed earlier today—obviously the bill will go through unamended; the Democrats acknowledge the numbers in relation to that and will not be kicking up too much of a fuss.
But I thought I had best correct some of Senator Sherry's perceptions and the comments he has made in relation to the Democrats. I could adopt the Senator Schacht line of argument to legislation in this place and say that the legislation was totally the government's legislation and it is completely unfair to blame anybody else for the outcome. But I do not take that approach, and that is because the Democrats were the first to do GST roll-back. We engaged in enormous changes to the original GST package, making it immensely fairer and immensely less environmentally damaging. 
The pleasing part of this is that the ALP has now shifted its position to actually accepting and considering amendments to the tax laws surrounding GST. If we had had the ALP's support at the time for other amendments that we would like to have moved, then we would have actually been able to roll it back even further than we could do at the time. It was because the ALP insisted on opposing every single amendment that the Democrats put up at the time that we were unable to get the support of the Senate to improve the package even further.
The Democrats will continue to work not just in that area of the tax law—the GST area—but every area of the tax law to make it fairer, to make it more workable, to make it more environmentally sustainable and to make it more appropriate in terms of the levels of revenue it needs to raise. We would appreciate the cooperation of all other parties in doing that. It is pleasing to see that the ALP have changed position to now taking a responsible approach and looking to consider amendments. They have supported a Democrat amendment today in relation to roll-back, if you like. Indeed, they have supported previous amendments.
I should say that, even after the initial package went through, the Democrats were actually the first to ensure that GST was taken off an additional item, and that was in the area of time-share resorts. I do not know if Senator Sherry remembers that particular debate. It was a disallowance motion that ended up not needing to go ahead but we spoke about it a bit anyway. That was a Democrat initiative and again was an example of us working constructively to always try and improve the legislation and improve the taxation system and its operation—whether it is in the GST or any other area—and to try to ensure that it did not have unfair consequences or anomalies.
In that sense—although I do not necessarily think roll-back is the best description for improving tax laws of any type, whether it is GST or others—I welcome the ALP's conversion to that approach. I wish they had been more constructive in considering amendments and improvements to the tax laws at the time they were first being debated. We may have been able to get an even better package at that stage. The Democrats are obviously on the record as being strongly committed to further improving the tax act in a range of areas. This is just one of them. We are pleased that the ALP are on the record in support of our suggestion to exempt lactation devices and the other ones that were on the record today as a result of this particular debate.
We will not kick up a fuss in relation to the Democrats amendment and the other ALP amendments. They clearly will now not be insisted upon and the legislation will go through unamended. As I understand it, the primary bill was a positive one, so in that sense we would not want to hold it up. I do think it is important to correct the impression Senator Sherry gave about the Democrats' approach to taxation in general and the GST more specifically. I hope that it is a sign that if the ALP do get into government they will work constructively with other parties to advance the effectiveness of the tax act in a whole range of areas, GST being just one.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2001-09-27,"—I rise in the chamber tonight to talk about representation. I believe it is a fitting theme, because as this parliament closes tonight we recognise that it is probably the final sitting day before the next federal election. We are all in politics and in parliament to represent the people, our constituents. Tonight I would like to reflect upon what I believe has been the abject failure of the Minister for Sport and Tourism, the member for Lindsay, Jackie Kelly, to carry out that vital and indeed noble role. The Minister for Sport and Tourism, the member for Lindsay, Jackie Kelly, obviously shares my belief in the concept of representation and its importance. In her first speech to the House of Representatives, she said:
The people of Lindsay ... want a representative who is part of a truly representative government, a government which has input from all walks of life, all ethnic groups, all generations and all denominations.
It is unfortunate, I believe, that the trust that the people of Lindsay placed in their member, Jackie Kelly, to take their interests to the federal parliament has been appallingly ignored.
There is no more forthright way of representing people, particularly in your electorate, than to use the forums of the parliament to reflect and air their concerns. Therefore, it gives me no pleasure tonight to highlight the abysmal failure of the member for Lindsay to utilise this parliament to represent the interests of her electorate. An analysis of the Hansard of the House of Representatives reveals shocking statistics in regard to the member for Lindsay's failure to represent her electorate. If honourable senators opposite are honest with themselves, the statistics I am about to detail will appal them. In the course of this parliament—our 39th parliament since Federation—the member for Lindsay has racked up a truly shocking record of inactivity. The sum total of her speeches to this parliament amounts to 69 minutes. That is not 69 minutes in sittings this year; that is a total of 69 minutes speaking in the parliament over the course of the last three years.
I understand, as we all do, that as the member for Lindsay and as a minister Miss Kelly has two roles. One of course is as a local member; the other is to represent and carry out the duties of her portfolio. We note that ministers sometimes will have difficulty in finding the time required to reflect the interests of their constituents, particularly if their ministerial duties intervene. But, when you look at the record of all the members of this government, the one that stands out for the greatest inactivity on behalf of the constituents of their own electorate is the member for Lindsay.
I think it is important to note, as we did earlier in the valedictory speeches, the fine contribution made to this chamber by the senator for the Northern Territory, Senator Grant Tambling. Senator Tambling, as all speakers noted, not only was a person who carried out responsible duties as a parliamentary secretary but also spent a lot of time in this chamber speaking on behalf of his constituents in the Northern Territory. He certainly spent a lot more time than 69 minutes raising the interests and concerns of the constituents in his electorate, notwithstanding the fact that he had other parliamentary duties as a parliamentary secretary. In the total of those three years—that 69 minutes—the Minister for Sport and Tourism, the member for Lindsay, Jackie Kelly, has made some 16 speeches. Not one of those speeches has ever dealt with the issues of concern for the people of Lindsay in Western Sydney. No doubt the member for Lindsay has been more involved in worrying about her extensive share portfolio, which was commented on in an article in the Australian only a few weeks ago.
The minister's performance in relation to the collapse of Ansett and the subsequent knock-on effects on the tourism industry were referred to by this minister as a `blip'. Quite rightly, the minister was castigated and reprimanded by the Prime Minister for such an insulting and indeed ridiculous assertion about the collapse of one of this country's two great domestic airlines. It demonstrates that not only has the member for Lindsay, the Minister for Sport and Tourism, not been focusing upon her own electorate—as her parliamentary speaking record demonstrates—but she has not been focusing too closely on the interests of her portfolio either. Indeed, of the 69 minutes of speeches that the minister has bothered to come into parliament to give over three years, just 25 minutes have related to the minister's responsibilities for tourism. What an absolutely disgraceful record. Sixty-nine minutes adds up to the equivalent of about 3½ full speeches. This, frankly, is an absolute disgrace. Out of that total of 69 minutes, the minister has spent only 27 minutes speaking about her other responsibilities as the minister for sport. Clearly, in both her portfolio responsibilities of sport and tourism, the minister has been an abject failure, just as she has been a failure in representing in this parliament the interests of her constituents.
I would like to put this a bit more into context. Recently, the former President of the United States of America, Bill Clinton, visited our shores for a number of speaking engagements. It is widely reported that Mr Clinton was paid some $200,000 per speech. It is not a bad job to get paid $200,000 for an hour's work, as we all would recognise. It is not bad work if you can get it. But when you compare what was apparently paid to Mr Clinton for, say, one speech of an hour—some $200,000—with what has been paid to the Minister for Sport and Tourism over three years for her total speaking engagements in this parliament of 69 minutes, she has been paid the equivalent of about $450,000, which is nearly 2½ times what former President Bill Clinton gets. That translates into a pay rate of some $6,546.52 per minute for the speeches made in this parliament by the member for Lindsay and the Minister for Sport and Tourism, Miss Kelly. That is approaching the earning capacity per minute of Kerry Packer or even Bill Gates. It is not bad work if you can get it, and clearly the member for Lindsay—who curries favour with the Prime Minister—is able to get away with it. Unfortunately, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Senator Grant Tambling, was unable to get the support of the Prime Minister to assist him in retaining his position in this parliament, notwithstanding the outstanding service he has given as a senator to his government and to his state.
Finally, I draw attention to Miss Kelly's web site. There is a heading which refers to `Jackie's Speeches'. Unfortunately, you will not find any of Miss Kelly's speeches under that heading. What you will find is a speech by the minister for finance and one by Senator Helen Coonan. What an insult to the people of her electorate. I have no doubt that at the next election the people of Lindsay will pass their judgment on the appalling performance of Miss Kelly.
