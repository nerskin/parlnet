"Sidebottom, Sid, MP",ALP,2003-10-15,"—In rising to speak on the Higher Education Support Bill 2003 and the related Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003, may I say good morning, Mr Speaker and colleagues. Yesterday I was speaking about this government's miserly approach to the University of Tasmania—
—Minister Truss, I do regard you as a colleague. The financial data indicates that the cumulative funding cut to the University of Tasmania from when this government came to office, in 1996, until 2002 was in the order of $119 million. That is part and parcel of the $5 billion cut to higher education under this government.
In contrast, under Labor there will be additional funding of $8 million for the University of Tasmania from the indexation clause in Labor's policy. During this government's term, since 1996, there has been a student-staff ratio increase of 36 per cent, and that is by no means the highest increase in student-staff ratios of our universities throughout Australia. The solution to meeting unmet demand for places at our universities could therefore not be more stark. The Nelson proposal will not even meet demographic growth after 2007. On the other hand, by 2008 Labor will create over 20,000 new full-time and part-time university places every year for Australians starting an undergraduate degree, as well as 20,000 TAFE places. 
Another key policy difference concerns fees. Since 1996, students and their families have already been faced with massive increases in HECS fees. Indeed, as Lincoln Wright pointed out in the Sunday Tasmanian on 12 October, student HECS debts are set to top $13 billion in three years, as low-income graduates struggle to pay off what they owe. They currently owe as much as $10 billion. The Nelson plan proposes, in proposed section 93-10 of the main bill, to deregulate HECS, allowing universities to set their fees at 30 per cent higher than existing rates, with the exception of teaching and nursing, which are capped at existing rates. That is recognition of the dangers of increasing fees, because it will have a detrimental effect on important professions and courses, such as teaching and nursing.
Will these fees be capped at 30 per cent? The bill provides the minister with the ability to vary them, and we know that HECS debts could reach $50,000. Already, too many students and their families are burdened with debt. Too many students have to take up more part-time employment or, indeed, almost full-time employment. They carry more debt and, under this government's proposals for higher education, that will increase.
In deference to my colleagues, because they all wish to speak, I quickly point out that a Labor government will remove the 30 per cent increase in HECS fees; we will remove the provisions that allow full fees to be charged to Australian undergraduate students; we will limit FEE-HELP loans for postgraduate study; we will remove the insidious 3.5 per cent surcharge, above the consumer price index, on FEE-HELP loans; we will increase by 20,000 the number of full-time and part-time funded places, as I mentioned earlier; we will remove the industrial relations and governance conditions and the caveats on the $404 million of Commonwealth Grants Scheme funding; we will increase the HECS repayment threshold to $35,000 in 2004-05; we will include Labor's indexation formula based on wage cost indexation, which is a far more equitable system of indexing formulas; and we will make the scope of funding agreements less prescriptive and more of an incentive rather than a stick.
There is a stark contrast between our policy on higher education and this government's policy. We believe in investing in Australia's future and its social and economic capital, and we do not necessarily see it as a cost.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Neville, Paul, MP",NP,2003-10-15,"—The Higher Education Support Bill 2003 and its accompanying bill, the Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003, mark a new evolutionary era for Australian higher education institutions. The provision of high-er education services is a demanding, dynamic and highly competitive sector, and almost all stakeholders realise that, in order to meet the rigours of competition in the 21st century, the current system is in need of reform. The Australian public also understand that no government can afford to provide all the resources that universities may need in the future and that, unless there are contributions from private sources, we will not be able to meet the demands of universities in the coming century.
The main bill contains a number of elements. Crucially, it proposes a new Commonwealth Grants Scheme for universities whereby, from 2005 onwards, grants for universities will be based on a new funding regime premised on student numbers and discipline mix. Why are we introducing this new format? We are doing so because it will allow greater flexibility, increase the quality and effectiveness of our education, training and research facilities, and allow for future growth. 
I approach this debate cognisant of the fact that universities have been transformed into something of a catch-all. They once existed almost solely for research and purely academic pursuits. It is true that, if it were not for universities, we would not come across some of the great truths of art and science. Yet university studies are now assumed to be a logical and practical extension of an individual's education, and not necessarily an avenue to higher learning for purely academic purposes. More often than not, universities are now seen as the gateway to securing a great job, qualifying for a promotion or nailing a pay rise. Whilst I do not condemn the transformation in the particular purpose of higher education, it is clear that universities and the higher educat-ion sector in general must move with the times and perhaps shape themselves into something more relevant to today's society. That is the purpose of this legislation.
We cannot underestimate the social and economic contribution that the higher education sector makes to Australian life. Its partial deregulation will go further to foster those benefits. In terms of sheer numbers, 295,000 international students choose to study with Australian higher education institutions and schools every year—130,000 of them at universities. In dollar terms, this translates to more than $5.2 billion in the sector of education services—our third largest export sector. Further to this, our higher education regime employs tens of thousands of Australians—81,000 in 2002—and generates a total revenue of $11.2 billion per year.
The government recognise that there is room for further growth in the education and training sector as an export industry. We are actively seeking to develop that sector further. To that end, the government will invest $1.5 billion in the sector over the next four years and provide a total support package of $10.6 billion over the next decade. Those significant sums will not be thrown at the sector in the haphazard way that the ALP proposes. There is a clear structure in this funding, which is tied to reforms which need to be introduced. 
From 2006, Australian universities will be able to access new funding under a range of programs. Those programs include the two-year $138.5 million learning and teaching performance fund, the two-year workplace productivity program worth $55.2 million, and the collaboration and structural reform program comprising $36.6 million between 2005 and 2007. On top of this, our universities will have upwards of 25,000 marginal places converted to fully funded places allocated to them by 2007, including 210 new fully funded nursing places which will be brought on line next year. Further investments include $42 million to promote our education and training sector in the international market and $36 million to set up international centres of excellence.
An OECD report released last month recognised that this government spends above the OECD average on education. It currently spends about six per cent of gross domestic product on education compared with 5.8 per cent in 2002 and the average OECD national level of 5.5 per cent. In fact, it is spending well above the OECD average in all areas of education—primary, secondary and tertiary. This government is investing $US4,967 per student per year compared with the OECD average of $US4,381. For high schools, Australia is putting in $US6,894 per secondary student compared with the OECD average of $US5,957. For tertiary students, it is investing $US12,854 per student compared with the OECD average of $US9,571. In fact, the OECD report showed that the government is spending 1.6 per cent of GDP on education alone, against an average in the OECD of 1.3 per cent. That final figure alone is a clear signal of this government's commitment to providing excellence in higher education services and facilities, but it is not prepared to rest on its laurels. This government knows that, by reforming the higher education sector, Australia and the students who choose to study in our country will reap even richer benefits. 
As I have previously mentioned, this legislation will allow for 25,000 marginally funded places to be fully funded over the next three years, whilst 1,400 additional student places will be provided in 2007. These measures will cost $139 million in 2003-04, $252 million in 2005-06 and $384 million in 2006-07—substantial investments in the future of our higher education sector. In part, the government will help fund these initiatives by restructuring the education services for overseas students fee and increasing the international education contribution within the student visa application charge. The reform package also places special emphasis on regional universities because of the difficulties they face due to their location and size. From 2004, the federal government will start distributing $122.6 million over four years in additional funding to support regional campuses, and I for one particularly welcome these measures which will mean greater higher education opportunities in my electorate of Hinkler.
My electorate is fortunate to have two Central Queensland University campuses within its boundaries: one at Bundaberg and one at Gladstone. CQU also has regional campuses at Rockhampton, Mackay, Emerald and Noosa, along with international campuses in Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, the Gold Coast and Fiji. It operates multifunctional delivery sites in Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia. Under this legislation, CQU will receive a five per cent increase in base funding per student across all campuses to help it deliver courses. This will help CQU continue its success in attracting both domestic and international students, as acknowledged by the CQU Vice-Chancellor, Professor Glenice Hancock, earlier this year. Professor Hancock was amongst a group of vice-chancellors who visited parliament midyear and who delivered a strong message to the government. That message was this: by investing in Australia's universities we are investing in securing the nation's future. CQU has been in the game for more than 35 years, so I can assure you that those who oversee its governance know what they are talking about.
CQU began life in 1967 as the Queensland Institute of Technology, Capricornia and four years later became the Capricornia Institute of Advanced Education. By 1990, the institute had completed a transition phase and became the University College of Central Queensland. I am proud to say that I was a member of the council of the institute and the college at that exciting time. Two years later, in January 1992, UCCQ achieved full university status. By the end of last year, after 10 years of being a fully-fledged university, CQU had a total enrolment of 19,405 students, with 47 per cent being international—a truly remarkable figure. This made CQU the highest ranking Australian university in terms of the percentage of enrolled international students, with the second ranking public university coming in at 35 per cent. 
It is telling that the Central Queensland University's figure of 47 per cent international enrolments is more than double the sector-wide average of 20.6 per cent. Between 1997 and 2001, CQU's revenue generated by student fees and charges increased from 17.5 per cent to 42.2 per cent. This compared with the average for the sector as a whole increasing from 14.9 per cent to only 19.8 per cent over the same period. Quite clearly, this is one institution which is going from strength to strength on the basis of full fee paying international students, while managing to maintain its core presence and service delivery to the rural and regional areas of Central Queensland.
We pride ourselves on being the lucky country—an egalitarian society where everyone gets a fair go—but it seems this particular raft of legislation has copped a real belting, despite the fact that the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee recognises the importance of HECS in ensuring equity of university access. The committee president, Deryck Schreuder, is on the record as saying:
We're broadly very pleased with the direction that the government has struck with the new policy. ... Universities have increasingly been underfunded and overregulated and the government has begun to give attention to that.
Unless reform comes soon, Australia's universities will face serious financial and educational difficulties. One of the principal areas of reform revolves around the Higher Education Contribution Scheme—HECS, as we know it—where students can defer the costs of their education until they are in paid employment. HECS is a remarkable equity provision which spreads the cost of higher education and produces stronger outcomes for the wider community as well as private benefits for those who go on to higher education.
As it stands under the current arrangements, our university graduates have enjoyed subsidies from the Australian taxpayer of around 75 per cent. We should also recognise that a graduate has an 80 per cent chance of a permanent job within four months of degree completion. A male graduate can expect to earn $622,000 more over his working life than a nongraduate, and a female, in comparable circumstances, $412,000. But a point that should never be lost on us is that the Aussie battler is not assured of such an outcome, despite being the chief financier of our tertiary students. So we are looking to make some changes to HECS, although the basic scheme will remain in place.
We have heard a tremendous hue and cry about the adjustment to HECS payments, but precious little has been said about university graduates who choose to delay their HECS payments. They will not repay a single, solitary cent until they are in paid employment and reach the earnings threshold of $30,000 a year. Under the current arrangements, HECS debt repayments kick in once a university student reaches an annual earnings threshold of $24,365. So we are in fact providing a `grace' earnings gap of around $5,500 per annum. The top-end repayment threshold also rises to $60,000 from the current $44,000.
This legislation also offers further assistance measures to students by way of two new scholarship schemes. From next year, 2004, the government will invest around $84 million over four years in the Commonwealth Education Costs Scholarships, which will provide $2,000 each year for low SES students and Indigenous students undertaking full-time tertiary studies. The second scholarships scheme, the Commonwealth Accommodation Scholarships, focuses on students from rural and regional areas, providing $4,000 a year for up to four years to cover the costs associated with relocation. This particular scholarship could be of enormous assistance to prospective students in Central Queensland, especially in the more remote areas. There will be 1,500 accommodation scholarships available next year under these bills and that will rise to 2,000 in 2007. 
I have no doubt that these two measures will open a few doors to students who might otherwise not fulfill their academic potential. But it is not only students who have the right to reach their full potential; I believe higher education institutions also deserve that right. To that end, these reforms will allow universities the discretionary power to increase their fees by up to 30 per cent above HECS rates, exempting teaching and nursing from that agenda. I stress the word `discretionary', because not all universities will increase their fees. I have heard of a couple of universities who are actually going to decrease them—an option which they do not have at present.
All Australian tertiary students, including those who choose to study at an institution which takes up the opportunity to raise its charges, will be able to access a loans scheme—the Higher Education Loans Program. Loans will be capped at $50,000 and an interest rate will be levied at 3.5 per cent above the rate of inflation for the first 10 years. They will be repaid in a similar way to a HECS payment.
Having detailed the reforms and assistance available to the higher education sector, I feel I should make clear that not all Australian high school graduates are destined for university studies. In fact, seven out of 10 high school leavers will choose other methods to build their skills bases. They might choose to take up vocational training through an apprenticeship or traineeship or enter the TAFE system, run by the various state governments of Australia.
The opposition has had very little to say about the monstrous fee increases the various ALP governments have introduced to these institutions. Has the opposition voiced its concern or outrage about the fact that the New South Wales government has hiked its TAFE fees by 300 per cent? Have we heard a peep out of the opposition about the fact that Victorian TAFE students will confront full fee paying courses at around $8,000 to $12,000 per year or that the South Australian government has increased TAFE fees by 50 per cent? Have we heard so much as a whisper from the ALP about the way its state colleagues have treated the working men and women of Australia and their sons and daughters who are trying to obtain basic technical and trade qualifications? No, we have not.
We have in these bills a new, proactive regime for universities—one which will expand the sector and give universities more, but not unbridled, flexibility. It recognises that the potential graduate has a distinct advantage in the marketplace and makes a modest contribution to his or her future. This regime does not deserve the scare tactics and odium heaped on it by the opposition. Australia is still one of the most generous countries in the world in the treatment of its tertiary students, and interestingly—and I close on this point—the Blair Labour government in the UK has itself proposed measures not unlike those that have been proposed in these bills by the Howard government. I commend the bills to the House.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2003-10-15,"—This debate is crucially important for this nation, but these bills do not show the way forward for us. Education is the bridge to the future for Australia. It is the lifeblood of the nation. It is the basis of opportunity for individuals. A nation that will not invest in education is a nation which is doomed—doomed to economic decline and social inequality. It is a nation that will not go forward. The Howard government claims that it is strengthening our higher education system; it is doing exactly the opposite. Its education policies are betraying the nation. Just as in health, the Howard government's philosophy is simple—it wants to shift the cost of education from government to the individual. It wants our education system to become a user-pays system. 
I think that we are in danger of losing in education one of the foundations of egalitarianism in Australia. It used to be that any bright kid in Australia not only could dream of going to university but could get there, and their parents could encourage them without worrying whether they could afford it. Today, how many potential scientists, teachers or business leaders are facing the decision about whether they can afford to go to university? Their parents' income is now more important than their ability, their drive and their dreams. Labor have a different view from that of the government. It is a better view. We believe that education increases economic growth, transforms people's lives and builds a more tolerant society. We believe that education is overwhelmingly a public good. That is why we believe that, as a nation, we must invest in it.
Today I want to speak specifically on the Higher Education Support Bill 2003 and the Higher Education Support (Transitional Pro-visions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003. I pose this question at the begin-ning: could these bills be any more in-correctly named? Far from being the higher education support bills, they are the higher education destruction bills. If they are pass-ed, the great Australian dream that every child will have the chance to go to university and get a good career will be destroyed. Labor believes that our great universities and TAFEs need more assistance, but they do not get it from these bills. The member for Jagajaga, the Deputy Leader of the Opposit-ion, has foreshadowed a comprehensive series of amendments that will remove the negative features of these bills. They are amendments that, with our policy proposals, will create a stronger education system and a better future for our nation.
Before I detail Labor's solution, let us understand the magnitude of the problem that has been left to us by the Howard government. After seven years of that government, Australians are paying the highest taxes in our nation's history but are getting less in return. The government is not only taxing families more, it is charging them more for the services they depend upon—in particular, health and education. It is no wonder families are struggling under increased financial pressure, not just in health but in education as well. The record of the Howard government in education is a national scandal. When John Howard became Prime Minister, he cut $5 billion in investment from our universities. Between 1995 and 2000, public investment in education fell by 11 per cent—more than in any other country in the OECD. As a result, public education investment in universities is now the sixth lowest in the OECD. The rest of the world is leaving us behind.
Each year, 20,000 qualified young Australians are missing out on a tertiary place. There are now 120,000 fewer places in our universities than would have been the case had Labor still been in office. That is what the forward estimates projected—120,000 more places than this government is currently overseeing. Student fees have risen by over 85 per cent, and university class sizes have risen by more than 30 per cent. Student debt has more than doubled. It now stands at $9 billion and will soon rise to $13 billion. How will our young people ever be able to afford to buy a home and start a family with up to $100,000 in compounding debt hanging over their heads? Yet that is the legacy of the Howard government so far. 
In the recent budget, John Howard expected the Australian people to thank him for giving them a $4 sandwich and milkshake tax cut. But the tax cut came at a terribly high price, including pricing average Australians out of tertiary education and reducing the productive capacity of our nation. It is a new tax, a knowledge tax, a tax on our nation's future. Once again, John Howard is giving with one hand and slugging Australians with the other. Also, the education minister constantly asks why Australian students cannot pay full fees to get into courses, just like overseas students. There is a simple answer: Australians and their families pay taxes here. They have contributed already. The real question for this government is: why does the Howard government want Australian students and their families treated like foreigners in their own country? I make no excuse for treating Australian students differently and making education accessible and affordable for them.
But as bad as the system has become under the 7½ years of the Howard government to date, these bills that are before us are going to make it worse. Under this legislation, universities will be free to increase their fees by 30 per cent. That is another 30 per cent on top of the 85 per cent rises since 1996. This means huge HECS debts: $15,000 for arts, $21,000 for science and $41,000 for law. And worse, there is no guarantee in this legislation that the fee rise will be capped at 30 per cent. There is nothing to stop the fees going up even higher again. I ask Australian families and students to contemplate that. This horrendous increase that we have seen in the last 7½ years will only escalate further if this government is returned.
Half of all university courses will now be eligible for full fees. And, if he chooses to, the minister for education can simply deem entire courses to be 100 per cent full fee paying. What sort of an opportunity does that present for students from struggling families, for kids that have ability but whose parents cannot afford to put them through university? Some degrees, like medicine, will cost up to $150,000. That is not our figure; it is the figure of the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Melbourne, Professor Alan Gilbert. We talk about doctor shortages and now we are pricing them out of the market. Average Australian families will never be able to afford to send their children to university if this becomes law. It is the end of the Australian dream of a fair go for every young person.
But the Howard government is not just content with putting up fees. It also intends to put up the cost of servicing the loans to pay for them. Real rates of interest—currently at six per cent—will see student debts compound year after year. What a burden to place on our young people just as they are starting their working lives. Our young people are being left with the choice of missing out on higher education or drowning in debt. It is a choice that they should never have to make.
But the changes will not just hurt the students and their families; they will also hurt the universities. Under the bills, universities will be blackmailed into accepting unfair industrial relations changes or losing $400 million in funds. If they refuse to accept these impositions on their independence, that is $400 million less that will be available for investment in extra staff, extra buildings and extra resources for their libraries. It just highlights the ideological nature of the government. It is a government that talks about freedom for our universities but now, through this industrial relations agenda and new funding system, wants to impose new restrictions on them. This is not just an attack on intellectual freedom; it is an attack on institutional autonomy. 
Students and parents have condemned this package. The only endorsement that this package has got is from some of our vice-chancellors, who have been forced to accept it as their only lifeline after seven years of cuts. But now that they have seen the details, even these vice-chancellors are backing off. And also, now that they have seen Labor's alternative, they are embracing that. Labor's package offers them a real alternative.
Australian people do not want these changes to their higher education system. They offend a core Australian value: a fair go. Labor's approach is based on the principle that access to education should be on ability, not ability to pay. Today, Labor make these pledges to Australian families. We will not allow this government to slug you and your children with a 30 per cent increase in university fees. Labor will make higher education more affordable. We will not only stop John Howard making half of all university places liable for full fees; we will also abolish full fees for Australian undergraduates altogether. There will be no $100,000 degrees under a Labor government. We will not allow this government to saddle you and your children with $800 million of new debt at real interest rates. We will abolish real interest rates for these loans. And we will not allow the wealthy to jump the queue and take the university places that rightly belong to the hardest working and the most able young Australians.
I have outlined what is wrong with the government's approach. Let me tell you about my vision for the future of our education system. The world is changing—changing so rapidly, in fact, that our children will be working in jobs that they have not even imagined yet.  They will have to update their skills throughout their lives, not just when they are young. This requires no less than a revolution in the way we think about our education and the education of our kids. Our goal must be the creation of a world-leading system of lifelong learning. That means learning must start with the crucial early years; it must be developed intensively during the school years and it must continue throughout life. 
Instead of educating just some of our children to the highest possible standard at the start of their lives, we must educate every person to that same high standard right throughout their lives. We cannot afford to leave a single child behind if we want this nation to become all that it can be. Too many of our children are slipping through the net because they are not getting the help they need to develop their learning skills when they are young. That is why Labor will expand early learning programs so that every child gets the help that they need in the vital early years. It is the best investment our country can make in its future. Every dollar we spend in the early years will save up to $5 down the track.
Opportunities are also being lost because not enough money is being invested in our schools. Labor will repair this damage by increasing investment in our public schools. While we encourage everyone to get a year 12 qualification, we do not provide enough apprenticeships or enough places at university or TAFE for them. That is why Labor will create 20,000 more TAFE places and it is why we will create 20,000 extra university places. This will include extra investment in our teachers and nurses through the creation of over 3,000 new full- and part-time places for nurses and around 4,600 places for teachers. Our universities will benefit from Labor's plans for the better indexation of their operating grants—a policy that will deliver an extra $312 million over four years to our universities. We will reform and modernise our universities with a $450 million universities of the 21st century investment fund—again, a commitment over four years—and we will boost our nation's research potential through 300 new postdoctoral fellowships. 
Not only will we create more places and fund our universities better; we will make education more affordable for our students. We are going to do this by extending rent assistance to Austudy recipients; by reducing the age of independence for students on Youth Allowance to 23 years of age; by lifting the HECS repayment threshold to $35,000; and by lowering the cost for students of maths and science at our universities. Labor's investment in education, outlined in this document, Aim Higher, is fully costed and fully funded, because budgets are about choices and Labor choose to invest in education—to make it more accessible and affordable for everyone, not just the wealthy.
Earlier this year I met with students at the Penrith campus of the University of Western Sydney, just as I met with many other students around the country, when we were developing this package. At that campus, two-thirds of the students are the first members of their families to make it to university. I am going to make sure they are not the last. Together with my vision for early education and early intervention, these new higher education policies will help us become the type of nation we want to be and must become: a richer, stronger, fairer and more tolerant place. Labor's policy of investing in education will be good for our young people, good for families and good for our nation.
That is why these bills before the House should be rejected. That is why the amendments moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition should be supported. But that is only to stop the problem. What we have to do is build and build again as a nation. Labor has been the only party in this parliament that has seriously invested in education—that has understood the importance of opening up opportunity, making it available to everyone, and recognised that it has become a lifelong learning exercise. That is why it is not just a question of opposing these pieces of legislation; it is about proposing an alternative. Labor's policies are outlined in this document, Aim Higher. 
It is not just a question of blocking these bills that are going to put a further tax on knowledge in this country; it is the reason why we need a Labor government returned to office—a Labor government that is prepared to invest in education, a Labor government that understands that education is a public good and that is why we as a nation must invest in it. A nation investing in education is not just giving opportunity to young people; it is giving opportunity to us as a nation. It determines whether we advance. That is why this country needs a Labor government—because under 7½ years of a Howard government we have simply had a reduction in opportunity. We have had the introduction of fees and the pricing out of the reach of young people the opportunity to get an education in a university or TAFE college. Labor will not only oppose what the government is doing in these bills; we will propose the alternatives—the alternatives that give accessibility and opportunity. That is what the country needs.

"Quick, Harry, MP",ALP,2003-10-15,"—I am delighted to follow my leader in this debate on higher education. As a former teacher, it is wonderful to hear the news, just announced by Simon Crean, of the application and dedication of funds to ensure that not only are universities looked after but TAFEs and the early education sector of our education system are looked after as well. I welcome the opportunity to speak to the Higher Education Support Bill 2003 and the Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003—bills that seek to disadvantage universities as institutions, strip university staff of their working conditions and place students and prospective students in a debt trap for years to come. These bills are examples of the lack of vision of this government with regard to education. They represent the ideological bent towards cost shifting from the government to the people. They represent a shift from affordable education to a system allowing only the rich to buy their way into a university education. 
Labor does not support a system that favours full fee paying student places at the expense of HECS university places. Labor also does not support increases to HECS fees of up to 30 per cent. The 1996 changes to HECS by this government had the effect of reducing demand for higher education amongst our school leavers by around 9,000 students per year. The DEST paper on higher education found that around 17,000 mature age applicants had been discouraged from applying for university places. The fear of changes proposed in these bills will dis-courage even more students from applying for university places—fear of the debt, fear of the cost and, for many prospective students, fear of living on the breadline because they have no access to either Aus-tudy or Youth Allowance. That, of course, is another sore point with this government.
The vision that people are looking for—the vision that Labor espouse—is that of equitable access to education so that the talents of Australian students can be further developed and nurtured. Ours is a vision where Australian students from all geograph-ical areas, from all socioeconomic back-grounds and from all cultural experiences contribute to Australian society and build Australia's economy. As the leader said, Labor will provide an additional 20,000 university places each year to allow all those who want to go to university to fulfil that dream. Labor will also reduce the HECS fees for science and mathematics courses by $1,600 per year. I have just come from a meeting with three scientists—we are all being lobbied this week by scientists—and they are delighted with Labor's commitment to reducing fees in science and mathematics. These are measures that will revitalise the education sector and stimulate students to aim higher.
The accumulated HECS debt in this country is estimated to reach $13 billion by the year 2006. We all know the results of repaying HECS debts for new graduates: delays in purchasing homes, delays in having children and, for some, a brief visit to the poverty line. I can speak from personal experience of my two daughters, Sarah and Hannah. Sarah did a Bachelor of Arts degree in journalism at RMIT, and Hannah, who has just finished a diploma of education, is now teaching in her first year in the Victorian education system. I know what they went through. Labor supports the increase in the repayment threshold to $35,000 but the point needs to be made that it should never have been lowered in the first place.
On September 26 this year, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Tasmania, Professor Daryl Le Grew, told the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee:
We were looking for vision. We were looking for some evidence that the system would become differentiated, that the University of Tasmania could see this package as a way of shaping its future.
He went on to say:
So we have some problems with the package as it exists at the moment and as it is translated into projected legislation.
	...	...	...
On the basis of the industral relations reforms, we find that what is being proposed is unworkable. 
	...	...	...
We do not know why there is a continuing and obsessive commitment to something which appears to be more ideologically driven than logically driven at the present time.
These are strong words indeed that are now on the public record from the Vice-Chancellor of the Uni-vers-ity of Tasmania. What more can we say about a system devised by a government that is more intent on stripping the conditions and pay from academic staff in universities than it is on improving the system and thereby increasing the way we value those with the knowledge and skills to develop our children and our friends? All I can do is agree with the vice-chancellor and repeat: it is ideological and obsessive.
The former minister for workplace relations and the minister for education have agreed to tie workplace relations reforms to the university funding package. I am not sure what the two ministers were saying about academic staff when they dreamed up this stunt. Were they alleging that academic staff are overpaid? Were they alleging that academic staff have cushy jobs? Why have the ministers not come out and stated exactly how the staff of universities are overpaid and underworked, as they allege? Where do they think the savings should be made? The reason we do not hear details is that ideology has no detail, just the capacity to derail the proper functioning of an excellent university system. Professor Le Grew puts it very simply:
What it does not recognise, also, is that the staff of a university are its intellectual property, its intellectual capital. Without that intellectual capital nothing happens.
There is only one course of action open to the minister on the industrial relations front: cut the industrial relations dogma from the package; it serves only to aggravate what is already a contentious piece of legislation. Again the vice-chancellor is clear in his views:
There are unworkable provisions in here that are, frankly, unacceptable. The industrial relations precondition is unacceptable to the University of Tasmania. To that extent, it threatens the viability and sustainability of the government's package.
Hear, hear. These words from the specialists who know the industry speak volumes. I endorse these sentiments wholeheartedly. We should encourage universities to continue to be shrines of learning rather than tombs of disappointment and bitterness. With great regularity I mention the special problems of Tasmania, particularly the difficulties associated with our population distribution, and I agree with Professor Le Grew that the regional outreach of the University of Tasmania needs special and additional support. He and I both know that there are kids in schools who are desperate to get into university.
Tasmania's participation rate is very low, and yet we are still 1,000 university places short. Nothing in this package will fix that shortfall—in fact, it is more likely that the formula will see Tasmania with even fewer places. It is outrageous that Tasmania should be faced with this prospect—the prospect of places being redistributed to other universities rather than it receiving funding for an increase in the number of places to take up the 1,000 students who want to come to the University of Tasmania but who cannot.
I reflect sometimes on the contest between the two ideologies: Labor's belief in a system with equity against the government's push for a system weighted in favour of those with wealth; Labor's strongly held belief that a nation benefits from educating as many of its citizens as possible against this government's wanting to educate only the elite; Labor's belief in wealth distribution against the government's support of wealth accumulation. The differences are stark. You do not need a microscope to see that Labor are way out in front on education policy; take a look at what we will deliver when in government. As the Leader of the Opposition has said, there will be an additional 1,100 new undergraduate nursing places; 500 HECS funded postgraduate nursing places every year from 2005; an extra 1,700 undergraduate teaching places; and 500 additional HECS funded postgraduate teacher education places every year from 2005. More importantly, Labor will establish strategic settings for long-term reform. Labor will not ask students to pay more. We will provide the vision, investment and direction needed for a world-class Australian university system. 
The universities themselves have spoken out against this reform package. All the arguments I would want to put here in this debate have already been put—before the Senate committee and in the media. The government seems to be unable to bring itself to fund the public sector. Across this great country of ours people are calling out for improvements in public health and public education. With some irony, we see that in health it is the doctors' union speaking out and in education it is the vice-chancellors' group. It is quite astonishing to see groups that traditionally align with conservative policies being transformed into advocates against this government's policies. It seems that everyone in the country can see what needs to be done except this government. The government is driving education and health in a downward spiral. Labor is about raising the bar and about accepting challenges. Labor stands for learning, training and better jobs for more Australians. Labor is about aiming higher, not lower.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"O'Connor, Gavan, MP",ALP,2003-10-15,"—The bills we are debating here today, the Higher Education Support Bill 2003 and the Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003, are the latest instalments in the Howard government's plan to regress tertiary education in this great country and give effect to its higher education package, Backing Australia's Future, announced in the 2003 budget. In a previous debate in this place I referred to the title of the government's package as a misnomer because the government would want us to believe that, having ripped $5 billion out of tertiary education since coming to office, it is really in the business of backing Australia's future. Only in the coalition of the Liberal Party and the Nationals that forms the government of this country could such a delusional exercise be undertaken without so much as a twinge of guilt for the damage they have already inflicted on Australia's tertiary education sector by the withdrawal of that $5 billion.
The Higher Education Support Bill 2003 and the Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amend-ments) Bill 2003 repeal the Higher Education Funding Act 1998 and replace it with a similar base structure. However, there are important differences contained in these bills to make them quite different from the 1998 act. They indicate the absolute philosophical confusion of the Minister for Education, Science and Training, who, as I have said, has the gall to publicly masquerade these measures as reforms. For example, the minister seeks to deregulate tuition fees for undergraduate students for the first time in 30 years—in that particular initiative, he is on the deregulation kick—yet he reserves for himself substantial powers and control of the student profiles of universities and arms himself with the authority to add newer higher education providers to the system without any reference to this parliament.
On more than one occasion the minister has trumpeted the extensive process of consultation he undertook to produce the initiatives that are contained in this legislation. It is legitimate for members on this side of the House to at least ask how anyone could have gone through an extensive process of consultation and produced such a bad, internally inconsistent, philosophically confused and poorly resourced package of educational initiatives. It is a matter of some regret that members on this side of the House are not going to be able to access their full debating time on this legislation, because in my own electorate this self-styled reform package from this conservative government minister will impact adversely and quite heavily in a financial sense on many of my young constituents and their families.  
The implications of this legislation for the tertiary education sector are not really too hard to comprehend. Massive student fee hikes will flow from this legislation and, whether members opposite want to admit it or not, there will be $100,000 degrees. There is another simple reality, and that is that the Howard government's policies are going to lead to a blow-out in student debt to more than $9 billion—the transfer of resourcing responsibility of an enormous magnitude from the public to the private sector.
There are two consequences of this legislation that I would like to deal with in greater detail in the context of this debate, because they say much about the ideological obsessions of the government and their blind inability to acknowledge and change policy in the face of mounting evidence of the damage those policies are causing to this nation in the long term. The first consequence is the massive disruption across university campuses as a result of the government's attempt to blackmail universities into implementing the government's extreme industrial relations views. At stake is more than $400 million of badly needed funds which are contingent on the universities implementing over three pages of conditions before they can access those funds.
Let me outline for the House some examples of the more celebrated and stupid attempts by the minister to micromanage our universities. These conditions include: institutions must not hand out union membership forms during staff induction processes; related funding must not be used for union salaries, facilities and activities; institutions must not provide union offices on campus free of charge; Australian workplace agreements must prevail over certified agreements; existing conditions, including current levels of redundancy payouts and maternity leave are threatened; limits to casual employment levels must be removed; and union involvement in dispute resolution must be reduced. Not one of these conditions has one iota of relevance to the universities' core functions of teaching and research. 
These are the policies of a control freak minister. They are the policies of an egomaniac. They are the policies of a minister who wants to establish himself as `mein Fuhrer' of the Australian higher education system. Thankfully, people within Australian universities are resisting the attempts of this minister to micromanage the affairs of their universities and to poke his nose in an area where he should not. 
The second consequence of this legislation is related to the fact that there is disturbing comparative data that suggests that Australia is falling behind its competitors in key performance areas in the tertiary education sector. There is no doubt that our universities are in crisis after seven years of this government; how could they be in any other position, given that $5 billion has been slashed from their budgets? There is evidence that Australia's public investment in higher education is falling backwards while other countries are increasing theirs, and the bald implications of this trend are that our children—our future generations—will not enjoy the highest standard of living that they could; indeed, their standard of living might well be reduced. 
According to the OECD report, Education at a glance: 2003, between 1995 and 2000 Australia's public investment in universities declined by 11 per cent—more than any other country in the OECD. We are slowly being left behind as this government sacrifices the tertiary education sector on the altar of its own ideological obsessions. The result of this lack of investment is that we have seen a lowering of standards in our universities, with overcrowded classrooms, and infrastructure which is in a terrible state of disrepair.
The opposition have released, for public debate and comment, a raft of initiatives which we believe will substantially restore the fortunes of our tertiary education sector and put Australia on the best possible footing to maintain the standard of living of all Australians into the future. I urge members opposite to look at Aim Higher: Learning, Training and Better Jobs for More Australians. In it, we have taken the waste and the misplaced priorities of the Howard government and redirected that expenditure to the purposes for which it should be used in this sector. We will expand opportunities to get a qualification by creating 20,000 commencing full- and part-time university places and 20,000 full- and part-time TAFE places. That means that, by 2008, there will be 40,000 additional commencing TAFE and university students in the system each year.
We have provided $35 million for a program to support secondary school students from disadvantaged backgrounds to progress to university and TAFE. This particular funding is relevant to my electorate, which in certain areas has a very low socioeconomic profile, where families find it very difficult to send their children to university. More importantly, we are going to restore merit over money as the primary criterion for getting a university place and ensure that access to universities remains affordable. I urge members to read that document, because in it is the future of this country. Our country's future is not in the regressive set of measures that are contained in these particular bills but in a broad, comprehensive program for the tertiary education sector that will put Australia on a sound footing in the future and will go a long way to maintaining the standards of living that we have enjoyed, and passing on those standards to our children.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2003-10-15,"—This legislation, the Higher Education Support Bill 2003 and the Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003 could not have come at a more important time. As I rise to speak today, you can be sure that there are hundreds of young Australians everywhere, sitting down in their homes trying to focus their minds away from the TV and onto their study books, with the heavy knowledge that their final school exams are just around the corner. Alongside these young Australians are their parents, who bear not only the role of study enforcers but also concern about what the end of the year will bring for their child, no matter what their final results are.
This time will be blissful for some lucky parents of year 12 students—not only are they sure their child will obtain the marks to get into the course of their choice but they know they can afford to support their child's talents and ambitions. Young people preparing for their exams know that there are limited places for students at universities across Australia. They know that, even if they achieve higher than last year's entry mark for their chosen course, there is no guarantee they will get a place, because there are fewer places. They know that when they finish they are guaranteed to have a debt that will take them years to pay off. They know that other young people who may not be as intelligent as them or who may not have worked as hard will get their place because their parents have more money. How fair is this? How Australian is this?  
Until recently Australians were regarded as one of the most highly educated societies on earth, but the rest of the world has caught up. Australia today invests only 6.15 per cent of its GDP in our most valuable asset—knowledge. The United States invests 8.73 per cent; Finland, 9.62 per cent; and Sweden, 10.8 per cent. For our nation to be all that it can be, we must invest not just in some of them occasionally but in all of them continually and according to opportunity. We must not let any group or any disadvantage area be left behind. Only a generation ago it was common for people to rise from the shop floor to the boardroom in the span of their working life. 
Education has always been one of the biggest political issues for women. But one of the reasons education is now a big issue for men as well is that many fathers realise their children will not have the same opportunity they had to get ahead in life unless they get a trade or a university education. They know that university or TAFE qualifications have become their sons' and daughters' passports to a secure future, as well as guaranteeing a secure future for our nation. If we want high incomes and growth we have to be skilled. We have to be educated. These things will not fall into our laps. Australia's education spending is certainly at odds with international trends.
As well as opening up education opportunities in the fields that industry need, Labor is committed to supporting disadvantaged students' aspirations. Our Bright Futures program will encourage students from disadvantaged areas to consider future learning and training. This is a fundamental element of our education package. We want to open their eyes to opportunities, to plant the potential seed of ambition, in the early years of high school. Bright Futures will cost $35 million over four years. The money will go to schools, universities and TAFEs to encourage young people to keep learning. It will involve visits by TAFE and university students to tell school students first-hand about their training options. Labor will not increase the HECS burden on students or their families. Overly large prospective debt discourages participation, particularly of those from poorer backgrounds. 
The government knows all about this—and not only chooses to ignore it but also hides the facts. The `more honest than thou' Minister Nelson tried to bury a report, which the government had been sitting on for months, by releasing it one Friday afternoon at 5.30 p.m. The data showed the government's 1996 HECS increases turned an annual 9,000 school leavers and 17,000 mature age prospective students away from furthering their education at university. The government hid this report because it killed its defence of the planned 30 per cent fee increase. The government's plan is not just an exercise in pushing responsibility off its books but also a lazy policy. By contrast Labor will invest more in TAFEs and universities to increase the number of places. 
We must also improve the quality of higher education. Labor's 21st century fund will create a world-class university system. Our indexation fund will stabilise funding in real terms to relieve the pressure that now gives students standing room only at lectures and sees tutorials disappearing. We will raise the annual salary threshold at which graduates repay HECS to $35,000, providing relief to low- and middle-income graduates. Our 300 three-year postdoctoral fellowships are designed to slow the brain drain. At a time when we are hosting Science Meets Parliament in this House, it is appropriate to reflect on the drain from this nation of some of our best minds in research and science who have chosen to go overseas because of the financial cutbacks that have occurred in higher education and research in this country. 
The total cost of our package is $2.34 billion over four years. It is fully funded. Parents believe that they have to start saving from the time their child is born if they want them to have the opportunity to go to university. According to one report, the Australian Scholarships Group has put the cost of a four-year science HECS degree, including living costs, at $143,506 by 2015. The same degree is projected to cost $255,000 in full fees, including living costs. These developments are frightening. Parents are right to be worried. These developments mean that a university education will be limited to those who can pay. What is more, the considerable social and economic spin-offs of a strong university sector—tax receipts, skilled professionals, increased productivity and international competitiveness—will all diminish. 
The Howard government wants to let universities increase HECS fees by 30 per cent. An increase on that scale will mean that students' contributions will have more than doubled since 1996. Already the University of Sydney has decided to increase fees by 30 per cent in all possible courses. Labor are committed to making university a prospect for all Australians. We will not increase HECS for students and we will lower HECS fees for maths and science. Labor believe we need to encourage more students to pursue maths and science, and we will cut the cost of a three-year degree in these fields by nearly $5,000. Labor will abolish full fees for domestic undergraduates, whereby people buy a university place ahead of someone with higher marks and pay as much as $150,000 for a degree. 
The Howard government wants to double the number of full fee places at Australian universities. This government is about education for the elite. That is why it has provided such substantial increases in funding for category 1 schools. Australians should not have to pay exorbitant fees to buy a university place when they are already contributing to our tertiary system through their tax and HECS. All Australians should have an equal opportunity to get into university, based entirely on ability. Under Labor, merit will be the only criterion for getting a university place. The size of your wallet should not be a factor.
Forty per cent of our teaching work force is due to retire in the next 10 years, yet the Howard government turned away nearly 30,000 prospective teachers from university between 1996 and 2001. There is not one extra teaching place in the Howard government's higher education package for our public universities. Labor will create 500 new HECS funded postgraduate teaching places in areas of specialisation and professional development and provide additional funding to increase the quality of teacher education, including meeting the costs of classroom teacher training. By contrast, the Howard government's higher education package has one main policy objective: making students pay more.
Labor is committed to funding not just more university places but 20,000 more TAFE places as well. The government is offering nothing—not one extra dollar or TAFE place, despite the enormous need. Currently, up to 15,000 school leavers who are qualified and who want to do a TAFE course are turned away each year. There is nothing smart about this for anyone. There are also those who look to go to TAFE later in life—those who need to retrain—who cannot get in. That is why we are adding 20,000 new TAFE places. We want them aimed at addressing skills shortages. Labor will deliver more places at more affordable prices at higher quality universities.  
The differences come down to this: Labor believes in a society that creates more wealth by offering opportunities to everyone with talent; the coalition only want to make life easier for the well off. In the global knowledge economy, sustained long-term economic prosperity is unimaginable without an ever improving education system. The government proposals all point towards a future where educational opportunity is based on the size of your bank balance rather than the marks you get and the ability you have. Labor stands for a different future: one where a great university education is a prospect for all Australians from any background.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Ferguson, Laurie, MP",ALP,2003-10-15,"—The defenders of privilege in this country—the people who are not concerned at the blow-out in managerial salary packages, those who seek to casualise our workforce and to force conditions down to Guatemalan or Honduran levels—often argue that if anyone criticises this it is the politics of envy and if you dare say there is too much inequity in this country and that it is growing you do so because you are personally envious.
But what we see in the debate about education in this country and on the Higher Education Support Bill 2003 and the Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003 is those very same people basing their arguments on innuendo and subterranean messages which say: `Why should you, who do not earn so much or are on a small pension, fund people to become doctors and lawyers? You should be envious of the possibilities that others might gain—more advantageous employment, the ability to go into a profession—and you should be greedy as taxpayers and do nothing to enhance their futures.'
They say that the current system favours those people living in the North Shore and in the eastern suburbs of Sydney, those in wealthy affluent suburbs, and that is what they aim to redress. But what they do not say is that the people in this government—the Deputy Prime Minister, who went to Kings School, the Minister for Finance and Administration, who went to Knox Grammar, the Minister for the Environment, who went to Scots College in Melbourne—and their families and associates will still be going to university, regardless of how much HECS costs. Essentially, those families will still be monopolising university places in this country because they can and will have the money to afford it.
The real target of this government policy is essentially to hit people in Western Sydney in particular, where 1.8 million Australians reside. We have one council out there in which one 60th of the Australian population resides, Blacktown council. It is a region that is characterised by unemployment higher than Sydney's average. Some of the municipalities in the University of Western Sydney area are Auburn, with 3.7 per cent higher unemployment than the Sydney average, Fairfield is 4.3 per cent higher and Campbelltown is 2.8 per cent higher. They are areas that very much disproportionately utilise the University of Western Sydney's services.
The government also speaks about aspirational people—people who no longer want to be in unions and who no longer want conditions and who want to go out there and get a larger house. But I have news for this government. Those people also aspire for their children to have a decent education and to be part of the tertiary experience in this country, whether it is through universities or TAFE. The reality is that many of those same families that the government cites as being subcontractors or self-employed and prospering—supposedly—and no longer wanting to be bound to organised labour are often people who did not go to university themselves and who would like their children to go. That is part of their aspirations. It is not simply about having a two-storey, five-bedroom home. This government's legislation will certainly circumscribe their possibilities. 
What we are seeing is a government that is trying to appeal to the lowest common denominator and people's animal instincts by saying, `You should be selfish; you should not be interested in the nation's future; you should reduce taxation devoted to education in this country.' Basically, it is sink or swim. If families have not got enough money to pay for it they can essentially go jump. That is a very limited, a very short-term and a very ill-advised policy.
We have already had a situation such that, according to the OECD, Australia had the second worst growth of the most advanced countries in university enrolments over the period 1995 to 2001—four times worse than the OECD average. We have had the largest fall in public—that is, government—investment in our education system.
The member for Corangamite came in here and asked, `What could be better than having thousands of foreign students basically funding our education system?' The reality is that it is driving down standards in this country. We have seen example after example—particularly in New South Wales—where teachers and lecturers have been sacked, persecuted or demoted because they stood up for our standards in institutions where there is an increasing drive to decrease our standards so that people can remain the next year and keep paying the fees, regardless of how successful they are in university. The member for Corangamite asks, `What could be better?' I think a few things could be better. What could be better is the devotion of government money—taxation—to essentially protecting the status and the accessibility of our universities.
I turn to the University of Western Sydney in particular because, as I said, it is a major focus for 1.8 million Australians—quite a few people. In that region we have seen the irresponsible conduct of the member for Lindsay. Quite frankly, her performance leaves her with very few friends—even within the Liberal Party in the region. Her comments have included:
How much more can you spoon-feed UWS? At the end of the day, you've just got to have a dynamic board and senior administration.
She says that the University of Western Sydney can equal Melbourne university, Sydney university, New South Wales university and the other sandstone universities in going out there and getting dollars off Australian corporations. That is fantasy island. There is no possibility whatsoever that Western Sydney university can be competitive with those universities. It has not existed for 20 years; it has not reached their status; and, essentially, it is not seen as cachet as those universities. So, to say that we can solve the problems of the universities of this country by getting BHP to kick in an extra $50 million or something to the University of Western Sydney is a pipedream.
The member for Lindsay has attempted to say that the University of Western Sydney's criticism of the federal government has come about because they have a lot of Labor Party hacks on the board. It is interesting to note the comments of the acting chancellor, Geoff Roberson—a long-term Liberal Party member; the deputy major of Parramatta; a person who is respected in the business sector of Western Sydney. He made the point: 
We only started in 1989. Our first graduates would have only just paid off their HECS debts by now.
It is reported that he said that, as a member of the Liberal Party, he resented Ms Kelly's remark that the board was full of Labor Party appointees. Geoff Roberson is also reported as saying that Ms Kelly was in danger of `losing every vote of every UWS graduate'. The situation is that, unlike the member for Lindsay, that Liberal Party alderman and the entire Parramatta City Council have voted to condemn the government's attacks on that university—attacks which have seen a reduction of $270 million in its funding and a blow-out of 28 per cent in its ratio of students to teachers.
I have only 10 minutes to speak here today, but I want to stress the importance of this regional facility. There are six campuses in the region—one at Rydalmere, very close to my electorate. The statistics show that that university is disproportionately made up of students whose parents and grandparents never went near a university. This university has practices and innovations which encourage students from non-English-speaking backgrounds and it has measures with a regional focus to try to ensure accessibility. I want to particularly associate myself with Professor Reid and the entire board in standing up to this government's attacks on universities in this country.
The situation, as other members have said, is not only about the move towards $100,000 and $150,000 degrees—which, I concede, those ex-graduates of Knox, Grammar and Shore will still be able to afford—but also about this government's determination to bully the universities into certain industrial relations practices. Members of the government often say in this House that they want freedom of association so as to protect the individual against powerful unions who bully them around. But what we are seeing in this legislation is extreme bullying by this government—saying that the universities of this country will not be able to make their own decisions with regard to work practices on their sites, otherwise this government will reduce their funding by $400 million. That is vital funding which these universities need to survive and enhance their performance. If you allow the union to have an office on campus that is not paid or you have functions where the union is allowed to give out pieces of paper, essentially you will have your funding circumscribed.
Today the Leader of the Opposition has very strongly stressed that Labor will not allow a 30 per cent increase in fees and that it will stop the move towards full fee paying courses in this country. I must confess that it surprised me at the launch of Labor's last campaign that there was a huge cheer when Labor promised funding for the ABC but it went very unnoticed by the crowd that Labor promised major commitments to the TAFE sector. Labor is saying that 20,000 places will be devoted to that sector which has been so vital with regard to skills accrual in Western Sydney.
This legislation contains a variety of measures that are aimed at depriving people access to higher education. The size of the repayments and the move towards full fee paying are all trends of a government that wants to deny access to the majority of Australians and a government that basically subscribes to a preference towards those people—many of whom are on the frontbench of the government in this country—who will be able to afford to go to university regardless of how expensive it is.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2003-10-15,"—If I were to pick an area where there was a great divide between the Labor Party—which I represent today in this House—and the government, there would not be one area that I would choose before education. Education divides us fundamentally, and it does so because those in the government see education as something to be handed out to those with privilege and rarely be handed to those in need. The fact is that there is a major gulf between the political parties in this area—that was shown in the budget and the budget in reply speech by the Leader of the Opposition in May—and it will always be so. 
Historically, Labor has always looked to increase access to education. It has always looked to broaden the base of entrance into the tertiary system. It has always looked to enable students from non-elite schools—that is, from government and non-elite independent schools—to gain access to tertiary education. It has always been Labor who has introduced reforms that have provided access to those people not traditionally able to get access to tertiary education. That will never change, and it is therefore a very important issue that the electorate at large will have to consider when we go to the next election.
Clearly, health is a very vital issue to be considered by the electorate, but I think education is an issue that fundamentally divides the two major parties. As I said, it was a Labor government that sought successfully to massively increase the number of entrants to the tertiary system in the 1980s and the early 1990s. Although it is true that Labor introduced the earlier version of today's HECS—I think it is very important that we acknowledge that and note it—the fact is that the HECS introduced many years ago was of a totally different character, a totally different creature, to the one that is now being imposed upon students by this government.
In 1996 the HECS changed with the change of government. There was a dramatic increase in fees, which was a dramatic imposition on students, and therefore an increasing disincentive for ordinary working families and their children to consider tertiary education. That is a fact that most Australians know. The Leader of the Opposition has today clearly enunciated the alternative view to Howard's legacy. Howard's legacy goes to so many things. Overall there has been a $5 billion cut to education since the Howard government were elected. The Howard government would like to impose a fee increase of up to 30 per cent on the students of Australia.
The Howard government fail to ensure that those people eligible to enter university get to university. Each year 20,000 qualified Australians miss out on studying at university because of the policies of this government. These are people who are, quite clearly, qualified, capable and keen to undertake university education, but they fail to do so because this government has put a limit on the number of places available. As I said, there is a great divide in this area. I know that this is something that ordinary Australians will be looking at, and families across the nation will be considering, when we go to the next election. There is no doubt that, in the last seven or so years since the Howard government were elected to this place, there has been an incredible decline in services in this fundamental area. I support the views raised by the member for Reid when he said that this government tries to use the politics of envy and to say to those people who have not been able to get to university, `There is no reason for you to in any way contribute to our education system.' That is patently untrue, and it is a blight on this government to allow such a line to be put. The fact is that education is about educating the nation. An education system is supposed to ensure that the nation is educated for all of its citizens not just for those who are fortunate enough to participate in that system. 
The Minister for Education, Science and Training likes to make reference—whether anecdotal or otherwise—to a cleaning woman he met on his way into a university who commented that she had never been in a university and could not see why she should have to pay anything. Labor is interested in ensuring that that cleaning lady has the opportunity to further her education; if not, that her children have the chance to enter university and obtain a tertiary education. Those children could be the first generation of her family able to enter an institution of higher learning. I have been a very fortunate beneficiary—along with many others on this side—of Labor's policies of the seventies and eighties, which allowed me to be the first generation of my family to enter university. I am forever grateful for that opportunity; so much so that one of the reasons I chose to enter this place was to put something back into the system that supported me so well. I hope I can pay that back with some justice and that I am able, in some way, to help the system and help the country that provided me with so much assistance. I do not see education, first and foremost, as the development of individuals, the acquisition of skills or the increase in knowledge of a particular individual—though clearly that is one dimension to the education system. More importantly, I believe education is about making society a better place and ensuring that we have the necessary resources to look after our citizens—whether it be looking after them in the area of health or other areas. The fact is that education is vital and, when we consider the two major political parties in this country, only Labor focuses on the education system as being about improving the wellbeing of this nation's citizens. I think that should be very clearly noted by all Australians when they contemplate who they would like to see preside over the executive government of this nation at the next election.
I think it is fair to say that there have been some really outrageous attempts by this government to privatise education. There is an old Redgum song with the lines:
Daddy bought me a Mercedes Benz
And he bought me a law degree
I can recall hearing that song in the seventies and thinking it was a bit over the top. I believe the singer of that song ran against a member opposite and almost beat him. In current circumstances, he might want to try again and challenge the Minister for Foreign Affairs in his seat. He could sing that song around the electorate because it resonates now. It seemed a bit fictitious in the past that daddy could buy his child a Mercedes Benz and a law degree, but now $100,000 degrees are being put on sale by this government. Clearly what we see here is a government that want to enable people with money, not necessarily with merit, to enter university. They want people who, I suppose, come from the same ilk as they do. What they are saying, through the minister, is that those people who have never been able to get university should not bother trying. They are effectively saying, `Feel resentful because you have not been able to get there. Don't ever consider you will be able to, and nor will your children.' That is what this government say when they make out there should be no reason for ordinary families to even contemplate entering a tertiary institution.
I think this really shows the contempt of this minister and his government for ordinary families who aspire to improve themselves and who aspire to give their children the same opportunities as the sons and daughters of those on the government frontbench. In conclusion, there is a great divide between the two major political parties with respect to education. I think the Australian people know that. I am clearly of the view, from going round my electorate, that this issue is being discussed, and I am sure it is going to be a significant issue when the voters of this nation get a chance to throw this mob out and elect a government that makes education a high priority.

"Ferguson, Martin, MP",ALP,2003-10-15,"—As the member for Burke indicated, the government would have the Australian community believe that the debate on higher education is about the politics of envy. I think it is about time the government got the message from the Australian community that it believes Australia should make a decision that we are required, as a nation, to invest in our future by putting more into the education and skilling of our nation. The government is presenting this debate as being about Backing Australia's Future. Contrary to that, if the government has its way as a result of this debate, it will really be about Australia looking backwards, in terms of both decency in life and also our investment as a nation in making the economic cake in the future bigger by skilling Australia to maintain a competitive position both domestically and internationally.
I hope that, just as we have a real debate about health care in the Australian community today because of announcements made by the Leader of the Opposition in the May budget, we will see a debate take off in the lead-up to the next election about the fundamentals of life in schools, TAFE colleges and universities. I hope that we accept that the next election is about our requirement to invest in our future; that it will not be an election about border protection and Tampa but an election about whether, in the 21st century, Australia is prepared to take up the challenges and provide adequate attention to such fundamental services as health and education and to our requirement to invest in and improve the environment to overcome some of the man-made damage we have inflicted in the past.
Let us go to the crux of the debate. The Higher Education Support Bill 2003 and the Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003 are not about backing Australia's future. They are a clear demonstration of gov-ernment hypocrisy and doublespeak. They are not about flexibility for our universities; consider, for example, that the legislation provides for much greater centralised control and ministerial direction.
Let us go to some of the fundamentals of these bills. Firstly, the bills provide for the minister to determine the limits to which universities can increase tuition charges. Secondly, they provide for the minister to determine how many students are taught in individual courses at each university. So much for flexibility at a campus level! Thirdly, they provide for the minister to add new higher education providers without reference to the parliament. Fourthly—and this is even more concerning—there is an insidious proposal to tie core operating grants to university compliance with extreme government policies on industrial relations and governance structure. I think back to the huge improvements made in the industrial relat-ions framework in Australia in the eighties and nineties. They were about flexibility at a workplace level and the right for workplaces to determine their futures. These bills are about big government directing universities on the industrial relations front and are a complete reversal of what we achieved in the eighties and the nineties.
The debate is also about the opportunity of many millions of Australians to access university. It is no more important than a previous debate, a couple of weeks ago, about the capacity of Australians to also access TAFE places. It does not matter whether it is an apprenticeship or a university opportunity; we, as a nation, have a requirement to provide opportunities for our young people, and some in later life, to pursue education—not only to ensure that they have an opportunity to be gainfully employed throughout their working lives but also to guarantee that we, as a nation, seize opportunities by educating and skilling Australia. 
As you move around Australia, the facts show that there are simply not enough HECS places being funded by the government at the moment. I know that from the situation at La Trobe University, which will soon go into my electorate as a result of the recent redistribution in Victoria. La Trobe Univer-sity has indicated that, because of this government, it will be forced to cut 500 HECS places in 2004. I contrast that to the Labor Party commitment to provide an additional 20,000 fully costed new full- and part-time places each year. That is the divide in the education debate in Australia. It is about us making sure that universities are able to offer to all in the Australian commun-ity an affordable opportunity to pursue a university degree.
In that context, let me say I actually support HECS. It is right that we as a community make a contribution to the cost of our education. But, having said that, I totally oppose the suggestion by the Howard government that as a result of these bills they will allow an increase in university HECS fees of about 30 per cent. That would be a barrier to education for a range of Australian people, especially people in the northern end of my electorate, close to La Trobe University. I want to create opportunities for those people to seize educational capacity. We should not be condemning our young people to a life of debt. How can we ever consider increasing HECS fees beyond what young people are capable of meeting? Having completed a degree, they are then expected to go out into life, commence work, think about purchasing a home and, in a country with a declining fertility rate, think about having a family. They are some of the considerations that are part and parcel of this debate. It is not simply a debate about higher education. It is a debate about Australia in the 21st century.
I simply say that the content of these bills proves how out of touch the Howard government is with the Australian community on the higher education front. If the government has its way—if the Prime Minister has his way—higher education will become the preserve of the rich and powerful in the Australian community, the elites. It will be a class determined question of whether or not a young person is able to go to university in the future. I thought that those days were gone in Australia. It was the debate in Australia in the lead-up to the 1972 election won by Gough Whitlam. We put that debate to bed, but here we are over 30 years later having to re-engage in it.
It brings to a head, as I indicated at the outset, a fundamental debate in the lead-up to the next election. It is about where we go with respect to a requirement as a community, a decent community that wants to invest in the future, to embrace the following type of policy agenda: firstly, as the Labor Party in opposition proposes, we should increase the supply of places in Australian universities; secondly, we should ensure that those places are affordable now and in the future; thirdly, we should guarantee that merit—yes, merit; why should we be ashamed of the issue of merit?—should be the only criterion for getting a university place; fourthly, we should provide a mechanism for restoring the quality of university education; and, fifthly, we should, as part of that debate, recognise the key role of apprenticeships in shaping Australia's future. 
A commitment to those fundamental requirements in our education system is also a commitment to returning to a productivity debate in Australia. A productivity debate is also about a bigger economic cake for all Australians to receive the benefit of. I note that skills growth was a driver of productivity in days gone by. It drove productivity through considerable improvements over the last couple of decades, but I note that it has fallen by 75 per cent in the last 10 years. The Productivity Commission is also warning that it will fall further, unless we embrace a government commitment to invest more in skills and training as a nation. It is not just about training lawyers and IT experts; it is also about training nurses, teachers, childcare workers, plumbers, electricians, bricklayers and carpenters, to name a few of the areas of skill that we require in Australia in 2003.
In conclusion, I say that this debate is important. I hope the government does not have its way in the Senate. I urge all Australians to think about the issues before the House today and to give a commitment that they will not allow the Australian government to sidetrack the Australian community on a debate about issues such as border protection and defence in the lead-up to the next election. Let us have a debate about the future of education and health, our requirement to clean up the environment, and doing something about productivity growth and creating a bigger economic cake. I commend the second reading amendment moved by the opposition and, in doing so, plead with the Australian community not to accept the lies that are perpetrated with respect to higher education and our future in the bills before the House today.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Mossfield, Frank, MP",ALP,2003-10-15,"—In commencing my remarks on the Higher Education Support Bill 2003 and associated bills, I would like to work through part of the submission that the vice-chancellor of the University of Western Sydney made to a Senate references committee on higher education funding and regulatory legislation. Professor Reid, as a member of the ministerial reference group, expressed the hope that the Nelson review would be the turning point not only for UWS but for similar universities which serve increasing populations in outer metropolitan regions of Australia, where great faith is placed on education and where families make considerable sacrifices to ensure that as many of their family members as possible gain a university degree.
The view was expressed that there should be additional public funding in the higher education sector, that there should be no further financial strain placed on students and their families and that Australia needs not only one or two world-class universities but a world-class university system. Professor Reid is supportive of several of the government's reform proposals, but in relation to fees she said:
The measures relating to fees and interest-bearing loans I believe particularly reinforce the hidden faces of privilege and may increase the burden of disadvantage that characterises many of the communities in greater Western Sydney. I would not like to see this divide leading to differentiation in the sector based on individual or institutional privilege and wealth if there are no robust measures in place to counter this.
Surely this is a call for the political leaders of the region to stand behind our university and support its call for education services to be better resourced, but this has not happened. In fact, the UWS board has been castigated by the member for Lindsay in correspondence sent to the board for standing up to the government and seeking a better deal for `our university'. Indeed the chair of the hearing of that references committee, Senator Carr, raised this issue with Professor Reid and indicated that the letter accuses UWS of mismanagement, indecisiveness, and immaturity—quite insulting remarks, I would suggest. As Senator Carr said: 
It is an extraordinary document. I have never seen a member of parliament's letter to a vice-chancellor like this in my 10 years in parliament. 
The member for Lindsay continued her attack on the University of Western Sydney last week in the Main Committee. It is an ongoing and concerted effort to discredit the university for standing up against the proposed changes contained in this legislation. I am pleased to see that other government members in Western Sydney are not taking the same position. I note, however, that while there are some 46 Labor members and two independents contributing to this debate, there are only a dozen coalition members willing to speak out in defence of this bill. The member for Lindsay is not among those government members participating. She is very much conspicuous by her absence from this debate.
Professor Reid's response to the Kelly letter was measured. She pointed out that UWS had rationalised all of its courses over the past three years, that it had successfully introduced a new student information system, that it had reviewed all of its international courses with overseas visits and audits and that it had reduced the number of courses where this was necessary. The university has been absolutely assiduous, to use Professor Reid's words, in its management, in quality assurance and in finding efficiencies in order to position itself for the future.
Professor Reid also indicated that the ministerial reference group took the view that any government with a balanced policy agenda would ensure that any new funding would flow to those new generation universities—in at least in the same proportion to their size and community need—in the growing but educationally neglected urban frontiers of major cities. This has not happened in this round of funding, where the government has taken a one size fits all approach. It intends to fund students in the same way, in whatever institution they study, as long as they are studying the same degree. Professor Reid contends that the government's package does not follow this principle. Professor Reid also referred to the widening gap in the number of university students from Western Sydney compared to the number from the rest of Sydney. She quoted the 2001 census, which shows that only half as many people who live in Western Sydney are graduates compared to those who live in the rest of Sydney. With Western Sydney seeing 25 percent of Australia's population growth over the next 20 years, this gap will widen.
Under the previous funding arrangements, UWS turned away some 2,700 students this year who met the university's entry requirements. These potential students were mainly in the teaching, nursing, communications and business fields. This is an enormous waste of talent. Professor Reid has indicated that UWS has done extensive calculations, based on the government's revised offer, which suggest that the university will be $5.34 million worse off in the first year of operation of the package and just over $2 million worse off in the second year. This assumes that the 2.5 percent increase in funding is granted.
The University of Western Sydney is the jewel in the education crown of Greater Western Sydney, a region of Australia that has one-tenth of Australia's population and a GDP of over $38 billion. UWS was founded in 1989 with the purpose of providing high quality and accessible higher education and research in a region which has historically been underresourced. UWS is now the fifth largest university in Australia and the second largest in New South Wales—all achieved in just 14 years—with 60 percent of its students coming from Western Sydney. UWS has over 35,000 students, including more than 5,000 international students. There are six campuses located in Greater Western Sydney—at Campbelltown, Bankstown, Parramatta, Penrith, Richmond and, of course, Blacktown in my own electorate of Greenway. UWS has developed partnerships and agreements with other education groups such as TAFE, high schools, local government and private industry for the whole of the region of Greater Western Sydney. 
The University of Western Sydney has suffered significant funding cuts over the seven years of the Howard government. The government has cut from it $270 million—the third largest cut to any university in Australia, behind Melbourne and Monash universities. Without over 100 years of building up investments in property and savings or the research base that can attract funding, UWS has been disproportionately hit by these funding cuts. UWS is situated in one of the fastest growing regions in Australia, and the demand for university places will increase year by year. It is interesting to note that the state of Western Australia has roughly the same population as Greater Western Sydney, yet that state has four public universities and a private university—Notre Dame. Members can see the sorts of pressures UWS will be under to find available places for our local young people who want a tertiary education. UWS trains our nurses and teachers. It trains our engineers and computer technicians. It trains our lawyers, accountants and business managers.
As the population of Western Sydney increases at a rapid pace—Western Sydney is expected to overtake the rest of Sydney in total population in just over a decade—there will be a need for more university places. The Senate estimates process has revealed that, unfortunately,  there will be 510 fewer places available at UWS in 2005 than there are today if the current government policy is allowed to continue. With the changes being proposed in these bills, UWS has estimated that they will be a further $30 million worse off, so that will have an impact on the number of available places as well. The university lost half of its postgraduate research student places in the last round of changes, resulting in important economic, social and environmental research being curtailed. Fewer research places means less funding. There is an urgent need in Western Sydney, which I know you would fully support, Mr Deputy Speaker Price, to increase access and participation for all sections of the community and to provide students with educational opportunities regardless of circumstances, and this objective will not be achieved under the policies of the Howard government.
I will conclude my remarks by referring to a document produced by the University of Western Sydney. It states:
UWS does not support additional fee-paying arrangements. The UWS Board of Trustees has been consistent and clear in its view that the University would not offer fee-paying places in mainstream undergraduate programs in recognition of its concern not to substitute wealth for merit as a determinant for entry to University. Any scheme which encourages students to pay either part or full fees must be balanced to ensure that access to higher education is enhanced and does not lead to a two-tier system where wealth buys privilege.
I congratulate UWS and support the second reading amendments that will be moved by the Labor Party.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Zahra, Christian, MP",ALP,2003-10-15,"—I rise today to speak on the Higher Education Support Bill 2003 and the Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003, which are being debated cognately. We are very fortunate in the Gippsland region to have outstanding higher education institutions. We have Monash University's Gippsland campus, operating in Churchill in the Latrobe Valley, and we have the Central Gippsland Institute of TAFE, operating mostly in the West and South Gippsland districts. We are also very fortunate to have Gippsland Group Training Ltd, which is one of the best group training companies in the country. It directly employs about 1,100 apprentices. Most people in this place would accept that it is one of the leading group training companies in Australia. There has been quite a bit of academic research done on and academic literature written about the great success of the group training model which has been pioneered in the Gippsland region by Gippsland Group Training Ltd. We are fortunate to have these great institutions in our district and we get great benefit from them. 
When you speak to people who are in leadership positions within these institutions, they tell you that they would like to be doing more. They tell you that there is a lot more that is demanded of them than they are able to supply as a result of the funding with which they are provided. In our district we have a lot of identified skills shortages and we have these wonderful institutions which are in a position to resolve some of these skills shortages, yet this government does not provide these institutions with the funding that they need to be able to deliver on those courses or to provide the number of places being demanded by people in our local district.
In speaking about higher education generally, it is worth noting that the federal government's approach to higher education is as far removed from meeting the needs of people in our district as it is possible to imagine. We are not a region that has a lot of millionaires and, Mr Deputy Speaker Price, I know that you know what it is like to represent an area where there are not too many people who have got big flash houses and hundreds of millions of dollars. We might not have a lot of millionaires and big flash houses, but our kids are just as smart as—or probably smarter than—those from the affluent North Shore of Sydney, for example. The kids who go to the secondary schools in our areas deserve to have the same chances and opportunities to go on to university, TAFE or other forms of higher education as the kids who come from families that have got a lot of money. This is a basic idea that has always been central to what Australia is about.
But the higher education system being developed by this government is not about providing opportunities for families from the Latrobe Valley, West Gippsland, Pakenham or the South Gippsland district to send their children to university. It is all about cementing privilege in Australia and making sure that the only kids who can go to university are those kids whose mums and dads went to university and who have quite a bit of money. That does not really work too well for us in the Gippsland region. In our district, we do not have a lot of people who have gone to university and who are working in professional, management or business positions. We have a lot of tradespeople; we have a lot of people who are working in services and in retail, in the power industry, in the pulp and paper industry, and in the agricultural sector. We do not have a lot of people who have gone to university. Cementing privilege as the key driver of who gets to go to university in real terms means that kids in the Gippsland region will miss out.
When I go und the district, I am continually impressed by the quality of the young people who are being produced by the schools in our region. It really is a tribute to people in the secondary school system in our district that so many outstanding young people are being produced. These students are getting incredibly high marks in their TERs and their outlook towards their community is very civic minded. But although our secondary school system is producing outstanding leaders—people who are getting good marks, have a good world view and a sense of putting something back into the community—they are locked out of opportunity as a direct result of the federal govern-ent's approach to higher education. 
I graduated from year 12 in 1990, and shortly after I attended the ALP campaign launch for McMillan at the Traralgon hall. When I graduated in 1990, one of the great things that we loved and really enjoyed was that the kids whose mums and dads had lots of money but who were not smart and did not work hard would not be able to get a university place. We used to love this; it was a great equaliser. If you were smart and you worked hard, you could get a place at university. We loved the fact that, if you lived in a small house and did not have much money or your dad did not earn too much in a flash job, it did not matter. You were able to get ahead of other people based on who you were, not who your mum and dad were. We used to love it, and it was great thing.
But now when I visit secondary schools in my electorate and speak to the young kids in years 11 and 12 who are contemplating the move to higher education, they tell me how bitterly disappointed they are. They are angry and frustrated that their chance to go to university is not what it should be, that they have a restricted opportunity of going to university. Yet they know that some of the kids whose parents have got money will be able to go to university despite the students from less well-off families getting higher marks than the kids from rich families.
I think that is a disgrace. I think that is a disgusting thing. I think it is an offensive idea, considering what Australia has always been about. We are not just talking about one or two students; we are talking about some 9,500 students who have made their way into university using this crook method. And it is a crook method. It is the wrong way to go about determining who should go to university. The basic test for who should go to university or TAFE or anywhere else associated with higher education is that they should be people who are smart enough to get into those institutions and who work hard enough. Under the government's system someone can get into university because mum and dad have a lot of money and can send them to university because they are able to pay their way in.
At the same time as these 9,500 people have been getting into the university sector using this crook method, the federal government has put in place policies which have made it harder and harder for people to afford to go to university by increasing the fees associated with courses. The government says, `It's all just money they can pay back later on. It doesn't matter if someone's got to pay $100,000 for a degree through HECS; the main thing is that they can pay it back later on.' That might be right if it were not for the way this thing has worked in terms of practical outcomes. The federal government knows what these practical outcomes are. I know what these practical outcomes are and I think that most people in this place do too. All the research tells us that, if you are from a rich family with a million-dollar house and a lot of money coming into the household and someone says to you, `Your degree will cost $80,000. You have to pay back $80,000 at the end of your studies; you have to pay it back through the HECS system,' you will say, `That's no big deal, $80,000. That's how much Mum and Dad spent on my first car. That's not that much money.'
But we know that when battlers, people without much money and particularly those from country districts, hear `$80,000' they think about how much their house might be worth—and there are many houses in my electorate that are being sold for $80,000—they think about how hard their parents have to work just to make ends meet and they think that taking on a debt that size is more than they can afford. This is the reality of the difference between rich and poor in this country and in their attitudes towards higher education, and this is why it is so important that we have a system in Australia where the people who get into university are those who are smart and who work hard, not just those who have hundreds of thousands of dollars and come from privileged backgrounds.

"Burke, Anna, MP",ALP,2003-10-15,"—I consider myself very fortunate to be the member for Chisholm. In addition to having constituents from diverse backgrounds who continually give back to the community, there are numerous industries and businesses within my electorate. Moreover, within Chisholm there are two outstanding internationally recognised universities: Monash University and the city campus of Deakin University, in Burwood. I am also privileged to have one of the state's largest and most advanced TAFEs, Box Hill TAFE.
These universities and TAFEs are, however, under attack from the very body that should provide their lifeblood—the federal government. The government has cut a staggering $1.3 billion from Victorian universities since 1996. That is just from Victorian universities—$1.3 billion. This includes nearly $340 million from Monash University alone. Monash University is this country's largest university. It is surviving with $340 million less in its budget. Public funding has fallen way behind the increase in the cost of running a university under the Howard government. The Howard government's Higher Education Support Bill 2003 and Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003 will make this even harder, not easier.
This legislation will make it harder for our young people to get a university education. The Higher Education Support Bill will reduce the size of our universities. It is a bill that will reduce education and ultimately reduce the amount of knowledge in our country. This bill aims to restrict participation in Australian universities and significantly reduce the opportunities Australians have to go to university. Australians want an education. They deserve an education. They deserve to get an education if their abilities qualify them for a university place. Higher education is not a luxury and should never be viewed that way. It is not a privilege or a prerogative of the rich in this country.
Education ensures a better future for Australians both within our borders and on the international playing field. A lack of education will mean that we as a country will not compete at all on that field. We need a world-class university system that delivers teaching and research of the highest quality to students across the system, not just to the lucky few who can afford it. I think it is very self-evident today, when we have Science Meets Parliament taking place, that we should be looking not only at universities but also at research and the wonderful benefits that science brings us. It is easy to provide high-quality education to a few; it is much harder to provide high-quality education to everyone.
These bills would make the Australian university system the most expensive public system for students in the Western world. They would allow universities to increase their fees by up to 30 per cent, by shifting from public investment to user pays—the very ideology the Liberal Party prides itself on. It is worth noting that, amongst countries within the OECD, Australia had the second lowest increase in the rate of university enrolments between 1995 and 2001. This is unforgivable, considering that this year alone there are 20,000 qualified Australians missing out on university places. This is not even a brain drain, because it is not giving Australians a chance to get an education to begin with. 
With these measures the government is trying to force universities to cut around 8,000 HECS places by 2007. In my state of Victoria this means over 1,200 university places will go in the next year alone. Over time this means more and more people will miss out on courses they would otherwise have got into. It will also mean that we will not have the necessary skills in our society. Teachers and nurses are in short supply; if they do not have university places, they cannot be educated. But why is the government doing this dastardly deed? It wants to introduce more full fee places.
I was on a round of visits to universities to discuss with VCs, students and staff how they viewed the package that the government was introducing. One VC looked at us and said, `In the future there will be no distinction between full fee paying students and HECS students.' That is the way this government wants it to be—no differentiation and all students to pay full fees. Those who have already contributed through their taxation, either directly or via their parents, will be forced to pay up to $150,000 for a full fee university place, which is an enormous sum by any measure. As if this is not horrendous enough, publicly funded places will decline even further after 2007, creating a greater rift between the haves and the have-nots. I think the proudest day in my mother's life was when my younger brother graduated from Monash University. That meant she had five first-generation university graduates. It was something my parents could never have contemplated if they had had to fork out $150,000 times five on our father's bank clerk salary.
What the Howard government is effectively doing is discouraging aspiring students, and in turn their families, because of their socioeconomic bracket, from the prospect of ever getting a tertiary education. This is nothing short of shameful. This government's package means huge HECS debts of up to $50,000 for Australian undergraduates. An arts degree could cost $15,000; a basic science degree, $21,000; and a law degree, $41,000. How can anyone deny that these figures would discourage a bright yet financially challenged teenager from pursuing an education, a goal and a future?
As if these figures were not daunting enough, these nasty pieces of legislation include a provision for the minister to raise HECS fees over and above 30 per cent, which means either his statement that 30 per cent would be the absolute maximum is a little less than truthful or the minister needs help defining 30 per cent. This minister is very good at using stats, though I am not sure how many of them are actually ground-ed in truth, and this is yet another one that is slightly wobbly. This discretion fortifies the rationale that the Howard government wants to allow even bigger hikes in HECS fees but to do it in the grotty, sly manner in which it gets things done.
In case those on the other side of the chamber think this is a stunt, let us demonstrate the callousness with which the Howard government have treated education. The university fee structure in Australia is now one of the highest on the world scale. Our country is currently the fourth most heavily dependent on private funding in the OECD. Australia has had the largest drop in public investment in universities over five years of any OECD country—it dropped by 11 per cent. In stark contrast, the OECD average was an increase of 21 per cent. Australian students already spend the shortest amount of time at university of students in any OECD country. So, instead of spending money where we need it in education, we are ripping money out of the sector. But it seems this is not bad enough for the government. It now plans to have no limit on the number of full fee places at Australian universities. At one stage the education minister said it would be capped at 50 per cent of the number of students, but of what significance is this if he has the discretion to exclude entire courses from this 50 per cent limit? In reality this means that some courses will not have one single HECS place. It seems apparent that, for the government, it is always about the bottom line and the almighty dollar, doesn't it? 
I have spoken in this House before about a constituent of mine, Claire, who got 98.5 for her TER score in her HSC year and was the Monash Law Prize winner. The cut-off for law that year was 98.7—she missed out by 0.2 of a per cent. She could have got into a full fee paying place with a score of 91. She was only off by 0.2 per cent and had won the law prize from Monash, but she did not get a place. She could have got a full fee paying place if she had not been one of nine children of Italian migrant parents. Instead, she got to university, did arts and transferred to law. I think this demonstrates starkly that this legislation tends to disadvantage bright kids from poor backgrounds.
There will be no full fee places for Australian undergraduates if a Labor government win the next election. That is right: in stark contrast to this government, we will not have full fee paying places. The university system in this wonderful country is an excellent one. This is evidenced by the number of foreign students that have the privilege to come here and study, as many do at Monash and Deakin universities in my electorate. But should we or our children have to buy a university place because international students can and do? Of course not. We and our children are a part of the Australian community that has contributed to the tertiary education system through tax and other forms of support. Why do we have to now compete financially with foreign students who, most likely, are here on a transient basis?
Let me remind the House that the Howard government has cut $5 billion from our universities since 1996. What has this caused? In my various meetings with staff in the universities within my electorate, I have seen stress levels rise dramatically. Stress is now the No. 1 cause of illness at universities. This is due to the rising disparity in student-teacher ratios and the resultant substandard student support, which has allowed this stress to reach the point where it is severely impacting on staff performance in the delivery of service.
On a regular basis, my electorate office receives calls from constituents expressing their decreasing confidence in the university system and the concern that their projected debt for their children's education is expected to snowball. This concern is most evident in the number of foreign students who are nowadays determining to go to other universities because Australia does not provide the level of education they seek. To address these problems, indexation of university funding has been identified by universities as the priority issue—and it was applauded as a significant initiative when it was announced in the ALP policy—as it would deliver more money for most universities than they can extract from students through HECS increases. At this stage it is important to recap where we stand with this Liberal government. Unaffordable degree costs, increased HECS fees, insufficient student places and ministerial discretion on HECS places make this legislation a tragedy and legislation we should reject. ",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"King, Catherine, MP",ALP,2003-10-15,"—The Higher Education Support Bill 2003 and the Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003 implement the government's agenda to change the face of higher education in Australia. They give unprecedented ministerial control over our universities and increase the burden of debt on students and their families. The government likes to refer to them as bills that reforms higher education, but in order to reform higher education you have to seriously invest in it, and invest in the right ways. These bills are essentially a patch-up job. After seven years of funding cuts, they do little to restore the funding that universities have lost under this government, whose answer to increasing funding is to shift the burden of cost away from itself to individuals and families. It is user pays in its starkest form. These are essentially bills that are about which young Australians will in future years be able to benefit from higher education and which will not. They are about who in the future will be burdened by higher education debt and who will not. They are essentially bills that limit the opportunities of young people from low- to middle-income earning families in this country to get ahead.
As such, there are no other bills before this parliament that so starkly shows the choice between the two major parties. You do not have to look very hard to see that universities are in trouble and are experiencing problems and that the problems are ones of this government's making. One bill, in typical government speak, is titled the Higher Education Support Bill 2003. More correctly, it should be called the `Higher Education Propping It Up Because We Have Mucked It Up Bill'. It is clear that the government's cuts to universities and its inadequate funding have led to pressure on universities, lecturers and students. Overenrolments, overcrowding of lecture theatres, significant increases in the student-staff ratios, pressure on infrastructure and other resources such as library facilities—all of these things have potentially undermined the quality and standards of Australian university education.
Universities across Australia have experienced over $5 billion worth of budget cuts since this government was elected. In my own electorate the University of Ballarat, a fine institution, has experienced $52 million in budget cuts since this government came to power. Universities such as the University of Ballarat, the Australian Catholic University and VUT, which many people in my electorate go to, have muddled through. But there is no doubt that the government's funding cuts have had a significant impact on the ability of universities to deliver high-quality, affordable education in this country.
And what is the government's response to this? The government's response to this is that people should pay more. Under this government we saw student-staff ratio increases of around 43 per cent at Ballarat university from 1996 to 2001. We have seen significant numbers of students unable to access university places. About 20,000 people qualify for university places each year and miss out. This government's policies have allowed and even encouraged universities to overenrol. Ballarat university is estimated to be overenrolled by about 350 places, the majority of which it is set to lose if the minister does not keep his promise as given to me and recorded in Hansard. The university is reported as being set to lose around 114 places under this government's proposal. In courses such as nursing and teaching—areas where there are desperate shortages of professionals—significant numbers of students are knocked back each year. At the University of Ballarat, nursing has been one of the courses in which we have experienced significant growth. Estimates are that around 900 students apply for nursing at the University of Ballarat each year. The majority of them miss out on a place. 
The government's response has been to announce 210 new nursing places. I note that in the member for Mallee's contribution he called on the government to give some of these places to the University of Ballarat, and it is a call I echo. However, you do not have to look too widely to realise that 210 places are not really going to stretch very far across the country, and it is highly unlikely that they are going to go anywhere near meeting the demand at the University of Ballarat alone. Labor, by contrast, will create an additional 1,100 commencing undergraduate nursing places and 500 new fully funded HECS postgraduate nursing places every year from 2005. If the member for Mallee thinks that the government's tiny contribution will assist the University of Ballarat, I am sure he will recognise that Labor's proposition has a much better chance of actually addressing nursing shortages in rural areas.
The government's response to our problems in universities is simply that students and families should pay more if they want to access higher education. The government's so-called reforms will make it harder for young people to get a place at university and make it even harder for them to pay for it. Average student contributions to higher education have increased significantly already. Student debt has doubled under the Howard government and is now at $9 billion. These are significant barriers, not only to accessing education but to future home ownership and financial stability. There are claims that there are record numbers of students in Victoria who will carry their HECS debts to the grave. The government's proposal is to increase the burden of debt on students by allowing universities to increase their HECS fees by 30 per cent. This means that an arts degree could cost $15,000, a science degree could cost $21,000 and a law degree could cost $41,000. They are significant increases. Starting out in your first paid job is hard enough, but being burdened with these sorts of debts is absolutely crippling.
The University of Ballarat has stated that given the average income of our catchment area it does not think that it will be feasible to increase university fees, and it has stated that the real benefit will go to the sandstone universities. So the University of Ballarat is not even going to benefit under this part of the government's proposals. At the University of Ballarat, 75 per cent of students come from the catchment area of the Wimmera through to Ballarat and surrounds, where the average household income is around $33,500. Sixty-three per cent of all commencing students at the University of Ballarat are the first generation to ever to go to university. There is no indication as yet from the university as to what courses are going to cost more—and I am sure that some of them will—but I agree with the vice-chancellor's assessment that the income levels experienced by people in my electorate mean that the government's proposals would place a significant burden on Ballarat students and would dissuade many of them from attending universities were fees to rise.
Labor are opposing the 30 per cent increase in HECS fees and are instead expanding opportunities for students to get a qualification by creating 20,000 new commencing full- and part-time university places and 20,000 new full- and part-time TAFE places. This means that by 2008 there will be 40,000 additional new commencing TAFE and university students every year. We will also be providing $35 million for a program to support secondary students from disadvantaged backgrounds to progress to university and TAFE. Labor also want to directly address the issue of financial hardship for students. Many students are currently living in dire financial circumstances. Labor will extend rent assistance to Austudy recipients and reduce the age of independence for students on the youth allowance. We will also increase the HECS repayment threshold to $35,000 per annum in 2004, which is a year earlier and a threshold $5,000 higher than the government is proposing. 
Higher fees do create barriers to university education. In 1998, the government for the first time allowed full fee paying student places, meaning that 9,000 students who had the money could buy their way into universities. We now have the Vice-Chancellor of Melbourne University pricing a full fee paying medical degree at $150,000. Instead of access being on merit, the government wants to increase the opportunities for students and families with money to purchase a university place by increasing the number of full fee paying places. The government is also introducing a loan scheme with prohibitive interest rates that will do little to allow kids from poorer to middle-income families to access university education.
The minister likes to pretend that he is not playing the race card when he asks, `Overseas students have access to full fee paying places, so why shouldn't Australian kids?' Overseas students and their parents do not pay taxes in this country, so in my view it is reasonable to ask them to pay extra for their education. I am not ashamed of saying that we should be charging overseas students for courses in Australia. But when Australian parents have already paid their taxes, why are we now saying to them, `If your kids cannot get access because the government has not funded enough university places, the only way they will get access is if they can buy their way into universities'?
What this government is trying to do is entrench privilege in this country, and it is creating barriers to university participation. Not satisfied with making it harder for those on lower incomes to attend university, by raising fees, the government wants to make it easier for the rich to attend. Labor will, by contrast, abolish full fees for all new domestic undergraduate students. Labor opposes the government's plan to increase HECS and introduce a loans scheme with a six per cent interest rate. By contrast, Labor is going to increase the number of university and TAFE places, creating more opportunities, not fewer, for all Australians to attend university and TAFE.
The Howard government has made over $400 million of desperately needed university funding contingent on its extreme ideological industrial relations agenda. This proposal has the stamp of the former Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations all over it. None of the conditions that the government is proposing have any relevance to the core functions of university teaching and research. This legislation does not create enough fully funded university places to meet population growth—let alone unmet demand. For those seeking a university or TAFE place, it does little to provide hope that they will be able to get one, let alone afford to pay for it if they do. Under this government, too many of our young people have already missed out on a university place. 
With Labor's policies, we are trying to make sure that more kids get to go to university, regardless of their background. Countries with highly skilled, know-led-geable and well-educated populations do better economically. Regionally we do better because we have the University of Ballarat and the Australian Catholic University in our area. This is why I will support Labor's amendments to this bill and why I oppose the government's regressive provisions, which will limit growth in my region and opportunities for young people and mature age students to get a better chance in life. ",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Jackson, Sharryn, MP",ALP,2003-10-15,"—I rise to oppose the government's bills, the Higher Education Support Bill 2003 and the Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003 in their current form and, in particular, I oppose the general direction of the higher education policy proposed by the Howard government. I also intend to speak today in support of the fairly detailed amendments that were foreshadowed by the member for Jagajaga, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, with respect to this legislation.
As we know, the legislation introduces fundamental changes to Australia's higher education system in four key areas. The first is deregulation of tuition charges for undergraduate students. This is the first time we have seen this happen in 30 years. To borrow a phrase from a popular movie, it seems to me to be a step `back to the future'. If this legislation is passed, universities will be allowed to determine their fee levels for students, within certain limits—and universities can request that the minister allow them to increase those limits.
The second change we see with this legislation is an increase in regulation of the student profiles of our universities, giving the minister and his department the power to determine how many students are taught in individual courses at each university. This seems to me to be an extraordinary situation for Australia's education system. The third significant change is, as part of that increasing regulation, the explicit tying of core operating grants to universities complying with the government's policies in respect of industrial relations and governance structures. I will come back to that later. Lastly, the legislation gives the minister the authority to add new higher education providers, without any reference to this parliament. As I understand the legislation, such decisions by the minister would not even be disallowable.
I do not want to traverse the ground that has been covered by many other speakers with respect to this legislation, but I indicate for the record that I endorse in their entirety the comments of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Jagajaga, and the Leader of the Opposition in their addresses to this parliament. What I would like to do in the time that is available to me this morning is to address the impact that these changes are likely to have in my electorate of Hasluck.
Over the two years that I have been privileged to represent the electors of Hasluck in this place, I have had concerns about participation rates in tertiary education. Indeed, it was obvious from the background papers that were part of the minister's higher education review that the participation rates from rural areas and low socioeconomic suburbs, the like of which fall in my electorate, have actually fallen or remained the same. You would hope that, over time, we would have seen an increase in the participation rates of students in these areas.
In the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics data on participation rates in higher education for the Perth metropolitan area, it is quite interesting to contrast the situation of people who live in Perth's western suburbs with those who live in Perth's eastern suburbs. Unlike the rest of the country, in Western Australia it is our western suburbs that are the leafy and perhaps more affluent suburbs in the metropolitan areas, as opposed to the eastern region, where my electorate is. I was distressed to discover that you are four times more likely to be participating in higher education if you live in the western suburbs of Perth than if you live in the eastern suburbs. Indeed, about a third of the higher education students in Western Australia live in the eastern suburbs or have eastern suburbs postcodes. But when you look at how the resources in higher education are spread around the Perth metropolitan area, we find that there are 5,000 residents for each higher education place in the eastern suburbs compared with 20 residents for each higher education place in the western suburbs. That is a huge disproportion in terms of the distribution of higher education places in the Perth metropolitan area. 
In Western Australia we have only three universities. Of the 11 campuses that they operate only one is in the suburbs east of Victoria Park, an inner city suburb in the Perth metropolitan area. No doubt this is a contributing factor in explaining the far lower participation rate of people in higher education in the eastern suburbs. Between 1986 and 1996 the percentage of the population in Perth's western suburbs attending university rose from five per cent to almost 10 per cent. It also doubled in a corresponding group in the eastern suburbs, but it moved from a particularly low base of just 1.8 per cent to 3.5 per cent. When you look at how Perth benefits from resources in higher education of around $1 billion, it seems to me that that learning expenditure or investment is spent almost to the exclusive benefit of the communities in Perth's richer western suburbs.
The combined effects of increasing HECS fees for undergraduate students—which is the single greatest change in this legislation today—the continuing reduction in the number of student places, the deregulation of fees and the disproportionate location of higher education places will be devastating for poorer urban communities. In my view there must be equal access to higher education for all Australians, particularly for West Australians where this huge imbalance needs to be addressed.
I have spoken before in this place about the area of Midland in my electorate. It is an example of an outer metropolitan regional community that has a substantial level of unemployment. It is a low socioeconomic community, and we have high levels of unemployment amongst our youth. In my opinion, if we concentrated some resources in this area and we had appropriate government support, we could ensure that this situation would improve and that there would be quality jobs for the residents.
I know a wonderful group of people there from local, state and federal government, as well as the business and community sectors. They are working together to establish the Midland tertiary education precinct. They are in the process of lobbying both state and federal governments to establish a multisector educational campus based in Midland, with an emphasis on strong science and engineering programs—not just at the post compulsory level or TAFE level but also at the undergraduate, postgraduate and research and development levels. The slogan for the Midland tertiary education precinct group is `upskilling our region'. It could not be a more fitting description for the eastern metropolitan region, which is experiencing population growth at twice the rate of the Perth metropolitan area.
Midland was the historical centre of the West Australian railway industry. What was once a thriving area, with tradespeople working at the Midland railway workshops, now suffers from high unemployment, low income levels, low levels of skilled workers and a low level of school retention rates. Contributing to this problem is the lack of opportunities available to young people living locally. There is only one small tertiary presence in the region and only one private post compulsory education provider. This is a critical issue to the Midland area and it is one that the Midland tertiary education precinct group is trying to address. If ever there was an example of why more funding is needed to ensure that young people can access quality skills training and education, Midland is it. 
In the minute or so that I have left, I have to say that Midland residents still talk about the 1996 election commitment made by the then shadow minister for education, Robert Hill, and the member for Pearce, Judi Moylan, to establish a university or to create higher education facilities in the Midland area. That would have contributed to the upskilling of people in this region. It is seven years since this government have been in place and have had the opportunity to deliver on that commitment to the Midland area, but they have consistently failed to do so. 
In closing, can I say that I have just had the pleasure of meeting the scientists who have been visiting many MPs in this place. They indicated to me that Australian public investment in higher education as a percentage of GDP has fallen dramatically, to levels well below our international competitors. Let us hope that commonsense will assert itself and that people in this place will reject the proposed Howard legislation and support the alternative that is being promoted by Labor.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Irwin, Julia, MP",ALP,2003-10-15,"—The Higher Education Support Bill 2003 and the Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003 will turn back the clock to a time before the Whitlam government came to office in 1972. It will turn back the clock to a time that the Prime Minister seems to think was ideal for Australian life—back to the 1950s, back to the days of white picket fences and listening to the cricket on the radio, back to the time when a higher education was the privilege of the lucky few who won a Commonwealth scholarship or whose parents were rich enough to send them to university. For the rest, a university education was something that could only be dreamed of. 
Of all the changes made by the Whitlam government, the one which affected more lives and which offered potential to more Australians was the change to higher education that abolished fees. The effect of those changes took some time to influence the ambitions of young Australians. But, from that time, every Australian child who started school should have known that financial restrictions would not prevent them from going to university. I do not think there was ever a survey of this type but, if you were to ask an eight-year-old child what they wanted to be when they grew up, the answer—apart from the usual choices like a fireman or a pilot—before 1972 would have been be very different to that after 1972.
That difference was because, for the first time, Australians had a real choice about their career. For the first time they could decide on a career which required a university education; for the first time Australian kids did not have a ceiling on their ambitions; for the first time Australian kids could think about careers that were once the exclusive choices of the rich; for the first time Australians could consider themselves to be part of a nation that embraced equality; for the first time every teacher and every student could see educational potential limited only by ability, not by economic status.
A few weeks ago I was speaking with some retired teachers who taught in our schools in the 1950s and 1960s. The comments that struck me most were their regrets about the hundreds of bright students who had the capability to go on to university education but did not—kids who left school at the intermediate level and went into a trade. As the retired teachers said to me, it was just the accepted thing at the time. Kids did not expect to go to university. Many of those students have done well in life, but the big difference is that for many kids today the expectation is now the opposite. They expect to go to university. Not all of them will but through their years at school they can at least hold onto that hope. 
It is true to say, as many critics do, that free higher education did not bring about a great levelling. Today, kids from rich families are twice as likely to go to university as kids from poorer homes. But that is a big improvement on the figures before 1972. The important thing is the issue of access. There are many reasons why more kids from poorer homes do not go to university, but the cost of an up-front fee or debt burden for life should not be one of them. I will not deny that it was the Labor government that introduced HECS fees and I know that even under Labor HECS fees became a burden. But at the same time it is only fair that university graduates should be expected to meet part of the cost of their education after their income has reached a reasonable level.
But the Higher Education Support Bill 2003 and the Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003 go much further than the changes made when HECS was introduced. These bills allow universities to set their own level of fees. While this is limited to 30 per cent above the set level, the way is clearly open for this limit to be removed at some future time. While the message given to every Australian child in 1972 was one of hope and opportunity, these bills slam the door shut on the hopes and ambitions of a growing number of Australian kids.
When I visit schools in my electorate and I look at the faces of those young Australians I like to think of each and every one of them having the chance to reach their full potential. But if these bills are passed I will not be able to do that. I will not be able to look at those beautiful faces in quite the same way. That is what I mean by turning back the clock: going back to a time when so many kids faced that ceiling on their ambitions; a time when our society was less fair and ambition was framed by how rich your parents were, not by your dedication to achieve your potential.
As someone who grew up in Western Sydney, nothing gives me greater pride than the achievements of the University of Western Sydney. If ever the dream of Gough Whitlam to give Australian kids the chance to reach their full potential is being realised it is at the University of Western Sydney. More than two out of every three students at UWS are the first in their family to go to university. That combination of affordable university fees in an institution that caters for the needs of students from Western Sydney is an important reason for the success of UWS.
That success is a source of great pride for the people of Western and south-western Sydney. Like other members of this House from there, I too am proud of the achievements of that great university. As someone who advocated its establishment as a young girl, I am proud to say that my daughter is a graduate of UWS and my son, Blake, is currently a student there.
But not every member representing Western Sydney electorates shares that pride. In recent comments in the Penrith Press the member for Lindsay has shown her contempt for the University of Western Sydney. She is quoted as saying, `The UWS board and management are left wing, politicised, inflammatory and inefficient.' The member for Lindsay refuses to stand up for UWS. Her name is not even on the speakers list for this most important debate. Instead, she claims that UWS receives above average funding and even claims that the funding changes would lead to more equality in university funding. 
But then she goes on to say, `We are providing them with transitional funding, so there will be no funding cuts to UWS.' But the member for Lindsay does not explain why you need transitional funding if there is not going to be a funding cut some time later. There will be funding cuts. That is the view of the founding vice-chancellor of UWS, Sir Ian Turbott. Sir Ian is also quoted in the Penrith Press as saying that he believes the federal government's higher education reforms would cut funding to the university. Sir Ian said that UWS should be considered differently from other universities because the majority of people who used it were not able to afford the increase in fees.
To quote from the article, Sir Ian said:
University gives an opportunity to people who would never have had it before. Whereas universities such as Sydney can increase their fees, that's not an alternative of the University of Western Sydney because the people are not in the high income area.
Sir Ian went on to say:
It is hard to understand why the federal government intends to cut funding to UWS and deny our region the opportunity to have a well funded university which can serve people in western Sydney.
In response to those remarks by the member for Lindsay, Sir Ian described her attacks as `troubling'. He said that in his time as vice-chancellor he had not experienced such an outburst and had no idea why Ms Kelly made the statements she did.
I could clear that up by saying that the member for Lindsay does not understand the needs of the University of Western Sydney—which is in her electorate—and, for that matter, she does not understand the broader needs of the people of Western Sydney either. But the facts speak for themselves. Only one person in 10 in Western Sydney holds a university degree, while the figure is one person in five in the east. The forty-two per cent of Sydney's population living in Western and south-west Sydney have one university. In the east of Sydney there are four universities.
According to the member for Lindsay, these changes will lead to more equality in university funding—but she does not understand the needs of Western Sydney. The member for Lindsay should be visiting the campus in Western Sydney and speaking to the students who go there—speaking to the students who live in her electorate and who go to the University of Western Sydney. As I said, the member for Lindsay does not understand the needs of Western Sydney, not like Sir Ian Turbott who guided UWS through its early years and saw clearly the needs and the role of the university in and for Western Sydney.
I have spoken about the impact on the University of Western Sydney and the Western and south-western regions of Sydney, but we should also look at the impact on individual students of a 30 per cent fee increase. For a start, we should recognise that, under this government, HECS fees have just about doubled and their repayment, even with the latest changes, cuts in at lower levels than when HECS was first introduced. At a time in life when graduates are setting out on their career—and for many it is also a time when they are setting up a home—HECS fees are taking a large bite of their income. With high house prices and the need to take out large mortgages, graduates saddled with a large HECS debt are hurting—and hurting badly.
This government is transferring the burden of the cost of higher education onto graduates when, in many cases, they can least afford it. Before too long, as they start families, the old HECS debt—and if this bill passes, the extra burden of the higher fee debt—will be crippling for many young families. We will have gone back to the time—that pre-Whitlam era—when we had the full fee paying universities. When the children of this generation's graduates see the burden faced by their parents, they will wonder if it is all worth the effort. In 50 years we will have come full circle to another generation of bright kids who do not go to university. They will be the poorer for it and our nation will be the poorer for it as well. But that is the white picket fence vision that this government wants to take us back to. That is the vision of the member for Lindsay: a population in Western Sydney without hope of a career ambition. 
I am afraid that the next time I visit a school in my electorate—and I will be visiting a lot in the next couple of weeks—I will look at the faces that hold so much hope and I will think, `What chance will they have?' Will they and their parents be able to afford a university education? If this bill is passed, I do not think I will ever be able to look at those faces in quite the same way as I do now. The member for Lindsay should hold her head in shame and should get out and visit the university that is in her electorate and speak to those students.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,2003-10-15,"—In rising to speak on the Higher Education Support Bill 2003 and the Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003, I want to make a comment briefly on the speech by the member for Hasluck. She gave a very effective sociological analysis of the situation of higher education in relation to Western Australians, particularly in suburban Perth. The statistics that she repeated with regard to what happens in the eastern suburbs of Perth you could cite for the southern suburbs which I represent. In my electorate we have the lowest rate of tertiary participation in the metropolitan areas of the country. Added to that is a real problem in Western Australia with access to places—which this legislation will exacerbate.
The University of Western Australia has the highest cut-off points for entry to every single faculty of the university of any in the country. Ostensibly that means, of course, that the University of Western Australia has the most intelligent students in the country. If you take all of Western Australia's four universities, you will find that they are in the top eight on cut-off points. Indeed, to take UWA again, the requirement for students to get into the arts faculty is the same as that imposed in Sydney on students to get into the law faculty of Sydney University. Those four universities in Western Australia appearing in the top eight in terms of cut-off points do so not because of the intelligence of the Western Australian population but because of the inequity—the shortage of positions.
Murdoch University will go backwards under this legislation. Under the government's plans, Murdoch University will go backwards. Though it has an enviable record on questions of access and a notable role played in the Western Australian community in encouraging people who had absolutely no idea they could access tertiary education, it will be the first to be obliged to introduce full fee paying places. It is a tragedy for that university and it is a shocking indictment of the treatment of Western Australia by this government—set in concrete by this legislation.
I want to talk about the strategic settings of this legislation. From this side of the House, we have heard excellent analysis of the issues involved with regard to opportunity and equality of opportunity that are affected—indeed, damaged—by this piece of legislation. So I will talk about it instead in the context of its investment in our future as a country. Where it fails—I believe most grossly—is in its failure to assist this nation at precisely the point it needs to be assisted if we are to be a prosperous, competitive and secure society this century. This century, those nations that will succeed—and, in Australia's case, I would add to the word `succeed' the word `survive'—will be those who optimise the creative skills of their people, be it in ensuring continued access to skilling, re-skilling and education to expand an individual's knowledge base; be it in business innovation in research and development; or be it in injecting a knowledge edge in all aspects of public policy, from the provision of basic services to defending the nation. That would be the case anyway, but it is particularly the case in a time of war. 
We face a long war, the Prime Minister says, and we critically require two things in this nation to fight it—beyond simply competent defence forces and competent intelligence services—enhanced technical and economic capacity and enhanced national unity—that is, everybody in this nation having the sense of being a stakeholder. You do not believe that you are a stakeholder in this nation if you do not believe that your children have every chance to skill themselves, and have themselves skilled through their lives, to the extent that they can make the maximum contribution to society. If you do not believe yourself to be a stakeholder, you find yourself at the cusp of a diminution, in a national sense, of solidarity. Defeating this legislation—with its further public disinvestment in education and its destruction of nation-building unity through a sense of inequity—is the most important piece of micro-economic reform this parliament can engage in this year.
This is a lucky government. It has enjoyed good growth in troubled times. This it owes entirely to the hard decisions we took in the eighties and nineties: opening Australia to international competition and thus supercharging our exports, productivity and job growth. Productivity growth has slowed in the latter part of the last decade—we have not yet noted that. It slowed significantly in an environment where the component that was work force skills-driven declined. This most crucial component of future productivity growth reached a peak of 28 per cent of total productivity growth under Labor in the early nineties. Now it lies at three per cent. Freeing up labour markets in this country has run its course in productivity growth. The next phase must come through skilling our people and encouraging business innovation. University access and investment sit at the very heart of the inventiveness of our people.
The figures on all fronts under this government are simply appalling. Since it came to office, we have had an effective 12 per cent fall in public investment in universities while the average OECD growth has been 21 per cent. We have had the second slowest rate of growth in student numbers in the industrialised world. We have seen staff to student ratios—which were never better than the international average—blow out by 31 per cent. In actual dollars, we have seen $5 billion cut out. Savaging the tax concessions for business investment in research and development, in addition to all these other measures, means that business investment in this country is one-third lower than it would have been if we had stayed on Labor's trajectory. There you can see the two fronts—innovation in business and the skilling of our people—under attack by this government. What is the explanation for this undermining of Australia's capacity in our time of trial? Is it because the government confronts difficult budget circumstances?
I remind members that when we assumed office 20 years ago we confronted a budget deficit in today's dollar terms of $37 billion. But within five years we were in surplus, had reformed the Australian economy; legislated universal health care; increased public investment in higher education; introduced income tax cuts more than twice the size of this government's, without a GST; set business on the path of a 10 per cent per annum real growth in R&D investment; and created over a million new jobs, most of them full time. We set the Australian economy up, effectively for this lot to squander—or to attempt to do so. As it happens, this undermining is not a product of a lack of resources. There is a substantial enough budget surplus now foreshadowed that, for a cost of around one-third of what this government's contemplated tax cuts would cost, the government could restore over four years the $5 billion it cut from universities. I believe this government is walking away from the next crucial phase of micro-economic reform in the economy—that is, expanding access to education and training by enhancing its affordability. This legislation then is not related to its budget opportunity but is rather a product of ideological blindness. Its practical effect is undermining our nation in a time of war. That blindness stems from the government's class-consciousness. 
Under Whitlam reforms, Labor purged the last elements of its class war fighting orientation and became a party for all Australians, particularly middle Australians. We reflect it now in every element of our being. The Liberals never made the leap, either in their own sociology or in their own attitudes. Two thirds of this cabinet went to category 1 private schools, but only two per cent of Australians go to those schools—66 per cent of this cabinet; two per cent of Australians. A $100,000 degree means nothing to them intellectually. Members of the cabinet—all of them—think in personal terms in amounts for yearly activity that ordinary Australians sitting around the kitchen table only contemplate for a lifetime purchase of a house. One hundred thousand dollars means nothing to a Liberal cabinet minister. It means a house to many Australians sitting around the kitchen table, and a choice between the two: your house, as you grow into your 20s, or an education. They are blind to the needs of ordinary Australians; therefore they are as blind as Bourbons to what they must do to strengthen our society in this time of trial.
We in this party are not going to fail this test of micro-economic reform. We are not going to fall into the position that this government has fallen into of decreasing access to university, of making it unaffordable for ordinary Australians. We are going to take a stand in favour of public investment in strengthening our nation. That is what we are going to do. We can be confident that those great micro-economic reforms that we put in place at great cost to ourselves politically in the 1980s—reforms which opened up this economy of ours to international competition, the fruit of which we see now in a world around us of economic ravaging—have resulted in a very good performance by the Australian economy. That all came off Labor's reforms. We are the ones who know what to do about micro-economic reform in this nation, and because we know what to do we are going to destroy this latest effort to render our nation once again sclerotic by opposing this legislation in the Senate.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Grierson, Sharon, MP",ALP,2003-10-15,"—I also oppose the Higher Education Support Bill 2003 and the Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003. I agree with the previous speaker, the member for Brand; it is time for a reformist government, not this government that reforms through division and neglect of what are perhaps the best institutions we have ever had in our nation. So I rise to oppose the legislation and support the substantive amendments to be moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I regret that my comments have been restricted by the time limit placed on this important debate, but this government constantly uses its power to gag its opponents, be they charity organisations, High Court judges or Labor parliamentarians. 
This legislation represents the most significant change to higher education policy in 30 years and signals a departure from a fine tradition in this country where all citizens were encouraged to value our tertiary institutions, whether or not they or their family attended and studied in them. It also sets a new, and I would suggest dangerous, precedent in granting to individual universities the ability to set fees and to offer full fee paying places to Australian students. It now appears from the fine print in this legislation that the minister will have the ongoing power to decide which courses and what percentage of places in those courses will be full fee paying, as he sees fit. Our very own not so `brave heart', the Minister for Education, Science and Training, will now decide the fate of students once hopeful of an affordable education. Could this mean the minister would have the power to decide that all medical places should be fee paying or that all law places should be full fee paying? That would be a disaster for bright students from families of moderate means but okay for the thick and rich.
Already students are being forced to choose their courses by what is affordable. In my last employment as a principal, one of my school cleaners lived with the regret that her brilliant young daughter chose a commerce/law degree over medicine because of the availability of a scholarship. Without that financial assistance, her family could not afford to support her through her studies. I do not think many members of the government would know what it is like to work split shifts all week, commencing in the dark each morning and ending in the dark each evening, cleaning toilets and emptying garbage bins so that your child can have educational opportunities you did not have. That is a pity. I remember too well my own mother ordering me to my room to study so that I could get a decent job. At the time, as a sole parent she worked long, tiring shifts in a hotel, supporting her daughters so they could have opportunities she never had. Less opportunity and more financial hardship will be the result if this mean spirited government is allowed to bring about increased HECS fees and introduce full fee payment for Australian students.
Complete fee deregulation marks the beginning of elitism, the beginning of our own dinky-di version of Ivy League universities. That is just what we do not need: more Yankee Doodle, American style policy for this country. Our universities get the new variety at—you guessed it—a never to be beaten but always to be imposed and increased price. Agree to massive reregulation by the government, accept compromise to university autonomy and independence, and you can then set your own fees, decide who you enrol and how much they will pay. Sadly, after this government has ripped $5 billion out of our universities, some universities will accept the deal to gain access to a less constrained cash flow. Add some very special industrial relations conditions, throw in a little lecturer unrest and the deal is almost complete.
The minister claims there are too many universities, too much duplication, too many mickey mouse courses and too much mediocrity. He also knows there is much unmet demand and that in this new clever world more and more people will apply for university places. Simply, he does not want the government to have to pay for that. In this country already students and their families are paying some of the highest fee burdens in the world. Under this government, the average HECS fee has increased by 85 per cent. Student debt has doubled to $9 billion. My own daughter calculates when she may have children or purchase a house by when she will have her HECS debt paid off. And we wonder why the fertility rate is so low in this country. 
Student fees and charges now constitute 37 per cent of the income of universities, up from 25 per cent in 1996. The level of government funding has fallen from 57 per cent in 1996 to a new all-time low of 44 per cent. At current projections under current policies student debt is expected to reach $13 billion by 2006. If this legislation is passed, the burden on students and their families will escalate to staggering levels. This legislation will see no caps on HECS fees, no caps on the cost of degrees and no caps on full fee paying places, as well as less places for Australian students and huge HECS debts. According to Professor Bruce Chapman, the architect of HECS, up to 60,000 students will be paying full fees for degrees under the government's package. But the government is determined to impose its ideology, which favours the wealthy and pushes them to the front of the education queues, applying the principle that it knows so well of `user pays'. And if you cannot pay, that is tough; too bad.
As an educator all my life, I know too well that education is the great leveller, the deliverer of opportunity to all, irrespective of position, status and wealth. Education more than anything else blurs the lines of any class system and allows anyone with merit and determination to achieve qualifications that enable them to succeed, allowing them to gain rewarding work and accumulate wealth. That is why we on this side will always defend so passionately a universal education system where merit, not wealth, determines access.
The legislation we are debating today has no interest in principles of equity. It must be remembered that this Prime Minister is our very own `behind the white picket fence' guy from a conservative era when class did exist, an era when the workers wore overalls, carried Gladstone bags and travelled on public transport, while the white-collar workers wore just that—and were easily recognisable—and the professionals and privileged got to wear suits and drive the latest model Holdens. He is certainly overdue for a reality check. Australia has changed. It is progressive and modern and will not accept that higher education should be available only to the wealthy. It will not accept that our skills and talents should be compromised in any way. Equal opportunity has been the hallmark of our democracy and our education system, and it is enshrined in Labor's new Aim Higher policy—which, of course, has my full support.
What does this mean to my university? I am very fortunate to have in my electorate the University of Newcastle, a fine institution which our community fought very hard to have established. Since the introduction of the new education policy we have been trying hard to get the minister to agree to us having regional funding. The government have taken out that regional funding, and they have also taken out 200 places. I pay tribute to our Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Professor Brian English, who will not cut those places but will continue to hold them. Even though we have had a $1.7 billion deficit in funding since 1995, those places will be there for our students. The minister tells us we are not entitled to regional funding, although he has reinstated $1 million of regional funding to the University of Wollongong. We are pleased for Wollongong but desperate in our own region to make sure that the sorts of community based and regional programs that enable students to have that second chance and gain access to university will be funded. Unless that regional funding is restored, it will be very difficult in our region to continue to provide those sorts of enabling and engaging courses. 
But the minister claims that he has considered some new factors for the University of Wollongong: isolation and the inability of students to pay fees. However, he seems to have overlooked that in Newcastle the median individual income is only $306 a week—the 24th lowest ranked electorate in the country—and has not taken that into account. Isolation apparently does not exist because we have so many students we can draw from, even though they may have to come from across the Great Dividing Range, as far as the North Coast and south to the Central Coast. Apparently, isolation for those students living away from home is not a factor that he needs to consider.
Three hundred Indigenous students are enrolled in the University of Newcastle—the greatest number of such students in any university in New South Wales—but apparently the isolation they will feel from being away from home does not require any additional resourcing. I also point out that the University of Newcastle hosts two centres of excellence. I do not think that is matched anywhere else in the country. Having two centres of excellence in a regional university is a great tribute to the efforts of the staff and the management of the university. The university deserves a better deal.
Today is the eve of national industrial action by university staff. I must register my support for their protest. It is not acceptable that this government has tied $404 million under the Commonwealth Grants Scheme to acceptance by universities of its divisive and combative approach to industrial relations. The minister says that he requires his universities to be compliant with the government's workplace relations policies and to accept his precondition that AWAs should be made available to each and every individual. His requirement that no encouragement be given to union membership and that no restrictions or limitations be placed on the forms and mix of employment types is quite unnecessary and has little to do with education. Universities rightly decide these issues themselves and should continue to do so. Fortunately, all vice-chancellors have opposed this attempt to undermine the conditions of their staff and the activities of their union, the National Tertiary Education Union. Enterprise bargaining already takes place in these institutions with little unrest and a great deal of cooperation.
In concluding , the Australian public are fed up with the paternalistic arrogance of the minister for education, Brendan Nelson. Most Australians want to live in a fair and decent country where we can look each other in the eye as equals, have some spiritual comfort from knowing we all contribute to making our country strong and clever and at least try to give everyone a chance to succeed. I strongly oppose the Higher Education Support Bill 2003 and the related bill.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Bevis, Arch, MP",ALP,2003-10-15,"—I join with my Labor colleagues in strongly opposing the Higher Education Support Bill 2003 and Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amend-ments) Bill 2003 which are before the parliament. The Howard-Costello government's arrogant and elitist attitude towards education and training is one of this nation's great hidden tragedies, the effects of which will linger for a generation. The Prime Minister John Howard's boast some years ago, that he was the most conservative leader the Liberal Party has ever had, is evidenced more than amply in the Higher Education Support Bill and the government's approach to education and training. How ironic that we are having this debate in this chamber on the very day that science meets parliament, the very day on which some of our leading academics, scientists and researchers are here to meet with us and to impress upon us as members of parliament, if we needed it—and clearly those on the government benches do—the importance of investing in our future, our knowledge base, our creativity and our people. How ironic that on that day we have before us a bill that runs counter to all of those ideals. 
I was taken by the information given to me at one of those meetings that graphically sets out the way in which our investment in education and training and in research and development has declined so badly since John Howard became Prime Minister. Most members of this parliament will have an opportunity to see the graph that I am holding; unfortunately, the standing orders do not allow me to have it included in Hansard. It depicts very capably Australia's commitment to research and development over the course of the last 10 years. It shows Australia's performance in investment as a percentage of our gross domestic product steadily increasing year on year. Not surprisingly, it peaks in 1995-96—the year of the last Labor budget. From there on, it slides down. It is measured against the OECD average. In 1995 our performance was above that of the OECD average. It took this government just two budgets to drop us below the OECD average.
Of direct relevance to this bill, elsewhere in that document is a graph depicting the amount of money as a percentage of GDP that we put into higher education. From 1996 until the present, it has declined every year. Each year there has been a new decline on the decline of the previous year; that is, every year since John Howard became Prime Minister, the priority that has been given to higher education and to research and development in this country has declined. What a disgrace. Worse than that, it is a tragedy for our nation and our nation's future. The wealth of this country in the years ahead will be built on the creativity and intellectual property that we are able to generate. In the 18th and 19th centuries, countries that were wealthy found their wealth from what they could dig from the ground or grow from the plains. Those days are behind us. The wealthy nations of the future will generate their wealth from the intelligence, creativity and intellectual rigour of their people.
It is not possible to spend too much money on education and training. You can waste money—you can waste a little bit. You can spend a little bit and waste it all. But it is not possible to have a population that is too well educated, too well trained and too knowledgeable. Yet here we are as one of the few countries in the OECD reducing our commitment to education and training and, in this bill, to higher eduction, where our scientific advancements and so much of the economic fruit of the century ahead lie. This bill seeks to do that and more.
Each year in Australia 20,000 qualified Australians miss out on studying at university. That is a tragedy—a tragedy for them and for all of us. The government's own figures show that the number of Australians starting an undergraduate degree has dropped for two years running, and the OECD tells us that Australia now has the second lowest increase in the rate of enrolments in universities across the entire OECD. These are not statistics of which we can be proud. If the government has its way, after 2007 publicly funded places will not even keep pace with population growth. That is going to be a major challenge in my home state of Queensland, where the population growth is very substantial indeed—something which is drawn to our attention by redistributions in that state every couple of years as the state gets a new seat in this parliament. In Queensland, the fact that the Commonwealth will not even be funding enough places to cover growth means that young people, particularly in my home state, will be denied access to university places. Yet the government proposes to put in place full fee paying students and increase HECS to increase the burden on those who can get there. An increase in HECS fees of 30 per cent means that some students are going to be lumbered with a HECS debt of $50,000. An arts degree will cost $15,000; science, $21,000; and law, $41,000. 
But you can buy a degree under this government's plan. If your academic performance is not good enough to earn you a place at university, the government wants to let you buy a position if you are wealthy enough to do so. We need to put to rest one of the arguments that the minister has used and that a number of government backbenchers—the few who bothered to speak on this important matter—also raised. They referred to the fact that there are people who fall just short of whatever the cut-off might be in the various states and that they should not be denied the opportunity to buy themselves a place, because there are people from overseas who can buy themselves a place.
There are a couple of clear distinctions that need to be made. The people from overseas who buy themselves a place have not been paying taxes in this country like every other Australian pays taxes. But the real test is not the comparison of that Australian child who just fails to make the cut-off with an overseas full fee paying student. The real comparison is between the two Australian children who both get identical academic results just below the cut-off, one of them in a wealthy family, one of them in a low- or middle-income family. One of them is given a second bite at the cherry—the one who is rich enough to fork out the $100,000-plus. This is not a test of equity, fairness or ability. This is purely and simply a test of wealth. You are rewarded for your wealth. You are rewarded not for your intellect, for your industry or for the future contribution you can make, but just because you happen to be lucky enough to have wealthy parents. When John Howard said he was the most conservative leader the Liberal Party has ever had I did not think it went that far, but we know now it does. This is a reversal of every fundamental principle of education and equity that this nation has embraced on both sides of politics for 30 years.
I am just old enough to remember the system before that—the system John Howard wants to put back in place. I finished my secondary education in 1971. I started tertiary education in 1972. Thankfully, Gough Whitlam was elected at the end of that year and tertiary education immediately got an injection of funds and support. When I did my secondary education I was fortunate enough to get a state and a Commonwealth scholarship, without which it would have been very difficult to believe I could have done tertiary studies. I came from a family with a father who was a truck driver on a low income. I grew up in an area where you did not go to the dentist, because you did not have enough money; you went to the dental hospital for the students to practise on. People in that situation did not have the option of going to university unless they were fortunate enough to snare a scholarship, and I was fortunate to snare one of those scholarships.
I was so proud as an Australian to see Gough Whitlam change that system—so proud to see that turned on its head and merit put in place and to know that my children would have an opportunity to realise their academic and personal potential based on how they applied themselves and the abilities they had, not on my bank account or wealth. I have been proud ever since of that fact in our system. I find it disgusting that we now have a government that wants to revert to the system which I knew when I was a school student—a system that says, `You may not have the academic performance to earn your place, but as long as mum and dad have $100,000 ready to pay out you can get yourself a degree.' That is the test that needs to be applied when we look at this, and it is remarkable that any government in this day and age would do that. 
I have cited but a couple of statistics to refer to the declining priority this government has given to education, training and research and development. Sadly, there is insufficient time in this shortened debate for me to go through the other examples that illustrate that. But in conclusion I do want to make one other comment, and it is that this government has an infatuation and blind obsession with pursuing its industrial relations policies. It is forcing a very prescriptive industrial relations straitjacket on universities and saying to universities, `If you don't do what Peter Reith, Tony Abbott and John Howard want you to do'—because it has all been the same agenda—`then you do not get $400 million.' That is nothing short of intimidation and standover tactics. If it were somebody outside the parliament threatening that, they would be in breach of even this government's industrial relations laws. The only reason it can do it is because it is the government. That is a disgrace. The government has not told the truth about the details of the issues that it is imposing upon the universities. The minister did not tell the full truth in relation to that matter in his second reading speech. The details have been included in other material from Labor members, and unfortunately time will not permit me to go through them in relation to these bills. I am opposed to the legislation and I look forward to its defeat in the Senate.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Livermore, Kirsten, MP",ALP,2003-10-15,"—I stand in this chamber today with a great number of my Labor colleagues to protest against the Higher Education Support Bill 2003 and the Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003 and everything they represent in terms of how the Howard government sees this country and the direction in which it seeks to take it. Every person in this chamber—and especially in the Senate—who is here to advocate and preserve the Australian `fair go' and to stand up for equity in this country must vote against these bills. And those who vote for them should stand condemned.
These bills continue the Howard government's sevenyear attack on universities. Since taking up office in 1996, this government has cut $5 billion from Australian universities. This has had an enormous impact on our universities' ability to meet demand for places and to deliver the high-quality education that students in this country deserve and that this country as a whole needs if it is to prosper into the future. Five billion dollars is an enormous figure, and you need to break it down and cast your mind over what that means in real terms. Think just for a moment about the number of places that it represents—the number of university places denied to students who are otherwise eligible to undertake tertiary study. Think about the number of crowded lecture halls and tutorial rooms that that $5 billion figure represents. Think just for a moment about the number of researchers and academics who have taken their capacity and innovations overseas and stayed there as a result of this massive cut to our tertiary education sector.
The measures contained in these bills will be incredibly destructive to the higher education sector in this country. They will also be destructive to the future hopes of this nation, both at an individual level and collectively. They fail to invest in universities, despite the fact that Australia is falling dangerously behind on every international measure of public investment in higher education and research. We only need to look at the OECD figures and where Australia stands in terms of international benchmarks and comparisons of public investment in universities to see that our competitiveness and our future prosperity is being compromised by this government's failure to invest properly in our university sector. 
These measures will take higher education in this country back decades and return universities to the rich—and that is what really stands out in this bill. The Howard government's claim to stand up for the battlers in this country or for anyone other than the rich in this country is completely laid bare in these bills. As a result of these measures, a university education for those students who earn their places through hard work and application will no longer be a right but a privilege. It will be the exclusive preserve of those who can afford fees of tens of thousands of dollars plus the living expenses associated with full- or even part-time study.
This is very much exposed when you look at specific measures in the bill. The first I will speak to is the proposal to allow universities to increase HECS fees by up to 30 per cent. We have seen already what the government's changes, introduced to the HECS system in 1996—with their increased student debt levels and increased HECS debts—have done to participation rates in universities. These measures, which would allow universities to charge an extra 30 per cent on HECS fees for some of their courses, will have a huge impact on potential students in Australia. They will particularly impact on people coming from low- and average-income families.
The proposed increase in fees gets potential students from ordinary families coming and going. First of all, the prospect of higher fees will discourage students from lower income families from setting their sights on a university education. That has been shown by the Department of Education, Science and Training's own research in a study conducted by Richard James and published in 2002: Socioeconomic Background and Higher Education Participation: An analysis of school students' aspirations and expectations. That research shows that students from low-income families are totally turned off the idea of higher education or tertiary study when they think about the prospect of racking up enormous HECS debts. So those students are discouraged in the first place from participating in higher education.
This particularly affects Central Queensland University, the main campus of which is based in my electorate. It has nine campuses, but its main one is in Rockhampton in my electorate. CQU has a very high proportion of students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and, even more significantly, a very high proportion of students who are undertaking tertiary study for the first time; they are the first members of their family to take on higher education. They come from a background where there are already barriers to their participation in higher education. Measures like this, where we are talking about $30,000, $50,000 and $100,000 degrees, will have an enormous impact on the aspirations of students in my electorate who otherwise might have set their sights on a university degree.
Central Queensland University also has a high proportion of Indigenous students who would be affected in similar ways and who, like students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, would see the prospect of those sorts of HECS debts as an enormous barrier to their participation in university. These measures mean not only that the rich get richer on an individual level but also that disadvantaged regions, when compared with metropolitan areas, have their disadvantage entrenched. Barriers are being put up and opportunities are being limited for people who need encouragement to participate in higher education—and we are also talking about regions that would benefit enormously from opening up and cultivating the capacity that exists for individuals living those regions, no matter what their particular financial background may be. 
So there is that element of discouraging students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, in the first place, from taking up study. Then, when they get there, they find themselves having to work excessive hours in part-time or even full-time jobs in order to survive while studying. That severely compromises their ability to achieve academically and, again, sets up the barrier to their participation in study in the first place. If they do take up a university place, students who do not have the luxury of their parents paying their way to go to university will have their academic achievements compromised while they are there. They will also find themselves saddled with massive HECS debts or, if they are forced to take the full fee paying route, an even higher debt incurring commercial rates of interest when they leave university.
This package of measures shows this government's complete contempt for the aspirations and prospects of the majority of Australians who do not have thousands of dollars to spare for university fees. I will be voting against this legislation. I am very proud to join my Labor colleagues in standing up for equity and a fair go in this country. I want to assure students in my electorate, and the families who have aspirations for their children to undertake university study, that I will stand up for the right of those students to attend university if they get the results required to attend. The Labor Party have always stood up for equity, and that commitment to equity has always been manifested in our support for higher education—higher education based on merit, not on ability to pay.
The government's policy is simply to make Australians pay more for university education. That will seriously limit the capacity of so many deserving individuals in this country and will in the end hold back this country and undermine our ability to be competitive and successful on the world stage. But, more than anything, I am here to stand up for the rights of students in my electorate to attend university if they get the results required to be there and to be supported through Austudy while they undertake their studies and through changes to the HECS repayment system after they graduate. I oppose these bills and I call on the Senate to stick up for the people in my electorate by also opposing these measures.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Corcoran, Ann, MP",ALP,2003-10-15,"—The importance of education cannot be overstated. It is important for our society and it is important on an individual level. Australia needs more people undertaking higher education. As a society we need more people in higher education and, from a concern about the wellbeing of individuals, we need more people to have access to higher education. We need this to become and to remain competitive globally. On an individual basis education is important as it is the key to individual prosperity and a circuit-breaker of ongoing poverty.
The Higher Education Support Bill 2003 and the Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amend-ments) Bill 2003 are excellent examples of the differences between the policies of this government and the alternatives offered by the Labor Party. The government's response to the need for more people in universities and TAFEs is to introduce full fee paying places, increase the HECS fees for those lucky enough to get into university with a HECS place and limit the time a HECS student can spend at university. In other words, the government's response is to shift the cost of higher education from the public purse to the students and their families and so deny many young people their right to higher education. The Labor Party's response is to create 20,000 new full- and part-time undergraduate places every year by 2008, create 20,000 new full- and part-time TAFE places, abolish full fees for Australian undergraduates, not increase HECS fees, increase the HECS repayment threshold to $35,000 from July 2004 and not limit the time a student can spend at university in a HECS place. 
I have heard the argument that education, particularly university education, is not of interest to many people, least of all those on low incomes. This is not my experience. I have met many parents who have not had the benefit of completing secondary school themselves and who have certainly not seen the inside of a university, yet they go to extraordinary lengths to ensure their children get a good education. These parents define a good education as certainly finishing secondary school, with further education at TAFE or university as the goal. These parents understand that education is the key to their child's material success and to their fulfilment as a person.
It is very disappointing then that these bills do not do anything to make higher education more accessible to the general population but actually reduce or remove accessibility for many people. Right now too many school leavers who want to go to university are not getting there, and the reason is a lack of places. There are now 20,000 fewer fully funded university places than there were seven years ago in 1996. This means that this year 20,000 people who had the qualifications for entry into a university course—and the interest in doing so—have missed out, and 15,000 people have missed out on a TAFE place. This is a waste of our resources from a community and economic point of view and it is devastating for the young people involved. As a nation we should be focused on using our resources to the best advantage. By using the depth of the family pocket as the criterion for entrance into university we are certainly not doing this.
The Howard government is just not creating enough fully funded university places. Universities will be forced to cut 8,000 HECS places by 2007 because of a lack of adequate funding. These cuts mean that more and more students will miss out on a place. The number of available places will not even keep pace with population growth, and this means that the proportion of Australians with a university education will diminish. Since 1996 the government has taken $5 billion out of the funding it gives to universities. Australia has recorded the largest drop of any OECD country in public investment in universities over five years—a drop of 11 per cent. In contrast, the OECD average was an increase of 21 per cent.
An international comparison of private funding for universities, originally conducted by the Productivity Commission, shows that the contribution Australian students and their families make to the cost of higher education is already among the highest in the developed world—and it is continuing to rise. At a time when most developed countries are increasing their public spending on higher education, Australia is pushing more and more of the cost onto the private purse and reducing its contribution.
Until this government came into office, HECS was about 20 per cent of the cost of a degree. Today it is around 40 per cent, and this legislation will allow that percentage to move even higher. Under this legislation universities will be allowed to increase HECS fees by another 30 per cent. It is acknowledged that it is reasonable to expect university students to contribute to their course costs and that the HECS system is a reasonable way of doing this, but it is only reasonable as long as the contribution is reasonable. 
I have heard a number of members opposite state that the argument that increasing the HECS debt is a real deterrent is a furphy, that debt is not or should not be a problem for students. My constituents are worried about taking on a debt that is way beyond their ability to pay within a reasonable space of time. The Howard government is always on about how bad debt is; it is constantly sniping at the Labor Party for incurring public debt. How can it say that debt is bad in government hands but okay in the hands of young people? The answer is of course that debt in itself is neither good not bad; it depends on the level of debt compared with the ability to pay and the reason the debt was incurred in the first place. Debt incurred to provide assets for future use is usually fine. We accept—in fact, we even encourage—our kids to buy a house funded by a mortgage provided that they can afford the mortgage repayments and still have a reasonable quality of life. The same goes for education. It is reasonable to go into debt to fund a university course provided the debt is reasonable and the repayments will not cripple the student later in life.
If one wants to take a technical economic cost-benefit analysis approach to higher education, I refer to a research paper by the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research in 2000 called Returns to investment in higher education. I should record here my indebtedness to the Parliamentary Library for this information. The research shows, using 1976 data—that is, before HECS was introduced—that the individual rate of return was 21.1 per cent while the social rate of return to the community was 16.3 per cent. The same calculations done using 1997 data—that is, after HECS was introduced but before the increases of recent years—showed the individual rate of return was 15 per cent and the social rate of return was 16.5 per cent, a more balanced allotment of costs showing that HECS was at about the right level.
But this has changed for the worse in recent years and will change again with this legislation. Higher education is just one more area in which this government is shifting the funding burden from the public to the private purse. If this legislation gets through parliament, one criterion for getting into university will be the depth of the family pocket. This legislation, unbelievably, allows and indeed encourages universities to offer those students who miss out on a HECS place a full fee place.
I recently spent some time with students at Patterson River Secondary College and these students made it very clear to me that this was not their idea of a fair education system. Current university students I have spoken to are similarly unimpressed. The point made by both groups of students is that many or most of them would not go to university if they had to pay full fees. How this is fair is a mystery to me and a mystery to these students. How it is even desirable is also a mystery. As a nation we should be doing all we can to get our best brains into university. And the best brains do not always have the deepest pockets. To run the risk of not taking the best advantage of our best resources is wasteful and short-sighted.
I have also heard the argument that runs along the lines of `Why should overseas students be able to buy their way into a university course while Australian students cannot?' Let me just make one point in response to that argument: why should Australian students have to buy into a course at all? All Australians pay their taxes and will contribute to our society. We should be able to offer university places to all students that qualify on academic grounds. All Australian students should have an equal opportunity to get into a university course. The ALP's policy is very clear on this point: there will be no full fee undergraduate places in our universities and we will significantly increase the number of HECS places. 
This legislation also seeks to restrict the time a student can spend at university on HECS to five years. This is in a situation where Australian students already spend less time at university than those of any other country in the OECD. According to the education minister's own figures, only four per cent of students at university last year already had an undergraduate degree. This means that a very small number of people are furthering their education. This is alarming in an era where continuing education is becoming a necessity.
All in all, this bill is at best a backward step in providing for our future as a nation and in providing for the futures of our individuals. At worst it is a blatant attempt to create an unfair and wasteful education system—unfair because it will mean access to a university place is based on financial rather than academic credentials of students, and wasteful because it will mean that we are not necessarily educating those with the highest potential, which is a waste from a nation-building point of view and grossly unfair on individuals. In an era when we are becoming more and more reliant on knowledge, skills and research and development for our nation's growth and economic survival we are denying many capable students a place at university or TAFE. I will close on a comment which is not my own but which I have heard a few times before: if you think higher education is expensive, try ignorance.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Hatton, Michael, MP",ALP,2003-10-15,"—I am happy to join my colleagues on this side arguing for the extensive list of amendments that have been moved by the shadow minister and arguing against the main elements of the government's bill. The Higher Education Support Bill 2003 and the Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003, showing the government's approach to higher education reform, which I would call `change' rather than `reform', and Labor's approach to that in attempting to amend these bills here—and no doubt we will lose here, but we will attempt to amend them in the Senate—demonstrate that there are fundamental lines of cleavage between the coalition government and the Labor opposition.
 (Mr Lindsay)—I interrupt the member for Blaxland's speech. The question was that the bill be read a second time. You referred to amendments moved by the shadow minister. For your information, there have not been any amendments moved by the shadow minister.
—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I mean those foreshadowed to be moved in the Senate on our behalf and on behalf of the shadow minister. Those lines of cleavage are clear and dramatic. They are clear in higher education as they are clear, and made forcefully dramatic, in terms of the approach to Medicare and bulk-billing. No-one in the Australian community could be under any illusion whatsoever about the fact that the government's approach is entirely opposite to that taken by Labor on Medicare and so it is with higher education.
With these bills, the government seeks to remake higher education for the worse. But, in its time-honoured fashion since 1996, when the government comes up with a set of new proposals as part of a package, the marketing is all. The propagandising that can be done on the basis of that is the fundamental driver in terms of the way the government presents things. 
These bills largely give effect to the package that the government put forward, after about a year of review, called Backing Australia's Future. It is a wonderful phrase, isn't it—backing Australia's future. You would have to ask who could gainsay any package that was prefaced in that way. Rather than the way in which it is put, I would say that the measures taken in these bills collectively would in fact back Australia into the future. We would not be walking into it bold-faced and openly; we would not be walking into an expansion of opportunity for Australian students from whatever background, however unequal the circumstances were. We are facing a government intent on backing Australia into the 21st century and, as with so many of the predispositions of the Prime Minister and this government, intent on trying to drag Australia, kicking and screaming or willingly or unwillingly, back into some nether region or nether century, such as the 19th century, when things were simpler—when the Master and Servant Act operated and when higher education was allowed only to the very few.
This government seeks to fundamentally fracture the compact of the Australian people about the importance of higher education and its open capacity to be provided to everyone in Australia who is capable of satisfying the entrance requirements. This government would effectively reward those people who have the money to purchase their way into university. I well remember those people who had that capacity while I was at the University of New South Wales—those people who spent a decade or more wandering around the university doing course after course because they had the money to do it. Entry was denied at that university to those people who had an equal or greater ability but who could not get into a course because the places were being taken by the people who had the money to keep themselves there.
The fundamental plank of this bill, and really what the government seeks, is to deregulate tuition charges for Australian undergraduate students for the first time in nearly 30 years and allow universities to determine their fees within limits. That limit can be increased by ministerial determination. You have to ask yourself: would you trust this particular Minister for Education, Science and Training with regard to this? Would you say that if you allowed him the regulatory power to raise that amount that that would not happen in future years if this government were still in power? In fact, would you trust any of the ministers for education of this coalition government not to do that?
I would think that that is not the case. That is why Labor have proposed amendments, which will be put to the Senate, to remove the 30 per cent increase in HECS fees that is proposed. We also propose—and this is an interlocking step—to increase the HECS repayment threshold to $35,000 in 2004-05. This is based on a question of equity and it is also based on an appreciation of the inequalities between people, but the fundamental test is: what is a person's ability to pay at the end of their university education? In fact, if you look at all the budgets since 1996, you will see there has effectively been a doubling of the full fee places in terms of what is required with regard to HECS. People have been required to pay much more and also to pay much earlier.
When the Howard government came to office, they cut the threshold from $28,495 to $20,700 in 1997-98. Labor think that that is wrong. They think that, because people are carrying that burden at that low an income level, coming straight out of university with the other impacts on them, this needs to be readjusted. So we will move—and there is wide support within the community and from the higher education sector for this—for that threshold to be lifted to $35,000 because the fundamental principle when we introduced HECS was that people's capacity to pay had to be taken into account and people would not be forced to start to pay until they were in a position to be able to do so. 
The cleavages that are apparent in the Medicare area and the higher education area are very strong and very apparent. They go to a fundamentally different philosophical approach to higher education and its place and importance for Australia. Labor believe in public investment in higher education. We believe in public investment in the public sector and we believe in public investment in the university sector. Since 1996, when this government came into office, we have seen an erosion of our higher education sector, deliberately and determinedly put into place by this government.
The government have put the university sector into a situation where they have had to beg and plead with the government to return moneys that have been taken from them that could have been used for the further advancement of the university and their teaching role with young Australians. The universities are being denied that money. I think it is in the order of something like $8 billion from 1996. I may stand corrected on that, but from memory that is the case. The universities are in a position where they have realised that they will not get another zack out of this government because these bills demonstrate what the future is for Australian universities. If you are a sandstone university, you will be allowed to raise your fees. You will be able to raise HECS as much as you want until you get to the 30 per cent level. But beyond that the minister can exercise his discretion.
You can see the argument developing over time: here are the Australian universities approaching the government and demonstrating that the income they have is insufficient—because they have already done that over the past number of years; even the Group of Eight has done that year after year. They will be putting the case that they need extra money in order to function. What minister in the coalition would therefore be able to deny them an increase in HECS charges? They would argue that an equal approach to these things means everybody's HECS charges should be increased. 
This approach fundamentally hamstrings Australian higher education in the future. This government is not just about determinedly eroding what is there already but about trying to make a cash-and-carry approach to higher education, as it has in Medicare and a range of other areas. If you have got the cash, you will carry the entitlement away. If you have got the cash, you will take the diploma. If you have got the cash, you will take the university degree. I had 10 minutes and I have finished my time, but I completely condemn what is being done in these bills and will support Labor's amendments as they come through.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"McMullan, Bob, MP",ALP,2003-10-15,"—In speaking on the Higher Education Support Bill 2003 and the Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003 I want to focus on two things. Firstly, I briefly want to focus on the impact on the tertiary sector here in the ACT, particularly in my own electorate of Fraser, and then, more particularly, on the continued failure of the Howard government to address the education needs of Indigenous Australians. If passed, these bills will have the same damaging impact on tertiary education in the ACT as across the country. The impact in the ACT will not be particular but will simply be greater because higher education is very important here. My constituency has more higher education institutions than any other constituency in Australia. 
The ACT has already suffered severely from reductions in funding, from Howard government policy, since 1996. The Australian National University has accumulated funding cuts of $190.5 million until 2002 and the University of Canberra has taken a hit of $123.5 million. There have been similar negative impacts on the ACT campuses of the Australian Catholic University and Charles Sturt University. The effect of these government policies has been to increase staff-student ratios by more than 25 per cent, and each year nearly 300 eligible students from the ACT and the region who want to enrol cannot do so because there are insufficient funded places.
I know and accept that the Howard government does not care about Canberra. My constituents and those of my colleague the member for Canberra commit the continuing sin of voting for the Labor Party, so they do not expect to get fair treatment from the government. But I advise the Howard government that the ACT's higher education sector serves a much wider region. These changes will be felt by people living on the South Coast and in Yass, Goulburn, Wagga and Griffith and in the many other communities which see Canberra as their primary higher education service centre. Therefore, as the local member, I express my profound concern about the compounding impact of this package, on top of the damage that has already been done to higher education in the ACT since 1996.
In the limited time remaining, I want to turn to the importance of education generally, and higher education in particular, for Indigenous Australians. It is a similar picture. This package will compound a problem already made worse by the adverse impact of the changes made since 1996. Let us start with the most fundamental position: education is the bottom line for all policies and initiatives to reduce the appalling levels of Indigenous disadvantage in Australia and to enable greater Indigenous self-government, self-determination and responsibility in the future.
The Howard government talks about Indigenous people and communities taking responsibility and working towards practical reconciliation, but the reality is that the Howard government has failed to fundamentally address the major practical policy area that could turn the rhetoric of `responsibility' into reality for Indigenous Australians—that is, education policy. The Howard government has in the past and still is today—through measures including this very package of legislation we are dealing with now—actively introducing cuts and changes to policy that make access to higher education for Indigenous students more and more difficult. After all—and sadly and ironically—it is the current minister for Indigenous affairs who executed the massive $1.8 billion cut to higher education when she was the minister for education.
In relation to the particular area I am concerned about in today's address—Indigenous education—the minister was warned. But, against all the advice and warnings from the Indigenous community, from independent commentators, from academic analysts at Deakin University, from the National Tertiary Education Union and from the National Union of Students, Senator Vanstone went ahead with these drastic cuts. It was predicted at the time that almost 95 per cent of Indigenous students in higher education would be disadvantaged by the changes. Just think about it: a minister is advised that the changes she is proposing will disadvantage 95 per cent of Indigenous students in higher education, and she goes ahead with them. Sure enough, Indigenous enrolments fell by 14 per cent in just two years, from 1999 to 2001, falling back to pre-1995 levels and wiping out steady gains made in enrolments during the mid-1990s. 
While higher education enrolments for Indigenous students have picked up very slightly in the past year, I believe we are only now beginning to see the long-term impact of Senator Vanstone's cuts. One area in which this is disturbingly clear is the dramatically declining number of Indigenous students commencing degrees in education. In 1997, the president of the Australian Councils of Deans of Education, Professor Adey, wrote to the minister and expressed the following concerns:
I am writing to you to express the grave concern which the ACDE—
that is, the Australian Council of Deans of Education—
has with the changes ... announced in the May budget ...
The letter goes on to highlight one of the most serious consequences the ACDE foresaw:
The long term reduction in the provision of qualified Indigenous teachers, especially for remote Indigenous communities.
In that letter, the ACDE then urged the minister `to reverse the decisions of the May budget' so that `access by Indigenous people to tertiary education is not diminished'. Sadly, I can advise the minister that the latest figures released by her department show that this is exactly what has happened. The number of Indigenous Australians commencing degrees in education has dropped from 1,224 in 1997 to 826 in 2002. That is a significant drop—33 per cent over five years—and it is in stark contrast to the 45 per cent rise in Indigenous education commencements in the five years before that, under a Labor government. As I have said already: how can the government possibly claim to be working towards practical reconciliation and greater responsibility—for example, with regard to substance abuse and family violence—when they are not even bothering to ensure there is a sufficient number of Indigenous teachers who can appropriately educate the rest of the Indigenous population, empower them to take on more responsibility and encourage them to be proud and effective Indigenous leaders?
I spoke recently at a business forum in Perth, and the forum was looking at how government and business can work together to close the gap of shame between Indigenous and non-Indigenous living standards. The businesspeople were very positive. I was encouraged by what they had to say. But it became clear on that day that it is impossible for business to maximise the employment of Indigenous Australians if the Australian government does not invest sufficiently in education. Education outcomes for Indigenous Australians are already far behind the national average. A vital element of any program to overcome these differential outcomes is an increase in the number of Indigenous teachers.
So what do we have? First, we have a minister for Indigenous affairs who is the very minister who put in place the policies and reforms that did the damage. Second, today we have a package of higher education legislation which is increasing HECS fees and forcing the universities to cut thousands of HECS funded university places. Higher university fees and greater HECS debts are the last things that Indigenous Australians, struggling against great odds to get a higher education, need. And, to compensate, all that the Howard government has to offer is a higher education scholarship scheme that lumps Indigenous students in with all other students in lower socioeconomic circumstances. Of course, scholarships for students from disadvantaged backgrounds are necessary, but this very modest proposal will not overcome the adverse impact of these and previous Howard government changes. In the Sydney Morning Herald recently, ACOSS noted: 
Fewer than one in five poor or indigenous Australians will receive a scholarship to help finance their university studies under the Federal Government's planned shake-up of higher education ...
Even with its narrow focus on so-called practical reconciliation, a growing population of Indigenous people who have difficulty articulating the practical needs and responsible ideas of their communities is the last thing the Howard government wants. There is no way that we can give Indigenous people a real say and lift their standards effectively without addressing the current educational disadvantage faced by Indigenous Australians. I agreed to limit my speech to 10 minutes, so I cannot outline the extent of that disadvantage, but let me just say that they are behind. A report released and available today from the Centre for Aboriginal Economic Policy Research says that in education, as in other vital areas, the relative disadvantage of Indigenous Australians is getting worse.
There is no effective redress to this crisis, this gap of shame, without more Indigenous teachers. A good teacher can overcome many of the negative effects caused by the problems and barriers facing Indigenous children. A good teacher can improve a student's learning. The data available shows clearly that the current strategy in this respect is failing. The training of Indigenous teachers is declining, not improving. Everything in this bill will make this problem worse. Nothing in it will seriously address our status as the worst country in the Western world with regard to this gap of shame between the living standards of Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. That is why we need to reject this unfair package. It is bad for the higher education system. It is bad for low- and middle-income families. It will exacerbate the looming crisis in Indigenous education just when we need positive action to combat this crisis.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Sawford, Rod, MP",ALP,2003-10-15,"—I have spoken many times on transport issues in this House, but the best transport policy of all is a properly funded education system that provides access to higher education to everyone who needs it, on the basis of ability. That is because a good education system can transport young people from dead-end jobs and low incomes to lives rich in potential and optimism, and this in turn has enormous economic and social benefits for our nation as a whole.
Yet in South Australia last year, around 1,400 young people who had worked hard to achieve scores sufficient to undertake tertiary education were denied the opportunity by the Howard government's cuts to higher education. According to the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, the national total of young people denied access to higher education because of insufficient funding is around 25,000. The University of Adelaide's Vice-Chancellor, James McWha, says that South Australia could lose 2,000 HECS places under the government's legislation currently before the House.
This legislation—the Higher Education Support Bill 2003 and the Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003—ironically called the higher education support bills, would cause enormous harm to universities and to tertiary students now and in coming years. Chopping 2,000 HECS places, including around 1,100 at Adelaide University, may not seem a big deal to the minister or to the bureaucrats here in Canberra. To them it might be just a number on a page but, to young people and their families who have worked hard and sacrificed much to gain the scores to open the doors to higher education, it means a great deal more. 
Letters to the Adelaide Advertiser, in response to a recent piece by the minister, make the important points very succinctly. For example, a year 10 student at Mitcham Girls High School, Lindsey Webb of Edwardstown, says that the government's legislation to increase HECS and charge students $50,000 for a degree would necessarily make her reconsider her options. She says that private school students, who are generally from higher income backgrounds, could take most HECS spots and leave those from lower income backgrounds with no choice other than to pay full fees for a degree. This, as Lindsey points out, is unfair. 
That unfairness is amplified by another section of this legislation that increases the number of full fee paying places at the expense of HECS places. Emily Davis from the Flinders University Students Association highlights the irony of the minister's claim that he is providing students with more opportunities. He is providing, as she writes, `More opportunities to pay $50,000 for their degrees.' She also notes with irony that the minister's higher education qualifications, from which he has benefited mightily, cost him not a cent. That is because he was a beneficiary of Labor's reforms some decades ago which dramatically increased access to higher education according to merit, not ability to pay. It is those reforms that the government has been busily overturning since coming to office in 1996.
Another letter writer, James Frazer of Darlington, focuses on how the government has shifted the cost of higher education from government to students. He presents figures to show that student fees and contributions have doubled in this time to the point where the federal government now contributes just 40 per cent of the cost of a degree. Elicia Savvas of Glandore, in her letter, provided the minister with a helpful suggestion that the government `dip into the $7 billion surplus to restore some of the $5 billion it has stripped from universities since 1996'. That the government has made severe cuts to higher education funding since 1996 is a matter of public record and it is very well known to South Australian families, as the correspondence to the Adelaide Advertiser testifies.
What is now also on the public record is the deleterious impact these cuts continue to have on student aspirations and opportunities. For example, according to the OECD, Australia now has the second lowest rate of increase of enrolment in universities of all member countries. How dumb is that! How could you blame students for reconsidering their options when the option of higher education debt takes on the crushing proportions of home loans. For students from higher income backgrounds this may not be so much of a concern because they often have family assistance to settle the debt. It is those from lower income families, as usual, who will bear the brunt of the Howard government's funding cuts. They are the ones who face repayment of the debt from their pay packets for most of their working lives. The one thing this country does not need is talented people forgoing higher education because they cannot afford it, yet that is exactly what the OECD figures show is happening. This is a shocking indictment of the government, especially as the decline in the rate of student enrolment is happening at a time of strong economic growth in this country and around the world. We are falling behind our competitors. 
That this legislation before the House would deny 2,000 South Australians their hard-earned right to undertake tertiary study is bad enough. But the news for those who still manage to gain a place is no better, with the provision to allow a 30 per cent increase in HECS fees heading the list of charges that may deter people from undertaking higher education. The HECS fees increase will again fall heavily on those from lower income backgrounds because HECS debts mean a lot more to them than they do to those from well-heeled backgrounds. The well-heeled are also looked after by the government's legislation with the proposed increase in full fee paying places, places that come at the direct cost of HECS positions. This provision to give an unjust leg-up to tertiary qualifications for the well-heeled was one of the first things the Howard government did when it came into office in 1996. Those well-heeled students—the BMW and Volvo drivers—gain entry with scores of five university admission index points lower than HECS students by paying fees of up to $100,000 for a degree. These places come directly at the expense of HECS places. That is, better qualified students get bumped out of a higher education place by students who are less qualified but have a fatter wallet—or their daddy's or mummy's share portfolio.
The enormity of the injustice of this provision, despite being matched by other Howard government legislation over the years, remains staggering. It is a provision that panders directly to the Liberal Party's big end of town constituency and its born to rule mentality. That constituency has been pandered to again with the legislation currently before the House, which increases the cap on the number of full fee paying students from 25 per cent to 50 per cent. That is, the legislation would allow for half—this is absolutely incredible—of all undergraduates to be full fee paying students. Currently, about 3,500 full fee paying students commence study each year, denying better qualified students a university place. This bill also allows the minister to exempt entire courses from this limit without having to come back to parliament for approval, a sign that the injustice will become more commonplace in the future and less scrutinised.
All Australian citizens who want to should have an equal opportunity to earn a university degree. It is almost the definition of injustice to have students from wealthy families taking the place of others who are better qualified. I am proud to say that we on this side of the House will, when we win government—and we surely will—restore merit as the only criterion for getting a university place and will abolish full fees for Australian undergraduates. The government's failure to provide sufficient support for the university education sector has caused the current dire situation. The OECD has determined that Australia's public investment in education has declined by 11 per cent.
—The member for Lindsay laughs, but she will be a casualty at a future election, make no mistake about that. In fact, on average, OECD countries have increased their public investment in universities, not decreased it—we are the only country that has not—and the average increase in OECD countries is 21 per cent. We have dropped it by 11 per cent. That is so dumb!
The impact of the government's continued withdrawal of funding from Australian universities is seen with overcrowded classrooms, insufficient student resources, deteriorating infrastructure and higher student to staff ratios—but the story is true for secondary education; it is also true for TAFE and primary schools. For example, the student to staff ratio at the University of South Australia has increased by 30 per cent since 1996, by 26 per cent at Adelaide University and by 20 per cent at Flinders. Put simply, this means that today's students can expect a lot less personal attention and assistance than students received just seven years ago. 
I am limited to 10 minutes with this particular address but, as I said earlier, a properly funded university system is the best transport system this country can have for young Australians. I said that this is so because there is no more important task for governments than to provide the avenues and the bridges that people need to realise their full potential—and that is in the best interests of everyone in this nation. The avenues and the bridges are the properly funded and resourced learning institutions, from primary schools through to universities and other tertiary centres of learning, both for young people and older people seeking retraining. Equally important is that access to each stage must be on the basis of merit and not on the ability to pay. It is entirely inconsistent with the basic tenets of the fair society we seek to build to have the wallet override merit. I ask the government to put justice and equal opportunity before politics and accept the amendments to make the legislation fair to everybody.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Sciacca, Con, MP",ALP,2003-10-15,"—I rise to speak on the Higher Education Support Bill 2003 and the Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003. When it comes to higher education policy, the Howard government has a staggering record of underachievement. It has overseen $5 billion worth of cuts for the university sector and over the last five years it has recorded the largest reduction in public investment in higher education in the OECD. These cuts have led to overcrowded classrooms, a skyrocketing student to teacher ratio, a lack of student support and inadequate infrastructure renewal and development.
But, on budget night last May, after years of neglect, we heard that the government was about to launch a reform package for our universities entitled Our Universities: Backing Australia's Future. Unfortunately, any glimmer of hope for a revitalised higher education sector was somewhat short-lived. As the details of the minister's package became available, it became obvious what reform would mean for young people in our local high schools considering their options for the future and adults looking for opportunities to expand or update their skills. It would mean higher fees for students with HECS places and the opening up of full fee places, and it would see 8,000 HECS places for talented students cut by 2007. The combined effect of this is to limit the choices available to young people in our community and others seeking to broaden their horizons. It will put them in a position whereby their career path and the way in which they are able to contribute to our community is determined not by their skills or their passions but by the size of their parents' wallets.
Student debt has more than doubled since this government came to power in 1996. Not content with this achievement, the Minister for Education, Science and Training now wants to give universities a free hand to increase HECS fees by up to 30 per cent. It will mean that those university students who do not have the capacity to pay their HECS up front will be significantly penalised. When those students graduate, they will not only be clutching a degree in their hand; they will also be presented with a hefty HECS debt. This will reduce their net income and therefore their capacity to save, and to put enough away for a deposit for their first home or to start a family, for many years after they enter the work force as they slowly repay not only their original HECS debt but also the additional six per cent interest this minister seeks to impose upon them. 
As a token gesture to the principles of access and equity, the Howard government does intend to provide Commonwealth Education Costs Scholarships as part of the package. This assistance will be available to full-time undergraduate Commonwealth-supported students from low socioeconomic and/or Indigenous backgrounds and will be worth $2,000 per year for up to four years. But, even by the time the scholarship program is fully implemented in 2007, this assistance will cover only 20 per cent of eligible students. This leaves 80 per cent of students from disadvantaged backgrounds with no additional means of support to cover the increased HECS debts that most of them will face.
Those who are fortunate enough to secure a scholarship will receive a maximum of $2,000 per year. As the new HECS arrangements could see HECS fees increase by more than $8,000 per year, the scholarships do not come close to covering the cost of a HECS based degree. Consequently, this measure will do little to increase the participation rate of students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Also, in its response to the government's plans, the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee suggested that the scholarships may count as income when assessing a student's entitlement to youth allowance, Abstudy or Austudy. So, once the combined work income and scholarship reaches the prescribed limit, students will have their entitlements reduced.
Is it any surprise that students who need assistance from Centrelink look like they will have to continue to get more headaches than help in their quest to receive the entitlements they are due? It certainly would not shock Glen Fowler, a young man from Lota in my electorate who, despite his concerted efforts to do the right thing by the Centrelink system, has been experiencing considerable difficulties with regard to his Austudy payments. When Glen enrolled for his first semester at TAFE, as a long-term income support recipient he was entitled to a special rate of Austudy, which amounted to around $360 a fortnight. He was of the belief that he was not entitled to continue to receive Austudy during the holidays, when he would be actively looking for work. So he visited Centrelink to advise of his change in circumstances and his Austudy payment was cancelled.
When he returned to TAFE at the beginning of semester 2 he reapplied for Austudy, but his entitlement was reduced to the basic rate on the grounds that he had not been on a payment from Centrelink for 26 out of the last 39 weeks. Glen was unfairly penalised to the tune of $50 a week because he tried to do the right thing and advise Centrelink of his intention to look for work during the holiday period.
—That's what you get for doing the right thing.
—Exactly. Many students need to work during their holidays to be able to afford to continue in their courses. Yet, under the Howard government's legislation, they are penalised for doing so, making it even more difficult for them to complete their studies.
The minister has devoted a lot of time to trying to divide the community on this important issue. He has told us time and time again that those who pursue careers that do not require a university education should resent the fact that their taxes go towards universities, from which they receive no direct benefit. But there are not many plumbers out there who would begrudge their taxes going to train those who will teach their children. You would be hard pressed to find a taxi driver who thinks it is unwise to invest public money in training more nurses to provide quality care for their elderly parents. 
The minister has also suggested that, because we support investment in universities, Labor undervalue the importance of vocationally based training through apprenticeships and TAFE. This is simply untrue. In fact, in its Aim Higher education policy, Labor have made a commitment not only to increase HECS positions at universities in the crucial areas of teaching and nursing but also to redress the skills shortages in key industries such as transport and metalwork by creating 20,000 new full-time and part-time TAFE places each year by 2008.
The opening up of universities and vocational training options is an important priority for Labor and for the community. In surveys of our area, education is continually listed, together with health care, as one of the highest priorities of voters in my electorate of Bowman. In a recent contribution to the Courier-Mail newspaper, the Vice-Chancellor of Griffith University, Glyn Davis, reflected on why more and more Queenslanders are looking to attend university or participate in vocational training. He wrote:
Leaving aside the intrinsic satisfaction of new knowledge, many industries now demand a tertiary qualification as the minimum entry standard. Year 12 students understand that, on average, graduates earn significantly more over their lifetime, experience significantly less unemployment and on the whole have more interesting jobs. As studies by the Australian National University have shown, higher incomes bring better-than-average health, longevity, opportunities to travel, participation in community and culture. Tertiary education in short provides access to a better life.
In its submission to the Senate inquiry into higher education funding and regulatory legislation, the Queensland University of Technology Student Guild set out its concern that accepting full fee students who have not achieved the required OP score to gain entry into a course would lead to a lowering of the overall standard of academic ability in the undergraduate population. Those students feel that the integrity of academic institutions could well be undermined if universities begin to accept academically incapable students simply because they have the capacity to pay. This would lead to a reduction in the value attached to university qualifications by the community. This would not only be disastrous for the reputation of Australian universities but would also have a devastating impact on those students who have worked hard to secure their place at university, as the quality of their degree would begin to be questioned.
Students are not the only ones targeted by this package. Tomorrow, administrative staff, cleaners, groundspeople and academic staff from the University of Queensland, QUT, the University of Southern Queensland and Griffith University will rally at Roma Street, joining an estimated 40,000 union members from around Australia in a 24-hour strike to protest against the federal government's higher education package and the provisions related to workplace relations and employment arrangements for staff in universities. Just over $400 million in funding in this package is tied to the implementation of a list of so-called workplace reforms three pages long in a push to reduce entitlements to maternity leave and redundancy pay and force university staff onto individual workplace agreements.
Higher education, be it at university or TAFE, is a privilege. It opens up opportunities for personal growth, academic development and earnings potential, but it should not be the sole domain of the privileged. Those opportunities should be available to Australians based on the size of their achievements not, as this package would have it, on the size of their wallets. ",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2003-10-15,"—I rise today to speak on the Higher Education Support Bill 2003 and the Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003. I was prompted when preparing for this legislation to have a look at the government's 1996 higher education package. I was, of course, hard pressed to find anything in this current legislation that relates even remotely to the 1996 commitments that this government made in relation to higher education. The government's higher education package, Our Universities: Backing Australia's Future, does nothing to address the problems that are already being experienced by Australian universities. Instead it makes university education less affordable and less accessible. Rich kids will be able to buy their way into Australian universities and poor kids will rely on noblesse oblige—they will be waiting for scholarships.
It is interesting that the Minister for Education, Science and Training often talks about how unfair it is that universities are supported with public funding because your average factory worker will never see the inside of a university. Well, my mum worked in a factory, and I do not think she begrudges any of her tax dollars going into the education system that supported her three children through university education. The sad thing about this package is that the sorts of children of factory workers that a decent publicly funded education system gives opportunities to will be locked out by this package.
The package also includes the government's old bugbears of voluntary student unionism and attacking the industrial provisions of academic and non-academic staff in universities. These are ideological obsessions of the government that have absolutely nothing to do with educational quality at Australian universities. Voluntary student unionism has been a project of this government since its election. The aim of it is, of course, to ensure that young people do not see the benefits of joining a union too early in life. We know that the sorts of services that student unions provide at universities are things like subsidised food, subsidised child care and subsidised sporting facilities, counselling services and student loans. The fact that they would make voluntary student unionism such a central part of their higher education agenda means that all of these things are obviously seen by the government as threats to civilisation as we know it.
The other area that the government has taken up in this package is that of tying funding to changes in industrial relations at a university level. Academic and non-academic staff are being told that they have to engage in individual bargaining and that they have to bargain away the conditions that they already have. From what I see from my visits to universities, academic and non-academic staff have been forced for many years to do a lot more with a lot less. They are already struggling with massively increased teaching loads and 30 per cent more students in most classes than just a few years ago. To add to their burdens, they are going to be told that they should all sign individual contracts, that their workplace security is being threatened and that extra funding is contingent on them bargaining away their industrial conditions—again, absolutely nothing to do with educational quality at institutions and all to do with the government's bizarre industrial relations agenda and its obsession with this area.
The contents of this package are so vastly different to what was promised in the area of higher education during the 1996 election campaign that I thought you would be interested to hear just how far the government have departed from their promises at that time. In fact, it might be simpler to go through and pick out what they have stuck to, because in the document that I looked at there was probably not a single truth in the whole document. The 1996 commitments included a commitment to: 
	Promote quality and excellence in both teaching and research dimensions.
They have not done that.
	Promote diversity and choice within the higher education sector.
They certainly have not done that.
	Support the development of regional universities.
The member for Lindsay has been foremost amongst those attacking the outer metropolitan universities and has certainly not won any friends at the University of Western Sydney in her own electorate by calling them a bunch of whingers, so they certainly have not done that. 
—It is interesting that Penrith Panthers are able to support the University of Western Sydney but their own local member is not. Anyway, the next commitment was to:
Maintain Commonwealth funding.
This is the best, I think. The government promised that they would, if elected, maintain Commonwealth funding. They have cut $5 billion out of the higher education sector. The burden has fallen on students through higher up-front fees and massive hikes in HECS fees. According to the OECD's Education at a glance: 2003 report, between 1995 and 2000 Australia's public investment in universities declined by 11 per cent. That is more than any other country in the OECD and it contrasts with an average OECD growth of 21 per cent. I think that the package would be more appropriately titled `Limbo learning: how low can we go'—lowest public investment and lower participation rates. Student fees now make up 40 per cent of the income of universities, which is up from 25 per cent in 1996. In contrast, Labor's pledge is to invest $2.34 billion in universities and TAFEs and improve the quality of university education through a new indexation measure that will deliver an extra $312 million to Australian universities between 2005 and 2007.
The coalition, when it was still the opposition, in the good old days, promised to:
Ensure student access.
The quote continues:
The Coalition is committed to ensuring that financial, social and geographic factors do not act as a barrier to higher education for appropriately qualified students.
In discussing HECS, it is important that the deferred payment is reasonable and not subject to sudden alterations.
The Coalition will oppose attempts by public universities to introduce pay-as-you go fees at the undergraduate level as an alternative to HECS.
The reality seven years on is so very different. Each year 20,000 qualified Australians miss out on studying at university. Student debt has doubled since the election of the Howard government, with contributions exceeding $9 billion, and student contributions to HECS have more than doubled since 1996. The government wants to allow universities to increase HECS fees by up to 30 per cent. You are looking at $15,000 for an arts degree, $21,000 for a science degree and $41,000 for a law degree. For degrees like vet science and law, the HECS fees could increase by over 240 per cent.
The coalition also promised in their pre-election commitments in 1996 that they would increase research funding. That is another broken promise. I quote:
Other opportunities for growth funds, such as through the commercialisation of research and direct support from alumni associations, will also be supported— 
That is not very controversial. I quote further:
Expansion of the revenue base must be to enhance quality. If a university compromises its independence or its intellectual honesty, the increased revenue will be counter-productive.
They certainly have not been interested in what the motivations are and what the consequences are of allowing the universities to rake in every spare dollar they can get from students. The only increase in research funding from this government occurred five years after they were elected, in 2001, and it was pretty insubstantial at that.
The government promised in their 1996 package to maintain HECS. They certainly have maintained it—they have maintained it and increased it, and they are looking at allowing it to increase again. They also said that they would maintain Austudy and Abstudy—that is a joke. The minimum age of independence was raised from 22 to 25. Labor will reduce that minimum age again. The reality is that most university students that I speak to now are so busy earning enough money just to get by, week to week, that they are dropping subjects, they are working part-time and their studies are suffering. The reason is that they have no access to any income support. Their families cannot afford it and the government are not prepared to give it to them. That is one of the things that constantly is raised with me. I know students who are working 40 hours a week and are trying to manage a full-time university load as well, because they cannot afford to be studying part-time at university for the next six or eight years either.
The coalition also promised in that 1996 document to:
... at least maintain the level of funding to universities, both in terms of operating and research grants.
That is so laughable. The document also said:
The coalition government will enhance the autonomy of each institution by being less prescriptive in relation to expenditure of public funding.
I attended a rally at the University of Sydney a couple of weeks ago, organised by the NTEU and the CPSU. Academic and non-academic staff were protesting against the government's proposal to link industrial bargaining conditions to extra funding in the university sector. The staff at that rally were talking about some of the hardships that they are already facing in their work. They are facing lecture theatres that are so crowded that they actually present a fire hazard. At the beginning of each year students spill out of lecture theatres, and it is a process of attrition. The students who can hack the crowd-ed, inappropriate lecture facilities might hang on a little bit longer into the semester than those students who drop off because the learning conditions are so absolutely inappropriate. Academic staff are already dealing with class sizes 30 per cent bigger than only a few years ago. The resources spent on things like books and periodicals for university libraries have been whittled away by the cuts to university funding. The idea that, if university staff will not sign on to the government's industrial relations agenda, extra funding will not be provided to universities is one of the worst pieces of blackmail that I have seen in some time.
The coalition policy in 1996 also suggested:
Good moral. A commitment to quality and excellence and a pride in the institution are all important ingredients in building a successful university.
That is something that we can all agree on, but it is certainly not something that this government has been able to deliver. In contrast, Labor have promised that we will allow university management staff and their union to be free to negotiate their own industrial arrangements, that we will provide extra funding for universities, that we will fund unfunded places, that we will make an extra 20,000 university places available to students, that we will prevent full fee university places and that we will stop any increase in HECS fees.

"Swan, Wayne, MP",ALP,2003-10-15,"—This matter needs to be discussed this week, because this is Anti-Poverty Week, and Friday is Anti-Poverty Day. Today in the parliament we saw just how out of touch and how arrogant this Prime Minister has become. We saw how he does not have a clue about what is going on in the lives of average Australians who go to work each day, come home, cook the tea, and get up and do it again—for relatively meagre rewards. He has not got a clue about their daily struggles. He came into this House and said that he had achieved a `golden double', and he talked about record low unemployment and record low inflation. That is very welcome. It was built largely on the work of prime ministers Hawke and Keating. But what is the flip side of this government's economic record? I can tell you: it is a quadrella of inequality that is making life extremely difficult for millions of Australians.
Let us consider this quadrella. First, there are 2.4 million Australians living below a very modest poverty line. In the case of a family of four, that is $416 a week—if they earn that or less, they are living below that poverty line. The Prime Minister does not walk in the same shopping aisles as those families. He has not got a clue what it is like to delay the car repairs when the car breaks down. He would not know what it was like to fill up a tank of petrol. He simply has not got a clue of what the struggle is like to pay the electricity bill. Second, and this is largely his creation, we have one million Australians in this country who go to work but still live below the poverty line. His great achievement in this country has been the creation of the working poor. Third, on top of that, despite record wealth creation in the last decade—despite the fact that wealth in this community has increased by 100 per cent in the last 10 years—we still have more people on benefits long term than we had eight years ago. Despite all the record job creation that his ministers talk about in this parliament, not a dent has been made in the number of people trapped on benefits long term—not one dent at all. 
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—The member for Lilley will address the chair.
—Last, we have the economic disaster of the government's family payment system, which is in the process of giving debts to the tune of at least $1.6 billion to over 1.5 million families over three years.
—The member for Lilley will address the chair. Turning his back is quite rude.
—It is an obscenity. When he was asked about this in the House today, he said there was nothing new about this—it has always been the case. But there is a lot that is new about it. From my memory—and remember this is the new tax system; this is their family payment system, created by them and boasted about in this House as being such a bonanza for families—the last number of debts that came in around that area of family payments under the previous system was 60,000. That is 60,000 families compared to 750,000 in the first year of operation of the government's family payment system.
—The member for Lilley will address the chair. 
—The member for Brisbane is warned!
—So much for the Prime Minister's golden double. This quadrella of inequality is proof that the record wealth creation in this community has not been fairly shared. What we really had today from all of the ministers—and we get it in the Senate—is Howard's credo. And what is Howard's creed? Howard's creed is the rich get richer, the poor get poorer and the middle get squeezed. That is what all of the figures show. We have had record wealth creation. It just has not been fairly shared. The truth is that this government believe growing inequality is a good thing. They think it is a good thing, and that is what they are saying in this House today. 
If you want to see what they are doing to those pillars, if you like, of fairness and equality in this society, look at what they are doing or not doing in the area of health, what they are doing or not doing in the area of education and what they are doing or not doing in the area of housing. They are deliberately setting about creating far greater inequality in this society. That is their objective. This government pander, as always, to their favourite minority—and that is the wealthy. We do not mind the wealthy doing well in our society as long as those people who get up, go to work, come home, cook the tea and do it again get a fair share. We do not mind that as long as, as a society, we say that we will look after the vulnerable, that those who are left behind in this process get a fair share. The truth is they have not been getting a fair share.  
I have never been to Kirribilli, so I do not know the view from there, but I can imagine what it is like—you look across to the eastern suburbs, to the Opera House, and you see the beneficiaries of this wealth creation all concentrated in one place. If you go 30 or 40 kilometres west, you will see an entirely different story—
—Out in Fowler.
—out in Fowler where combined family incomes are substantially less, where increases in income have not matched those at the very top. I have here a very revealing graph, which comes not from the opposition but from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. It came out recently, and the ABS made a very special point of saying that inequality had substantially increased in this society. Basically what the graph shows is that between 1996-97 and 2000-01 the incomes of those in the top 20 per cent increased at seven times the rate of those in the bottom 20 per cent. In that period those in the bottom 20 per cent got $3 a week—and they got a GST, which has been hitting them for six—and those in the top 20 per cent got $109 per week. 
In this society there is growing inequality, and the government think it is a good thing. What stands out is that the rising tide has not lifted all boats. We have not had trickle down. We have not had anything like trickle down. There has been a flood of wealth at the top and a flood of inequality below that. That is why we say the rich have got richer and continue to get richer, the middle are getting squeezed and the poor are getting left further behind. That is why we have such a deep frustration in the Australian community. They see that the bounty they have worked so hard to create is steadily being withdrawn in terms of increased health costs, increased education costs and increased housing costs. They are finding that they are paying more tax through the GST, getting fewer services and paying more for the ones they consume. We have got to the deplorable situation in this country where people on low and middle incomes cannot afford to take their kids to the doctor. We had got to the situation in the education system where everybody thought that, whatever the circumstances of their birth, their children could have access to a quality education and could hope for things more than their parents could. But we have got to the stage where many are being denied that. They simply cannot even afford to stay in school. 
This is poverty week. It is an important week. It is an important time to reflect on not only the nature of Australia and whether we want to remain the country of the `fair go' but also on world inequality. We ought to acknowledge that, in a country as wealthy as this one, too many Australians are being left behind. Wouldn't it be a change if the government could come in here and say: `Too many are being left behind. Let's do something about it'? Wouldn't that be a change? Wouldn't that break the partisanship? But they will not do that. It is simply unacceptable that 2.4 million Australians are living below that modest poverty line that I mentioned before. It is simply unacceptable that, accompanying this wealth creation, the government set out to systematically vilify and denigrate vulnerable people in our community. That is simply unacceptable.
We live in a global village. The modern world is a global village, and a fairer distribution of resources in this world between the haves and the have-nots would be of great benefit to this country as well. We might physically defend this nation with armies but we always defend our civilisation at home and abroad through a commitment to fairness and particularly through a commitment to education and compassion. This point was made in this building on Monday by Archbishop Ndungane, who spoke without a single representative of the coalition being present; not one coalition member bothered to turn up for this presentation in World Anti-Poverty Week. He said: 
Lasting international security flows from investing in people, human capital if you like, to prevent the conditions arising in which terrorism flourishes.
So fairness is not just a question of morality and compassion; it is also enlightened self-interest. That is why we must be committed to it as well. 
In the world antipoverty cup, Australia really does not make the quarterfinals. If you look at our contribution to alleviating world poverty, we are well behind more than a dozen developed countries around the world, despite our location in this region. When you look at the degree of poverty, there is also a degree of inequality in this country. We are less equal than probably a dozen other developed countries, so we lose both ways. We make less of a contribution to the rest of the world and at home we underachieve. We ought to be able to do better. We must do better, and we certainly must do better than what has been occurring in this parliament through these ministers in recent times.
It is much harder at the moment for the voices of ordinary people from humble backgrounds to be heard in this society. It is much harder for these issues to capture the attention of the media but we must continue to try. Under this government, callousness has become a virtue and habitual heartlessness has become its companion, and we saw this with Senator Vanstone. Senator Vanstone literally became a political hyena. She was out there taking great pleasure in singling out the most vulnerable people in our community, and part of that is still continuing. Those 30,000 families are losing their carers allowance, yet they care for chronically ill children or disabled children. On top of that, huge debts have been lumped on families, pensioners and students. This meanness was exposed, which is one of the reasons why Senator Vanstone was removed from the ministry—and heaven help the refugees that she now has responsibility for. 
Now Senator Vanstone has been replaced by Senator Patterson. Senator Patterson has essentially been promoted for dismantling Medicare. Consider this: in the portfolio she has been in, she has dismantled Medicare. That has caused huge costs to every family, and many cannot take their kids to the doctor. Her prize for doing that is to be put in charge of a portfolio three times bigger that affects 10 million people. If Senator Vanstone was a political hyena, what do we think Senator Patterson is? The best I can come up with is a stunned mullet, and the families of Australia, the pensioners of Australia and the carers of Australia simply do not deserve that. We ought to be able to do better.
The attack on the social infrastructure of fairness in health and education is really creating a two-tiered society here. The rich are getting richer, the middle are getting squeezed and many are simply being left behind altogether. Australia is increasingly divided today, as St Vincent de Paul has demonstrated in its very important report Two Australias. We are now on the verge of an American style chasm: the wealthy at the very top doing very well and everyone else falling further behind. That is what I think many in the Australian community are unaware of. 
When you examine the taxation statistics you get some idea of the enormity of this chasm. When you look at the taxation statistics you find the top percentage of income earners have had real increases in their incomes of almost 30 per cent. The growth in their incomes has outstripped average incomes by 1.5 times and outstripped middle incomes by four times. The total incomes of the top five per cent of income earners—which is, by the way, 430,000 people—is now equivalent to the combined earnings of 3.8 million Australians, the bottom 45 per cent. The income of the top five per cent, at $61.8 billion, is roughly the same as the whole budget of the Department of Family and Community Services. This is an American style chasm.  
This is putting real pressure on people, and they talk to us about it all the time. I will quote one comment from my electorate.
The cost of living is increasing constantly, my pay has just increased by $1 per hour, the first pay rise I have had for 18 months ... I constantly chase around supermarkets for bargains and stock up when things are cheapest.
I do not think that the Prime Minister has done much of that. Take this one:
I am a member of the “working poor”. My wage is so low that I can't afford to take my family to entertainment venues, can't afford new clothes, any non public medical or dental expenses—
and so on and so on. I know those stories are absolutely familiar to many in this House. But what do we get from the Prime Minister and his ministers today? A complete denial, because essentially they believe that inequality is good. Well, that is unacceptable to Labor. We have a program in place that brings equality and fairness to the fore. That is why our programs in health and education are so important to the future of the country. Investing in our people, a combined package of $4.2 billion, fully funded, is there to reverse the development of this American style gap that is opening up in our society. We have to go out there and talk to our people about that, because in this society there is a blindness of the affluent and what we need is much more attention on these issues.

"Anthony, Larry, MP",NP,2003-10-15,"—In contributing to the debate on the matter of public importance, I note the contribution made by the member for Lilley. In rebuttal of some of his comments, I would like to first highlight that much of the debate and what the member for Lilley has talked about centre on the statement that the opposition released about how they would allegedly combat poverty. Of course, to combat poverty or to raise the expectations and living standards of Australians, it is very important that their spokesperson has credibility—in other words, that they practise what they preach.
The member for Lilley parades himself as a great champion of the downtrodden and professes to help the disadvantaged. I will not dwell on it, but I was rather amused and interested to read in the paper that, whilst he is a great advocate—and whilst he scares a lot of the mums and dads in Australia—whether it is of pensions, the family tax benefit or those who are perhaps less fortunate than parliamentarians, the member for Lilley was quite happy yesterday, contrary to his leader's expression, about accepting a $16,000 taxpayer payment if he lost office.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. That is a lie—I did not say that.
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—The member for Lilley will withdraw that statement.
—I withdraw it. That was an untruth.
—Let me clarify that. I will quote him. He said: 
I would accept a payment made to me legally ... The Remuneration Tribunal is there to make decisions so that politicians don't have their hands in the cookie jar.
I very much understand why average Australians are upset by what they see as a double standard ... and that's why it is important that politicians aren't in there deciding their own terms and conditions.
He was quite happy to accept a payment that I do not think the Australian public thinks is appropriate. Here is someone who is meant to be the champion of the downtrodden saying he is quite happy to accept a ridiculous payment that no other Australian gets if they lose their job—and a lot of Australians lost jobs, I have to say, when the ALP was last in government. He is quite happy to take this payment. It demonstrates a great degree of hypocrisy, I am afraid to say, by the member for Lilley, particularly when he is in this debate today trying to prove the credibility of the alternative government when it comes to addressing the issue of poverty.
In the statements made by the Leader of the Opposition and the ALP shadow spokesperson, they highlighted a number of indicators and benchmarks that they want to articulate. It is interesting, because the last benchmark or major statement that was made in this country—and I remember it well; it was back in 1990 and it was made by then Prime Minister Bob Hawke—was that no child shall live in poverty. He was masquerading himself as saving the downtrodden. What an absolute joke! During that period, from 1990 through to 1996, more Australians lost their jobs than we have ever seen before in the history of this country. We inherited the `recession that we had to have'. Here was the then Prime Minister, the most successful ALP leader from the right wing—which, I must say, is certainly better than the left wing—pronouncing and setting this target that no child would live in poverty. Of course, it was an absolute failure.
Indeed, what we saw was that more families were put into perilous situations by the `recession that we had to have' which followed in the time of Bob Hawke's successor, Paul Keating. During that period we saw an enormous acceleration in debt. Some may say, `That doesn't bother us.' But it does—we were $80 billion in debt, which then went to $96 billion. The consequences of that and the impact it had on Australian families were profound. They lost their jobs and many of them lost their homes through very high mortgage repayments. We also saw real reductions in salaries.
The member for Lilley spends a lot of time talking about the broadening inequality between those who are very wealthy and those who are in the lower quartile. There are concerns there. No-one disputes that. But the fact is that more people were out of work—and it was a diabolical situation—when the ALP last occupied the treasury bench. It is interesting when we talk about that debt situation, because what we are talking about here is the credibility of the ALP. During that time of huge interest rate explosion and acceleration of debt, the interest repayments alone would have paid for the total health and education budget in the last year of Labor in 1996. So to say that no child shall live in poverty or to make the statements that have been made today is absolutely ridiculous.
The other interesting point in the statement by the Leader of the Opposition that was not talked about by the member for Lilley—and I think he was probably wise not to—was that the Labor Party is going to have another summit to solve the problems of inequality in Australia. I tell you what: the ALP is very good at summits. Bob Carr is the classic—he is the summit king. We have had summits on alcohol, obesity, drugs and salinity, and the list goes on. There are more summits being proposed by the Labor Party than there are in the Himalayas. Having a commitment to providing poverty reduction targets might sound good in theory, but in the practice of the previous ALP government it was appalling. 
I think it is important in this debate to look at some of the leading indicators to try and highlight some of the double standards of the ALP. We can look at what the coalition government has done since it came to office in 1996 about increasing wealth and opportunities for all Australians and, indeed, about raising the level of the tide for all boats, particularly as the tide relates to those in the lower quartile or those in middle-income Australia. The greatest thing you can do to overcome poverty—and this point was made by a number of ministers in the government today—is to provide employment opportunities. It is employment, that self-empower-ment to get out of poverty, that will assist more Australian families than any type of indirect or direct government intervention. Of course, that comes through good economic management.
As the Prime Minister said—and the member for Lilley was making fun of this—the reality is that we certainly do have a real trifecta here. The unemployment rate is now below six per cent—it is at 5.8 per cent. Inflation is under three per cent. We have an official interest rate below five per cent. The last time that happened was in 1968. When we compare that to the ALP record at the time it last left government, we see that unemployment peaked at 10.9 per cent. The ALP asks questions about the affordability of housing. When you have a mortgage repayment rate which peaked at 20.5 per cent, no wonder more people were driven to poverty. No wonder having such a basic thing in your life as a roof over your head was denied to so many people—it was totally unaffordable. The interest rate was 20.5 per cent in 1990 when the ALP was last in government.
Interestingly, if you look at households now, they have $6 in assets for every $1 in debt. The reality is that the wealth of Australia is increasing. Even those in the lower quartile have had a great increase in minimum wages and real growth rates compared to the significant reductions in growth rates that we saw from 1990 through to 1996. It is hypocritical for the ALP, which is meant to be representing the working class and working people, to say that real wages went up under its stewardship or that they are likely to go up if ever—God forbid!—it gets control of the treasury bench here in this place.
The reality is that, in order to alleviate poverty, employment is particularly important. Since we came into government, 1.2 million jobs have been created. Even in the area of teenage unemployment—and this is particularly poignant for many of those like me in coastal seats that have a high young population and a high elderly population—the rate of teenage unemployment is now one in 25 teenagers compared to one in 10 as was the case when the ALP was last in government in 1996. Do not ask me—I may have a particularly biased view—but the world economic outlook of the IMF predicted that Australia would continue to have the fastest growing economy in the world, providing opportunities for all Australians irrespective of where they live. These are opportunities. This is about creating jobs, not creating unemployment, which the ALP does consistently.
The member for Lilley talked about educational opportunities. Interestingly, when we look at vocational education and training today, more and more young Australians and people from disadvantaged backgrounds now have access particularly to apprenticeships and traineeships. There were 141,000 when Labor was last in government—we are talking about a figure that is three times that now. This is very important, particularly for a lot of those younger Australians who may not want to go on to higher education. It is also important particularly within our schools in that we are finding that it is ensuring that we raise the literacy and numeracy standards, because education is really the passport for many disadvantaged families—regardless of their circumstances—to get them out of those situations. We are providing increased funding particularly for education, but most particularly for improving the literacy and numeracy standards, which is fundamentally important. 
As was mentioned many times by the minister for education, we are planning $1.5 billion of funding for higher education and scholarships, particularly for a lot of Australians who come from disadvantaged backgrounds. In the area of youth allowance we are again providing that passport for young Australians: 380,000 of our young Australians are receiving substantially more than under the old Austudy where it was easier to get the dole than to go on to further higher education. This is again because of direct policy initiatives of the Howard-Anderson government—and, of course, of Tim Fischer, who was here a few years prior to Mr Anderson—ensuring that all Australians get the best possible start, particularly when it comes to education. I must admit that I was surprised that there were criticisms of the GST. We certainly did not introduce it to be popular, but I must say that none of the states has complained. What we would like to see is that all the GST revenue that goes to the states is actually spent on their core portfolio responsibilities of health, education and, in particular, roads and infrastructure.
—They support it now.
—Yes. As was acknowledged, they are very enthusiastic about it. We notice that the roll-back has of course been dropped by the federal opposition. The member for Lilley talks about the supposed inequality in private health insurance. Even when Graham Richardson was here—the master of the Australian Labor Party, who is obviously quite happy working for PBL these days—it was red alert time when private health insurance dropped below 40 per cent. Even he knew then that it was terribly important to support private health insurance to provide a range of options for Australians whether they are rich or poor and particularly to support the public hospital system along with the private sector by having adequate private health insurance.
Labor have continued not to endorse the government's policy on the 30 per cent rebate. They have not said it once, because they are quite committed to destroying it. Even today in question time it was demonstrated time after time that in the different seats represented by ALP members in the lower house either 40 per cent or 50 per cent of those constituents have private health insurance. Not only have we dramatically increased the funding—17 per cent, which is $42 billion, a doubling of what it was in the last couple of years of Labor—for public hospitals in the last agreements with the state governments; we have of course done the same for the private sector. We are unashamed about that, because when it comes to providing health, providing choice and providing equity it is the coalition government that does so, again by supporting Medicare rather than using the constant scare tactics of the member for Lilley and others.
Interestingly, although they talk about poverty or the health and wellbeing of Australians, Labor did not do a very good job when it came to immunisation rates. When it came to our kids, our kids' health and their future, immunisation rates were at the lowest rate for decades when Labor last left government. They have been increased dramatically by us. We have increased private health funding dramatically, along with funding to general public hospitals. 
One of the interesting areas is the debate on housing. Through every conference that I go to and every visit I make to a charitable organisation, it is made clear to me that the primary responsibility for any one of us parliamentarians—whether we hold a coastal seat or one in an urban area—is to make sure that we provide adequate housing for Australians. The notion that somehow Australians will be better off with the ALP being on the Treasury bench is ridiculous when we know their economic management policies are poor and we know that interest rates will start to skyrocket. How can you possibly afford to have a roof over your head when you have to pay interest rates of 17 per cent? Today they are 6.55 per cent. The PM mentioned today that mortgage payments today are $400 less per month. Can you imagine: if you were on a 30 or 50 per cent tax rate, you would have to be earning $1,000 more per month to pay that. Through our first home buyers scheme, 482,000 new home buyers have been able to buy a house.
Look at aged care. Look at child care. The coalition government have increased all of these areas substantially. Even on the issue of family tax benefit, we redesigned the system by changing 12 payments into three. We increased payments by $2 billion. We have $11 billion going out the door now. When you put in child-care benefits, this is a great success story of overcoming poverty in Australia.

"Vamvakinou, Maria, MP",ALP,2003-10-15,"—I think the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has a serious case of denial when it comes to the issue of poverty. What we have to understand is that poverty is not an issue that affects Third World countries only. Poverty also exists here in Australia. What we need to understand is that we are no longer the lucky country. We are no longer the egalitarian and wealthy country where everyone has the benefit of a fair go no matter what their station in life is. As much as the government wants to gloss over the devastating effects that its policies have had on Australian society, the fact remains that there is a growing social stratification where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. Although it may seem to be a bit of a cliche, the reality is that Howard's battlers are being hoodwinked. I would like to quote Father Joe Caddy from Catholic Welfare Australia, who today said:
Australia is too fast becoming a country that is divided between the haves and have nots ... While this had been a decade of unprecedented prosperity, those on the margins are being left further and further behind.
That is why the matter of public importance submitted by the shadow minister for community services is timely. There is indeed a great urgency to understand the level of poverty in this country and to commit to doing something about it. The Treasurer comes into this place on a daily basis and happily lauds his economic prowess and success—but for whom? Who is reaping the fruits of Australia's economic success?
It is a strange form of economic prosperity that sees only a small section of the Australian population benefit. The Treasurer's much flaunted fiscal prowess amounts to ridicule when you consider the fact that one in eight Australians are living below a modest poverty line. The wealth creation he is so fond of boasting about is unfortunately not being shared fairly by all Australians. If you consider figures such as the top 20 per cent of income earners in the past seven years having had their incomes increase by seven times that of the bottom 20 per cent, or that earnings of the top five per cent are equal to the bottom 45 per cent, it is obvious that inequality in Australia is well and truly a social issue. That is proven by the fact that, in the last six or seven years of the coalition's rule, the number of people living in poverty in Australia has increased by 400,000. 
Of the 2.4 million Australians living in poverty, many of them are in my electorate of Calwell. While the government continues to brag that its policies across the board are giving Australians a better chance to improve their lot in life, the reality out there on the ground is somewhat different. Howard's battlers are not only being left behind but also increasing in numbers, because government reforms amount to nothing but cuts to vital areas of education, health and welfare. The looming housing crisis, which is making housing unaffordable for so many Australians, is pitting the haves against the have-nots in Australian society.
If you look at the submission ACOSS made to the Senate poverty inquiry, one of 255 received so far, you will see that, try as it might, the Howard government cannot mask the level of poverty in this country. According to the executive summary of the ACOSS submission:
Thirty years after the National Poverty Inquiry and the establishment of the Henderson Poverty Line, there is evidence to suggest that poverty is now more widespread, against a backdrop of deeply entrenched social divisions:
	more than 6% of the labour force is “officially” unemployed compared with less than 2% in the early 1970s. When we take into account hidden unemployment the current figure doubles. The number of long term unemployment recipients has also grown substantially from negligible levels to around 380,000 in 2003 ...
ACOSS is merely affirming what a lot of people in this place know to be the case: we have a serious problem with the number of people, especially in the age group of 45 and over, who are long-term unemployed. In fact, the Standing Committee on Employment and Workplace Relations, of which I am a member, is currently conducting a public hearing into this disturbing phenomenon. It is a bit of a paradox, to say the least, given that the unemployment figures show a decline in unemployment. The ACOSS figures also show that 15 per cent of children—that is, some 860,000 kids—lived in jobless households in 1999, and 23 per cent of working age people were reliant on social security payments in 2000, compared to 16 per cent in 1981.
The government prefer to pursue a policy of blaming the victims. They do this constantly because, by blaming the victim, they deflect responsibility from themselves. Far be it from the Howard government to accept responsibility for the negative outcomes of their ideologically driven policies. The government, after all, give with one hand but take with the other. Let us not forget the GST and its negative impact on many Australian households, and pensioners in particular. Certainly the people in my electorate remind me of this constantly, and I also see it for myself as I visit my local supermarket on a weekly basis.
We squander our human capital when we do not give Australians, and especially Australian kids, an equal opportunity to develop their talents so that they can make constructive contributions to society and develop independent means of existence. Resources in the form of budget surpluses are squandered if they are not targeted to addressing inequalities in education, for example. Education is the key to breaking the poverty cycle; it is the means by which the kids in my electorate can get a better future. It is time for the education minister to get real about equal opportunity in education for all kids instead of storytelling and spinning yarns, because the kids in my electorate can easily see through his spin and fables. They recognise that his propositions for giving them a so-called fair go for access to university courses is nothing more than spin. I can also tell him that, next time he comes to my electorate, he should call in to my office because I would be more than happy to take him to my local secondary colleges, where the kids rely on breakfast programs funded by unions such as the CFMEU, and he can try and tell them that he is doing them a favour by increasing the number of fee paying places in universities. The truth is that the youth in Broadmeadows will never be able to avail themselves of his so-called generosity because they simply cannot afford it. 
Since 1996, in Victoria alone the Howard government has cut $1.3 billion from universities and TAFE institutions, and the kids in my electorate are worse off for it. I can tell the minister that these kids do not want an increase in fee paying courses. They actually want more money to be spent on increasing vocational and educational training courses; they want their secondary schools to have similar resources to non-government schools. But the bottom line is that they want a fair go. They want a fair go because it is only through education that they have a hope of breaking free from the poverty cycle.
It is not only in the education sector that this government's policies are driving a two-class system. Let us look at the housing sector. The First Home Owners Scheme seems to be the jewel in the Treasurer's crown, but what has happened to affordability of housing for poorer Australians? The 105,000 or so homeless Australians—as at the 1996 census; no doubt, it is a much bigger number now—are being beaten to home ownership by one-year-olds and seven-year-olds whose parents are obviously clever enough and devious enough to avail themselves of the scheme's loopholes. The big housing boom in Australia has become a wealth creation scheme for high-income earners and property developers who are clever enough and resourceful enough to avoid paying taxes through the creation of family trust funds, always at the expense of poorer Australians.
The word `unaffordability' has become synonymous with this government. The people in my electorate should not be forced to choose between conflicting interests. They should not have to choose between buying groceries or seeing their local GP; they should not have to choose between the education of their children and other aspects of their family budget. The 30,000 parents of disabled children, many of whom are in my electorate, should not have to worry about the possible loss of their $87 fortnightly payment, because a caring, fair-minded government would never contemplate taking it off them in the first place.
We need to treat the issue of poverty in this country with the seriousness and concern that it deserves. Many Australians would be horrified to know the extent of poverty in this country. That is why events like Anti-Poverty Week and International Anti-Poverty Day are important because they not only draw attention to the fact that 1.2 billion people around the world are forced to live on less than $1 per day but also serve as a wake-up call for all Australians, and in particular governments, to realise that poverty exists in this the lucky country.
ACOSS is right when it states that:
Governments have an important role in drawing attention to poverty and disadvantage, in taking action to reduce it and to monitoring progress in addressing it.
The people in my electorate affected by poverty need help and assistance from government. They should not have to rely solely on the goodwill and charity of volunteers and church groups in order to provide the most basic day-to-day necessities. 
Having said that, I want to pay tribute to the many good people in my electorate who run around collecting food and clothing for the hundreds of families who come to the neighbourhood houses' food banks on a Friday to get their weekly groceries, I want to pay tribute to these people because I have seen first hand the work that they do, I have seen the difference that their efforts make to families who cannot afford to buy clothes for their children and I have seen the delight on the faces of young children when they receive hand-me-down toys and clothes. And I have heard the despair and witnessed the futility that they feel because they cannot always find enough people to donate.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Poverty</title>,Matters of Public Importance,9,1
"Smith, Anthony, MP",LP,2003-10-15,"—The substance of this motion and the issues it addresses are important. We all care about poverty and disadvantage. We all want to do all we can to limit it and to reduce it. That is precisely why there is absolutely no excuse for members to engage in scaremongering, to engage in exaggeration, to engage in misrepresentation and manipulation of statistics and above all to engage in hypocrisy and dishonesty. But that is precisely what we have had today and in the previous weeks and months from the member for Lilley and particularly today from the previous speaker.
If the member for Lilley were to be believed people could be excused for thinking that the sky was falling in, that the economy was bad, that unemployment was rising and that opportunities were decreasing. In the short time available, I want to address the lack of substance in the member for Lilley's arguments, I want to expose some of the blatant hypocrisy—which those on the other side know only too well, particularly the Leader of the Opposition—of the member for Lilley and I want to address some of the misconceptions that can occur in the debate about statistical inequality.
But first I will expose the member for Lilley's breathtaking hypocrisy. In all his speeches and comments—and, dare I say, roostering—he managed to not mention Labor's record once. He managed to not mention the fact that a decade ago the Australian economy entered one of its worst recessions, which saw household incomes collapse, a multitude of jobs simply disappear and record business bankruptcies. Back at that time—while he was not a member of this place, in 1990 and 1991—there was no concern from those on the other side about inequality.
Inequality was on a different basis: it was between those who had jobs and those who did not; those who managed to keep their houses and those who lost them. But at that time members opposite, from the former Prime Minister down, were shouting in the opposite direction just as loudly as they do today, denying that inequality was a problem.
Ten years on, Australia has emerged as one of the strongest economies in the world, unemployment is half what it was, interest rates are around a third of their peak in the early 1990s and real wages have undergone sustained and stable growth. If we believe what the member for Lilley says and implies—his coded message—we are supposed to think this is all bad.
How the member for Lilley can maintain this—how he can even mention poverty without mentioning Bob Hawke's amazing promise to wipe out child poverty by 1990—I do not know. If Labor's words were matched with actions, childhood poverty in Australia would have ceased to exist 13 years ago. But he does not mention that and he does not mention Labor's past and there are very good reasons why he does not. 
One is he does not have a solution. In all his contributions, and particularly today through 15 minutes of talking, he did not say once what Labor would do. He did not offer a single solution, nor did he mention Labor's record—and the reason he never mentions Labor's record is because Labor's record and Labor's past actions are actually the member for Lilley's solution. If you want to know what Labor would do if ever they had the chance, you only have to look back over 10 or 15 years and see what happened then.
As we saw in question time today, what they did was reduce real wages. Real wages fell. The member for Lilley cannot have it both ways. At one point in his contribution he said the rich were getting richer, the middle was getting squeezed and the poor were getting poorer. At another point in his contribution he acknowledged that low-income earners had experienced increases in real wages but argued that they were not big enough.
The inescapable fact for the member for Lilley is that, after Labor was elected in 1983, for 13 years they reduced the incomes of the lowest income group in Australia. They reduced their take-home income, life became tougher and—as the Prime Minister said today—they did not hide it; they boasted about it. That is Labor's record. That is Labor's policy for the future. What they do not do is own up to it and what they do not do is acknowledge it.
When the member for Lilley seeks to imply that the rich are getting richer, he tries in a coded way to imply that the poor must necessarily be getting poorer—that somehow, if somebody is experiencing an income growth, someone else must be experiencing a corresponding income decline; that if a group of people improve their income it must be at the direct expense of another group. This is not only completely wrong and dishonest but also deeply cynical.
The latest evidence from the ABS and the latest comprehensive analysis from all of the academics who work in this area show that all income groups have experienced increases in income. That was highlighted in question time today. No group has gone backwards. Far from one group progressing while another regresses, all are gaining. The difference is in the rate of growth. Of course we would all like to see greater gains for low-income earners, but the point is that they are moving in the right direction, which is up, and they are moving in a direction in contrast to the direction they moved under Labor, which was down.
The other point about the measurement of statistical inequality which is often overlooked is that changes can occur for a variety of reasons. They are occurring to a degree at the moment because higher income groups are moving up at a faster rate than middle and lower income groups—but, as I have said, all are moving up. Changes can also occur if one income group moves while the others are static. It is actually possible in a statistical sense to have an improvement in the measurement of inequality if all income groups decline. Presumably, the member for Lilley would welcome that because it would be a better statistical outcome for him. But the fact is that it would completely ignore the measure that affects the day-to-day lives of Australians—that is, the measure of their livelihood; the measure of their living standards.
That is why the fact that real wages have increased is something that is far more important to the day-to-day lives of Australians than a mere statistical measure. The people out there in the suburbs of Sydney, Melbourne and the Gold Coast are actually concerned about outcomes; they are not concerned about a statistical measure. For the member for Lilley to use this to scaremonger and to exaggerate is dishonest and irresponsible in the extreme. What this tells us, of course, is that statistics can be manipulated—and they are manipulated by those opposite. 
I will finish on a couple of points. If the member for Lilley has a solution, he should say what it is. He argues that the government has not intervened enough. Those opposite would argue that the government should do a lot more and they ignore what the government does do. If the member for Lilley believes in massively higher taxes, he should say so. The other thing the member for Lilley and particularly the left wing members of the opposition should do is be honest. I refer the members opposite to one honest left winger I have discovered: Clive Hamilton. Last year he said:
Difficult as it may be to admit, social democrats and democratic socialists have a psychological predisposition to believe that the mass of people are suffering from material deprivation.
In real terms, Australians today are at least three times better off than their parents were after the war, and the distribution of income is about the same. Unpalatable as it is to concede, inequality is not substantially greater than it was 40 years ago.

"Moylan, Judi, MP",LP,2003-10-15,"—On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the 11th report for 2003 of the committee relating to RAAF Base Richmond Reinvestment Project, Richmond, NSW.
Ordered that the report be printed. 
—by leave—Medium-term investment in facilities at RAAF Base Richmond is required in order to maintain operational capability until 2010, or until the long-term future of the base is decided. The estimated cost of the project is $35 million.
It is proposed that the reinvestment project will address critical shortcomings in the facilities and infrastructure supporting current capability, such as engineering services and working and training accommodation. The proposed works comprise: the construction of a new combined headquarters complex for No. 36 and No. 37 Squadrons; the construction of a new, purpose-designed Mechanical Equipment Operation and Maintenance Section facility; the construction of an extension to the east side of the No. 33 Squadron hangar; an upgrade of works to No. 36 and No. 37 Squadron hangars and workshops; an upgrade and rationalisation of high-voltage electricity reticulation; the construction of new ablution facilities to service the western portion of the base; and an upgrade and repair of the stormwater drainage system. Having inspected the facilities to be addressed under the works proposal, the committee wished to ensure that occupational health and safety issues and, particularly, fire safety measures of an appropriate standard would be met across the entire base. The Department of Defence told the committee that present funding ensures that these standards are met throughout the base.
Members had concerns about the comfort and amenity of personnel. The committee noted that, in some instances, work areas and associated ablutions or meals areas are to be located in separate buildings. The Department of Defence responded that separate ablutions blocks were common throughout the base as co-location can pose contamination risks. The committee recommends that, in order to improve the comfort and amenity of personnel, a covered walkway be provided between the existing fuel-testing laboratory and the office building to be constructed under the reinvestment proposal. Given the ageing facilities at the base, the committee wanted to know whether existing services infrastructure would have the capacity to support the proposed development. The Department of Defence emphasised that the proposed work is intended to replace or refurbish existing facilities and no additional load on services is anticipated. 
The committee questioned the Department of Defence on two environmental issues. The Department of Defence submission mentioned that some structures on the base contain asbestos. The committee was concerned that personnel could come into contact with harmful material. The Department of Defence assured the committee that it has a range of procedures in place to prevent contact with any harmful material and conducts regular audits. The committee also inquired if there had been any chemical spillages at the base affecting the local stormwater system. The Department of Defence told the committee that incidents had occurred but were contained by existing procedures.
According to the Australian Heritage Commission, the proposed works will require the demolition of some heritage listed Bellman hangars. The Department of Defence informed the committee that negotiations will continue with the Australian Heritage Commission on this matter. Recognising the base's importance to the local economy, the Department of Defence expressed its commitment to promoting opportunities for business in the Hawkesbury region. This was welcomed by the member for Macquarie, who took a particular interest in the proceedings of this hearing. The department will divide the project into several parts and conduct briefings on the tendering process to assist local enterprises to bid successfully for works packages.  
While not within the scope of the current proposal, it was brought to the committee's attention by the member for Macquarie that the living-in accommodation at RAAF Base Richmond requires refurbishment. The committee was therefore interested to learn more about the Department of Defence's plans to address deficiencies in this area. The department explained that, while there are no immediate plans for refurbishment, a current study is investigating priorities for defence accommodation Australia wide. This base has provided a very important service, particularly during difficulties in the Asia-Pacific region in recent times—and further afield.
Finally, several witnesses raised the issue of the future of the RAAF Base Richmond, given its strategic role in recent times. The committee recommends that a decision on the long-term future of RAAF Base Richmond be made as soon as possible to ensure the most effective use of public funds. Having inspected the base, it is apparent to the committee that the upgrade of the facilities at RAAF Base Richmond is essential to maintain operational capability and provide an appropriate working environment for base personnel. The committee therefore recommends that the proposed RAAF Base Richmond Reinvestment Project at Richmond proceed, at an estimated cost of $35 million. 
I wish to thank many people, including Wing Commander Knight; the member for Macquarie, for his interest and submission; the Hawkesbury Economic Development Advisory Committee; GROW Employment Council Inc.; and the Mayor of Hawkesbury City Council, all of whom took a particular interest in this project and recognised its importance to the region.

"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2003-10-15,"—by leave—Mr Deputy Speaker, as a member of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works you would know that this was an important review of RAAF Base Richmond. This base was clearly in need of this reinvestment project. I therefore concur with the sentiments expressed by the chair of the committee, the member for Pearce, when she indicated that $35 million should be spent on the developments required, which were put to us by the Defence department. 
I would like to mention a number of matters that I think need to be rectified quickly. There is no doubt, having inspected the area, that the Defence personnel have amenities which are wanting and in need of immediate repair. It is fair to say—and I think every member of the committee would agree, as would the local member—that the Defence personnel should be provided with appropriate amenities. There is no doubt in my view that those amenities are deficient. The committee has therefore recommended that those matters be attended to forthwith.
I would also like to raise the need to negotiate with the Australian Heritage Commission because the proposed works, as the member for Pearce indicated, would require the demolition of some heritage listed Bellman hangars. I think it is important, when we look at dwellings that are heritage listed, to ensure that everything is done to preserve those things where possible. In this case, it would appear that there has to be some demolition undertaken, and it should be done as sensitively as possible.
Finally, I want to touch upon the indefinite future of the base. As the statement made by the member for Pearce indicated, there were some questions about this issue. The fact is at the moment the only commitment made by the government in relation to the RAAF base at Richmond is that it will not close before 2010. Therefore, the members who made up the committee on that day were clearly interested to see whether the $35 million should be spent and would be value for money, given that there is no commitment beyond 2010 for RAAF Base Richmond at this point. 
It was reasonably put by Brigadier Hutchinson and other witnesses when they indicated that there was a commitment that went to almost seven years. Indeed, there are immediate occupational health and safety concerns and, of course, the deficiencies in the amenities to which I referred earlier, and therefore the money would be well spent. The need to spend it was impressed upon us. I did also ask of Brigadier Hutchinson and Wing Commander Knight in the hearing:
Have there been any morale problems or concerns with the personnel on the base, given the fact that there is a guarantee of less than seven years?
Brigadier Hutchinson indicated that he would like to pass that question to Wing Commander Knight, who said:
Yes, morale has been affected by the indecision that has been created by the Prime Minister's statement.
That reinforces the view that there is a need for the government to make a decision on that site. We are slowly heading towards 2010, and the more quickly the government can make a decision so that the personnel—and, indeed, the community at large within the electorate—can be assured that RAAF Base Richmond has a life beyond 2010, the better. Finally, along with the member for Pearce, I thank the witnesses and all those involved, including, last but not least, the secretariat, who have again done a fantastic job in assisting the committee with its deliberations.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Public Works Committee</title>,Committees,13,1
"Moylan, Judi, MP",LP,2003-10-15,"—On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the 11th report for 2003 of the committee relating to RAAF Base Richmond Reinvestment Project, Richmond, NSW.
Ordered that the report be printed. 
—by leave—Medium-term investment in facilities at RAAF Base Richmond is required in order to maintain operational capability until 2010, or until the long-term future of the base is decided. The estimated cost of the project is $35 million.
It is proposed that the reinvestment project will address critical shortcomings in the facilities and infrastructure supporting current capability, such as engineering services and working and training accommodation. The proposed works comprise: the construction of a new combined headquarters complex for No. 36 and No. 37 Squadrons; the construction of a new, purpose-designed Mechanical Equipment Operation and Maintenance Section facility; the construction of an extension to the east side of the No. 33 Squadron hangar; an upgrade of works to No. 36 and No. 37 Squadron hangars and workshops; an upgrade and rationalisation of high-voltage electricity reticulation; the construction of new ablution facilities to service the western portion of the base; and an upgrade and repair of the stormwater drainage system. Having inspected the facilities to be addressed under the works proposal, the committee wished to ensure that occupational health and safety issues and, particularly, fire safety measures of an appropriate standard would be met across the entire base. The Department of Defence told the committee that present funding ensures that these standards are met throughout the base.
Members had concerns about the comfort and amenity of personnel. The committee noted that, in some instances, work areas and associated ablutions or meals areas are to be located in separate buildings. The Department of Defence responded that separate ablutions blocks were common throughout the base as co-location can pose contamination risks. The committee recommends that, in order to improve the comfort and amenity of personnel, a covered walkway be provided between the existing fuel-testing laboratory and the office building to be constructed under the reinvestment proposal. Given the ageing facilities at the base, the committee wanted to know whether existing services infrastructure would have the capacity to support the proposed development. The Department of Defence emphasised that the proposed work is intended to replace or refurbish existing facilities and no additional load on services is anticipated.

"McLeay, Leo, MP",ALP,2003-10-15,"—The Higher Education Support Bill 2003 and the Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003 are concerned with the Commonwealth's funding of higher education. When I look at this legislation, I often wonder if I am in a looking glass or back-to-front land. I read what the government says it is doing with education policy, I am aware of the rhetoric it puts out on education and I think, `That doesn't sound too bad.' But when you look at the detail in legislation such as the bills before us today you see that it is all quite different. The Minister for Education, Science and Training claimed in his second reading speech:
The government's vision of education, science and training is that our ambitions and our policies should enable every human being—especially every young person in this country—to find and achieve their own potential.
When you hear that, you think, `That's very sensible.' But in fact these bills will have the opposite effect if passed without amendment. There is a significant difference between the government and the opposition when it comes to higher education. Our view on this side of the House is that everyone has a right to higher education, irrespective of their ability, or their parent's ability, to pay. The view of those opposite seems to be that those who can afford to pay have a greater right to higher education than those who cannot. This legislation, if passed as currently formulated, will have the effect of saying yes to the rich and no to the poor. So much for the minister stating in the second reading speech that the government's ambitions and policies in this area `should enable every human being ... to find and achieve their own potential.' 
In this legislation, the government also tries to bring in a number of issues that are completely unrelated to higher education by seeking to tie core operating grants to compliance with government policies on industrial relations. This government has really stepped down to a new low. It strikes me as being typical of the government that, when thwarted in getting its ideology across in a straightforward way—and we hear every day in this House from the minister how its industrial relations bills are being rejected in the Senate—the government then thinks it can be very clever and sets about finding a sneaky way of putting its ideological preferences into practice, going after the economy sector by sector. We saw the government attack the building industry, and now we are seeing it attack the education industry.
Industrial relations matters, such as the enforced introduction of Australian workplace agreements and the establishment of barriers to union presence on university campuses, should not be part of funding legislation. In fact, they should not be part of any legislation at all, in my view. But the government is so determined to kill trade unionism and have everybody on AWAs that it obviously could not resist the temptation to include these matters in the bills before us today. It is no wonder that the universities and others, including the unions that are involved in universities, are up in arms about this issue. It is offensive, and it is a gross interference with the way universities operate. It is forcing the government's ideology upon them, and the universities are effectively being held to ransom. Unless they agree to these things, they will not get funding. That is what the government is saying, and it is outrageous.
It has been suggested by some that the minister may be willing to compromise on this aspect of the legislation. I sincerely hope he does. But how time wasting to put forward proposals as divisive as these that he knows he will probably have to compromise on in order to get other parts of the legislation through. Years of consultation have gone into the preparation of this legislation. We would all have thought that the government could have got it right and come up with a reasonable piece of legislation—not one that contains outrageous features that the government knows in advance are not going to be acceptable to most people in the university sector and, odds-on, are not going to be acceptable to the Senate. Or, once again, are  this minister and his colleagues being too smart for their own good? Is he thinking, `I will throw this stuff in just to get them all scared and outraged, then I can make a big person of myself and take it out of the legislation, and everybody will be so happy and impressed by my ability to compromise that they will accept the rest of the legislation without further demur'?
Is that what the minister and the rest of the government is thinking? Is that their tactic? If it is, this is an absolutely ridiculous waste of time and it puts this parliament in a terrible position, whereas those of us on this side who have a genuine commitment to education would like to be able to walk hand in hand with the government and get some decent education outcomes for this country. But when you have these sorts of smarty operations going on in legislation, it makes it impossible for compromise to be achieved.
The government has accused the opposition of wanting no change to the current system or of wanting to throw more money at the higher education sector, but there is much more to our policies in this area than more money. The Leader of the Opposition and our spokesperson have outlined our policies in the debate on this legislation. In fact, Labor and Liberal education policies, if you look at the published statements about them—as I have said earlier in relation to what the minister has said—seem to have similar aims but very different ways of going about them. But, unlike the government, the opposition does genuinely compare what the government does with what we do. The difference is that we care about the future and we are sincere about investing in Australia's future by investing in our young people and providing them with opportunities to obtain a full education, thereby allowing them to achieve their potential. The difference between us and the government is that we will increase the funding; we will provide better opportunities; and we will do our best to see that young people achieve their potential. 
Some of the government speakers in this current debate have muddied the waters by implying, and sometimes stating outright, that Labor sees universities as the best and only educational option for young Australians. We see the minister in here every day at question time running that line. They then extrapolate from this argument that Labor regards those who do not have a university education as lesser beings or less deserving of support. Nothing could be further from the truth: we want equality of access and equality of opportunity both for poor people and for those who are better off.
Another aspect of this legislation which concerns me is the proposal to deregulate tuition charges for Australian undergraduate students, allowing universities to determine their fees within certain limits. But, as in all legislation put up by this minister, there is a catch in that this limit can be increased by the minister. In other words, the sky is the limit. Whenever the pressure is on universities for more funds in the future, the temptation and the facility will be there to raise fees. The universities may not want to do it, but it may be their only option if they find themselves in need of funds and cannot obtain money from the government or in any other way. This proposal is yet another tricky way for the government to ease its way out of funding and push the funding burden through the university administration back onto the students and their families a la the American system, which many members of the government are very enamoured of.
The government can try to justify its proposals to allow fee increases, but the facts speak for themselves. Average HECS fees have nearly doubled since the Howard government first came to power. Australian universities are already the fourth most heavily dependent on private funding in the OECD—only Korea, the USA and Japan are ahead of us. The changes proposed in this legislation have the potential to give Australia the highest cost public university system in the Western world—a dubious honour and not a situation to be proud of. Public investment in Australian universities is not high, despite what this government would have the general population believe. In fact, public investment in Australian universities is the sixth lowest in the OECD as a proportion of GDP, at 0.8 per cent.
Another bit of sophistry indulged in by some of the speakers opposite relates to the provision of full fee places for a greater proportion of students. If I remember correctly, full fee places were first introduced for overseas students who wished to study certain courses at Australian universities. In 1996 the Howard government announced that universities would be able to enrol full fee paying Australian students. At the time, this amendment was capped at 25 per cent of the total enrolments. The current bill would double the cap to 50 per cent; thus half of all Australian undergraduates could be full fee paying students. I have heard some of the government speakers suggest that it would be discriminatory not to offer overseas and Australian students the same opportunity to pay full fees for their courses, but how discriminatory is that system towards those who cannot afford to pay? 
The universities will become increasingly desperate for funding and will have to take what they can get. If they are inadequately funded by the government, they will have to supplement their funding in other ways. Full fee paying students will be a more attractive proposition than those who need assistance, loans et cetera. Even universities with the best intentions will find that they have to constantly juggle competing demands and academic standards, ensuring that the best students may have to be sacrificed or at least compromised because of the need to attract funds and to take the students who can pay up front in preference to those who are not so well off but who may have greater academic potential.
Universities are not factories; they are not companies; they are not government businesses. They are unique educational institutions where the brightest of our young people should be encouraged to develop and become assets to our society in a variety of ways. I am not saying that universities should not be accountable, but they should not be treated in the way that this government is treating them. The powers that this legislation would give to the minister to intervene in the running of universities, both directly and indirectly, are unprecedented. It must shock and horrify all those who value academic freedom and student choice. I cannot believe that this government thinks it can get away with these outrageous proposals. Without amendment, this bill should be defeated in the Senate.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Wilkie, Kim, MP",ALP,2003-10-15,"—I wish to speak on the Higher Education Support Bill 2003 and the Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003. I am concerned about the possible deterrent effect of increased HECS fees on participation, especially for those from disadvantaged and rural backgrounds. I am also extremely concerned about the potential for the cost being imposed by this government to outweigh the benefits of higher education. Since HECS was first introduced in 1989, there have been a number of studies into the scheme. There seems to have been no detrimental effect on participation due to HECS prior to the 1997 increases. However, it is plain from more recent studies that HECS has affected males from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Their participation in the most expensive courses has declined by 38 per cent. This is a statistic I believe we should be very concerned about.
As a result of this government's policies there are already far too many talented people missing out on a university place. Unmet demand for university places for 2003 in my state of Western Australia was in the range of 1,300 to 1,600. We have encouraged young people to stay at school to maximise their potential, only to make it impossible for up to 20,000 qualified, capable Australians to get a university place. These are young, motivated people who have the qualifications and capabilities to achieve a degree but, because of this government's policies in higher education, are still unable to gain a place in university.
Australia has the second lowest increase in the rate of enrolment in universities in the OECD. The Howard government is not creating enough fully funded university places to even maintain current numbers for the next three years. Australian universities are being forced to cut around 8,000 HECS places by 2007. The Howard government's policy of making students and their families pay for the $5 billion in cuts from our universities via the staggering fee hikes is not the way to encourage the uptake of university studies. This action to charge exorbitant fees by the government significantly impacts on our young people, leaving them with HECS debts, at the end of their study time, of up to $50,000. 
The education minister has been misleading the public by promising that no more than 50 per cent of places in a university course would be allowed to be full fee places and that all full fee places would be in addition to the HECS places. He now admits that full fee places are going to replace all HECS places in some courses. The minister intends to exempt whole courses from the 50 per cent limit, meaning no public funding at all for some courses and forcing all students to pay full fees. The courses on the minister's hit list are those that he claims are `not in the nation's interest'. What is in the nation's interest is apparently entirely up to him.
The Howard government is stopping thousands of Australians from realising their potential and gaining the skills and education they need for better job opportunities. The government's own figures show that the number of Australians starting an undergraduate degree has dropped for two years running. Due to its own policy, the government is not creating enough fully funded university places to even maintain current numbers for the next three years. Our universities are being forced to cut around 8,000 HECS places by 2007 because the Howard government is not properly funding enough student places. As a result, thousands more school leavers will miss out on a university place over the next three years. By 2008, publicly funded places will not even keep pace with population growth. This means a diminishing proportion of Australians will be going to university because of the Howard government. A responsible government should be creating new full- and part-time university places every year for Australians starting a degree. This would go a long way to meeting unmet demand for university and it would mean more young Australians could get a university qualification.
The benefits of higher education for the individual in terms of employment and income are also evident from the surveys of the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The unemployment rate for people with a bachelor's degree is 2.7 per cent compared to 9.1 per cent for those people without nonschool qualifications. The earnings for higher education graduates and people with other educational qualifications were $1,108 per week for full-time work and $555 for part-time work. In 2001, the earning capacity for people who had only completed year 12 was $737 full time and $277 part time. I would have thought that the highest taxing government in Australia's history should be able to work out that these people who are earning more money as a result of their degree are paying more tax over their lifetime than are those who are less qualified. When one compares the amount that the government spends on higher education to the tax receipt the government gains as a result of that higher education, the government has to be in front.
Work done by J. Borland and others showed that, on average, the total gain in earnings over a working lifetime that a graduate can expect is estimated to be around $300,000. Therefore, the $5.3 billion spent on university teaching would ultimately generate approximately $8 billion in additional receipts from the taxes of graduates. The average rate of return to the government from their investment in higher education is estimated at around 11 per cent. Notwithstanding these figures, under the Howard government's policies on higher education, cost will become a barrier to a university education, and young graduates will spend a large part of their working lives weighed down by massive debt. This in turn has the potential to cause reduced home ownership, delayed parenthood and an increase in the brain drain. The government policy is to let universities increase HECS fees by up to 30 per cent. These new fee hikes could see average student contributions more than double since 1996. Fees for some courses, like law and veterinary science, could increase by over 240 per cent. Labor will not support any measures to increase fees for Australian students and their families. 
Thomas Jefferson described education as the defence of a nation. I believe in that notion and further believe that higher education should be available and affordable to all those who aspire to take part in it. I do not agree with the Howard government's attempt to create an American style system where money, more than marks, opens up university doors. Under this government since 1998, full fee payers have been able to buy a university place ahead of people with higher marks. Degrees costing as much as $150,000 are available to those who can afford to pay. It is appalling that, for a price, a person can get preferential treatment over those infinitely more qualified.
All Australians should have equal access and opportunity to go to university, based on their ability. Access to university should be based on achievement and potential, not on how much you or your family can pay. The Howard government is intent on increasing the number of full fee paying places so that half of all university places go to people who buy their way in. That means that more university places will be reserved for the wealthy and more $100,000-plus degrees will be bought. The government defends its proposals by saying that this does not mean that only the rich can participate. It is magnanimously offering to introduce a loans scheme, with a six per cent interest rate, to encourage more Australians to pay full fees. Six per cent translates into a repayment of $4,300 in interest alone, over and above the cost of living.
I advocate none of that nonsense but rather merit as the only criterion for admission to university, no full fees for Australian undergraduates and the abolition of real interest rates on postgraduate loans. For seven years this government has been cutting funding to education. Since 1996 it has slashed $5 billion from universities, with Australia's public investment in universities declining by 11 per cent—a decline greater than that in any other country in the OECD. Average OECD growth is 21 per cent. As a result of budget cuts and falling investment, our universities are struggling to perform at the highest possible standard. Our universities are in a serious state of disrepair, with overcrowded classrooms, insufficient student resources, fewer tutorials and less individual contact. All of this compromises learning for students. Over the past six years the number of students per teaching staff has blown out by 31.3 per cent; at some institutions the increase has been over 50 per cent. 
This government should be investing more money in higher education. Instead it has hijacked over $400 million of desperately needed university funding and is now attempting to blackmail universities into implementing industrial relations conditions—conditions that are so unpopular and irrelevant to universities' core functions of teaching and research that they have caused massive disruptions across university campuses. Under this government we have seen a massive drop in skills growth—from a 28.6 per cent rate of productivity growth in the late eighties and early nineties to just 2.9 per cent in the late nineties, which is a drop of 75 per cent.
The Productivity Commission found that more Australians must attain higher skill levels to raise living standards. There are severe skill shortages in key industries in Australia. The need for more skilled workers in areas like nursing, teaching, multimedia, vehicle trades and metalwork is getting to a desperate level. In spite of this, under this government tens of thousands of talented Australians are being turned away from university and TAFE every year. Despite this, there is no new assistance for funding future growth or meeting unmet demands in TAFE. This government's policies result in Australians being denied access to the skills they need for a good job. More funding is needed, not less. We need more HECS funded nursing and teaching places, full- and part-time, at undergraduate and post-graduate levels. 
The Howard government wants to limit to five years the amount of time a student can have a HECS place. A standard undergraduate degree takes three years of full-time study and a master's degree takes six years of full-time study. What is the value of offering HECS for five years? Figures show that Australian students already spend the shortest amount of time at university out of any country in the OECD. This limit to five years of study limits people who decide on a career change or who want to upgrade their skills. 
Australia's university system needs investment and longterm reform, not cost cutting and increased student costs. We must support Australians in their pursuit of higher education. This is an investment for all Australians. People with TAFE and university qualifications are more likely to get a good job and contribute to social and economic development. This means benefits to Australians, including higher living standards, a higher tax base, improved productivity, increased business investment and greater skills growth. A wider distribution of these benefits can be achieved by increasing opportunities for people to go to university or TAFE, raising standards and ensuring that cost is not a barrier to study. To achieve this, we have to make a commitment to adequately fund our universities and TAFEs and keep student fees affordable.
Of course students should contribute to the cost of their university study. That is why Labor introduced the Higher Education Contributions Scheme in 1989. But students and their families already contribute a substantial amount to the cost of study. An increase on these levels of contribution risks turning too many Australians away from university. Higher education at universities and TAFEs should be viewed by all as a shared investment which has important public as well as personal benefits.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"McFarlane, Jann, MP",ALP,2003-10-15,"—I rise today to speak on a package of bills which are part of the changing landscape of higher education in Australia. They are the Higher Education Support Bill 2003 and the Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003. My Stirling constituents often say to me, `What is the difference between the major parties? They seem so similar.' When replying I point out two major areas that affect the lives of everyone: health and education. The Labor Party has fundamentally different views on higher education than the Howard government. My colleague the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Jagajaga, has articulated the difference extremely succinctly in the following comment: `Labor believes that Australia's university system needs vision, investment and longterm reform—not just some mishmash of measures to increase student costs and force universities to fall in with the Howard government's extreme industrial relations agenda.'
Education is the mortar that holds together the bricks of nation building. Education is responsible for creating the vision, designing it and putting it together. It is the driver of change. Without a world-class education system, there will be serious economic and social effects. It should be the aim of government, regardless of political persuasion, to ensure that Australia's education system is a world leader. Labor sees all forms of education as an investment in the skills, knowledge and employment of the nation; this should be recognised. People with TAFE and university qualifications are more likely to get a good job and to contribute to social and economic development. 
This all seems pretty clear cut, so why is there a difference of opinion between the Labor Party and the Howard Liberal government? The answer is quite simple: a conservative government is scared of change; it stands for the status quo. This Liberal government is scared that, by educating our young people, we will somehow change the social fabric of the nation. It seems scared that, if children from disadvantaged families are educated, they will ask, `Why am I disadvantaged? What can I do to make sure that I am not disadvantaged? How can I change society so that I am not disadvantaged?' So how do conservative governments manage this problem? We only have to look at the current state of our higher education system to get some idea of their strategy. The easiest way is to make it economically impossible for families on low incomes to properly educate their children. This is what the changes introduced by the federal Minister for Education, Science and Training, the member for Bradfield, essentially do.
The problem for this government is that the Australian electorate is a lot more sophisticated than it thinks. People are not mugs. They will not take long to realise that this government has the policy aim of making students and their families pay more. My personal philosophical view is that there should be universal free education. Unfortunately reality dictates that students should contribute to the cost of their university study. That is why Labor introduced the Higher Education Contributions Scheme (HECS) in 1989. Although it was criticised by students at the time, it is generally accepted now that HECS is a reasonably fair way to ensure that people contribute towards the cost of their education.
But HECS has been bastardised by this government. Since 1996 we have seen this government change thresholds, increase the rate of payment and make a whole range of other changes that have increased the burden on students and their families. Students and their families already contribute a substantial amount to the cost of study. Student fees and charges make up nearly 40 per cent of university education costs, up from 25 per cent in 1996. Continuing to increase these contribution levels creates the risk of turning too many Australians away from university. Labor see university income as a shared investment that has important public as well as personal benefits.
What is the current situation? I will outline the problems facing the sector and also examine the effectiveness of the Howard government's response to these problems. Oppositions are often criticised for not offering a different policy alternative. In this debate I will outline what Labor would do if we were elected at the next election. There are not enough HECS places in our higher education institutions. Too many talented young people are missing out on university places. Each year, over 20,000 Australians miss out on studying at university even though they are capable, qualified and motivated to further their education. So over a five-year period, 100,000 people are being denied the chance to make a meaningful contribution to our society, and our society is being denied their contribution. 
How do we compare with our major trading partners and competitors? According to the OECD's Education at a glance: 2003 report, Australia has the second lowest increase in the OECD in the rate of enrolment in universities. This is a disgrace and it is an indictment of the policies of this government. How is this in the national interest? It is a fact that universities are being forced to cut around 6,000 HECS places by 2007 because the Howard government is not properly funding education. After 2007, publicly funded places will not even keep pace with population growth. A diminishing proportion of Australians will be going to university, due to the Howard government's policies.
What will Labor do to address this serious problem? The Deputy Leader of the Opposition recently released a policy called Aim Higher. This policy is available on the ALP web site at www.alp.com. I will just give my constituents a brief overview of the policy. Labor will expand the opportunities to get a TAFE or university qualification by creating 21,660 new full- and part-time commencing university places each year by 2008, to be distributed throughout Australia; create 20,000 new full- and part-time commencing TAFE places each year by 2008, to be distributed throughout Australia; and provide $35 million to support secondary school students from disadvantaged backgrounds to progress to university or TAFE.
Labor will ensure fair access to affordable tertiary education by not increasing Higher Education Contribution Scheme—HECS—fees, by not deregulating HECS fees, by not introducing real rates of interest on loans for postgraduate courses, by abolishing full fees for all new domestic undergraduate students, by relieving the financial burden on students and new graduates by extending rent assistance to Austudy recipients, and by reducing the age of independence for students on Youth Allowance to 24 in 2005 and 23 in 2007. Labor will also increase the HECS repayment threshold to $35,000 per annum in 2004 and address national skill shortages through a variety of measures, including reducing HECS fees for science and mathematics students and funding extra places for teaching and nursing. These are only a few of the measures that Labor have outlined in our Aim Higher package.
Our education system needs a boost. I would like to quote from a media release from the Australian Council of State School Organisations:
Governments have a primary responsibility to address educational disadvantage—not ideological preoccupations. What we urgently need is a coordinated approach by all Ministers to put in place funding policies that close the resource gap between the educationally rich and poor. When total funding for non-government schools is greater than that provided to our universities then it really is time to take a very hard look at the way governments distribute their educational dollars and the accountability required by taxpayers from those receiving that government funding.
We do need to close that gap. If we do not close that gap now, it will become insurmountable for a lot of families. This would be a national tragedy.
Let me localise this debate for a moment. I do not have a university campus in my electorate of Stirling, but this does not mean that my constituents do not participate or have not participated in higher education. At the time of the 2001 census, 5,460 of my constituents were studying at university or another type of tertiary institution, and a further 3,975 of my constituents were studying at a TAFE. If you add these figures together, the total is over 10 per cent of the total number of electors in the Stirling electorate. This is a large percentage of people to kick—but kicking them is exactly what this government is doing through its introduction of full fee places. These are great for those who can afford them, but for those who cannot it sets the bar even higher, especially in cases where universities are going to be able to charge fees on top of HECS places offered. This will create a two-tiered higher education system. 
How does this affect Stirling families? Most of my constituents have heard about the $100,000 degrees that these changes will introduce. I recently visited some students at Balcatta Senior High School and Tuart College with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Jenny Macklin. At both of these institutions we had sit-down discussions with year 12 students. I was amazed by some of the students' comments; they were saying exactly what Labor had been saying. They identified the concerns that I am trying to highlight in this debate. How can they afford this education? The simple answer is that they cannot.
What these changes will do is increase the burden on the family unit. Kids will have to stay at home longer because they will not be able to afford to live away from home. We are already seeing children stay at home longer; this will just exacerbate this trend and put a further financial burden on parents. As a mother of two children who have studied and are still studying at university I know first-hand that this can be a financial strain. The loan proposals of this government also need some serious scrutiny. Unlike the current HECS system, in which money is paid back through a person's tax, this scheme is more like a commercial loan. The fact that commercial interest rates are going to be charged raises serious issues about how this loan is going to be treated.
I am extremely concerned that the following scenario may occur. A student leaves home at 23 with a law degree and decides to buy their first home. The student goes to the bank and is refused a loan because a $100,000 student loan exists and the bank says the student has to repay that loan before being able to get a loan for their first house. What is the solution? Under this Liberal scheme the student is forced to live at home for another seven years until he or she has paid the loan off. Again the poor parents have the financial strain of their child living at home until the parents are close to retirement age. Not many families in my electorate would be able to afford this situation. This government's package not only makes it impossible for low-income families to send their kids to university or TAFE, it also makes it difficult for middle-income families. There are many other issues I could go into, such as the university in Western Australia cutting courses for small numbers. If the government is serious about higher education, it will support Labor's foreshadowed amendments. With those amendments I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2003-10-15,"—I support the shadow minister's foreshadowed amendments and oppose the Higher Education Support Bill 2003 and the Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003 and register the protest of thousands of high school students, university students and hardworking families in my electorate of Lowe and across Australia, who are deeply disturbed that, as a result of this bill and the Howard government's failure to adequately support and invest in higher education, their children will not receive the educational opportunities they once possessed.
Shamefully, the Howard government is determined to withdraw its commitment to affordable and fair access for all Australians to opportunities for higher education—opportunities in higher education that Australian parents understand are crucial to realising their children's potential and that Australian industry understands are essential to Australia's future prosperity. I am saddened and disappointed but not surprised by the government's decision to cut investment in higher education in Australia. I am shocked by the government's decision to severely increase the cost burden on students and their families, which will limit the number of public university places and replace those enrolments with an American style system where money, more than marks, opens university doors. 
That is why I am pleased to support the substantive amendments to be moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and shadow minister for employment, education and training, Jenny Macklin, which remove the worst aspects of the proposed legislation and give effect to key elements of the opposition's education and training policy, Aim Higher, which represents an investment in Australia's future by supporting fair and affordable access to higher education. The key elements of our policy include: removing the 30 per cent increase in Higher Education Contribution Scheme fees, removing provisions allowing full fees to be charged to Australian undergraduate students, increasing the number of fully funded and part-time places by 20,000, and increasing the HECS repayment threshold to $35,000 in 2004-05.
Higher education is an investment in Australia's future that should create a work force that can meet the skill and training requirements of Australia's economy and highly specialised work force. Australians expect the government to ensure universities are filled with students with the greatest talent and potential to benefit from that learning experience. A university place is meant to be earned—a reward for student effort and family commitment as measured by results, however imperfect that measure happens to be—not a privilege based only on their ability to pay $50,000 or $100,000 fees. A place in a university should not be conditional upon a student's ability to manage a mortgage-like student fee debt.
The minister for education's answer to my question on notice No. 952 on 22 October last year revealed that almost 7,000 students from my electorate of Lowe already have a HECS debt and, in addition to them, over 11,000 people living in my electorate are repaying a HECS debt. The Howard government has hit these students and their families with a shocking increase in fees and, as a consequence, a debt burden. The government is forcing them to make up for its $5 billion cuts in higher education. Since 1996, student debt has more than doubled and has blown out to more than $9 billion.
Hardworking families in Sydney's inner west and across Australia, who are working to provide their children with the best primary and high school education they can and encouraging their children to study hard, do so expecting their government to at the very least match this commitment and ensure university places are determined by merit not privilege. Shamefully, the Howard government has instead cut investment in higher education and ensured that cost and the ability to pay is a barrier to a university education and that young graduates will spend a large part of their working lives weighed down by a massive, mortgage-like debt.
The consequences of the government's failure to support fair and affordable access to higher education, and the burden this places on students and families, mean more and more young Australians are unable to buy their own home. They are delaying having children, which has given rise to our negative birthrate. This is a serious threat to our economy unless we promote more migration. A Labor government will address Australia's skills shortage by reducing HECS fees for science and mathematics students by $1,600 per year and by funding an additional 1,100 new commencing full-time and part-time undergraduate teaching places. 
Australian families deserve a federal government that will support their children's achievements, not abandon them by creating enormous student debt and ensuring universities have little choice but to charge full fees. Under the Howard government, far too many talented young Australians are missing out on a university place. Universities are being forced to cut around 8,000 HECS places by 2007 because the government is not funding enough places. These bills will ensure there are not enough publicly funded places, making it even harder for those students relying on their talent and hard work for a place and easier for those students lucky enough to be able to afford to pay five- and six-figure fees. This is disgraceful.
The crisis in higher education is explained in the National Union of Students' August 2003 submission to the Senate's inquiry into higher education funding and regulatory legislation. The submission highlights the degree to which the government is increasingly relying on higher student fees and debt:
The share of total university revenue contributed by the Commonwealth fell from 57.2% in 1995 to 43.8% in 2001. 
At the same time:
Treasury has re-calculated that the accumulated study debts on graduates will have reached $13 billion by 2006-7, and will balloon out as more students incur the increased HECS-HELP and FEE-HELP debts.
Unfortunately, the Howard government sees higher education as something which must be reserved for the privileged who can afford to buy one. Australian families in my electorate and across Australia understand that higher education is an investment in the skills, knowledge and employment of young Australians. We share that understanding and will always promote fair and affordable access because Labor believe education is a shared investment, with important public as well as personal benefits. Privately, it means increased skills and better jobs, but there are public benefits for all Australians in higher living standards, business investment and improved productivity.
Labor believe that students should make a contribution to the cost of university study, which is why we introduced the Higher Education Contribution Scheme in 1989. Students and their families already contribute a significant amount to the cost of their education. Student fees and charges make up nearly 40 per cent of universities' income, up from 25 per cent in 1996. The Howard government's main policy objective, as illustrated by these bills, is to make students and their families pay even more.
In contrast, a Labor government will ensure adequate university funding and fair and affordable access for all students. This commitment to support fair and affordable access is acknowledged by the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee in a September 2003 document titled Fairness and flexibility: ensuring sustainable Australian universities for the future—the AVCC response to `Aim higher: learning, training and better jobs for more Australians', the higher education policy of the Australian Labor Party. The fourth paragraph on page 3, titled `Support for access', reads as follows:
A major part of the Labor plan is to increase the number of funded places in universities to meet demand pressures and future expectations for higher education provision. In addition to properly funding 25,000 places (presently partly funded) Labor is committed to funding a further 32,000 places by 2008. This represents a major commitment to access, and should go much of the way to ensure that all eligible Australians can find a suitable university place. 
Australia desperately needs a Labor government to restore merit as the primary criterion for getting a university place and ensure access to university remains affordable. Aim Higher will relieve the financial burden on students and new graduates, address the national skills shortage and ensure higher education is equally and fairly accessible to any student who has achieved the results required, rewarding students and their families for their hard work.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,2003-10-15,"—Never before has a government done so much to hurt so many people for so little in return. Before coming to the chamber to speak on these very important bills—the Higher Education Support Bill 2003 and the Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003—I was trying to crystallise in my mind just what these bills represent, and my opening sentence was the one sentence that kept coming into my mind. Why is it that this government is bent on destroying the future and dumbing down our young people? Every single one of our young people deserves the opportunity and the right to have a decent education, whatever they choose that decent education to be. This government does not have the right to take away from them their hope and their chance to get into university if that is what they want to do—there is no way that this government has the right to do that.
The titles of the Higher Education Support Bill 2003 and the Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003 are more examples of the traditional doublespeak of this government, which gives titles to bills that do not represent in any way, shape or form what the bills are about. These are higher education destroying bills and higher education dumbing-down bills—these bills do nothing to support higher education or the young people of Australia. These bills destroy the great Australian dream that you can do better than your parents did, be the first in your family to go to university and do better than others did before you. That is the great Australian dream and that is what young people want—the opportunity to be able to do that. But there are no measures in these bills at all that go anywhere towards actually being able to deliver that.
Labor, on the other hand, has an alternative—Labor has a solution; Labor has a plan to actually deliver to young people what they deserve. Over the last 7½ years that the Howard government has been in power we have seen an increase in taxes—it is the highest taxing government in history. We pay more for our services, health and education and we get less in return—that is what this government has delivered. It has delivered suffering to ordinary Australian families and suffering to young people who, because they have no choice, are losing their hope and not going to university—this government will not allow them to get there.
The Howard government have cut over $5 billion in funding to education. We are now the sixth lowest country in the OECD when it comes to public spending on education, and that is because the government do not believe in investing in all Australians; they only believe in investing in some Australians—their Australians, not all Australians, as was promised by the Prime Minister when he was first elected. Since the government were elected, costs have risen for students by 85 per cent, class sizes have gone up by 30 per cent and student debt is at a record high of $9 billion and will be climbing in the next few years to $13 billion. This means in practical terms that a young person studying and loading themselves up with the sort of debt that will be necessary for them to be able to go to university will never have the opportunity to buy a home. They will never have that start in life that maybe their parents had or other people have got. 
What do the government do in response to that? They deliver with a gleeful smile a $4 `sandwich and a milkshake' tax cut and say to people, `You should be happy with that; that's all you're going to get'—a measly $4 `sandwich and a milkshake' tax cut, using the words of their own minister at that time.
—When did you last give tax cuts, you mean miser!
—It is a tragedy that this government is putting a tax on education. It is a tax on young people and a tax on our future. As always when I speak on these issues you get a minister in here who gets all upset because they hate hearing the truth and hate being reminded of what they are actually doing. They can do it as long as they put on their earmuffs—just do not tell them too loudly exactly the sort of damage they are doing to young people in this country. 
The Minister for Education, Science and Training turns around and asks, `But why won't Labor support full fee paying places for Australian students? We allow it for overseas students, so why won't you treat Australian students just like overseas students?' We do not want to treat them in the same way, because they are different. Australian students and their families have paid taxes in this country all their lives and Australian students will pay taxes in the future after they graduate—lots of taxes and lots of revenue to the government—
—You are the high-taxing party!
—Overseas students do not pay taxes. They pay a premium to come to this country just to study. That is the difference, Minister—that is what it is about and that is why they should be treated differently. But you probably already know that; you are just never going to admit it publicly. On top of that, what do we see the government doing? What is its incentive? It wants to increase university fees across the board by 30 per cent. It says it is going to cap it at 30 per cent, but it quite cleverly forgot to actually put in the legislation that it is capped. So it is going to run wild, it is going to run free. It will not be just 30 per cent. It will be whatever the vice-chancellors and the universities decide. It is also up to the discretion of the minister. He can direct that entire courses be full fee paying. We also have the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Melbourne saying that university courses will cost $150,000. 
Labor will not stand for this. Labor will not accept that this is the future that young Australians have to live with. This is not the future that their parents have worked hard for—that all Australians have worked hard for. We often hear the minister rambling on in this place about people who will never see the inside of a university. Do you know what their great contribution is? Maybe they will not see the inside of a university, but maybe their children will. There is nothing wrong with that—not everyone has to go to university. But, if they want to do it, they should be given the opportunity, and they should be given that opportunity based on merit—on deserving to go. This is the great Australian way. This is what we are about as a people, a nation and a culture. If you deserve something based on merit you can rise up—you can become anybody you want to become in this country. But you can do that only if you have a government that supports you through legislation and actually does something positive to help you through. That is what this government should be doing—not what it has done with this legislation.
All families want is a fair go. I have not talked yet about the impact on families. If you have a young family with kids growing up and you hope that one day they will go to university—maybe you have not been, but you would probably like your kids to go—what is the impact on you? You had better start saving your money now, as if you were going to buy another house, because that is the sort of money it will take to send your kids to university. Is this the future that we want for our children?  
What Labor will do is abolish the increase in fees. We will make university affordable and we will not support real rates of interest on loans for students. This government wants to slug students. If you are a student and you borrow $50,000, the government wants to slug you with real interest rates, and you will not be able to pay that back until you have paid your HECS; and if you work it out, that is going to take you 20 years. You will be in debt to this government for the rest of your life—but only if you cannot afford it. If you come from the northern suburbs of Sydney and you are rolling in dough, you buy yourself a university degree. You can actually buy yourself one. If your dad is a lawyer or a doctor, then lucky for you. But if your dad is not, then what do you do? You work hard at school and all you ask of the government is that they are supportive and that they give you a chance and a hope. That is all you want. If you work hard and get the grades, you should be given the same opportunity as someone from those rich, northern suburbs of Sydney. Just because they can buy a degree does not mean that you should miss out on a place. That offends me and I know that it offends many families.
What we are talking about is giving people a fair go—a real shot at making a decent life for themselves. We know the statistics. The jobs of the future have not yet been imagined. We do not know what they will be. But I can tell you this: if you work hard at school and you want the opportunity, you should get the opportunity and be allowed to get into university so that you can achieve your dreams and do whatever it is you want to do. If you want to be a doctor or a lawyer—anything you want to do—you should be given that opportunity. If you want to become an apprentice or if you want to get job training, you should be given that opportunity. This government should be supportive of young people and give them the opportunities which they deserve and have worked hard for. As I said before, this is the Australian way, this is the Australian fair go, and this is the fair go that is being ripped away by this government.
Labor will do something positive. Labor will allocate 20,000 new places for TAFE. This is not just about university. Many young people want to go to TAFE and get an apprenticeship. I did one myself. I went through the TAFE system and got myself an apprenticeship, which gave me the base and the ability to go out and do other things. It gave me a rock-solid base of a career and a trade behind me. If it were not for that opportunity, I might never have gone to university. That is all I asked at the time. The only reason I got to university was because we had a HECS system in place that allowed me to go to university and pay it back later through my taxes—which I did happily because it gave me a huge opportunity in life to seek out the things I wanted to do. I want that opportunity for every single child in this country, and this government should not take it away from them.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Jenkins, Harry, MP",ALP,2003-10-15,"—These two pieces of legislation, the Higher Education Support Bill 2003 and the Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003, are part of a package by this government to institute their fundamentally flawed strategy for improvements in Australia's higher education system. They are fundamentally flawed because the prime element is to champion private provision over public provision. That is the clear difference. As in other areas of public policy, that is the clear difference. If we look at health, it is the same story—an emphasis on private provision over public provision. 
Labor do not believe that that is the way to go. Labor believes that higher education is a shared responsibility. We believe that there should be public provision of resources and a responsibility by individuals to make a contribution. But this government, with its expectations of the way in which individuals must provide, has gone too far. Especially since the 1997 increases in HECS, the proportion that we expect to be provided by individuals has become a disincentive.
This whole debate characterises the fundamental differences in the way in which we look at public investment in higher education. The minister would have us believe that, because there is an advantage to individuals, others are being asked to pay through their taxes for something that is purely for the gain of individuals. This decries the notion that an investment in higher education is an investment in a public good. It decries the benefit that arises to the nation out of an investment in its human resources. 
During this debate today—and as we go forward into an election where this will be one of the topics of discussion and one of the things that help people make decisions about their vote—we see this basic difference: a lack of understanding that, through the involvement of government in properly resourcing the higher education sector, we are increasing Australia's advantage in a whole host of areas. We decry the view that an investment in our human capital is of the same nature as our investment in physical and other capital. I find the most infuriating and annoying aspect of the debate is that the government genuinely cannot see the outcome of a properly funded higher education system.
Labor support a merit based education system whilst believing that people who face disadvantage have an equal opportunity to access education. The Howard government are stopping thousands of Australians who are capable, qualified and motivated from realising their potential and gaining the skills and education they need for better job opportunities. As I have said, Labor see higher education as a shared investment which has important public as well as personal benefits. Why should it be that this package is based on somebody having the ability to pay, and therefore the ability to access education, to get that personal benefit? As a result of the initiatives back in the Whitlam days, we saw higher education as something the whole community could aspire to. As has been said in this debate, many people who are at universities today are the first generation of their families to have access to universities. If we increase the impost on that generation, regrettably they may be the only generation of those families to have access to higher education.
As the opposition have emphasised throughout this debate, further education—whether it be TAFE, university or even courses at a community level, such as the University of the Third Age—is all part of lifelong learning. We recognise the importance of education being a continuum and, that we should not look upon each of these stages or each part of a person's education as being the be-all and end-all. As has been stated on many occasions, students who are embarking upon their early primary education will end up in jobs that we have not even thought of. But once they get into the work force they are likely to have a working life that is characterised by changes of job. For each of those changes they will require an upgrade of their skills or will need to learn new skills. At this point in time we are preparing students through primary and secondary education to have continuing lifelong education. 
Regrettably, since 1998, full fee payers have been able to buy a university place ahead of people with higher marks. Now the government proposes through these measures to allow universities to increase the cost of HECS courses by 30 per cent and to double the allowable number of full fee places by 50 per cent. Student fees and charges already constitute 40 per cent of Victorian universities' income and, on a national level, 37 per cent of universities' income. Students are already paying for this government's failure to properly fund higher education. The government wants to introduce a loan scheme, called HELP. Help? It is far from being a help. The Higher Education Loans Program, with a six per cent interest rate, will not encourage more Australians to pay full fees, as is its purpose. 
The Australian Nursing Federation has expressed its concern that under the government's proposals nurses who go on to specialise in areas such as midwifery, mental health or emergency nursing could face debts of $37,800 or more, adding to the already adverse effects that the current education debt is having on specialist nursing numbers and Australia's health system. Remember that this $37,800 debt arises as students are obliged to repay their outstanding HECS debt first, before they can gain access to the full fee loan that they would be taking out for their postgraduate qualifications. It is a full fee loan that would grow at six per cent a year. That means somebody studying for a specialist nursing degree would have to pay over $4,300 in interest alone, over and above the cost of living. Postgraduate degrees allow people to refine and specialise their skills. Having to pay market interest rates could hardly be a bigger disincentive to upskilling. Remember these people are likely to be doing it at a time when they are still juggling other commitments family and work. 
Australia has severe skill shortages in a number of industries. We only have to look at the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations' own figures. In a document for 2003, areas such as nursing, teaching, multimedia, vehicle trades and metalwork are highlighted. There is hardly a speciality that is not listed in this National and State Skill Shortage List for Australia 2003. Let us look at secondary teachers: manual arts textile studies, math, physics, chemistry and general science are listed. Today the Science Meets Parliament program is in Parliament House. An article in the Canberra Times, headed `Science degrees in decline: report', states:
A leaked draft of a Federal Government report on science and innovation admits that there has been a “relative and absolute decline” in university degrees in science and engineering since 1995.
...	...	...
It ranks Australia 16th among OECD countries for gross expenditure on research and development relative to its Gross Domestic Product. 
The reports says that the impact on the quality of Australian science has declined relative to other countries. Science should be something that we celebrate. It is an area of endeavour that Australia has a fine record in.
There are other measures that we can talk about in the context of this debate. The opposition, through our policy Aim Higher, have set out a whole raft of measures that we see as being very important to the way in which we develop our skills as a nation. This legislation does not go to those areas. It does not go to the areas which we see as being very important, such as increasing the numbers of nursing students and increasing the numbers of teaching students and the types of things that would address those shortages. It does not recognise the community benefit of institutions like those immediately in the area of my electorate—RMIT Bundoora Campus and La Trobe University—and the way in which they impact upon the local regional economy. 
Labor recognises that in outer suburban areas like the electorate of Scullin universities are key elements in the way in which local economies develop. Through the community engagement fund that we have outlined in Aim Higher we would establish a $150 million fund to support regional, rural and outer suburban institutions in leadership roles in their local communities. That is so important. The nursing faculty of RMIT has a relationship with the Northern Hospital to teach graduate diploma students. There is a win-win benefit for both those institutions.
Simply put, this package is fundamentally flawed. It does not address the types of ills that have developed in higher education in Australia. It does not redress the $5 billion worth of federal government resources that have been ripped out of the sector. It is something that we reject and unless these pieces of legislation are dramatically amended we will oppose them not only in this House but also in the other place because they do nothing to benefit Australia as a whole or the individuals that aspire to higher education.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Windsor, Antony, MP",IND,2003-10-15,"—I rise tonight to speak on the Higher Education Support Bill 2003 and the Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003. I must say that I am disappointed. I had assumed from the early discussions that were taking place in relation to this legislation that the government's intention was one of real reform to a process that has been wound down over many years. Most people, including the government, would recognise that there has been a withdrawal of something like $5 billion in funds since 1996 from the tertiary education sector.
Very early on in the piece it was said by the minister and others that the intention of the reform process was to improve the lot of universities so that they would be better off under the reform document than they are at present. Sadly, that is not the case, and I will spend a little time talking about the university within my electorate—the University of New England.
—A fine university.
—It is a fine university, as the honourable member mentions. I had the privilege of being able to attend that university and I have a son who is attending that university currently. I also happen to be on the council of that university, which is one of the things that the legislation would like to take care of—it would remove politicians from the councils and the governance of universities.
But before talking about those sorts of things, we all should agree—we say in public, anyway—that education and health are the prime priorities of government, of this parliament and of ourselves as parents and members of society. Particularly given that we are in Anti-Poverty Week—and I spoke to the various health professionals at a conference on Monday in relation to some of these issues—we would all agree that education provides the opportunity for people to remove themselves from the poverty trap. Education, as many members have said—both on the government and opposition sides—is an investment in our children's futures. It is an investment in human capital.
Even if we take a fairly economic line in relation to the way we look at education, if you invest in human capital and those people go on to have income levels above the norm they become contributors to the taxation system and there are quite massive returns in the economic sense. But we should look at education in a far broader way and look at the opportunities that it gives our children. Given the chance, people who may not otherwise be able to attend tertiary education facilities gain an opportunity to move on in life. I was one of those students, I guess. I lost my father when I was young. Not coming from a very wealthy family, I was fortunate enough to obtain a Commonwealth scholarship in 1969 and attended the University of New England, which gave me a whole range of opportunities and opened a number of avenues to where I could go in life. In that sense, I would be hypocritical if I in fact supported this legislation—and I will not be supporting this legislation. 
There are a number of features in the legislation that make it doomed to fail not only in this chamber but in the other chamber as well. These include the tying of some of the industrial relations arrangements, the student union arrangements and even some of the governance arrangements—which are a state responsibility—to funding. The involvement of those three things, which really should be separate to the heart of the legislation—which is about funding for the future of these universities—should have been handled in a different fashion.
I feel a little sorry for the minister, Brendan Nelson, because he has been railroaded a bit on these particular bills because there is some philosophical dogma running through the legislation. Tying the $404 million funding block grants to the acceptance by universities of some sort of strategy to deliver industrial reform is not really what we should be debating here tonight in terms of the substance of this legislation.
I think, rather sadly, that someone within the government has determined that they are going to introduce a piece of legislation which has some money tied to it—which the universities are crying out for because they have been underfunded for many years. By tying some of these other provisions to the bills, we will see the legislation fail in the Senate in the form it is in at the moment, and that will obviously create some pain. I do not think there is any way in the world that this legislation, even in a modified form, will be available for universities to move into the next year. I think this legislation is doomed to fail in its current form, and that is very sad. If it had been attacked in other directions and the industrial relations reforms—the student unionism reforms—were addressed in other forms, maybe the legislation would have had a better chance of getting through. In my view, this legislation creates a two-tiered system. Particularly in regional Australia, we are seeing too much of that at the moment.
—I wonder what Peter and Lindy think about it.
—That would depend very much on the income circumstances of Peter and Lindy. Peter and Lindy have two children—one who was identified today: a boy child called Ronnie, apparently. If they lived west of Narrabri, for instance, and they sent young Ronnie to the University of New England—
 (Ms Gambaro)—Member for New England, bring it back to the topic.
—If they sent Ronnie to the University of New England, they would have some large accommodation expenses at the university. There are costs that country families have in relation to sending their children to university and there are also administrative costs that universities in the country have which are quite different from the costs of universities in the major metropolitan areas—the big eight. I appreciate that the Minister for Education, Science and Training has tried to address those costs through some of the transitional fund arrangements and also the regional loading but, as more and more people get put into the regional loading arrangements, it will be difficult to ascertain whether universities are going to be better or worse off than they were before. 
On the surface it seems that the University of New England will in fact be worse off, particularly if the industrial relations component of the legislation does not get through the parliament—and I do not think it has any chance in Hades of getting through the Senate. That would mean that the University of New England would be worse off under this legislation than it is currently. For that reason alone, I will not be able to support the legislation. I do however thank the minister for his attempts to remedy the regional loading and for the inclusion of external students, to which the University of New England is a major contributor through its distance education. When we ran the numbers, we saw that did have a significant influence on the viability of the university. It has made a significant difference, but not significant enough to make this package represent what was promised six to 12 months ago—that all universities would be much better off under the reform process—and that is sad.
We are talking about $1.5 billion in funding over four years. But that is an absolute pittance. When you have had the extraction of $5 billion over the last seven years, we are not even talking about $400 million a year to go into the system. Currently we are looking at a surplus of somewhere between $5 billion and $7.5 billion that could be available to be spent. I would have thought that the key area that the government would be concentrating on—and a way in which they could actually get this legislation through the parliament—would be to start putting more money into the higher education sector.
It is obviously not enough money in terms of the block grants and the regional loading provisions. It relies very heavily on the capacity of families and students to pay increased fees. In that sense, it runs the risk not only of creating a two-tiered system, because the elite students from country areas will be the ones who will be attracted to the major metropolitan areas, but also of the universities that feel that they cannot increase the fees by the 30 per cent limit being seen as the poorer cousins. That leads into a spiral of not being able to attract the elite teaching professionals and not having the capacity to pay, and we end up with this almost self-fulfilling prophecy of the feedlot in terms of education. I do not think the big eight would be terribly opposed to that. They would probably suggest: `Why don't we close some of these smaller universities and they can all come to Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane and be educated there?' I think it is a very sad view of the future if we do in fact go down that road.
There are a number of issues that I will go through. I spoke of the regional loading. It has improved but should at least be doubled. The governance provisions are doomed to fail once again. I do not have a particular problem if I am thrown off the university council as a representative, but I do not see that having a couple of members of parliament on a university council is necessarily a bad thing. I think it gives input from the governments of the states in which those universities reside. I see that as a red herring and it probably will be thrown out in the Senate as some sort of bargaining chip. Tying industrial relations to the grant funding is, to start with, fairly stupid. I think even most of the vice-chancellors are opposed to that. All it will do is infuriate a lot of people who can make flexible contractual arrangements and other arrangements about their employment anyway. 
The students, in particular, have problems with the increases in the HECS fees and some of the loan arrangements—but I will not get into that. I know there is a lot of concern about the capacity for the government to involve itself in the course mix arrangements of universities. It seems to be a bit of an indicator of this current government's position on controlling various agendas. I would have thought that encouraging universities to be places where students have the freedom to learn, to express themselves and to look at a whole range of issues during that particular part of their lives would be something that all governments would be pursuing. What we seem to have here is a control mechanism being imposed on the availability of courses—a whole range of checks, blockages and control mechanisms to be built into the system through this legislation.
Indexation is another issue that has been raised by the vice-chancellors in particular. It seems odd that for school funding we have an indexation factor of 5.8 per cent whereas for universities it is something like 2.1 per cent. That needs to be remedied; otherwise in a few years time we will all be back here again arguing the same sorts of things about the smaller universities not being able to survive and the bigger ones not having enough freedom—we will have to go through the whole arrangement again.
I congratulate the minister on attempting to come to grips with overenrolment. I think there are something like 12,000 new places in this package. The government has extended the tolerance band from two to five per cent which will make a difference to a number of universities and is a positive step. Student unionism, as I have mentioned before, is going to be negotiated in the Senate. Why it is here to start with is beyond me—I guess it is an overhang from Tony Abbott. The student body at the University of New England, for instance, has done a tremendous amount of work. It is a commercial body that has injected an enormous amount of capital. It has provided not only jobs for many students but also cinemas, and it owns one of the hotels. It has been a very successful commercial operation, and I am sure that the majority of students at that university are quite comfortable with the arrangements.
I have never been a member of a union and I am not particularly fussed with unions, but I do not see student unionism in the same light as some people who see student unions as being some sort of trade unions. I think they are completely different, particularly in regional circumstances where they make an enormous contribution to the operation of some of the other facilities at universities. I understand that the opposition is proposing some amendments. I will be looking very closely at those amendments and possibly supporting some. I make it quite plain to my electorate and to the parliament that I will be opposing the legislation.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"O'Byrne, Michelle, MP",ALP,2003-10-15,"—New York Supreme Court Judge, Justice Leland DeGrasse, once said:
Poverty, race, ethnicity and immigration status are not in themselves determinative of student achievement. Demography is not destiny. The amount of melanin in a student's skin, the home country of her antecedents, the amount of money in the family bank account, are not the inexorable determinants of academic success.
I believe that Justice DeGrasse would be as disappointed with this government's attempt at higher education reform in Australia as many Australian's currently are. Labor does not support this legislation—the Higher Education Support Bill 2003 and the Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003—in its current form and will only support it with significant amendments. These amendments include: the removal of the proposal to deregulate university fees, the removal of the provisions allowing full fees to be charged to Australian undergraduate students, increases in the number of funded places, the removal of the industrial relations conditions on Commonwealth Grants Scheme funding, and an increase of the HECS repayment threshold to $35,000. 
Contrary to the government's hollow arguments about the need for greater flexibility in university regulation, this legislation centralises control. It gives the minister increased and disproportionate discretionary powers. Members of this House who have already spoken have identified the biggest impacting factor on students as the proposal to deregulate the Higher Education Contribution Scheme fees. This will allow universities to set their fees at a rate that is 30 per cent higher than the current capped rates. Such an increase will rule out the chance of a university education for many from low-income families. I am the product of one of those families—my father was a painter and my mum was a cleaner. The first members of my family to go to university were my brothers and I. We would not have had that opportunity if we had had to pay these sorts of fees.
The cost of tertiary education has meant that students will incur a dramatically increased debt if they go to university. Debts hanging over students for many years will undoubtedly have an impact on their ability to make financial investment decisions later in life. This is not the first time that this crowd has hiked up university fees. This government has already increased HECS fees by 85 per cent since 1996 and now it wants to slug students and their families with an additional 30 per cent increase in fees. This is almost a doubling of fees in only seven years.
I, along with the shadow minister for education, employment and training, recently had the opportunity to speak to a group of year 11 and 12 students in my electorate about what they believed to be the biggest concerns in choosing how they were going to manage their further education. Overwhelmingly, they told us that it was not their academic performances, or even the academic performance of tertiary institutions, that were the defining factors in their choices; it was the cost and whether their parents could afford to help them. Too many Tasmanian families are feeling that they are failing their children because their bank balance just does not add up to what this government is going to require. Some students said, `I've got two or three older brothers and sisters and there is no way my parents will be able to afford to pay for all of us so it is just not an option.' This should serve as a wake-up call to this government.
Students and their families need assistance, not a government that is out of touch and uncompromising. Students need financial support to help them achieve their goals, not major increases in fees that will place them further and further in debt before they even have an opportunity to start their adult lives. In my electorate of Bass only 30 per cent of students in matriculation go on to university. This is in comparison to some wealthier cities where many schools have 90 per cent or more of their students going on to university. This increase in the amount that students and their families are expected to pay comes on the back of figures recently released by the Commonwealth Department of Education, Science and Training which show that students are already propping up universities financially because of increasing funding cuts by the Howard government. Student contributions as a proportion of universities' income rose from 25 per cent in 1996 to 37 per cent in 2002. If further fees are imposed then these figures show that student fees and charges will eventually overtake government funding as the single greatest component of universities' revenue. 
At the same time, government funding fell from 57 per cent in 1996 to 40 per cent in 2002—the lowest level of government contribution since the Commonwealth government assumed responsibility for higher education. The DEST figures show that more than half of the surplus of the education sector is concentrated in four city based universities, while the combined income of every other university in Australia has gone backwards by $200 million.
Of the two tertiary institutions in Bass, one, the Australian Maritime College, has joined the esteemed group of eight universities which recorded a deficit, making this the second largest number of universities to record a deficit in the last decade. The other tertiary institution, the University of Tasmania, is on the verge of recording a deficit and has a surplus of less than $1 million. The figures have shown that the AMC is losing $3.6 million of its $10.8 million in funding a year, and there is no way that this highly internationally recognised facility can sustain its high level of education and remain viable with these sorts of cuts. If these cuts happen, it will not only affect the students and staff at the AMC but also have a profound impact on Australia's maritime industry.
In the recent Senate inquiry the University of Tasmania Vice-Chancellor, Daryl Le Grew, made some interesting points in evidence. He said:
We have argued long and hard that the University of Tasmania has not had its fair share of university places on a population basis.
	...	...	...
We are still unhappy about the equity provisions of the package. We have special problems in Tasmania. I think everybody understands that there is a special character to the distribution of the Tasmanian population, and the regional outreach of the university needs special support.
Whatever happened to the idea of Australians valuing education as a right and not a privilege for the select few in society who can actually afford to put up with the government's funding failures? Labor's Aim Higher policy will reverse the trend by investing $2.34 billion to rebuild universities and provide increased public investment for every university and no increases in student fees.
Australia's universities are in crisis, with equitable access to education becoming another chapter in history as we watch this government continue its slash and burn agenda on university funding. Australian universities are struggling. They are struggling to meet the demand of places for students and they are struggling to deliver the type of educational standard that we have come to expect. In Tasmania there is a 36 per cent increase in the ratio of students to staff, and I understand that in some other areas that ratio has increased to levels approaching 80 per cent. Surely the government can see that cutting university funding has a direct result on the standard and level of staffing and the standard and level of education and tuition that these educators can deliver. It means that classrooms are overcrowded, infrastructure is deteriorating and access to appropriate resources is in serious decline.
Another concerning aspect of this bill—and the previous speaker, the member for New England, made some comments on this—is the proposal to implement industrial conditions on university reforms. These conditions, in effect, will link university funding to industrial reform, and universities that do not abide by these reforms will risk losing their funding. This is forcing universities to put harsh industrial relations practices and requirements ahead of what they want to do, which is improve teaching, improve learning and improve research. 
What sort of agreement is this? Months of discussions between universities and unions broke down because the former Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations hijacked $404 million of Commonwealth university funding. Hopefully the new minister will leave university staff and management to progress their own industrial discussions and agreements. This type of action by a minister is effectively blackmail. The former minister wanted to blackmail universities into implementing his extreme industrial relations agenda, and he was planning on using university funding as a ransom in his war on working conditions. The really interesting question is: where was the Minister for Education, Science and Training during all of this? We did not hear a word from him. He should be standing up for universities, and instead he stood back and let the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations use university funding as a political football. It is now time to stand up and say: `Enough; enough to increases in fees, enough to further reductions in university places, enough of unmanageable tutorial sizes, and enough of slugging essential university services in order to reduce costs.'
In the recent Senate inquiry, Professor Le Grew from the University of Tasmania said:
... I would like to point to the lack of provision for anything after 2007. Are we going to go into another period of systematic decline? ... What the universities are looking for is something that actually allows us to plan over a decade because that is the time line for getting new courses up and running with graduates coming through the other end, with research projects maturing and so on. We simply do not have a year-by-year or even a three-year planning cycle; we have a five- to 10-year planning cycle and we need to at least have a mechanism for dealing with that.
If university funding continues to decline it will be an even more elite group of Australians that will have access to tertiary education. At the moment the government is continuing to decrease funding and increase the number of full fee paying students, meaning that half of all university places could go to people who buy their way in. Where does merit fit into the government's agenda? It is unfair that wealthy children are encouraged to take an education for granted but students who earn a place but cannot pay $100,000 for a degree must forget their education dreams, and the dreams of their parents, because their place has been taken by someone who can afford to pay for it.
The education minister got his education for free, and now he wants to reduce access to education to only the wealthy, perhaps only those who associate with his new found political associates. Education is the basis for a developing society, and we need to fight to make sure that our universities are accessible to everyone—to smart kids from ordinary families as well as the wealthy.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Price, Roger, MP",ALP,2003-10-15,"—It is a unique distinction to be the last speaker on the Higher Education Support Bill 2003 and the Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003. From the outset I want to say to the House and again place on the public record that I am inordinately proud of the University of Western Sydney. I am very critical of the University of Western Sydney at times only because I have the highest expectations of it, and I think that the good folk of the University of Western Sydney understand where I am coming from.
As I have said before, the University of Western Sydney services one of the fastest growing regions in this country. Its six campuses cater for 10 per cent of the Australian population. It is now the seventh largest university in Australia, with more than 35,000 students enrolled in 2003. More than 70 per cent of the students come from the greater west of Sydney, and nearly 60 per cent of those students are mature age students. In most cases they move into the work force immediately after leaving school to raise sufficient funds to undertake tertiary study. They may not be well off financially, but they are certainly well motivated; they are determined to get to university. 
Clearly the University of Western Sydney is doing a great job servicing its community, but the government's higher education package has placed the University of Western Sydney in an unenviable position. The malaise in higher education has not developed overnight; it is a product of more than seven years of neglect from the Howard government. Savage budget cuts have taken their toll, with the end result that thousands of young Australians are missing out on a university place.
Each year 20,000 qualified Australians miss out on a place at university. In 2003 the University of Western Sydney turned away 2,700 qualified students—that is, people who were eligible for a university place but who were turned away because of a lack of funded places. This is a tragedy. Of the 2,700 who were turned away, 70 per cent were mature age students—people who are showing great courage in later life, people who are determined improve their qualifications and employability. And what are we doing? We are closing the door on them. It is not as if we in Western Sydney have more than our fair share of university students. The reverse is the case. The participation rate of people from Western Sydney who go to university is now starting to decline. That is the sorry record of the Howard government: university participation rates in Western Sydney are starting to track down.
The government is taking action on overenrolment. The overenrolment system was a complete disaster. The scheme allowed universities to fund admissions above the Commonwealth quota at 25 per cent of the fully funded cost of university places. The end result was a skewing of student to staff ratios and a potential for erosion in the quality of education that institutions have been able to offer. Now the government is forcing the university to ditch those places. Almost 400 places at the University of Western Sydney are now destined for the scrap heap as a result of this appalling decision. In the first instance, 2,700 qualified students were turned away and now there is an additional loss of 400 places—3,100 places in total. We can ill afford this. The decision makes it even more difficult for school leavers in Chifley or mature age students to gain entry to a university course.
I well remember the controversy surrounding the Labor government's decision to introduce HECS. There were many arguments, many demonstrations, many representations and, even within the Labor Party and the Labor movement, a clash of views and ideals about the proposal. To give credit to the opposition of the day, they supported the proposal. What was the key thing underpinning HECS? Yes, we were asking people to make a contribution towards the cost of their university fees. They only became liable for that contribution when they were earning a certain amount of money. Every dollar and cent of HECS was put back into the system to expand it, to make even more places. And what is the central tenet underpinning this government's reform package? It is to increase the quantum or allow the universities to increase the quantum of HECS by up to 30 per cent in all undergraduate courses. I have said before in this House that people in Western Sydney are relatively debt averse. Compared to other universities, the University of Western Sydney has a higher rate of students paying HECS up front, because they do not like being saddled and burdened with debts. If you start increasing the HECS debt, you turn away more students. Already 3,100 students were effectively turned away, and now there will be more. 
Unlike the sandstone universities, like the University of Sydney and the University of New South Wales, new generation universities already start at a disadvantage. From all sources of funding, including the Commonwealth, including the universities' own investments and fees—all sorts of revenue—the sandstone universities effectively have $26,000 per student. What is the comparative figure for a non-sandstone university—not the super 8, but all the rest like the University of Western Sydney? It is $11,000.
There is no argument that the University of New South Wales and the University of Sydney are going to quite easily be able to increase their HECS fees by 30 per cent and still survive. But the University of Western Sydney is in a dilemma, because it knows that every time it seeks to increase the amount of HECS it will be a barrier to some students. But it also knows that it suffers disadvantage by comparison to the other universities. Therefore, if it fails to increase the HECS levels, the quality of teaching may suffer—and that is the last thing we want. By proposing to increase fees by 30 per cent, students could run up debts of $50,000—arts degrees could set students back $15,000; science, $21,000; and I have not tried to calculate the cost of combined degrees. Student contributions already make up close to 40 per cent of total income for universities, up from 25 per cent in 1996. The government always likes these comparisons. Let me give you one, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley: student contributions for the universities servicing your part of the world are up from 25 per cent in 1996 to 40 per cent—and rising.
The minister for education makes great play of the fact that we initiated the scheme to allow overseas students to come into this country and pay full fees. He says it disadvantages Australian students not to allow up to 50 per cent of places to be reserved for full fee paying students, including Australian students. The point that you need to make is that overseas students, or their parents, do not pay income tax or GST or the milk levy that you have put on, Mr Deputy Speaker, or the sugar levy that you have put on, Mr Deputy Speaker, or any of the other charges that have been increased as a result of the Howard government. Having paying overseas students is quite reasonable, and a whole export market in tertiary education has been developed. But it is anathema to me to have or to support a system whereby Australian students get into their places of learning based on their parents' cheque book, bank balance or assets rather than on merit and ability. In other words, if a very worthy person in my electorate were competing for a university place, I would like to see the ground rules being those of merit, so that they are not bumped out by someone from the North Shore or the eastern suburbs of Sydney—or anywhere else for that matter—whose parents can write out a cheque. There was a lot more that I wanted to contribute, but I understand that time is limited in the debate, so I will conclude my remarks at this point.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Nelson, Dr Brendan, MP",LP,2003-10-15,"—I thank all of those members of the House who have made a contribution to this very important debate on the Higher Education Support Bill 2003 and the Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003. This is all about Australia's future. The kind of country that the next generation and subsequent ones will live in will be determined in a very large way by what happens in Australian higher education, and that is why it is important. Whilst I, on behalf of the government, disagree with many of the contributions from the other side, I nonetheless respect the sincerity with which many of the arguments have been put—though, unfortunately, in many cases they were not founded in fact. I would particularly like to thank the member for Macquarie, who I thought made an outstanding contribution to the debate. 
There are a number of things that I would like to focus on in summing up that are important. One thing is to go back to why the government is even considering changing higher education. The changes are important for a number of reasons. The first reason is that there is a need for Australian higher education to have access to considerably more money—a lot more of it—in the longer term. Whilst there is no immediate crisis facing Australian higher education, as Professor Gerard Sutton, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Wollongong, said in speaking to the Bulletin a couple of months ago, if these reforms are not passed there will be a genuine crisis in higher education. The second reason for needing change is that money is only half of the problem facing the sector. The way in which universities are governed, regulated and administered by both the government and the institutions themselves is as much a part of the problem. If any government were to simply increase resources to universities without addressing their regulation and administration, it would be doing a great disservice to the sector—as indeed would a government that simply undertook regulatory reform without increasing financing.
The other thing that many of us might not necessarily like but which is a reality we, and our children even more so, face is that, increasingly, the only benchmarks against which higher education in this country is going to be judged are international ones. Whereas once—perhaps when you and I were growing up, Mr Deputy Speaker—it was important to know where your institution was rated in New South Wales or in Australia, the interest now is increasingly in where an institution rates internationally. The reality that we face today is that some of the best students in this country are being recruited to North American, Singaporean and some European institutions on the basis that if they want to have `an education in a world-class university' that is where they are going to have to go.
What the government has proposed in these bills is to increase the public investment by the Australian taxpayer by $1½ billion in the first four years. Contrary to what has been said by some, there is an increase in publicly funded HECS places in Australian higher education. The government is proposing to fully fund 25,000 overenrolled, marginally funded places over the first four years at a cost of $347 million. In addition to that, there will be another 6,500 fully funded HECS places in the first five years. It also ought to be remembered that every one of the vice-chancellors of Australia's universities said that, in order to have a world-class higher education sector, HECS flexibility is important; that each university and university council should determine the value of the course to the students who will go through as graduates and the socioeconomic profile of the communities from which those students come; and, for the very first time, that there would be a situation created where the HECS charge for a course in one university would be different from that in another. These reforms increase the funding for regional universities and campuses by $122 million, increase funding for the education of teachers and nurses, and make sure that there are scholarships available—$161 million worth of scholarships; 25,100 scholarships in the first four years of the package. That specifically addresses the real problem that faces students when they get to university. 
Whether you come from a high- or low-income family, HECS is not the problem at university. In fact, the biggest barrier to getting into university is a poor year 12 result—and the biggest contributor to that, by the way, is poor literacy skills in year 9. The biggest problems for students are accommodation or rent, trying to run a car or pay for transport, trying to feed themselves and trying to survive while they are at university. Once a student graduates and is earning money, they will pay their HECS contribution—which under these reforms will still amount to around 26 per cent of the total public investment in higher education—back through the tax system.
One of the many things that many speakers, in particular those on the other side, have focused upon is the notion that Australian citizens who pay full fees are in some way jumping queues—that in some way they are unworthy of taking up a fee paying place in an Australian university—whereas, as we have just heard from the member for Chifley, we welcome, quite rightly, about 130,000 international students to Australian universities. I say to the parents and young people of Australia, who have been sought to be misled by a lot of what has been said during this debate, that HECS is not only continuing but being strengthened and enhanced.
I think the most dispassionate and intellectually and scientifically based analysis of HECS and its impact on participation by students has been done by Professor Bruce Chapman at the Australian National University. He co-designed HECS, was an adviser to the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, and is certainly not an uncritical supporter of this government. He points out that HECS can increase as long as, at the same time, its repayment threshold also increases—and there is no evidence at all that changes to HECS introduced over the past 14 years have had any adverse impact on participation from low-income families.
I say to the young people of Australia and their parents that the Labor Party is proposing a ban; it is proposing to say to people who do not get a HECS place that, even if they are academically qualified, they will not be allowed to take up a fee paying place in an Australian university. From the government's point of view, it defies logic that, if a student achieves a tertiary entrance score of 97 or 98—of which any parent would be proud—and misses out on the course of his or her choice, they cannot take up a full fee paying place which is not subsidised by the taxpayer. Essentially HECS places are distributed on merit. In fact, as I said earlier in the debate, 40,000 people who got a HECS place this year did not exactly get it on merit; they actually got it because they had been educated in difficult circumstances. Eight per cent of the people who got a place at QUT this year, for example, never fronted up for a year 12 exam; they went through TAFE. Four per cent of those who got a HECS place this year at QUT alone were assessed on the basis of `life skills'. In other words, the universities themselves have recognised the inadequacy of a year 12 assessment and what a blunt instrument it is.
The government is saying, `If you miss out on the place of your choice but you are considered to be academically qualified, the university can offer you a full fee paying place where you will not be subsidised by the taxpayer but for the very first time, under these proposals, the government will lend you the money, as it does with HECS, adding a 3½ per cent interest rate to be paid back once you actually start working.' Also for the first time loans will be available for students who choose to go to any one of a number of private higher education providers the length and breadth of Australia. 
There are things in this package which obviously are not supported by a variety of people in higher education—and certainly not by the opposition. However, the government is doing these things because they are important; they are in Australia's longterm interests. It is important that we have HECS flexibility, with every last dollar of HECS going into improving the quality of education being delivered to students. It is also important that there be increased public investment, increased flexibility in terms of working relations, and reform of the way in which universities are governed and administered. All of these measures are absolutely necessary if we want a world-class education for our children. There is no point in any of us, on this side or the other, guaranteeing them a place if they subsequently find, to their great disappointment, that they have graduated from a university that is considered to be mediocre.

"King, Catherine, MP",ALP,2003-10-15,"—The Prime Minister proclaims himself to be the protector of working families. In August 2001 the Prime Minister said in his National Press Club address that obtaining the balance between work and family is essential for the prosperity of our nation and that he personally would not like to see the situation `where our growing wealth has been built at the expense of our families and communities'.
Yet families in my electorate are part of the one-third of all Australians who are now working more than 49 hours a week and part of the 60 per cent of workers who are working some time on the weekend or well into the evening—and they are doing it all for the highest taxing government in Australia's history. At the same time, approximately 6,000 families in the electorate of Ballarat owe a family tax benefit debt. This accounts for almost $51 million that has been taken out of the families' pockets in areas like Daylesford, Buninyong and Ross Creek. These overpayments are not the fault of these families but the fault of this government's flawed family tax benefit system.
This system asks for families to estimate their annual income, despite the fact that it could be affected by overtime worked or an increase in share dividends. If a family underestimates it means a bill at the end of the financial year. There is no capacity within the system to actually adjust payments. Last year, families in my electorate had their tax returns stripped by family tax benefit overpayments. Many were not aware this was happening and many more were unaware that they had a debt in the first place. They were relying on these tax refunds to purchase new household furniture or to take a holiday or were going to put the refunds away for Christmas. 
Therefore, what we had was the government again shifting the blame for a flawed family tax benefit system to the families, who were not at fault, by asking them to repay their overpayment—certainly in some cases in my electorate—via their credit cards. We heard today in question time the Prime Minister's refusal to allow an amendment that would permit families to pay off these debts in instalments rather than have their tax returns automatically reduced.
The Howard government went even further recently, with 597 families in my electorate being asked to prove to the government that their children actually had disabilities and continued to require care to entitle them to the carers allowance. These cold-hearted reviews followed the decision five years ago to change eligibility for child disability allowance when the new carers allowance replaced it. To avoid a backlash to the new rules the government decided to continue payments to those previously granted child disability allowance based on recognised disabilities but placed them on a five-year review.
The time is up for the families, who must now justify the care provided to their children, who unquestionably have serious disabilities. It is a disgrace that many families who care for children with a range of disabilities are still being asked to justify the care that they provide. Forcing these families to justify these modest benefits is further proof of the Howard government's habitual heartlessness towards the most vulnerable.
Many working families in my electorate not only are being crippled by significant credit card debts and family tax benefit debts, but also are finding that—while it is terrific that house prices have gone up—their mortgages are taking up more and more of their incomes. They are finding it harder and harder to live under this government.
Labor will try and provide a better way of life for working families. We believe that it is important to get a balance between work and family life. We want to support working families and we want to see a better family tax benefit system. 
I know the Prime Minister will, in the lead-up to the next election, stand in front of the Australian people and the people in my electorate and say that he is working for working families. The battlers who are in my electorate will certainly know that, over the course of the seven years of this government, it has been absent in many areas and that many of its policies, including the flawed family tax benefit system, have in fact been burdening them with debt rather than actually assisting them.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Family Payments</title>,Adjournment,15,1
"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2003-10-15,"—This morning, I would like to raise some concerns that I have about the alleged treatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. There have been allegations that those detainees are being tortured and, if this is true, that would be a breach of the international conventions against torture. I also wish to raise in this place some concerns that were put by international judges and lawyers last Friday when they condemned US treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba as a violation of international law. Justice Richard Goldstone, a judge of the Constitutional Court of South Africa and former chief prosecutor of international tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda, said in a speech in Washington that there had been dozens of suicide attempts at Guantanamo Bay, where prisoners deemed enemy combatants are being held indefinitely outside US territory. He went on to say:
The law just doesn't accept black holes. If they're prisoners of war they've got rights under the Geneva convention. If they're civilians they've got rights under the domestic laws of the US.
Those issues are of concern to me, particularly in times of international terror, because it is important that democratic nations are vigilant in upholding the principles of natural justice and the tenets of democracy. We are judged by the way we treat detainees. Indeed, the United States as a nation will be judged by the way it treats its detainees at Guantanamo Bay. I think, therefore, it is important to note those claims that have been made and ensure that those claims are not true or, if they are true, ensure that something is done to rectify the matter.
I would also like to make reference to the Red Cross, which is the only organisation that has had access to those detainees. It is an organisation that rarely speaks out, because of the conditions upon which they are able to gain access to such detainees, but they also have indicated that there is a worrying deterioration in the mental health of detainees and have raised concerns about certain breaches of international covenants. Again, I say that there are a number of critics of the way in which the United States is dealing with this matter.
Finally, I want to quickly mention the former military officers, federal judges and diplomats of the United States, including two former World War II prisoners of war who have indicated their concerns about the treatment. They have said in their brief that ignoring the Geneva conventions in Guantanamo Bay will give other nations an excuse to do the same and will endanger American soldiers captured in the future. I think America should take note of its former war heroes.",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>Military Detention</title>,Statements by Members,17,1
"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2003-10-15,"—I rise to support the Telecommunications Interception and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2003. I support it, of course, along with the entire opposition because in our view it makes a very decent contribution to the fight against terrorism and also improves a number of areas concerning law and order. Firstly, it ensures that the Western Australian Corruption and Crime Commission and the parliamentary inspector who will oversee it will have appropriate investigative powers conferred by Commonwealth laws. This bill, among other things, amends the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 to make the new commission and parliamentary inspector eligible authorities for the purposes of that act. This new commission and parliamentary inspector will therefore have greater powers. This will enable them to receive, for example, telecommunications interception products relevant to their functions. In addition the commission will be able to be declared an intercepting agency, enabling it therefore to obtain executive telecommunications interception warrants in its own right. This latter process may be initiated by a request from the Premier of Western Australia, and that would also require the Commonwealth Attorney-General to be satisfied that the new commission meets the appropriate record-keeping requirements and accountability measures.
Further to those amendments the bill amends the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 and therefore allows the commission to be effectively a law enforcement agency for the purposes of the act, which will give it access to financial transaction reports information. In addition, the bill amends the Crimes Act 1914 to make the commission a participating agency for the purposes of the assumed identities scheme under part IAC of the act, which will enable the commission to acquire and use evidence of an assumed identity. 
As you can see it is a very broad bill and it goes to a number of areas of law. I should indicate by way of context that this year the Western Australian government introduced legislation into their parliament to establish a new and better resourced Corruption and Crime Commission to replace what was the Anti-Corruption Commission. That law, passed by the parliament, was assented to in July this year.
The creation of the new body implements a recommendation of royal commissioner Kennedy, who was charged with the responsibility to investigate police corruption. In his report, delivered last year, he indicated that there were in fact quite serious flaws in the structure and power of the ACC. Therefore he considered that such deficiencies brought about a lack of public confidence in the current processes of the investigation. Therefore the commission's role now would be to investigate police corruption, to investigate the public sector corruption and also to play a vital role in examining and investigating organised crime.
The amendments made by this bill will ensure that this newly established commission has all the powers of the outgoing ACC to tackle corruption and organised crime. It is important that we commend the Western Australian government and in particular its Attorney-General on the establishment of this new body because it is certainly going to strengthen the powers for authorities to act when necessary.
Another purpose of this bill is to amend the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979, as I said, which would enable interception warrants to be sought in the course of investigating slavery, sexual servitude, deceptive recruiting and aggravated people-smuggling offences contained in the Criminal Code. The new offences applying to the smuggling of people—aggravated people smuggling—have been strengthened. They would now, for example, apply to the smuggling of people into a foreign country, whether or not via Australia, whereas previously offences of this type in the Migration Act had applied only to the smuggling of people into Australia.
Again, this is a very timely amendment to the law to ensure that the authorities have powers to prevent things such as this happening and indeed, if they were to occur, to ensure that people were properly charged. In respect of that offence of people smuggling—that is, when a person organises the illegal entry of another person—the maximum penalty would be 10 years imprisonment, and I think it is an appropriate sentence for such a heinous act. This bill has looked to improve the law in this area to respond to public concerns about such acts and therefore I happily rise to support those provisions.
As I said, there are also some references to other areas, including slavery, sexual servitude and deceptive recruiting. I think it is public knowledge that there have been many victims of this evil trade and indeed there has therefore been an important requirement that the law be enhanced in order to respond to those awful crimes. I think this bill goes some way to doing that and should be commended.
In respect of the interception warrants, we support this bill. But, as with all matters that go to potential intrusions on individual freedoms and people's rights, there always has to be the right balance between ensuring authorities have the capacity to undertake their duties and discharge them effectively and the government being conscious of not intruding upon individuals unnecessarily. Therefore matters such as this with respect to telecommunications interception should be reviewable, and we should monitor the way in which our authorities implement such laws. I note that the then Attorney-General, when commenting upon this issue and making reference to the report which was handed down, said: 
The report shows that the use of telecommunications interception continues to be an important investigative tool which is demonstrating proven results. The figures contained in the report show that access to this tool is vital for law enforcement particularly at a time of such rapid technological change and advancement.
Those comments by the former Attorney-General were made in relation to the latest annual report on the telecommunications act. But, to reinforce my concerns about maintaining a balance, I note that the Sunday Tasmanian, in its editorial, indicated the following:
AUSTRALIANS are fast becoming the most spied-on people in the Western world.
Mail interceptions and telephone taps have soared.
	...	...	...
The 2,514 court warrants for phone taps last financial year—almost double the number issued in the US—represent a tenfold increase in the past decade ...
The warrants apply to hundreds of thousands of individual phone calls and eavesdropping on thousands of people.
That paper may have gilded the lily a little and may have used hyperbole to make its point, but I think it is an issue that has to be properly monitored. I also note with respect to this matter that, in relation to the report, the then shadow minister for justice, Daryl Melham, stated in September last year in this place:
It is a striking fact that Australian law enforcement agencies are resorting to telecommunications interception much more than their American counterparts ...
He went on to note that, given the disparity in population between the two countries, it amounted to a per capita rate of telephone interception in Australia which is more than 20 times that of the United States. Clearly, if we were to use the United States as a benchmark for those things, then, in terms of rights to intrude into individual freedoms in order to discharge the powers that are needed in such insecure times, I think we have to be mindful of the fact that there has indeed been quite an extraordinary increase in interceptions in this country. The rate is far in excess of that which would occur in the United States and other comparable countries. Therefore, I think we have to take note and be mindful of that when we have this bill passed and assented to.
I will finish by saying that the Labor Party supports the bill. We believe that it should be passed. It does strengthen powers in a number of areas and that is a good thing. However, I think it is important that we review the way in which our authorities and, indeed, our executive governments, apply these quite powerful measures to intrude into people's homes. We must make sure that the balance does not fall against the individual unnecessarily when we are attempting to achieve a secure nation.",REPS,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS INTERCEPTION AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Hatton, Michael, MP",ALP,2003-10-15,"—The Telecommunications Interception and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 has two parts. The first part is dealt with in schedule 1 and it concerns remodelling the way in which the Western Australian Anti-Corruption Commission operates. That remodelling is necessary because the manner in which the commission previously operated has been found to be deficient. In fact, the commissioner who looked into the situation with the WA Anti-Corruption Commission concluded: 
... that the identifiable flaws in the structure and powers of the ACC [Anti-Corruption Commission] have brought about such a lack of public confidence in the current processes for the investigation of corrupt and criminal conduct that the establishment of a new permanent body is necessary.
This is an unusual situation in that a Commonwealth bill is seeking to assist a state government to renovate something found to be faulty at a state level. We know that, Australia wide, state governments have set up independent commissions against corruption. Both Deputy Speaker Causley and I are from New South Wales and Deputy Speaker Causley's former experience is in the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales. He will know that the New South Wales anticorruption body has now had a considerable history. In the way they have been set up, moved forward and changed, the New South Wales and Queensland anticorruption commissions have almost formed the benchmark for the way in which state jurisdictions have dealt with these matters. But, in Western Australia's situation, the experience was that, over time, they fell far short of the quality of practice of places like New South Wales and Queensland.
The Labor Party is entirely supportive of the changes proposed in this bill with regard to Western Australia. It is supportive of the fact that the Western Australian Premier, Mr Gallop, and the relevant minister, Mr McGinty, have sought to resolve these problems and come up with a new anticorruption commission which will do its job much more effectively. The bill specifically deals with this in schedule 1. I will now state the advice that has been given to me about the way the bill attempts to get around these problems. I think this bill is coming before us for about the third time. It has had a foreshortened history, if I am thinking about the correct bill, and we are finally dealing with it now. But I stand to be corrected on that.
In terms of the Western Australian situation, this bill amends Commonwealth laws to provide the Western Australian commission with enforcement powers to perform its functions consistent with the powers available to the body that it will replace—the WA Anti-Corruption Commission. So it is the enforcement powers linked to the Commonwealth's ability to guarantee those, effectively, that are being introduced here.
Specifically, the bill will amend the Telecommunications (Interception) Act to include the proposed Western Australian commission and the proposed Western Australian parliamentary inspector of the Corruption and Crime Commission as eligible authorities, enabling them to receive intercepted information. Of course, if they were not in a position to do so, we would have the problem that, although people working for the commission might otherwise be operating legally, if this measure had not been taken they would not be in a position to be able to use the information gathered in hearings before the Western Australian Corruption and Crime Commission. That instance is now covered by this covering Commonwealth legislation.
In addition, the amendments will enable the Western Australia commission to be declared to be an intercepting agency in its own right, allowing it to obtain and execute telecommunications interception warrants, subject to the fulfilment of specified preconditions. The importance of that, of course, is that references do not continually have to be made to the Commonwealth from the state jurisdiction in order to gain powers. We have seen where that sort of thing has operated in the past. We have seen that it is not particularly effective because it is a cumbrous and burdensome process. What this does is trust the Western Australian Corruption and Crime Commission, as a new entity, to take on these powers and to use them effectively in order to do its job and, hopefully, to do it better than the Anti-Corruption Commission that it replaced, without a tangling of responsibilities or a tangling in terms of process. 
Given this situation, you can think about a couple of examples, particularly in New South Wales, where this has become extraordinarily potent. If we go back to the start of the anticorruption commission process in ICAC in New South Wales, the technological capacity that was available to ICAC or available to the Fitzgerald commission in Queensland or, indeed, available to the Anti-Corruption Commission in Western Australia, was relatively poor just more than 15 or so years ago—the ability to record people who were doing the wrong thing; the ability to track them and gain information about what they were doing. In very large part, that was dependent upon wire-tapping or phone tapping to get at them. 
Most people at the time these were set up used fixed telephone lines. They were not using mobile phones. When mobile phones came into play, of course, it was pretty easy to track them if you knew the number. We had an analog system at that point, so it was easy for Commonwealth authorities to do it. Over the intervening period we have seen digital telephones come into play. There is a very simple situation in that, unless there is a specific power given—which there has been, under a series of different legislative instruments in this Commonwealth parliament—to our relevant agencies, you cannot crack open digital to digital or digital through to a land line. If anything is carried by radio, it is possible for our interception agencies to deal with that pretty effectively, but they need the power to do it. Every time there has been a dramatic advance in technology which has involved questions about Commonwealth and state government powers, these have needed to be resolved and made certain.
Given that that closely monitored power to intercept has been given through a series of different bills, I think we can be happy with the manner in which it has been used so far, given the new techniques that have been developed in New South Wales. These include ones that have become famous in the past couple of years, where people have used cameras—not the size of cinecameras but extremely small ones, either in cars or on the person who is cooperating with an anticorruption commission—to provide absolutely solid evidence that is transmitted to officers who are off site. It can then be used by the anticorruption commission through techniques similar to what we have got here, with the anticorruption commission taking on the relevant powers extended by the Commonwealth and taking responsibility for those. That is what this bill seeks to do in allowing this new commission to be properly resourced in its capacities and powers. I trust that, in terms of schedule 1 of the bill, this will go a long way to ameliorate the problems that are evident at a state level in the way the anticorruption commission did not function effectively. There can be no worse situation than what was designated by the commissioner who looked at this—the fact that public confidence was utterly wanting because the current processes simply did not work well. So the federal opposition joins with the government in hoping that this will work effectively for Western Australia.
This bill is in two parts. I think the second part is the far more significant one. It is not a question of a state agency being assured of a new future and having powers available to it; it is a question of people-smuggling and the attendant questions of people-smuggling being aggravated by exploitation, slavery, sexual servitude and deceptive recruiting. This very day on the radio these issues have been dealt with. The government is starting to make a case for everyone in Australia to see this as a more significant problem than it has been perceived to be in the past. Sexual slavery and servitude are evident within Australia in a range of our jurisdictions. There has been a significant problem in the past in dealing with those people who have been caught by the department of immigration—the manner in which they have been dealt with—given the fact that they have generally been trundled back to where they came from fairly quickly. There has been an argument that the way in which that has been done has not taken into account enough the enormous suffering that these people—in fact not only they but their families as well—have been put through. There is also the question surrounding the fact that, to crack down as hard as we need to crack down on people-smuggling practices, we actually need the cooperation of the victims. Simply sending them back or treating the victims as if they were the problem is not a fundamental solution to this. Dealing with this on page 2 of his second reading speech, the minister said. 
The trafficking of people into Australia and the exploitation of those people is an issue of significant concern to the government. The government has been working to develop a strategy to arm law enforcement agencies with the capacity to investigate these offences and to facilitate prosecutions where evidence of illegal activity is uncovered.
He is quite rightly pointing out there that across a range of different agencies—not just the agencies involved in this bill but a range of government departments whether it be Customs, Immigration, Justice or Attorney-General's—you need a coordinated strategy to unbundle this. He then said:
The nature of trafficking means that victims often fear that speaking out will result in action against either themselves or their family.
This is the very point that I was just making. It is a fact that it can be much harder to undo it if you take the wrong approach. He also said:
The availability of telecommunications interception warrants will provide law enforcement agencies with a valuable tool to assist in the collection of information that may not otherwise be available in relation to these very serious offences.
This in part gets to the nub of the matter—that those who are most victimised by these vile processes are not as likely to come forward, because they think they will just be pushed back to their country of origin. They become partly culpable because they are helping to continue this practice. They cannot stop being sexual slaves, because they have become part of it. The people who are exploiting them are utilising their power over them and their families to the point where they do not see any way out.
So the minister rightly points out that in these circumstances—when those people who are the ultimate beneficiaries of this bill see no light at the end of the tunnel in terms of getting out of their situation—you need to use other means than might otherwise be appropriate. Generally, we can deal directly with these people only if there is a raid by the immigration department and they are taken into custody. We can then extract information from them and, in doing so, get one step closer to taking action against the people smugglers and sexual enslavers. But, in order to achieve this, in most of these circumstances—given the covert way in which people who run these businesses operate—you need these interception means. So I have no difficulty at all in supporting schedule 2 of the bill because of what it is directed at.
I want to make a couple of broader comments arising out of this about people-smuggling, sexual slavery, sexual servitude and the deceptive recruiting of those people. That is also part and parcel of what we have seen over a considerable time now—in fact, since 1996—with regard to people-smuggling itself. Since then, 236 boats have arrived, carrying 11,500 people. This is a large and vigorous industry which has brought many more people in 2½ years than came under 13 years of Labor government, when in fact 2,500 people were smuggled into Australia, primarily from the Fujian province of mainland China. Those people were relocated after questioning and sent back to southern China. We dealt with the provincial government and the central government and, having identified those people and the fact that they had no right to be in Australia, we sent them back to where they had originally come from, at a cost of about $1 million. The people who had run the people-smuggling rings to get them into Australia had their future source out of that area broken. 
You need strong effective powers, but you also need discipline and certainty in the approaches that you take in regard to this. Throughout the world, we have seen almost an efflorescence of people-smuggling out of China and other areas since 1996, because people can earn a significantly large amount of money from running those activities.
Catching these gangs of people smugglers has become more difficult in Australia, but the need to crack the gangs has become much greater because they have chosen, by and large, to take people who would otherwise be accepted as refugees in Australia. They do not just perform a broad snatch of people who might want to try their hand at being accepted as refugees; they preselect people. Their preselecting people who are likely to come has provided a significant difficulty for decision makers—not just because of the large numbers but because about 10 per cent of our refugee and humanitarian program intake are people who have come from camps overseas. That program has taken people equally and equitably, rather than people knocking down the door and attempting to come to Australia improperly. We have seen those 11,500 people come in part because there was a question of retribution for certain actions taken by this government in relation to East Timor and because there was retribution from some of our Indonesian colleagues.
We have finally seen—and it has taken a considerable period of time—a cooperative band of practices developed between Australia and Indonesia. Intersecting that, of course, is the dreadful anniversary that we have just celebrated of what happened in Bali, which affected Indonesian nationals as well as our own. Terror there has affected us here. It is also a fact that in Indonesia, which was such a strong conduit for people-smuggling activities in the broad and also a conduit for people-smuggling activities involving sexual servitude and exploitation, these practices have been choked. Most of our problems in this regard are caused not by people coming by boat to Australia but by those flying in, economy class, from a number of originating places, particularly in Asia. The department of immigration has tracked the countries specifically concerned.
When we were in government, we rightly brought in legislation to take into account that Australians travelling overseas should not act inappropriately when it came to dealing with, in particular, under-age women in Asia. People who did so could be prosecuted not only locally but, more importantly, at home for offences they had committed. The other side of this, which we are dealing with here, is where those inappropriate activities have been brought to Australia. The mechanisms that we need to use to break those are at hand if we are willing to use them and to bring about prosecutions.
In closing, concerns in general have been addressed by the former speaker and in quotes from the member for Banks, the previous shadow minister for this area. There have been strong concerns expressed across the board about the liberties of Australians and the overuse of telephone interception. But here is a classic case of a nasty and vicious practice—people-smuggling for the purpose of sexual servitude—which should be wiped right out. I commend the bill to the House.

"Ruddock, Philip, MP",LP,2003-10-15,"—I take this opportunity to thank all the members who have participated in this debate on the Telecommunications Interception and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 and to particularly thank, in his absence, the member for Barton for his comments. As he noted, there have been no prosecutions for slavery, sexual servitude and deceptive recruiting offences. As was mentioned earlier in the week, the Australian Federal Police have now charged eight people with slavery, sexual servitude and deceptive recruiting offences, and they are currently investigating a further 18 cases of alleged offences.
The measures set out in this bill will provide the AFP with an extremely effective tool to further assist in their investigations of these crimes, which are quite repugnant to us all. The strength of the government's commitment to combating trafficking has been demonstrated by not only the improvements to investigative tools provided by these amendments but also the comprehensive whole-of-government strategy to combat trafficking in persons which was announced on 13 October—a couple of days ago. You will recall that, in the House at question time, I took the opportunity to elaborate on the range of initiatives, costing in the order of $20 million over four years, that will include legislative preventative law enforcement and victim support measures. These initiatives, including the amendments to this bill, demonstrate that ongoing commitment to investigating, preventing and prosecuting this insidious criminal activity of trafficking.
The bill is important for law enforcement. Trafficking of people into Australia is an issue of significant concern to not only the government but people generally. This bill enables law enforcement agencies to obtain warrants to assist in the investigation of offences involving smuggling aggravated by exploitation, slavery, sexual servitude and deceptive recruiting, as set out in the Criminal Code. Telecommunications interception provides law enforcement agencies with a proven, cost-effective technique for uncovering and prosecuting such serious offences. The availability of telecommunications interception warrants provides law enforcement agencies with a valuable tool to assist in the collection of information. Offences of smuggling, exploitation, slavery and sexual servitude are very serious. They attract hefty penalties and, as the member for Barton acknowledged, this bill gives the law enforcement agencies a very important capacity.
The bill will give the proposed Western Australian Corruption and Crime Commission and the Parliamentary Inspector of the Corruption and Crime Commission the means to perform their crucial functions more effectively. The government is aware of the corrosive effect that organised crime and corruption can have on our society. For this reason we support the conferral of appropriate powers on the proposed commission. The amendments will enable the commission to receive information which is collected by telecommunications interception conducted by other agencies and which is relevant to the performance of the commission's functions. The amendments enable the commission to be declared an agency for the purposes of the interception act, allowing it to apply for and execute telecommunications interception warrants in its own right.
Telecommunications interception has of course been extremely effective in dealing with organised criminal activity and a range of other offences, and it has been an extremely valuable tool for the law enforcement agencies and anticorruption bodies in Western Australia. The bill will also allow authorised officers of the Corruption and Crime Commission to acquire and use evidence of assumed identity and to access financial transaction reports in the course of investigating corruption and serious criminal activity. The bill reflects the government's commitment to providing effective law enforcement tools and ensures appropriate safeguards are there to protect the rights of individuals. It is a question of keeping a sense of proportion while enabling us to deal with organised criminal activity, to deal with corruption and to deal with trafficking in persons, which is of a very serious nature. In that sense the bill is very valuable. 
In the course of this debate, the member for Burke claimed that Australians are `spied on' more than Americans, for example, and cited figures from some recent reports as evidence of this, claiming that, per capita, Australian authorities use telecommunications interception more frequently than their American counterparts. The advice to me is that this is not true. Comparing the Australian and US statistics is like comparing apples and oranges. Both schemes have very different legislative requirements. For example, Australian law enforcement agencies must obtain a warrant for all forms of telecommunications interception, whether voice, fax or data. The US legislation provides separately for access in the different fields of communications, making it very difficult and perhaps almost impossible to directly compare their statistics and ours.
The member for Burke also questioned whether the use of telecommunications interception is subject to sufficient safeguards. I served on a parliamentary committee looking at these matters under the former government when I was an opposition member, and I know that these matters were pursued in government by the member's own colleagues. I always find accountability issues, when raised in these contexts, fairly interesting. Often accountability is only pushed when you are in office and want to try to suggest that the use is in some way inappropriate. But I can assure the committee that the act does contain a wide range of accountability measures designed to ensure appropriate use and to ensure that the Australian public, through reporting to parliament, has access to information about it. The member himself was able to cite some of the statistics. As the member noted, each year the Attorney-General does table an annual report. That gives information to the public generally.
I think this is a very important measure. It ensures that we are able to deal with these issues effectively. It demonstrates that we are prepared to work cooperatively with state governments and, in this case, particularly with the Western Australian government. I commend the Telecommunications Interception and Other Legislation Amendment Bill to the committee. I look forward to it receiving speedy passage.
