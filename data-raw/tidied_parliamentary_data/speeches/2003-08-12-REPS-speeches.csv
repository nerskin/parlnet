"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,2003-08-12,"—We know that $5 billion of budget cuts after seven long years have left our universities and TAFEs struggling. Too many qualified people are being turned away from both universities and TAFEs. The Australian vice-chancellors tell us that about 20,000 qualified Australian students miss out on a university place every year. About 15,000 young people miss out on a place at TAFE because this government will not fund enough places. Public confidence in our universities is continuing to drop. Student fees just go up and up. In fact, under this government they have gone up already by 85 per cent—and that was before the government decided to let universities put them up by another 30 per cent. We know this government's whole approach to getting into university is that, if you have the money, you will get a place—even if it is as much as $150,000. We know that staff morale is at an all-time low. This is all the direct result of the Howard government's budget cuts of $5 billion. 
By contrast, Labor now have put out our higher education policy. It confronts each and every one of these issues. We will provide $2.34 billion extra in public investment for our universities and TAFEs. It is time for Australia to put in place a massive increase in the number of university and TAFE places so that people who are qualified, who want to go to university, can in fact get that opportunity. Labor in government will provide 20,000 additional full- and part-time university places and 20,000 additional full- and part-time TAFE places so that people who want to go to university or TAFE can do so. Labor's policy will also restore merit as the criterion for getting a university place, not money. We will make sure that getting into university remains affordable. We will oppose the government's plan to increase HECS and to deregulate university fees and we will abolish full fees for all new Australian undergraduate students so that merit replaces money as the criterion for getting into university.
Our package also includes significant measures to address the growing skills shortages, whether they be for nurses and teachers or in the area of maths and science. We will take off the financial burden that students are facing by making sure that those on Austudy finally get access to rent assistance. We will lower the age of independence so that more students are able to get access to the youth allowance, and we will increase the level at which students have to start repaying their HECS debt to $35,000. We have got a range of additional equity measures to boost Indigenous participation, to support people with a disability and—most importantly, I think—to encourage people from disadvantaged backgrounds to have the aspiration to go to university or TAFE. Labor will make sure there is a place for them. 
We of course also want to make sure that our universities are world-class centres of excellence. We have a $450 million fund called the Universities of the 21st Century Fund, $150 million for community engagement, $150 million for teaching and learning, and a new indexation measure—which the universities have welcomed—to make sure that we deliver quality education and that the funding from the Commonwealth actually keeps up with the costs of delivering outstanding education in our universities.
This package was very well received. The Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee said that they are particularly reassured by Labor's commitment to increase university places. They said that Labor have indicated that they have listened to the AVCC's higher education policy concerns, especially in regard to effects on students, and that this is reflected in the changes to Austudy and youth allowance, in the raising of the HECS threshold and in the rejection of any real rate of interest on student loans, as proposed by the government. And so the positive comments went on. From a range of individual vice-chancellors, from student organisations, from bodies representing teachers and nurses and from bodies representing scientists, the policies received an outstanding response.
But one area where I was not really expecting the reception that we got was from the minister himself. On the day that the full policy was announced, the Minister for Education and Training called a press conference to discuss the Labor Party's policy. He seemed to be so impressed by the number of new student places in our package that he immediately did a bit of creative accounting and tried to bump up the numbers in his own package. When asked how the government planned to address unmet demand, the minister went into a very convoluted discussion of private universities, government loan schemes and five-year learning limits. It was amazing—with some very effective smoke and mirrors, the minister somehow just did away with this unmet demand for university places. Those 20,000 students were just going to somehow go off to private universities, get a loan, pay $150,000 or do whatever it might be. But the real magic in the minister's response was that he claimed in his press conference that he would be creating `some 8,000 new student places'. This is just codswallop, I have to say. It is nothing more than a figment of the minister's rather overactive imagination. 
An opposition member—He is the Rain Man.
—As my colleague says, he is often known as the Rain Man. He is also occasionally known as the Human Abacus or Captain Calculator. 
An opposition member—Will he go feral?
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—I am sure the member for Jagajaga does not need any help.
—They're doing all right! This is the minister who, as we all know, just loves to let fly with a whole string of numbers, beautiful sets of numbers. Unfortunately this time the Rain Man got it wrong. There are not some 8,000 places in the government's package, as he well knows. So, when the minister's transcript finally hit the street, a few changes had been made. Each time in the transcript that the minister claimed some 8,000 new places, the word `misspeak' now suddenly appears in brackets.
According to the transcript, our Captain Calculator has a terrible case of the `misspeakables'. Apparently, being `misspeakable' magically makes someone unimpeachable. This is a very instructive approach. It obviously could have been very useful for the Prime Minister if he had known about this notion of misspeaking a little earlier. The Prime Minister told the House in 1999 that there would be no $100,000 degrees under this government. That was obviously a misspeak. Then he committed his government to `a clear rejection of deregulation of university fees'. That was another misspeak. And what about his declaring, `We have no intention of altering the current HECS arrangements'? You guessed—it was another misspeak! 
It is bad luck that the Prime Minister did not have this device at his fingertips at certain other crucial moments. There is one that we know very well: `There will never, ever be a GST.' Children, of course, were never thrown overboard—that was yet another misspeak. And of course there is the one that we were debating in the parliament yesterday and today: `I had not spoken to Dick Honan on this issue.' What else was that but a misspeak? Obviously the Prime Minister should be heavily indebted to this minister for his political version of a `get out of jail free' card. We have seen in question time just how useful it could be.
Is it any wonder that the minister has had to introduce the word `misspeak'? We have seen in today's question time that this is a minister that actually likes to censure his own work. He took his own censorship to dizzying heights in his press conference on the day that we released our policy. He actually used the word `inaudible' to edit his own transcript and get rid of questions and little bits of his answers that he did not much like. This edited transcript has got 39 `inaudible's to clean up the minister's and the journalists' words. So, for example, there is the question from the journalist: 
... and if we are playing the politics of envy, aren't you playing the race card when you start talking about foreign students?
But in the edited transcript the minister's office has simply deleted the words `race card' because it does not seem that he wants the truth about his political tactics seen for what they are. However, the journalist was persistent and asked him the question again.
—Order! This is parliament, not vaudeville. Would the member for Jagajaga address her comments through the chair, please, and not play to the audience.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I quote the minister's own transcript:
But when you start talking about Jakarta and Beijing, you've been a critic of—
and the word left out—it says `inaudible' in the transcript—was `Hansonism'. And so it goes on: the word `inaudible' gets used so many times that you cannot help wondering if the term `free speech' is in fact a foreign language for this minister.
—It's inaudible.
—Yes. The censorship does not stop there. As we have seen in recent weeks in report after report in the media, this minister has been caught out fiddling with a report from his own department that shows, not surprisingly, that high fees certainly discourage people from going to university. Let us go back—because the minister actually referred to this report on 23 July, when we released our policy. He was asked in his press conference about the report that we now know was doctored. He said:
Firstly, Fran, I haven't been sitting on the report. I haven't even seen the report. In fact when I first heard of the report, I said “what's this report”?
Crystal clear—the minister has no idea that the report even exists. But then straightaway he is asked again, and the journalists certainly were persistent: `You still haven't seen it?' This time—not even a minute later—Dr Nelson, the minister, said:
Well, I've seen a copy of the report this morning.
So it is one thing one minute and another thing another minute—the exact opposite, a direct contradiction. This has been a very serious case of the misspeaks. Unfortunately, for this minister just getting away with misspeak is not going to cut the mustard. All the reports that have been doctored, which he has been finally embarrassed into releasing, are way too damaging because they really show the impact of the HECS rises in 1996 on those students who were leaving school and on the students who were mature age and wanted to go to university. We know how detrimental these increased fees have been for prospective students, and of course the government has completely ignored that research in deciding to allow universities to put up their fees by up to another 30 per cent. It turns out that not only did the government withhold the release of the reports but also the reports have been seriously doctored to remove sections that in fact show that 9,000 students leaving school each year are discouraged from going to university because of the 1996 HECS increases and so are 17,000 mature age students. That is the real impact of what they did back in 1996, and we know that increasing the level of debt that students will face under this government's new policies will only make these things worse. 
We read in today's paper that the current Secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet—he was previously the minister's secretary—was apparently the one that moved in to delete the sensitive parts of the report. Of course, we could not get to the bottom of this in question time. We tried again and again to get the minister to come clean and tell us whether it was Dr Shergold. Time and time again the minister just refused to answer. Dr Shergold says he does not remember. The minister refuses to answer—he has obviously gone off misspeaking. This is a very rotten state of affairs: a minister who misspeaks the facts to suit his purposes, censors his own transcripts, tries to hide behind the department and then of course tries to make public servants in his department take the blame for all of these problems. It is hardly a tribute to each and every one of those heroes that you have, Minister. You know who they are, and none of those heroes would be proud of what you have been doing. (Time expired)

"Nelson, Dr Brendan, MP",LP,2003-08-12,"—Australia is a relatively small country. We are 0.3 per cent of world population. We are currently 1.2 per cent of global GDP. We are still only about six per cent of APEC. It is obvious that our future as a country will rely entirely on our ability to learn how to learn, to develop ideas and, from them, new technologies that we will apply not only to new and emerging industries but also to traditional industries and commodities in land and labour intensive industries. The case for reform in Australian universities rests not on any argument of crisis. If people wish to see a crisis in education, they should look at Aboriginal literacy in many parts of the country. They should look at children who have spent five years in the public education system in some parts of large cities and who simply cannot read a word. Moreover, they should speak to some Australians two generations above the age of 45, many of whom still struggle to turn on a computer, being displaced from low-skilled occupations in industries that are undergoing major transformation. But the case for reform rests on two inescapable but perhaps unpleasant truths. The first is that universities need access to a lot of money, and a lot more of it in the long term. The second is that money is only half the problem: the way in which we administer, regulate and fund our universities is as much a problem as is the level of resourcing.
We and our children face the 21st century with a higher education sector that has gone from a so-called elite system to a mass system—more than 750,000 people are in Australian universities, for example—and we do so in the context of globalisation, which we do not always understand or want; a revolution in telecommunications; and, increasingly, the move toward lifelong learning. It is in that environment that the government has taken on the difficult but necessary process of reform of Australian universities.
Increasingly, the only benchmarks that are going to count are international ones. Whilst we are proud of what we do in Australia and within one jurisdiction, increasingly we will be asking ourselves—and we do now—where we rate internationally. The University of Melbourne, Monash University, the University of New South Wales, the University of Sydney and the University of Queensland are competing not so much with one another but with the rest of the world. They do so within a funding and regulatory framework which treats the University of the Sunshine Coast, Charles Sturt University, Edith Cowan University and the University of Western Sydney in precisely the same way. It needs to change, and that is the basis of the government's reforms. These reforms are not intended to pander to populism. They are being developed and implemented very much with an eye to Australia's future. 
Apart from amusing us at my personal expense, the member for Jagajaga, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, spent much of her time speaking about Labor's higher education policy. According to the Australian Labor Party, their policy is costed at $2.34 billion over the first four years. I should point out that $467 million of that funding is derived from reducing by 10 per cent the diesel fuel rebate for the mining industry. That is a $467 million tax on an industry that employs 83,000 Australians, many of them in low-skilled and sometimes low-paid occupations. The price that will be paid for this will be jobs. It puts lead in the saddlebags of the mining industry as it seeks to export its products into international markets and create wealth for this country.
The second way that the Labor Party intends to fund its policy, in the amount of $159 million—I suppose it is understandable, but the Leader of the Opposition obviously does not understand this part of the policy—is by continuing the student financial support scheme. This scheme, introduced in 1993, is one where low-income people in vocational education and training, many of them Abstudy or mature age students, can trade in their social security or Abstudy payment and for every dollar they trade in they can take a $2 loan.
We have had 10 years' experience with this loan. We have lent $2.3 billion to these students and $1.4 billion is now considered to be doubtful debt. The default rate or doubtful debt rate amongst Aboriginal Abstudy students is 84 per cent. The doubtful debt rate for non-Abstudy welfare recipients is 54 per cent. The Labor Party is seeking to find $159 million to fund its higher education policy by continuing the loan scheme. Eight thousand people in this loan scheme owe more than $20,000. One person owes $64,000. The repayment threshold is $35,000 a year, so they start paying the loan back when they are earning $35,000 a year. If, for example, you had a $28,000 debt and you were earning $35,000 a year, it would take 40 years to pay back the debt.
I invite people to consider the hypocrisy of the Labor Party being opposed to the government offering loans to students who choose to take up the same opportunities in Australian universities that are offered to foreign students. The Labor Party is opposed to those loans as well as to loans to support Australian undergraduates spending some of their time being educated overseas. But it is prepared, for an accounting reason—for $159 million in so-called savings—to run a loan scheme for some of the poorest people in the country, most of whom have very little prospect, if any, of paying it back. I do not often agree with the National Union of Students, but I think they were right when they described it as a disgrace.
The Australian Labor Party's policy proposes to do a number of things. The Commonwealth Department of Education, Science and Training and the Commonwealth Department of Finance and Administration have fully costed the Labor Party policy. The Labor Party has proposed, at a cost of $43.6 million, to reduce by $1,600 a year the HECS charge on 57,000 places for about 80,000 students who study science and mathematics in Australian universities. These students comprise about 14 per cent of the sector. Universities receive their money in terms of a total operating grant. That operating grant includes the net operating grant, which is the specific sum of money that the government provides to the university itself. The other 25 per cent comes from students—or, at least, the Commonwealth pays it on behalf of the students, through HECS. If the Labor Party does what it proposes to do—that is, reduce the HECS contribution by $1,600 a year—there will obviously be an adverse impact on universities unless the operating grant is increased by an equal amount to offset the reduction in HECS. 
The Higher Education Contribution Scheme has been carried by Australian students since 1989, when the Australian Labor Party introduced it. Students deal with it in one of two ways. One-quarter of them pay their HECS up front and they receive a 25 per cent discount for doing so. Three-quarters of the students, however, take their HECS contribution as a loan, indexed according to the CPI and recovered through the Australian taxation system for the Commonwealth. They will be paying it off, under the government's proposals, through the tax system when they are earning $30,000 a year. The impact on the budget of reducing HECS, as proposed by the Labor Party, is twofold: firstly, there is the HECS impact, and, secondly, there is the operating grant impact.
The HECS impact occurs in three ways. Firstly, under the Labor plan, because students will have a lower HECS contribution to make in science and mathematics, the level of the discount that the Commonwealth will have to pay will be lower. If the student pays three-quarters of his or her HECS charge up front then the Commonwealth pays the 25 per cent discount directly to the university. So there is a positive impact on the fiscal balance and the cash balance of the Commonwealth in having a lower 25 per cent discount to pay. Secondly, there is an impact on the indexation of the HECS debt. HECS is treated for accounting purposes as an asset of the Commonwealth. Each year when HECS is indexed it amounts to about a 17 per cent positive impact on the fiscal balance. So if the HECS contribution from these students is reduced, it has a positive impact on the fiscal balance because a lower debt is carried and indexed. Thirdly, because the total level of the HECS contribution from students is reduced, the remissions and write-downs that the Commonwealth deals with each year from students who cannot pay their HECS contribution are obviously reduced.
I am sure the Labor Party has given a lot of thought to all of those things. It is obvious that the member for Jagajaga sincerely believes that she is right. I am sorry to say that unfortunately she is wrong. The Labor Party has not taken into account the impact of these changes on the operating grant, nor has it adequately costed them. By way of explaining, when I say that the member for Jagajaga believes she is right, today she quoted from the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee document The Higher Education Scheme (HECS) and the Postgraduate Loans Scheme (PELS): the facts. She read this to the House in question time:
Universities do not receive more income because students pay HECS. Rather the government determines the total amount that universities should receive and balances its contribution against the student contribution to ensure universities receive the designated amount.
What they are saying is that if HECS goes up or down, then the operating grant is adjusted so that the total amount of the Commonwealth contribution is unchanged. The AVCC document then says:
This means that higher HECS rates do not lead to more income for universities.
Yes, that is true. When HECS was increased in 1997 there was a commensurate reduction in the operating grant so that the universities' total sum of money or quantum being delivered was unchanged. The AVCC document then says: 
With increases in HECS revenue not flowing directly to universities, the increasing level of HECS revenue has been used as a substitute for government funding, allowing the government to reduce its investment in university operating grants.
The Labor Party seems not to appreciate that HECS is now uncoupled from the operating grant. As Professor John Hay said to the higher education editor of the Courier-Mail:
... the Opposition is trying to have its cake and eat it by claiming it can reduce HECS charges in some areas, fail to make good the $220 million cost of doing so and still have the same amount of money available for university grants.
Professor Hay said it is nonsense and that a first-year economics student could work it out.
To be fair, I do not think that the member for Jagajaga really understands the difference between accrual and cash accounting. In the Australian, to Sid Marris, who is one of the most highly regarded economic journalists in the press gallery, on 4 August 2003, the member for Jagajaga said:
Dr Nelson's costings use the accrual accounting method, but Labor uses the cash system, which only includes the cost when it occurs.
The following day, to the higher education editor of the Courier-Mail,she insisted:
... under the accrual accounting system used in the Federal Budget, the $5,000 reduction to tens of thousands of students will have absolutely no impact on forward estimates for the years 2005 to 2007 covered in Labor's costings.
In the past that would have been the case. Then she goes on to say:
Sometime in the future there will be smaller cash transactions, which is what HECS repayments are, but this does not affect the Budget surplus or the deficit.
I am sorry to have to explain this to the opposition but, as the Department of Finance and Administration and the Department of Education, Science and Training have said, if the Labor Party chooses to reduce HECS for about 80,000 students in higher education, the increases in the net operating grant to the universities to offset the lower HECS contribution have to be accounted for now. In accrual accounting, which has been run over five successive budgets, the liability carried by the Commonwealth has to be accounted for.
There are two fundamental errors. Firstly, the Labor Party has not accounted for the cost to the Commonwealth and the liability of the Commonwealth in carrying that lower HECS liability—which, by definition, increases the operating grant—unless it does intend to reduce funding to universities by $220 million. Secondly, what the member for Jagajaga has done is to confuse cash accounting with accrual accounting. Further to that, she even said in her own media statement that students do not pay HECS directly to universities. In fact, the Leader of the Opposition himself has done just that—and he should not be criticised for it—on behalf of one of his own children.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Education: University Funding</title>,Matters of Public Importance,15,1
"Price, Roger, MP",ALP,2003-08-12,"—I would really like to ask the minister for education whether I understood correctly when he said—and is he suggesting this?—that the AVCC has got it wrong and that he has got it right. Is that what he is really saying in terms of the link?
—The AVCC is right.
—Okay. They do not have it wrong; they are right. In talking about higher education, I want to start off with a couple of facts. Before we look at the way this government is going to distort university education, let us consider that sandstone universities, from all sources of funding, whether it is Commonwealth, fees, donations or investments, get $25,000 per student. The new generation universities, such as the University of Western Sydney that I am so proud of, get $10,000. So before we start there is a huge distortion in the marketplace. The minister talks about globalisation and competition. I understand that. But that is distortion. In addition to that, you want to change it by allowing up to 50 per cent of all places to go to full fee paying Australian students. We are not going to look at the potential of students, at what they can aspire to; we are going to look at what their parents' bank balance is. If their parents have that money in the bank, they can get into university irrespective of the fact that they could not get in by merit. We believe in getting in by merit. I am very pleased that the University of Western Sydney has already ruled out having 50 per cent of its places reserved for those with appropriate bank balances. I would hope that other universities would do the same, but we know they will not. 
The minister did not say it in his speech, but he wants to allow universities to increase their HECS fees by some 30 per cent. That means for a course per year the HECS debt is going to rise on average by $1,650, from $4,600 to $6,250. For a three-year degree course the HECS debt under this minister will be $18,750. For a four-year course the HECS debt will be $25,000. I note the member for Prospect and other members from Western Sydney are present in the chamber. They know that people in Western Sydney are debt averse. That is why the University of Western Sydney ironically has one of the highest rates of people paying up-front fees: they are debt averse. We know that students are going to be deterred from undertaking a university course for that reason: they do not want to get into extra debt.
It is all very well for the minister. He comes from a region where there are plenty of students going on to university. If you look at the number of people in Western Sydney—that is, I might say, 1½ million people, and by the year 2016 more than 50 per cent of Sydney's people will live in Western Sydney—the proportion of people with degrees is 10.5 per cent; that is, 10 in 100 people have a university qualification. But for the rest of Sydney it is double that! In fact, the participation rate under John Howard and the minister is starting to come down in Western Sydney. More and more students are going to universities from Western Sydney, but the rate of increase in other parts of Sydney is climbing even faster, so our participation rate is coming down in comparison. And that is a tragedy.
The difference between the minister and his party and the Labor Party is this: when we see a young person, we think of their potential and what might be needed to have that potential realised—we like to give them a helping hand—but, as far as the minister is concerned, he wants to entrench privilege. `If you have got the money, you can get the profession; if you have got the money, you can get the degree.' We want to see more and more young people going on to university and going on to TAFE. We on this side of politics understand that the more learning you undertake and the more qualifications you have, the better chances you have of success in life. We want our fair share for the people that we represent.
What is happening to the University of Western Sydney? What a tragedy! The Labor Party, some 14 years ago, fought to have the university established. It is now the seventh largest university in Australia. It has 25,000 effective full-time students. It has six campuses: Bankstown, Blacktown, Campbelltown, Hawkesbury, Parramatta and Penrith. The Labor Party members that represent the areas that include those campuses such as the members for Blaxland and Prospect are inordinately proud of the university. We want to see it grow and develop, because we understand what opportunity it represents for the young people in our electorates. But, equally so, the members for Fowler, Werriwa, Greenway, Banks and Reid are all very proud and all very prepared to stand up for our university. 
What a shock it is! When the Canberra Times lists the winners and losers, have a guess who the No. 1 loser is: the University of Western Sydney. And of course there is a yike. The university is saying, `In 2005 we will miss out. We will be $7 million worse off.' And the minister says, `No, you won't. It's only $4 million.' The university says that, in total, it will be $30 million. What I want to know is: what is the member for Parramatta doing about it? What is the member for Macquarie doing about it? What is the member for Macarthur doing about it? What is the member for Lindsay doing about it? Aren't they proud of that institution? Don't they want to see that institution grow? Don't they want more of their constituents to be afforded the opportunity to go there? I certainly do. I do not want the University of Western Sydney to be the loser; I want it to be the winner. As one of the papers pointed out, in the next 10 to 15 years we are going to see a growth in Western Sydney equivalent to that of Canberra. And what does Canberra have? The ANU and the University of Canberra—two universities.
—Canberra has four universities.
—Four universities! Is the minister proposing that in Western Sydney we should have four new universities? What we know is that the changes he is bringing about are going to deter people from going to university. Two-thirds of those going to the University of Western Sydney are the first people in a family to go to a university. The newly preselected Labor candidate for the seat of Greenway is a graduate of the University of Western Sydney—the first, I believe, to have been selected by a political party. We want to see this university grow and develop, not be constrained.
Interestingly, 55 per cent of all applicants to the university are mature age students. These are often people with commitments. Whether they are women coming back to further their education or are people in a job and wanting to enhance their career prospects, mature age students often have existing financial commitments. If we increase the burden, we are saying to those mature age students in Western Sydney: `Don't go. You won't be able to make it. You will fall at the financial hurdle.' I am pleased to say that under the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Jagajaga, and the Labor Party we will provide opportunities. We will increase the number of places.

"Hull, Kay, MP",NP,2003-08-12,"—It staggers me that the member for Chifley can stand there and indicate that the love of his life is the University of Western Sydney when we know quite well that a detailed analysis by the Commonwealth Department of Education, Science and Training—which has been verified by the department of finance—has revealed that there is a massive black hole in the costing of Labor's higher education budget. We have estimated that the University of Western Sydney—the member for Chifley's absolute love—over three years would be around $7 million worse off under Labor's policy.
I am a proud owner of—and absolute advocate for—Charles Sturt University, because it is in my electorate. Later on, in the debate on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2003, I will be speaking about just how proud I am of this university. Under Labor policy, Charles Sturt University is almost $6 million worse off. I admire the patience and tenacity of the Minister for Education, Science and Training in trying to explain this issue to the member for Jagajaga but I really do not think you will achieve a breakthrough either with her or with the member for Chifley. 
I would like to quote an article from The Daily Advertiser, a newspaper in my electorate,written by Paul Enever—he will like this. The article says:
Charles Sturt University has denied claims it could lose up to 2633 university places under the Federal Government's higher education package.
In a press statement released yesterday, the Labor Party spokeswoman for education, Jenny Macklin, said CSU would be hit hard by education reforms, with up to 2633 Higher Education Contribution Scheme places at risk.
CSU's acting Vice-Chancellor Professor David Battersby said Ms Macklin's statement referred to places in the university's policing course, which are under a separate category.
“Ms Macklin seems to misunderstand what is happening between CSU and the police service,” Prof. Battersby said.
“These places are predominantly associated with policing initiatives in Goulburn.
“CSU has received assurances from the Federal Government that these places will be protected under its reform package,” he said.
The places referred to by Ms Macklin and Prof. Battersby are classified under an industry category, taking account of the number of police positions.
Minister, you cannot win. The member for Jagajaga honestly and obviously does not understand what it is all about and how the process works. I say to you, Minister, and to the member for Chifley, that I would much prefer to be looking at the figures for Charles Sturt University—this great university we have in the Riverina electorate and in other electorates.
—And Dubbo.
—And Dubbo—absolutely. I would prefer to be taking my luck with the minister's package because, in my own electorate of Riverina, the government's reform package will substantially strengthen the position of Charles Sturt University. The government's estimated projections of the impact of the new Commonwealth grants scheme, to be introduced as part of Backing Australia's Future, show that Charles Sturt University will be more than $11.3 million better off in 2005, $13.5 million better off in 2006 and $14.7 million better off in 2007. Over three years this government will deliver $39.5 million in additional funding to Charles Sturt University as against a projected and estimated loss, under a Labor package, of almost $6 million. Is it any wonder that I am here to support the minister for education today on behalf of my university—Charles Sturt University—in my electorate? It does not take a rocket scientist to understand why I would be standing here in support of him today.
The member for Jagajaga said that, because people have to pay, the Higher Education Contribution Scheme is preventing enrolments in universities. What she does not say is that there are many young people, who do not wish to enter university, who have been given great opportunities to take up New Apprenticeships. What do we have? We have some fan-tastic initiatives. In New Apprenticeships, this gov-ernment has put forward the greatest initiatives in the following areas: the commencement incentive; women employed in non-traditional areas; the rural and regional skills shortage; declared drou-ght area apprenticeships; mature age workers; the innovation incentive; and school based New Apprenticeships. In fact, it is so good that I have just put it out in my regular business newsletter. 
This is what you get from the Howard-Anderson government. But what do we see happening? Generally these apprenticeships take place in TAFE colleges—across New South Wales in particular. What do we see from Labor? We see a 300 per cent increase in TAFE fees. A 300 per cent increase in TAFE fees! Do not worry about the battlers just wanting an apprenticeship. Do not worry about helping others who cannot achieve university entrance. Do not worry about all of that. Just whack them on the head! Just smack them in the mouth! Increase their percentages by 300 per cent. Do not worry about these guys out here, because they are not worth anything; they are not valued. Because they do not belong in a university, they have no value. Let me remind the people of New South Wales in particular that if they want to go to a TAFE college and not to a university they have no value—the Labor Party has no consideration for where they might want to take their careers.
This government is providing opportunity for everybody—not just opportunity for a select few, as has been indicated by members on the other side of the House, who say that we are providing opportunity for a select few. We are not. We are providing opportunity for everybody—opportunity for people who cannot, will not and do not want to enter university. We are providing them with other opportunities that the Labor Party are consistently taking away from them.
We should not forget that as at December 2002 the accumulated HECS debt was $8.9 billion. The average HECS debt is around $8,000, with 90 per cent of people owing less than $16,000 and 80 per cent owing less than $12,000. Currently, students contribute on average just 26 per cent of the total cost of their education. Under the new arrangements in the minister's reform package those same students will contribute on average 26.8 per cent in 2005. Look at that against New Apprenticeships, TAFE fees, opportunities in the work force and the ability of employers to provide employment opportunities in those young people's lives. They are always being slugged. 
The Commonwealth is contributing more than 70 per cent of university students' education fees. In fact, the taxes of the mums and dads and the young workers subsidise that education. Yet when young people want to get a new apprenticeship they have to compete against the New South Wales government. Shame on the New South Wales government for creating the inability to take up apprenticeships. Not only that but the New South Wales government now want to go forward and make super regions so that TAFEs will find it even harder to attain value and equity. The New South Wales government want about eight super regions—`We have about 40 independent areas but now we want eight super regions, with the quality of control and the chain of command taken to the Wollongongs and the Sydneys and away from regional people.'
This debate is not about equity. This minister is about equity. This minister is about ensuring that all Australian people have the opportunity to get employment. Let us not forget that HECS recipients do not have to begin to repay their debt until their wages are above $30,000. For some of these young women and men who are looking at TAFE New Apprenticeships it will take many years before they reach an income of $30,000 per annum, but they will pay up-front for their opportunity to get a job. That is the difference. This government and this minister are about providing equity of education. I am surprised to hear the member for Jagajaga in her speech in the House—(Time expired)",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Education: University Funding</title>,Matters of Public Importance,15,1
"Windsor, Antony, MP",IND,2003-08-12,"—There must be something about the Minister for Education, Science and Training, because the last time I spoke about this issue was in the Main Committee and my glasses broke. They have just gone again. Maybe I will send him an account. I was hoping to read a letter from the Vice-Chancellor of the University of New England; I will attempt to do so with one eye. I appreciate the opportunity to say a few words in the university debate, particularly in relation to the University of New England. I know that the minister is aware of the concerns of the vice-chancellor, university council and others in relation to the funding implications for the University of New England.  
I listened intently to the member for Riverina and I agree with some of the things she said about the state government and the TAFE course funding rearrangements. I do not want to get into the Labor Party's policy document, because it is the current government's policy document that I am most concerned about. In relation to funding, I would be most concerned if I were the member for Riverina and the university were in a worse situation than under a previous arrangement. Therein lies the problem that the University of New England has, particularly in light of the fact that, before the reform was introduced into the public arena, the minister and the government said that the University of New England would be a winner. The minister said in the chamber that the University of New England would be better off under the reform process. I will try to paraphrase the letter from the vice-chancellor—I think I would be a bit blind with one eye—
—Do you want my glasses? We're cobbers in this place.
—I thank all those who are concerned about my welfare and vision. 
I now refer to an analysis of the reform process and its impact on the University of New England. I will read a portion of a letter from the vice-chancellor, Ingrid Moses. I know that the minister is on friendly terms with the vice-chancellor. She stated:
Now that we have done our analysis of the proposed Commonwealth Course Contribution sch-eme we find that in 2005 we—
meaning the University of New England—
will lose about $1.8 million on the new discipline profile funding and another $2 million on the loss of differential for coursework postgraduate enrolments.
That puts into context the unique position of the University of New England in relation to external enrolments and the implications of the formula that the government is using, particularly in relation to the regional loading. Professor Moses continued:
The regional loading of 7.5% on fulltime internal students helps to plug that hole by approximately $1.41 million and the enhanced nursing and education funding adds about $950,000.
But we will be still short in 2005 close to $1.5 million.
They have refined that process and it is now about $1.8 million. Professor Moses continued:
We also realize that the regional loading is only `indicative' and therefore we worry greatly that the lobbying of other universities might change the parameters of the proposed scheme leaving the real regional and rural universities with even less help.
Since this letter was written there has been some adjustment, probably quite legitimately, in relation to some of the other regional campuses—but not to `real' regional universities as referred to in the letter. Professor Moses continued:
The rationale for only including internal students in the calculation for the regional loading was the regional loading is directed to meeting the costs of the regional campus and not the institutional cost of serving external students, even though they may be counted against a regional campus. 
That is a very important point. She continued:
This rationale may hold with regard to a regional campus. However, we are not a regional campus but a regional university and all of our infrastructure and all our infrastructure costs are here in the region—
the region of New England. She goes on:
We would strongly argue that regional universities should be treated differently from regional campuses.
And the reform process as I understand it, and I think as the vice-chancellor understands it, does not adequately do that.
As a minimum we—
the University of New England—
would argue that external units with compulsory residential school requirements should be included in the calculation.
That is the underlying problem, particularly with the funding shortfall that the vice-chancellor recognises. I ask the minister to take that issue on board and do what he can to overcome that process.
According to a report in the Northern Daily Leader yesterday, there was a meeting of the University of New England council in Tamworth. Even though I am a councillor, I was unable to attend because of parliamentary duties. If the vice-chancellor is reported correctly, she reiterated the shortfall in funds and made this point about students studying law:
It really is not fair that a student studying law at the University of New England should have to find 80 per cent of the cost of their course. Other UNE students, let's say teaching, nursing and agricultural students, are only required to pay for 20 per cent of the course costs.
That is another issue that I believe they are going to take up in the Senate inquiry on 24 September when the committee meets in Armidale. I ask the minister to also take that issue on board.
There are many other concerns. I know that the minister said in another place that the shortfall that the University of New England is experiencing may be able to be taken into account in the $12½ million transitional fund, and that may be a short-term way out of the process. However, it underlines the longer term significance that the real regional universities, as opposed to the major metropolitan universities that have regional campuses, have different infrastructure and overhead costs. They should be addressed in any reform process or it will mean a diminution in the importance of the real regional universities—namely, those regional universities all of whose infrastructure and overhead costs are borne by the community in the region as opposed to their having the capacity to be subsidised, in some cases by the University of Sydney, by other communities. That has obvious impacts on the economic circumstances of regional campuses as opposed to regional universities.
Finally, there has been a lot of debate about what the Labor Party would do. I would not suggest that I am by any means on top of that issue; however, there has been a lot of debate about the shortfall and the black hole that would need to be plugged in relation to the Labor Party's policy position. I suggest, and I think the Labor Party is on the right track in relation to this, that if there is concern about a black hole then Telstra should not be sold. The difference between the current dividend gained by government and the interest that can be saved by the removal of debt would plug that black hole. If the Labor Party is going along with its policy position on education, I suggest that it continue its support for the non-sale of Telstra. The sale of Telstra would mean a negative cash flow for the government coffers. We would be better off not selling it and being able to plug some black holes in the recurrent budget. I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker Hawker, for the opportunity to make a contribution in this debate and I ask the minister to take on board the concerns raised by Ingrid Moses, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of New England.

"Gillard, Julia, MP",ALP,2003-08-12,"—The Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 deals with the indexation of Commonwealth grants in the higher education sector and a number of technical changes that are required to funding arrangements. It also deals with funding for the Mount Stromlo Observatory, which was damaged in the Canberra bushfires. The honourable member for Jagajaga, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, has moved a second reading amendment to this bill which deals with a number of the real issues facing the higher education sector in Australia. It is my intention to direct my remarks to that second reading amendment, most particularly the part of the second reading amendment dealing with the inadequate planning by the Howard government to meet key areas of skill shortage in Australia. I intend to deal particularly with skill shortages in the medical work force.
As members of the House would be aware, I was recently appointed as the opposition's shadow minister for health. In that capacity, I am still doing a lot of learning about the health system in Australia. I think if you asked any Australian what you needed to run a health system, amongst the most obvious answers would be doctors and nurses. You cannot run a health system without doctors and without nurses, but when you look at where the Howard government has got us to in terms of planning for the medical work force—for doctors and nurses—you are inexorably drawn to the conclusion that that is precisely what the Howard government is trying to do. It ultimately will be trying to run a health system without doctors and without nurses. 
The shortage of general practitioners in the Australian community is acute. The Howard government, for most of its period in office, has been moseying around, like Daisy the brown cow, basically denying that there is an issue with GP shortages. What we do know is that Australia has a shortage overall of general practitioners and that there is a maldistribution of general practitioners, so that we see acute shortages in outer suburban areas and in rural and regional Australia. The Howard government—with its Daisy moo cow, wandering around, not knowing what is happening next attitude to the health system, and most particularly this question of GP shortages—took forever to get to the stage where it acknowledged that there was a maldistribution of general practitioners. Now it has finally acknowledged what everybody else could have told it: there is an acute shortage overall of doctors. That is an issue that needs to be addressed through our higher education sector.
The acute shortage of GPs in the outer urban areas and in rural and regional Australia obviously compounds the problems that people have accessing a bulk-billing GP. If there is an acute shortage of doctors then there are no competitive pressures to bulk-bill, and it is no mystery that the general plummeting of bulk-billing rates has been most particularly severe in outer urban areas and in rural and regional Australia. In those areas there are doctor shortages and, where there are doctor shortages, there is going to be an absence of bulk-billing. Indeed, for many members of the community in outer suburban areas and in rural and regional Australia, the question facing them is not: `How can I find a bulk-billing GP?' It is often an even earlier question: `How can I get to see a GP?' From the perspective of my own electorate, we have families who move to the area because it is a growth corridor and then they have to ring five, six or seven GPs before they can get on their list or even be entitled to make an appointment with them, let alone choose a bulk-billing GP.
It is a fact that the Howard government's actions have exacerbated this GP shortage. The Howard government is not only in denial about this problem. It is most particularly in denial about the fact that it exacerbated the problem. It exacerbated the problem by changing training requirements. The first actions of the incoming Howard government in 1996 were to introduce mandatory postgraduate training requirements for GPs and introduce a limited number of training places—in fact, 400 training places each year. They were the first actions of the Howard government, and they limited our ability to get new GPs into our medical work force. Is it any wonder that the best advice available from the experts in the health sector was that Australia was already facing a medical work force shortage issue, particularly a shortage of GPs? I think that advice would have been available in 1996, but along came the Howard government, in denial about the problem, taking a policy measure which of course exacerbated the difficulty by cutting the number of GPs that could be trained each year.
We finally have a number of measures in the recent budget to start addressing the damage that has been done to our general practitioner work force. In particular, I would like to acknowledge that Labor supports the introduction of 234 more medical school places, bonded to areas of work force shortage, to address shortages in the medical work force, particularly in outer metropolitan and rural areas. That was an initiative that the Howard government, after being in denial about this problem and exacerbating the problem, finally took in the last budget, and we support that. Labor also supports the 150 more GP training places that are being made available to try and increase the number of GPs who are coming on stream and who are going to work in our medical work force. Finally, we have had some recognition of the training issues associated with having sufficient general practitioners. Whilst the Howard government has taken some measures to address the training issues for GPs and to create a sufficient medical work force with a sufficient number of general practitioners, we still see a range of inadequate measures to try and attract GPs to areas where they are needed. We know that the first cut at this to try and get GPs where they were needed was the ill-fated and ill-designed outer metropolitan doctors initiative, which was announced in 2001. 
 (Mr Hawker)—Order! I am reluctant to interrupt the member for Lalor, but this is the debate on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill. I ask the member to bring her remarks within the bill.
—Certainly, Mr Deputy Speaker. My remarks are most particularly directed to that section of the second reading amendment which deals with the Howard government's failure to plan adequately to meet key areas of skill shortage through higher education. I am directing my remarks to that. I am indicating that the Howard government has exacerbated a skill shortage of GPs in our community by changing training arrangements when it came into office in 1996. It is now involved in a series of catch-up measures, including the changes to the training arrangements made in the recent budget. Whilst Labor supports some of those measures, clearly there is a range of things which remain undone to try and get doctors into the areas where we need them.
I was commenting that one of those initiatives was the outer metropolitan doctors initiative, which did not have the effect intended. In fact, it was a spectacular failure in getting doctors to go where they were needed. We have seen the government try to quickly recut that measure into a new measure to get doctors to relocate to outer urban, rural and regional areas, but we are very concerned that that quickly recut scheme also has program flaws in it and will not be sufficient to meet the problem.
I will move on to the section of the second reading amendment which deals with the question of the skill shortage in nursing. I reiterate the comments I started with by saying that you do not really need to know too much about the health system to know that you cannot run it unless you have doctors and nurses. We have a problem with the supply of doctors and, as many members of the House would be aware—because either their constituents raise it with them or, as I suspect, many members of the House actually have nurses in their immediate family or in their extended family—there is clearly a major nursing shortage. The government has done next to nothing to look at the issue of how we are going to get enough nurses in training so that we end up with enough nurses in our medical work force.
I think many of us here in the House would be prepared to say that we understand that nurses are a crucial component of the Australian health work force—indeed, they are the single biggest component of the Australian health work force—and that historically the work of nurses has been undervalued in our society. It is estimated that Australia desperately needs at least another 800 university nursing places to meet basic work force requirements, and yet over the last five years universities have turned away nearly 9,000 prospective nurses. So in the higher education system we have a clear problem where 9,000 people who wanted to train to be nurses—who wanted to staff all of the sections of the health system, such as the hospitals and clinics, which desperately need nurses—were turned away. 
Labor's solution, as announced by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Jagajaga, is to put much needed funds into nursing education. Labor has committed to funding an additional 3,125 new full-time and part-time undergraduate nursing places by 2008. Labor's commitment extends to starting this program in 2004, with 550 new full- and part-time commencing nursing places. From 2005 this will increase to 1,100 new full- and part-time commencing nursing places each year. Labor has also committed to addressing this critical area of skill shortage in the work force by enabling more nurses to study in high-demand, specialist areas of skill shortage, including emergency and intensive care, cardiothoracic health, neonatal intensive care, midwifery, aged care and mental health. Labor has committed to creating 500 full-time HECS funded postgraduate nursing places from 2005 and has also committed to providing additional moneys for the clinical training of undergraduate nurses so they have a smooth transition from studying at our universities to working in a modern hospital.
What is the government's alternative to that? We know what the government's alternative is, because the minister for education likes to tell us about it in question time. It is full of statistics, but he does not tell us about the outcomes and, most particularly, does not release the reports that deal with these outcomes. The Howard government's alternative is to change our higher education sector to put private money—and in particular the capacity of individuals to pay—at the centre of our higher education system. Instead, they should give people an opportunity and ensure that Australia has the right mix of skills to deal with the whole range of issues that our economy and our society need to deal with—not the least of which, of course, is having a functioning health care system with the appropriate number of trained general practitioners and trained nurses.
Labor is opposed to making it harder for prospective doctors, nurses, dentists, physiotherapists and other health professionals to obtain their qualifications, and that is at the heart of the government's higher education plan. Labor is opposed to the Howard government's plans to deregulate university fees by allowing universities to increase fees under the Higher Education Contribution Scheme by up to 30 per cent. Labor is opposed to the government's loans scheme, with a six per cent interest rate, which we all know will impose crippling debts upon students. If I could take an example from the medical work force, a student who wants to study to become a midwife could face a student debt of $37,800, including $4,300 in interest, and that is over and above the actual cost of living.
We have a system being proposed which will not only create major problems in terms of opportunities for people but also, as we know from the reports that have finally been released—and we know that the government has been aware all along of the effect this package would have—deter students from proceeding further in school and deter mature age students from accessing universities. So there is a major opportunity issue for the individuals involved and a major equity issue. But apart from the opportunity and equity issues, there is obviously a major work force issue in making sure that Australia has the right mix of people in training so that they are available to fill the skilled jobs that our economy and our society require to be filled, and of course our health care system is at the core of that. 
Labor has committed to not allowing universities to charge full fees to students. To give once again an example from the health system: what is being proposed under the Howard government's regime is that you could have a full fee paying Australian medical student who would be in one of the 10 per cent of all the places in medicine which would be reserved for such students and who would need to be able to pay fees of up to $150,000. Clearly there are equity and access issues that will deter our best and brightest from being able to get funded places. Instead we will have a reserve system, a special system, where people who have the money get differential access. I think we are all aware from our own experience that there is keen competition amongst students to get into medicine. It is one of the hardest courses to get into. Many of our young people do aspire to become doctors. Labor is simply opposed to creating a system where people who have the money are able to buy a place. That is at the core of what the government is proposing.
I conclude by saying that this is a bill that Labor supports, but I urge the House to consider supporting the second reading amendment moved by the member for Jagajaga in her capacity as Labor's shadow minister for education. That second reading amendment deals with a number of very important issues facing our higher education system—there is a series of those issues—but it also deals with the critical issue of inadequate work force planning from this government. We know that that inadequacy is already costing our health system dearly.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"Hull, Kay, MP",NP,2003-08-12,"—I rise to speak in support of the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2003. As the member for Riverina I am extremely proud of a Wagga Wagga campus in my electorate and all that it has contributed and continues to contribute to the region. The campus that I speak of is that of Charles Sturt University. Charles Sturt is one of Australia's largest non-metropolitan higher education institutions and it boasts campuses in a number of other regional cities, including Albury and Bathurst. CSU is Australia's largest distance education provider, and it delivers more than 300 courses to more than 38,000 people on campus and via distance education in Australia and overseas.
CSU has received $1.2 million in funding from the Australian Research Council for 2003. The bulk of the CSU research projects are working towards securing sustainable futures for the regions that CSU is located within. These involve research in environmental, agricultural and wine sciences and cultural studies, which include the development of new natural herbicides, an examination of how colonisation has impacted on natural ecosystems and research into the role of weed mistletoe as an indicator of the health of our Australian bush. The collaborative industry partnerships with the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service will look at the damage caused to rice crops by waterfowl, and in partnership with New South Wales Agriculture they will look at soil health. Of the seven research projects funded, two receive industry partnership grants.
CSU will host the Fourth World Congress on Allelopathy in Wagga in September 2005. The one-week conference is expected to attract 200 delegates from across 50 countries. The university's research focuses on finding alternative non-chemical solutions for weed management in crops, including wheat and rice. CSU's researchers are among the few leading scientists in the world to use these advanced techniques to identify natural compound implants for potential use as natural herbicides. A senior lecturer in the School of Agriculture on the Wagga campus, Dr Gavin Ash, is leading innovative Australian research into the biological control of weeds and plant diseases, concentrating on crops that are important to our region. Vice-Chancellor Professor Goulter said the research being carried out by Dr Ash was making: 
... a direct contribution to farmers in the region and to the agricultural industry throughout Australia.
The CSU Winery is a $2.5 million state-of-the-art facility located in Wagga and was officially opened by the Minister for Education, Science and Training in April 2002. Charles Sturt's wine science and viticulture courses have developed into some of the most significant wine education courses in the world, with graduates in demand right across Europe and North America and in emerging wine export countries such as South America and New Zealand. One such example is Ron Brown. Mr Brown is a wine importer in Tokyo. One of our local papers, the Daily Advertiser, recently featured a story on Mr Brown, who is an off-campus student studying through Charles Sturt University in Wagga Wagga. He is currently completing his six-year Bachelor of Applied Science in wine science. He told the newspaper that his reason for selecting Charles Sturt University was that he `needed an English-speaking course that would allow him to study off campus and this was by far the best one'.
Mr Brown is just one of thousands of both on-campus and off-campus students who have chosen Charles Sturt University as the best university to meet their needs. Charles Sturt University's results in the 2003 Good Universities Guide have continued to be consistent with those of 2002, with the university achieving the highest rating—five stars—for entry flexibility and attraction of international students, four stars for graduate employment and three stars for non-government earning capacity. It scored two stars for graduate satisfaction and one for research.
The university supports two major research centres that focus on the socioeconomic viability and biophysical sustainability of rural landscapes. The Farrer Centre for Sustainable Food and Fibre Production in Wagga Wagga examines issues of relevance to rural communities with a concentration on production systems which minimise environmental impact. The second research centre is located in Albury. Charles Sturt University has a number of international partners in a range of countries, including Canada, China, India, Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Cambodia and the United Kingdom.
Another good news story to come from Charles Sturt University, Wagga, courtesy of the Daily Advertiser, is that of a group of Malaysian food science and biotechnology students. The students came from one of CSU's international partner institutions and will be studying and living in Wagga Wagga for the next year. Charles Sturt was chosen because it offered a degree in food science, whereas the college these people had come from, in Sedaya, offered diplomas in food science.
Mr Deputy Speaker, one might ask if I am merely doing a commercial for Charles Sturt University or if I am in fact speaking to the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2003. I had to go and clarify whether I was speaking on the higher education bill or on a different bill in case I had brought the wrong speech into the House, so I appreciate the slight indulgence you have given me to set the scene for why I believe that we should be supporting this bill with great gusto in the House. 
The recent figures released by this government show that Charles Sturt University will be more than $11 million better off in 2005 under the reforms to higher education. These figures indicate that Charles Sturt University's estimated operating grant in 2005 would be $112.675 million. The rise in funding continues to improve in the following years, with an increase of $13.595 million expected in 2006 and $14.715 million in 2007. Is it any wonder that I support this education package and reform?
These figures exclude additional money that has been generated through other initiatives in the reform package, such as fee-paying students or research grants and consultancies. Under the model that we have in front of us, Charles Sturt University will become the second highest funded regional university in New South Wales, behind Newcastle University—and I am all for that. For too long Charles Sturt University has languished with funding that was perhaps not quite what it required in order to deliver the best courses for rural and regional Australians—and of course for city Australians. Having said that, I note that we now have a minister and a government who are keen to take into consideration the injustice faced by our newer universities and to move forward positively.
Charles Sturt University has an enormous educational, social and economic influence on Wagga Wagga and the entire Riverina. It is serving the higher education needs of western and south-western New South Wales, and I intend to do all that I can to ensure that Charles Sturt University serves even more of rural Australia. There are plans under way to look at introducing revolutionary and innovative ways of providing doctors, including in obstetrics, for the future. 
Whilst Charles Sturt University attracts and services students throughout western and south-western New South Wales, as I have said, many students from metropolitan areas and interstate choose to study there, as do many overseas students. In 1995 there were 438,000 domestic undergraduate students in universities throughout Australia. In 2001 that number had increased to 485,500, representing an increase of 11 per cent. International education—including higher education, both onshore and offshore, vocational education and school education—has been one of the major export growth earners over the past six years. In the 2000-01 financial year international students contributed more than $4 billion to the Australian economy. Education exports are now the third largest export sector.
New Commonwealth scholarships will be offered to expand educational opportunities and choices for students from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds. Students from regional areas studying away from home will benefit from the new Commonwealth learning scholarships. Five thousand of these new scholarships per year, commencing with 2,500 in the year 2004, will be provided, at $2,000 each, to help students cover their educational costs. Another 2,030 new scholarships a year, valued at $4,000 each, will be offered to assist rural and regional students who move away from home with their accommodation costs. These will start in the year 2004, with an initial 1,500 scholarships awarded. 
From 2005 the Commonwealth will no longer set standard student contributions through the Higher Education Contributions Scheme. Instead, institutions will be responsible for determining student contributions within ranges set by the Commonwealth. Most undergraduate students will be Commonwealth supported students, and for these students the Commonwealth will continue to contribute towards the cost of the course for each student each year, depending on the discipline studied. 
Students currently contribute, on average, 26 per cent towards the cost of their education. Under the new arrangements, the average student contribution is expected to be 26.8 per cent in 2005. The Commonwealth will continue—as I indicated in the MPI earlier—to be the major investor in higher education, contributing more than 70 per cent towards students' education. However, if you listened to the opposition speak on this reform and on these bills in the House, you would think that the Commonwealth contributes not a cent. In fact, it is the main contributor towards higher education fees and, in particular, the costs of university students' education.
A learning entitlement will be provided to allow access to a Commonwealth supported place for five years of equivalent full-time study. The five-year entitlement will be extended where a student is undertaking an undergraduate course where the normal enrolment time frame is longer than five years—for example, medicine or double degrees with honours. Provisions will be made for individual institutions to grant extensions for genuine reasons, such as ill health. The learning entitlement will provide opportunities for more Australian students to gain access to a Commonwealth supported higher education place as new entrants occupy places freed up by those students who have used their entitlement. The learning entitlement will focus students on what they want to study and encourage them to do their best to pass.
From 2005 there will be a range of loans that currently do not exist—and this is pretty extraordinary; as I said, if you listened to the opposition having discussions and speaking on these bills in the House, you would think that the government had provided no other opportunity for the Australian people—for Australian citizens and holders of Australian permanent humanitarian visas to assist them with the payment of their tuition fees. These include HECS-HELP for eligible students enrolled in Commonwealth supported places to help them cover their contribution to tuition, and FEE-HELP for eligible fee-paying students enrolled at eligible higher education institutions. FEE-HELP loans will cover the full amount of tuition fees, with the opportunity to borrow up to $50,000. There will also be OS-HELP, for eligible full-time Commonwealth supported students who wish to study overseas for one or two semesters. Loans will be up to $10,000. We have to remember that currently there is no such provision available for students. So, if you want to go and get a loan now to further your education, you have to go to a commercial lender—and we all know the cost of the interest rate in a loan in the commercial lending area. So I congratulate the minister for putting this process into place because I believe that it is innovative and will provide much needed assistance and be welcomed by the Australian public. 
The minimum HECS repayment threshold, which we are hearing about so readily this afternoon, particularly during the MPI, will increase from $24,365, as it currently stands. You have to earn over and above $24,365 before you start paying back your HECS fees. The minister, in his package, has increased that to $30,000 from 2005, so this does provide relief for lower income graduates. Not only that, what it does is this: if you decide, after the course you took and the degree that you have achieved, that you do not really want to work in that area and you just want to go out and be a tremendously great little tourism officer or someone in a coffee shop—providing the benefits of your work attitude to other than the area that you studied—while it will obviously take a long time to reach a $30,000 income per annum, then you will not have to pay back your HECS fee. I think that is not clearly understood. It may seem that $30,000 is a small amount and that of course everybody will have to pay back their HECS fee because everybody earns $30,000. Well, I can tell you that not everybody earns over $30,000. In fact I know of employment histories where people do four-year apprenticeships, come out as skilled tradesmen and their award wage is still $398 per week. They will never get to $30,000 per annum under that award wage. To me the $30,000 is a very generous amount. I believe that moving the amount from $24,000 up to $30,000 is quite generous in that it means you do not have to start paying back your HECS fees until over and above that amount is earned, and then of course it is on a sliding scale. I again applaud the minister. 
At the end of December 2002, the accumulated HECS debt, which we have heard so much about today, stood at $8.9 billion, as I indicated in the MPI. The average HECS debt is around $8,000—you would think it was $800,000 given the discussion that we have had at the dispatch box this afternoon—with 90 per cent of people owing less than $16,000 and 80 per cent owing less than $12,000. So in the debate this afternoon we had a distortion of the actual reality of the facts and the numbers as to how much money people are going to have to pay for an education. The evidence put in front of us quite clearly indicates the average HECS debt and the average repayments, and I think it is really quite wrong to distort the picture to get a political point across.
Current HECS students starting higher education studies in 2004, both full time and part time, will be able to study under current HECS contribution levels until the end of 2008, unless they discontinue their enrolments. So they will be able to study under the current HECS arrangements until we bring in these arrangements, when they will get the benefit of the increase to $30,000 before they have to start paying the loan back. It is quite a windfall and it should be recognised that the students currently studying will be able to take advantage of that $30,000 repayment loan, even though they are studying under the HECS regime that we have in place at the moment, so I think that they will be well looked after.
No student, including those who take up a full fee paying position, will be required under this legislation to pay fees up-front. I would like to quote a number of figures from Charles Sturt University's submission to the Higher education at the crossroads review of higher education. The following figures speak for themselves, indicating the importance of regional universities, such as Charles Sturt University, to the communities that they are a part of:
In 2001, CSU—
Charles Sturt University—
enrolled over 38 000 students, 24% from CSU's designated regions, 13% from other non-metro-politan regions, 43% from metropolitan Australia and 20% from overseas.
Its programs currently enable over 14 000 regional students to participate in higher education without having to relocate to metropolitan areas.
Further, CSU research indicates that on average 64% of regional students who study at CSU remain to work in regional Australia.
This will be even better fulfilled when they get the funding injection that they have been given in this higher education reform. This will be even better when they are significantly better off—about $39 million better off—under this government, as opposed to the projected figures of the possible loss of income to them under a Labor plan. So I say that for all intents and purposes I support this bill. (Timeexpired) ",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2003-08-12,"—The Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 provides for indexation of Commonwealth grants to cost changes. Although there would appear to be deficiencies in the current indexation arrangements, which fall short of Labor's proposals that seek to protect the real value of the Commonwealth funding, that is not the reason I wish to rise tonight and make comments.
Before I go to the issues that concern me in the government's education policies, I would like to make particular mention of Labor support for the reconstruction of the Mount Stromlo Observatory. This is an important step in rebuilding this historic national icon, which has been a tragic loss to this region and, in particular, to the Australian National University. I am sure that everyone in this House would agree that a $50 million contribution to have it restored is worth every penny. When the fires broke out earlier this year, I sought to find out a bit more about the Mount Stromlo Observatory. As I said, it is an icon for Australian science. It was the first Commonwealth building constructed after Canberra became the capital. Observations have been made from that site since 1911. It was established formally in 1924 and it has only recently had its 75th formal anniversary. Apart from the fact that many people's jobs have been adversely affected as a result of that tragic loss in the fire, valuable national and international work has been put on hold. Therefore, I think it is important for the local community, the science community and this nation as well as internationally that it be restored. I am very happy to support that provision in this bill.
In speaking on this bill, I am reminded of what I consider deficiencies in Backing Australia's Future, which was announced by the Minister for Education, Science and Training this year. There are many problems confronting our education system and they are not being addressed. These include the inability to meet the unmet demand for university places; the imposition of ever-burgeoning debt onto our students and, consequently, in many cases, their families; the failure to properly audit the nation's skill shortages, particularly in areas such as teaching and nursing; and the absolute neglect of and disregard for the links between higher education and TAFE. In fact, TAFE has not really been mentioned at all in the government's policy in a tangible sense. No vision or innovation can be found in the policies of the government in this area.
Further, the intrusion of ideological pursuits—in particular, the tying of funding to the industrial relations agendas of the government—has been criticised by people both outside and inside this place. It is criticised quite rightly, because there is no room for the ideological obsessions of the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. But they have been happily embraced by the Minister for Education, Science and Training in pursuit of a package that is supposed to be acceptable to the education community of Australia.
In short, this policy has major flaws. In all dealings, the government's intention is to develop an education system which has the propensity to concern itself with the elite of our society. It is an education system that places money before merit. It is short on equity and imagination, and devoid of innovation. It is no wonder, therefore, that students and their families across Australia recently protested against the Nelson packages. It is also not surprising that the first AC Nielsen poll after the minister's proposals were announced found that 70 per cent of the electorate were unequivocally opposed to Nelson's imposition on students' HECS fees. 
The reasons that the overwhelming majority of people are opposed to the hikes to student fees are, I believe, twofold. Firstly, the community understands that Australian students are already paying a very high price for their education and they are very well aware that, the greater the impost that applies to students' HECS fees, the greater the likelihood that children from ordinary working families will be priced out of access to university or other forms of higher education. Government members have remarked that there is hypocrisy in Labor's opposition to increase HECS fees as it was Labor who introduced the HECS fee system. That is true. The fact is—and there is no point saying otherwise—that Labor did introduce the HECS fee system during the Hawke-Keating period. But it was a system that provided a capacity for students to have a decent quality of life while studying. It did not increase fees and compel students to repay those fees on the lowest of incomes, which is exactly what is happening now.
I think it was then Minister Dawkins who introduced a system where, once a graduate reached the average wage or more—and the average wage, for those who do not know, is usually around the top 30 per cent of income earners in this country; it is not around the middle—they would be compelled to pay an amount. But, over the last 10 or more years, certainly since 1996 and the election of the Howard government, there has been a reduction of that threshold to the point where it hardly matters now what sort of job a graduate has—they would be compelled to pay that fee, regardless of whether it places them below the poverty line. That is the sort of government we have here: it has no regard for students who are in that position and it has bastardised the HECS system that was introduced by Labor.
In effect, this government has decided that the $5 billion shortfall in the university budget will be paid by students and their families. Under the government's plans, the HECS fee could increase overnight by up to 30 per cent. Already the University of Sydney have said that they will be imposing the full 30 per cent increase. If we look at the average increase in the cost of different types of degrees, an arts degree could cost up to $15,000 more and a science degree could cost an extra $21,000. So we are looking at the costs of general graduate degrees increasing at an extraordinary rate, with no real concern or regard for whether that is going to impact upon the capacity of students to continue their education. That is a major problem with the package that has been introduced by this government.
We on this side of the House understand from the minister's comments during question time that the government seeks to sell its package by appealing to people's worst instincts or most base views. The government is trying to engender much envy or enmity towards the recipients of higher education, perpetuating the myth that the only beneficiaries of the higher education system are those who are fortunate to enter it. This government is attempting to pit the users of the education system, the entrants into the system, against those people who have not been fortunate enough to enter the system. That behaviour, that tactic, is tawdry abuse of the government's information, and I think it should be stopped.
There is little effort by this minister to promote the notion that education is good for the nation and all its citizens. Indeed, the converse is true. An education system that is flawed and deficient will ensure that the citizens of the country will have major difficulties in living up to the many changes that are occurring in today's society. Clearly, the minister has really failed to lift the debate about the need to have a decent system that provides the greatest access possible for as many students as possible in order for this country to prosper. Instead, the minister attempts to say, `There are people out there who can't get in. Why should they in any way be concerned about a decent education system for this country?' That is a very base level of debate and not one that I would expect a minister for education in this country to be promoting throughout the community. Alas, the minister is doing just that. 
I have for some time now supported the idea that students should contribute to their education. I was very up front in acknowledging the fact that the original HECS system came in under a Labor government. I think that the mix was correct. I can remember a lot of people being upset by the system, but I think that there is no reason why a student should not pay a direct contribution to their education—provided that they can undertake their education, pursue those qualifications and have a decent life. The balance is completely skewed now against the capacity of students to learn, to gain qualifications and to live a decent life during that period. I accept that it is reasonable to expect a student to contribute, as I say. But I refuse to swallow the notion that this government hikes up student fees because the minister is concerned that a cleaner—real or imagined—whom he meets between getting out of his limousine and walking into a vice-chancellor's rooms, will have to contribute to education services with her taxes. That is the sort of anecdote that we hear quite often on this issue. Between getting out of his car and meeting a vice-chancellor, Brendan Nelson meets a cleaner who says, `I have never been into a university. I do not really think I should contribute in any way.' What Brendan Nelson does not tell the hardworking cleaner—
 (Mr Barresi)—I remind the honourable member to refer to the minister by his title.
—What the minister fails to tell that cleaner is that he is ensuring that the cleaner's sons and daughters are not going to make it into university. With the raising of the HECS fee to astronomical levels, the minister should be telling that cleaner: `We are raising the HECS fee. We know that you have never been to university, but, as a result of raising the HECS fee, your sons and daughters will never get to university.' That is the one thing the minister fails to tell the cleaner when he gets out of his limousine and goes into the vice-chancellor's rooms. That is the one thing he fails to tell cleaners and every other tradesperson and labourer that he seems to meet on his way to these important meetings.
That is the fundamental difference between Labor and this government. This minister attempts to draw envy from the people who are unable to get into university towards those who are. In doing that, in using such a base argument, the minister fails to raise the level of debate about how important the education system is. He also fails to accept that by increasing the HECS fee he is stopping people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds from gaining an opportunity to enter university and other forms of higher education. That is the reality. No anecdotes from the minister in question time or at any other time will ever change that fact.
I say to the minister: `Spare us your crocodile tears.' Working families and their children will wake up to you if they have not already. You have no regard for increasing the number of places for those people in the community. That is the reality: let us increase the HECS fee to make it almost impossible for people who are unable to pay the fees to enter university. The government's impost through HECS fees will make it harder, not easier, for poorer students. It will welcome with open arms students who have the ability to pay, but it will close the door on people with merit. 
The other issue that shows a deficiency in the government's policies is the unmet demand that was raised by the shadow minister in the MPI today and has been raised on a number of occasions. The fact is that the government has not addressed the unmet demand in the system. The shadow minister for education has already foreshadowed that we would be looking to increase places—20,000 places for university and 20,000 places for TAFE—but the fact is that the government has no answer to this unmet demand. The existence of unmet demand for qualified applicants points to evidence that the higher education sector is still not big enough to meet the existing aspirations of the community. Figures released by the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee revealed that 53,925 qualified Australians could not get a university place in 2002. This represented a 33 per cent increase in unmet demand for university places since 2000-01. Within a very short space of time there has been an increase in unmet demand.
The other interesting statistical change in recent times has been the extent to which people are in receipt of higher education in Australia. In 1996, 36 per cent of young adults were in receipt of a bachelor's degree or higher. That figure has fallen to 27 per cent. Australia has slipped from second to ninth of the 11 OECD countries that were placed in the report. There is a real problem with unmet demand. The fact is the government has failed to address it in the package. The government therefore has to turn its mind to that if it wishes to be taken seriously as a government that concerns itself with broadening the educational base of this country and providing the capacity for people to enter the system. That is another problem.
Another failure of the government's proposals that I made a reference to earlier is the scant regard for TAFE. Comparison between the government policy and Labor's policy announcements shows stark differences. Last month the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister announced the policy entitled `Aim Higher: Learning, Training and Better Jobs for More Australians'. And what an improvement it is on the government's feeble effort! Under Labor's plan, 20,000 new places would be created annually for TAFE. In comparison, the government has offered nothing to contribute to the TAFE system—not one extra dollar, not one place—despite the enormous need in the system.
This government pay lip-service to education generally and have absolute contempt for the TAFE system. Currently 15,000 school leavers who are qualified and wish to undertake TAFE courses are turned away each year. Any conversation with industry would reveal to those that are interested that a critical skills shortage is occurring. That has to be addressed. There are major problems in many areas, including maths and science. As I said earlier, the shadow minister has talked about ensuring that the maths and science degrees will go down to the lower band of HECS fees to encourage more graduates. The government have to start turning their eye to broadening the education system, bringing in those people that wish to be properly qualified and alleviating the financial imposition on students. If we fail to do this, we will be attracting people who have money but not merit. We will be putting people up who have no necessary understanding of the qualifications they are after, just a bigger bank balance than those people who seek qualifications and seek them genuinely.

"Pearce, Christopher, MP",LP,2003-08-12,"—It is terrific to be in this place tonight to talk on this great news story bill, the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2003. The fact is that education is the key to Australia's future. When we talk about education, we are talking about the quality and the range of education and training opportunities available to young Australians throughout this great country of ours. I am pleased to say that the Howard government has been working hard to improve education in Australia at all levels, whether in schools through initiatives such as the national literacy and numeracy benchmarks, in vocational education and training through initiatives such as the New Apprenticeships program or in the higher education sector through initiatives such as the recently announced Our Universities: Backing Australia's Future package, which I will return to later in my remarks.
The Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 is the latest in a line of practical measures that the government has taken as part of its commitment to a sustainable quality higher education sector. It is worth considering what has already been achieved by way of reform since 1996. This government has increased access to universities for young people. The total number of domestic students in higher education last year was 498,000 full-time equivalent students, an increase of 75,000 since 1995. In 2003 the government will fund almost 400,000 undergraduate and postgraduate non-research places in universities, with more than 370,000 of these for undergraduate students. In fact, by 2004 there will be 8,300 more fully-funded undergraduate places than there were in 2001. The introduction of the new Postgraduate Education Loans Scheme will assist an estimated 240,000 students to enhance lifelong learning opportunities.
The government has not only increased overall access but also provided increased opportunities for students from different backgrounds to address issues of equity and access. Since 1995, the number of rural and isolated students accessing higher education has increased by almost 10,000 and the number of students from low socioeconomic status backgrounds has increased by more than 10,000.
To back the government's commitment, over $6 billion in Commonwealth funds will go to the higher education sector this year. On top of this, the government's policies have provided universities with the flexibility to attract external income both new and incremental. The result is that the total revenue available to higher education institutions this year is estimated at a record $11.3 billion—almost $2.7 billion more than was available to universities since 1995.
Research is an integral part of the higher education sector's contribution to our country's future. For example, total expenditure on R&D by the higher education sector was estimated to be some $2.8 billion in 2000—an increase of nine per cent since 1998. To support these endeavours, targeted funding for research and research training, through the Department of Education, Science and Training—excluding science programs and funding through general operating resources—will this year total $1.46 billion, up from $1.3 billion in 2002.
The government has committed an additional $1.3 billion over five years from 2002—under the government's innovation action plan, Backing Australia's Ability—for higher education research and research training. This includes around $736 million over five years to double funding for the Australian Research Council; increase grants under the Discovery and Linkage programs; double the number of postdoctoral fellowships; fund new Federation Fellowships; and increase salaries for holders of ARC awards. It also includes around $583 million over five years for both project infrastructure and systemic research infrastructure such as libraries and information and communications technologies. Specialised equipment and technical assistance will also be provided. 
It is in this light that we consider this bill—the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2003. The bill can be considered in two parts: those provisions amending the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 and those amending the Australian Research Council Act 2001. Let us begin by looking at the amendments to the Higher Education Funding Act. The Higher Education Funding Act 1988 makes provision for grants of financial assistance to higher education institutions and to other bodies for higher education purposes. Importantly, it also establishes HECS, PELS, the Open Learning Deferred Payment Scheme and the Bridging For Overseas Trained Professionals Loan Scheme. Finally, the act makes provision for the repayment of moneys lent by the Commonwealth to students under those various schemes.
This bill assists the higher education sector financially by updating the funding amounts provided under the act to reflect the indexation of grants for 2003 and the latest estimates of HECS liability. The bill also provides $7.3 million this year to assist the ANU in rebuilding its world-class research facility at Mount Stromlo Observatory following its devastation by the Canberra bushfires in January this year. Financially, these amendments increase the overall appropriation for this year by over $58 million.
The Australian Research Council Act establishes the ARC as an independent body that administers Commonwealth research programs, makes recommendations to the minister on funding allocation and provides advice on research matters as requested. The amendments in this bill are intended to streamline the administration and financial management of the ARC, its advisory structures and indeed its research programs. The amendments update the composition of the ARC board and strengthen the `disclosure of interest' requirements for board members, provide for the appropriation of funds by financial year rather than by calendar year and provide the minister with greater flexibility in determining the funding split between various research programs. In terms of their financial impact, the amendments increase the overall appropriation by over $436 million for the period 1 January 2003 to 30 June 2007. This bill is part of the government's ongoing support of the higher education sector.
Let us consider the reform program ahead. The reform program has been developed as a result of a review of the higher education sector which consulted widely with universities, student groups, unions, the business community and various other stakeholders. The consultations produced a broad consensus that the current arrangements for funding universities were not sustainable. Indeed, it revealed that, in the longer term, it would lead to an erosion of the excellent reputation of Australia's universities.
The result of the review is an integrated policy framework based on four fundamental principles: sustainability, quality, equity and diversity. The framework was announced by Minister Nelson as part of this year's Commonwealth budget. The new proposed system will enable individual universities to better capitalise on their particular strengths and to determine the value of their course offerings in the marketplace. There will be renewed emphasis on teaching and learning outcomes, greater recognition of the role of regional campuses and institutions, and a framework for research in which all Commonwealth funding is either competitive or performance based. 
The proposed arrangements for student financing will encourage lifelong learning and ensure equity of access to higher education. This means that no eligible student will be required to pay fees up front when they enrol with an eligible higher education institution. Under the proposed reforms, improved access for disadvantaged groups will be supported, and the market for private higher education will be opened up also. The quality control mechanisms of the higher education sector will be enhanced to ensure real and practical benefits from the reforms and increased investment by the Commonwealth, particularly for the benefit of students.
Diversity will be encouraged through the creation of performance based incentives for institutions to differentiate their missions and purposes. Underpinning the proposed plan, around $1.5 billion in additional funding will be invested in higher education over the next four years, with more than $660 million extra per year from 2007. Over the next decade the federal government will provide more than $10 billion in new support for higher education. This includes an estimated $6.9 billion in additional funding to the sector and approximately $3.7 billion in assistance to students through new student loans. 
When you consider the past and the present, and indeed when you look into the future, particularly the future of higher education, it is clear that the Howard government has a strong track record of real achievement and a real plan for the future. That is important to my electorate and it is very important to me. At the time of the 2001 census, almost 5,000 Aston residents were attending a university or other tertiary institution, with over 3,500 more attending a technical or further education institution. In the case of Aston, many students attend the Clayton campus of Monash University or the Burwood campus of Deakin University—which are located in the eastern suburbs right next door to my electorate of Aston—or indeed the Swinburne campus in Wantirna South in my electorate. In addition, over 10,000 Aston residents hold an undergraduate qualification and around 3,000 hold a postgraduate qualification.
In Aston education is important. Aston residents understand at first hand the importance of getting the higher education sector right for the benefit of all Australians—and that is what I am committed to doing as the member for Aston and as a member of this government. I commend this bill to the House.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"George, Jennie, MP",ALP,2003-08-12,"—I am pleased to participate in the discussion on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2003. As other speakers have indicated, one of the primary purposes of this bill is to provide for the indexation of Commonwealth grants for universities. While in principle the measures are supported, I want to make some comments about what I consider to be the inadequacy of the current indexation arrangements. Further, I want to lend support to the arguments advanced by the member for Jagajaga in relation to the comprehensive amendment which she has moved and which draws specific attention to the inadequacies of this government in tackling the real issues facing this sector.
There is widespread acknowledgement in our community that Australia's fortunes as a nation, particularly in economic terms in an increasingly competitive global environment, depend very largely on our investment in education, our human capital and, in that regard, the money that we invest in the tertiary sector, be it in the university sector or vocational sector. Regrettably, I do not think that this message is being heeded by the Howard government, which have continued to pursue a strategy of reducing public investment in our universities. As we know, $5 billion has been slashed out of this sector by this government since their election back in 1996. Regrettably, the government see the benefits of tertiary education as primarily conferring private benefits. That mistaken view has propelled the government in the direction of shifting the financial burden onto individual students and their families. 
Labor see the issue quite differently. We support greater public investment and long-term reform of this sector. We see a whole host of public benefits accruing from investment in all areas of education. We see education as an important component of investment in the skills, knowledge and employment of the nation. In this regard, university education, like TAFE education, is a shared investment which has important public as well as private and personal benefits. Central to this view is our desire to see a wider distribution of these benefits through increasing opportunities for all and ensuring that cost and financial means are not a barrier to educational access and participation.
Under this government, public investment in our universities has fallen dramatically, with dire consequences for the university sector. If you do not believe what I am saying, let me quote a very authoritative body, the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, who earlier this year said:
Lifting the funding base, starting with a more realistic indexation of the system, will benefit all universities—and every Australian university is under strain and needing support to sustain quality and efficiency.
Similarly, the National Tertiary Education Union, which covers both academic and ancillary staff at universities, in its last federal budget submission said:
Cuts to public investment and Government failure to compensate universities for increases in cost structures are at the core of growing concern about the quality of Australia's university sector. The reduction in public resources available to universities is the primary cause in the decline in access and quality.
There we have it. Two very authoritative sources in that sector are arguing the case for greater public investment and the vice-chancellors are talking about the need for a more realistic indexation formula to apply.
I now want to turn to the indexation of university grants, which is a very significant element of the bill. As I said earlier, I support the principle of indexation, but I am concerned about the inadequacy of the arrangements that currently apply. The arrangements in this sector are compounding the financial difficulties confronting all our universities. Thankfully, our recent policy announcement will see the introduction of a fairer indexation regime which, as its end result, will maintain the real value of universities' operating grants.
I say that the present indexation formula is inadequate for the following reasons. At present, the grants to universities are indexed on the basis of movements in what is known as the higher education cost adjustment factor. When you analyse the basis of the indexation formula, you begin to realise that it is a totally inadequate measure to deal with the real costs of running a university as it does not measure the actual price increases in the sector. The current adjustment is based on two elements. Seventy-five per cent is based on the safety net adjustments as determined by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission but, as we know, the wage increases in the university sector, to academic and non-academic staff, in recent years have been far in excess of the safety net adjustments that flow to those predominantly without bargaining power in our economy. So 75 per cent of the formula is based on a salary adjustment which bears no relation to what is actually happening as a result of bargaining in that sector, and only 25 per cent of the indexation factor is currently based on the consumer price index. These proportions are notional and in fact bear no relation to the actual expenditure and running costs of universities. 
The government appear to have recognised that there are problems with the current formula but they have done little about it. They have stated that a review of the higher education cost adjustment factor would occur once the ABS developed the new wage cost index. The wage cost index has been developed but nothing more has been heard from this government. The significance of this silence is highlighted by the overview paper for the higher education review, which noted:
Over the period from August 1997 to August 2001 the wage cost index increased on average by 3.25 per cent compared with the safety net adjustment average of 1.55 per cent.
In other words, we have been supposedly compensating universities but at a much lower rate than the real costs, particularly the real costs that have flown on to the salary outcomes that have been bargained in that sector.
It is no wonder that the universities are under financial pressure. As a result of the lack of full indexation, the problems have been compounded and have led to quite a substantial increase in staff-student ratios, which appear on average to have increased by about 22 per cent since the election of this government. Every university will tell you that they are overcrowded, that there are fewer contact hours in classes and that larger class sizes seem to be the norm. While we are supporting the principle of indexation, it is an opportune time to call on the government to do something about this unfair system that has been operating for many years.
I welcome the fact that Labor have recognised the importance of maintaining the real value of operating grants in our university sector. Unlike the government, we will use the wage cost index that has been developed to measure the real impact of price changes on universities and fund them accordingly. In our estimates, that will deliver $312 million of additional funding to the universities by 2008.
But the inadequacy of the indexation arrangements is only part of the problem confronting this sector. As I said earlier, Australia's public investment in universities is on the decline. It is not just low by international standards, it has been falling while public investment has risen in other countries. According to recent data from the OECD, between 1995 and 1999 Australia's public investment in universities declined by 12 per cent—a decline higher than that in any other comparable nation. A recent study which looked at OECD nations highlighted this fact, placing Australia fourth among the nations most reliant on private funding and primarily that has been derived from increasing the burden on students and their families. We are being left behind as a nation while our international competitors are reaping the economic and social benefits of public investment in tertiary education.
I believe that the government's funding policies are not in the best national interest. Further, the government's policies are imposing an excessive burden on students and their families which has a profound implication on access and equity grounds. Since 1996, student contributions to the cost of a university degree have increased by over 85 per cent. Student fees and charges now make up nearly 40 per cent of the income of universities. When the government was elected that contribution was 25 per cent. You can see the huge growth, and the huge burden that is being carried, as a result of a shift from public to private investment. By comparison, Commonwealth funding now represents only 44 per cent of university income, down from 57 per cent when this government was first elected. 
I fear that much worse is to come, particularly under the strategies and policies being proposed by the minister in his higher education reform package. The government's main policy response is to claim that the current position is unsustainable but, rather than looking at the option of increasing public investment and recognising the shared benefits of that investment, they are now moving in the direction of slugging students and their families even more than they have slugged them in the last four or five years. We see this in the proposal that would permit HECS contributions to rise by up to 30 per cent. We see it in the proposal to introduce a loan scheme to encourage more full fee paying students. We see it in the proposal to increase the number of full fee paying places so that, in theory, half—I repeat, half—of all university places could go to people who buy their way into a university. This, of course, will lead to the position where money, not merit, will be the key to opening the doors of our universities in the future.
When you consider that at, for example, the University of Sydney, where I trained, the full fee for a law degree is now $85,000 you do not have to be a genius to know who will be missing out in future years. It is no surprise that we heard in debate today about the doctoring of a departmental report, which eliminated those sections which showed the impact of these increased fees and charges particularly on poorer and older students. So there is no joy in the strategy being proposed by the minister and by this government which continues to see a decline in public investment and a shifting of the burden onto individual students and their families.
While on the issue of university funding, let me once again put on the public record my profound disappointment with and anger at the government's treatment of the University of Wollongong and, specifically, its exclusion from the regional loading allocation. It is absurd that the University of Wollongong is not considered by the minister to be a regional university for the purposes of this grant. Why? Allegedly it is because Wollongong has a population of 257,000 people—7,000 more than the magical but arbitrary cut-off figure used by the minister for education to define what he believes to be a regional campus.
The end result of this absurdity is that the university that services my community will have an effective cut of $2 million from its budget. The loss is more disturbing because the government's criteria for determining regionality are completely arbitrary. Staff, students and the community know that the University of Wollongong is a regional university, but it seems only the minister for education believes otherwise. Not only is he out of touch on this matter; he also is out of touch in completely failing to recognise the impact of his policies on Australian universities and on the Australian community. Regrettably, the seven years of neglect that we have witnessed since the election of the Howard government appears to be the precursor of worse to come under the policies and directions set by the minister for education.
Let me conclude by saying that everybody recognises that our future as a nation is increasingly posited in a global, international context and that if we are to succeed we have to recognise that public investment in our people, in our social capital, in our education systems, in innovation and in research and development is the key component of a successful nation in a globalised environment. Our trading partners and OECD nations that we compare ourselves with recognise that public investment is necessary in this sector. They are boosting their effort at the same time as our effort is declining. Our effort in a short space of time has declined by 12 per cent. There is 12 per cent less contribution from the Commonwealth government at the same time as the burden is being increasingly shifted onto the shoulders of students and their families. 
It is no wonder that alarm bells are ringing, because the full fees that are being paid at some universities, ranging from $80,000 to $100,000 and even more a year, will mean that education in the tertiary sector will regrettably again be the preserve of the elite and well-off in our community. In other words, we will be turning the circle back to the bad old days where people who come from backgrounds where they do not have the financial means and capacity to buy their way into a university degree will be denied the access, the opportunities and the benefits that further education gives to them and to our whole community. It is very regrettable that the government, after all these years, is still moving along the track of shifting the burden onto individuals and not recognising the short-sightedness in strategic terms of its lack of support for public investment in this critical sector.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"Dutton, Peter, MP",LP,2003-08-12,"—I often listen with interest to the member for Throsby because, on many of these issues, she often makes a valuable contribution. Regrettably tonight, for part of the speech that I listened to, the member for Throsby spoke about the government's policy and what she perceived as the inadequacies of that policy. She neglected to tell the House that the Labor Party, in formulating their latest unfunded higher education policy, borrowed much of the government's policy in this area. So for a government that has a flawed education policy, in the words of the member for Throsby, we could not have done it too badly because the shadow minister is the person responsible for ripping off most of our policy to create their own.
The Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2003 provides for an additional $58.39 million in funding for universities in 2003, and it does that to reflect indexation increases and other technical adjustments. The bill also sets a new maximum aggregate funding amount for the years 2002 and 2003 to reflect actual HECS liabilities, budget decisions and other technical adjustments. This bill also puts in place the legislation for this government to fund the reconstruction of the Mount Stromlo Observatory that was announced in the 2003-04 budget. This $7.3 million in funding will assist the Australian National University to rebuild its world-class research facilities which were devastated by the Canberra bushfires in January this year. In particular, instrumentation workshops and a heritage building will be reconstructed and two new telescopes will be purchased to replace those lost in the fires. The contribution will help the Australian National University continue its cutting-edge astronomy research and demonstrate the government's commitment to re-establishing the Mount Stromlo Observatory as a world-leading facility. The government's contribution is in line with assistance provided in the past to other universities that have been victims of natural disasters.
Importantly, this bill also amends the Australian Research Council Act 2001, which establishes and appropriates money for the Australian Research Council. As we know, the ARC plays a key role in the delivery of research funding and outcomes in Australia, providing economic, social and cultural benefits to the entire Australian community. Indeed, one of the largest single initiatives of Backing Australia's Ability is an additional $740 million for research funded through the ARC. That funding will double the Australian Research Council's capacity to fund grants through the National Competitive Grants Program over a period of five years. This bill provides $275 million of that additional funding to be provided in 2006-07. This bill also provides for improved organisational productivity and accountability and will simplify ARC project and program administration. 
This bill reflects the government's commitment to Australia's higher education sector, and that was shown in this year's budget by the package of visionary higher education reforms which are shortly to be introduced to the House. It shows that we recognise the quality of Australia's higher education sector and the vital role it plays in ensuring the future strength of our nation. The graduates of our universities are among the leaders, the innovators, the humanitarians and, importantly, the entrepreneurs and the professionals of tomorrow's Australia. Through their lifetime work, the people our universities educate make a contribution back to the economic, cultural and social development of Australia. At the same time, higher education is a vehicle for individuals to fulfil their own potential and indeed achieve their personal and professional goals.
Whilst speaking to young people at schools in my electorate of Dickson about their goals for the future, the first thing that many of them often tell me is of their desire to go to university, their desire to pursue the course of their choice and their desire to fulfil their personal and career dreams. Many of those students are also excited to tell me about their anticipation of taking up an apprenticeship place. I will speak about that later. We are lucky that we already live in a country where this goal is possible for many people. The bill that I am supporting today continues to deliver on the initiatives already put in place by this government. It is yet another sign that this government is serious about backing and building Australia's higher education sector. This bill and the package of reforms we will introduce shortly are about giving Australians the ability to fulfil their potential in a high-quality, strong university environment. It is about giving them the opportunity to invest in their future. Importantly, it is also about investing in the future of our nation.
I want to speak briefly in relation to the Crossroads review, and I would like to take a few minutes to highlight the changes the government's reform package on higher education will make to this sector. These are reforms which have come about following a thorough review of higher education that was conducted last year. This review was conducted in close consultation with universities, student groups, unions, the business community and other stakeholder groups. The review identified a number of challenges currently facing our universities which, if not addressed, would put the future of our universities at risk—challenges which could lead to an erosion of the outstanding reputation of Australian universities. To assist institutions to meet these challenges, the government has developed an integrated new policy framework based on four foundation principles: sustainability, quality, equity and diversity. Laying the foundation for a 10-year vision, approximately $1½ billion in additional funding will be invested in higher education over the next four years, with more than $660 million in additional funding per year from 2007. Over the next 10 years, the Commonwealth will provide more than $10 million in new support for the sector, including an estimated $6.9 billion in additional funding to the sector and approximately $3.7 billion in financial assistance to students through a system of new student loans. The reforms will establish a partially deregulated system of higher education in which individual universities are better able to capitalise on their particular strengths and determine the value of their course offerings in a competitive environment. New arrangements for student financing will encourage lifelong learning and ensure equity of access to higher education. No eligible student will be required to pay fees up front when they enrol with an eligible higher education institution. Importantly, education will be free at the point of entry. 
What are the benefits of the new system? An important part of the government's policy in this area is the recognition that higher education produces significant public and private benefits. As I mentioned before, higher education provides our nation with a great social benefit and it also gives many personal benefits to those who participate in the system. It is therefore reasonable that there should be a sharing of costs between taxpayers and the individuals who benefit directly. The private benefits of higher education are significant. Recent studies show that the lifetime earnings of someone with a bachelor's degree were around $622,000 more for males and around $412,000 more for females than for those who did not possess a university education. They are more likely to obtain professional or managerial jobs and they experience greater stability in employment. Under the government's reform plans, the total average portion of costs paid by the student is expected to be about 26.8 per cent in 2005 and 27½ per cent in 2008. In other words, taxpayers will continue to contribute around three-quarters of the total cost of higher education, as they currently do.
There are many benefits to students, but the higher education reforms also offer significant benefits to tertiary institutions. For example, under the government's proposed HELP scheme, the significant level of Commonwealth subsidy involved in the HECS scheme—through discounts, write-downs and unpaid debts—will continue. The loans scheme will have a revised repayment threshold of $30,000, which more realistically reflects the point at which people can afford to repay their HECS debt. There will be no HECS fee increases for teaching and nursing students, with 1,400 places set aside for these students and for Indigenous students in eligible private higher education institutions, and 4,000 new scholarships will be awarded from 2004 for rural, regional, low-income and Indigenous students.
A realistic and sustainable number of new university places will be provided: 534 new places in 2004, rising to 5,494 a year in 2008. So, over the longer term, most universities will be better off under the government's new package, with $1½ million being injected into the sector over the next four years alone. The package also includes transitional assistance, with the fund totalling $38.6 million over three years, to ensure that universities are able to access additional financial assistance to help in the transition of new funding arrangements.
Universities will be greatly assisted by the increase in the Commonwealth contribution of 2½ per cent in each of the years 2005, 2006 and 2007, once they have complied with governance protocols and workplace relations policies. From 2005, equity funding will also increase. From 2006, universities will also have the opportunity to access significant funding under several new programs: the learning and teaching performance fund, with $188.2 million over 2006-07; the workplace productivity program, with $55.2 million over 2006-07; and the collaboration and structural reform program, with $20 million over 2005-07. Universities will benefit from the ability to offer an additional 50 per cent of places to full fee paying Australian students who will be assisted by loans. 
We often talk in this place about alternative policies. What is the impact of Labor's policies? We need to contrast the policy of the government with Labor's commitment to higher education because it is a commitment by the Labor Party to mediocrity and, of course, inaction. Labor's policy purports to aim higher, yet it is a policy which will create mediocrity in the tertiary sector and it will not fix any of the serious issues facing higher education today. Labor's policy simply takes some parts of the government's package but cuts out the strong decisions which will make the most significant improvements to the sector.
In largely retaining the status quo, the opposition proposal will cause many of the problems which universities are currently facing to continue. At the same time the opposition's package leaves a gaping black hole in some of its costings. This was revealed in a detailed analysis recently by the Commonwealth Department of Education, Science and Training and verified by the Department of Finance. Labor's policy promises that all maths and science students will be moved from HECS band 2 to HECS band 1. The Commonwealth Department of Education, Science and Training analysis reports that that alone will cost $262½ million. Labor has budgeted just $43.6 million. Labor's policy, which Simon Crean and Jenny Macklin boast is fully costed and fully funded, will require the almost $219 million shortfall to be borne by the institutions themselves.
What does that mean around Australia? In Queensland, currently 11,250 maths and science students in seven institutions cover the shortfall of around $43 million. So the universities that children from my electorate attend, such as the University of Queensland, Griffith University, the Queensland University of Technology and the University of Southern Queensland, will have to come up with an additional $43 million under the Labor plan.
The bill before the House today, as well as the government's proposed higher education reforms, go far and show our commitment to the importance of the higher education sector. This government, in many areas—higher education being just one—is about providing options. Many of the public policy matters that we have spoken about over the course of this term, and indeed since the election of this government in 1996, have been about providing Australians with choice. When we look at the alternative that the Labor Party has to offer, it is very much about providing less choice, putting a greater shackle around the necks of Australian university students and imposing a greater impost on the universities and institutions themselves.
One important factor that needs to be taken from this debate is yet another unfunded Labor policy. It is a theme that I think we will see repeated over the next 12 or 18 months as we run up to the next general election, because, if the Labor Party are famous for nothing else, they are famous for unfunded policies and for running up government debt, resulting in increased interest rates and increased unemployment. There is a debate going on in this country at the moment involving some of our academics in the universities and the general community at large about house affordability. We hear from the member for Werriwa and others opposite how bad it is to see the increase in house prices. It just goes to show how inept the opposition are at dealing with some of these public policy issues—in particular, the economy and higher education.
It is a problem that we need to discuss very broadly. The broader debate needs to be understood, because the Labor Party position—like many of its policies—is unsustainable. Those in the higher education sector who have come out in praise of the government's position and indeed those students who attend universities and are fully educated in the process of this debate would understand that the government's position is a very sound one. It is a very just position; it is one that is fair not just to universities but to students who have attended universities and will continue to attend universities in the future either through traditional means or through paying higher contributions themselves in the same way that we make that access available now to overseas students. 
What I think is important to the people of Australia and certainly to the people in my electorate of Dickson is an understanding that this government is fair in its policy on higher education. The taxpayer in Australia pays around 75 per cent towards a university degree, despite the fact that many of those people will never see the inside of a university. That is a very important part of this discussion that needs to be borne in mind when we are talking about committing billions of dollars to the higher education sector. There are many people in my electorate who will never see a university and who will never benefit from a university degree. I am sure it is the hope and the aim of many of those people that their children will. They understand that this government has made and continues to make a very significant and fundamentally important contribution to higher education. But this government is also very much about fiscal responsibility. It takes those two positions hand in hand in arriving at this policy on higher education. It is for that reason that I commend this bill to the House.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2003-08-12,"—I am pleased to be able to make a contribution to the debate on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2003. I will at a later point address some of the remarks made by the member for Dickson and expose what are quite important conflicts and contradictions in the argument he put. I might summarise them before he leaves the chamber. I will come, at some point, to a discussion of the issue between public and private benefit. On one hand he says that many people in his electorate have aspirations for their children to go to university because they themselves have not been able to; yet on the other he says that, because they are not able to, we can now put forward a proposition that would say to them: if you do not get sufficient points to get into the course that you would like to gain entry to, we will now provide you with the opportunity to buy your way into university and with the capacity to get a loan so that you can repay your debt at some later point.
This flies in the face of evidence which has been brought to light as a result of the failure of the government to disclose evidence from its own department of the decrease in the number of mature age people and school leavers as a result of the increases in HECS after 1996. Further, evidence from the vice-chancellors tells us that they now believe that people in the lower socioeconomic groups are deferring the opportunity to go to university because of the higher HECS fees and the possibility that they will incur a greater debt into the future as a result of those fees. So they are deferring because they see the possibility of higher HECS fees causing an onerous burden upon them and their families. The government is now saying that, even though they may not get access to a HECS course, it can see a positive benefit. It thinks that these people who are deferring going to university because of the HECS fees will somehow or other be besotted with the proposition that they can go and get a loan to pay for the course if they cannot get access to a HECS place. You do not have to be Einstein to work it out: this is a massive disincentive for people to attend a university, particularly for those people who would otherwise be trying to get a HECS place. 
In the communities that I have travelled through across Northern Australia in recent months, and particularly in my own electorate of Lingiari, there is no university—although now there will be a new university formed in the Northern Territory as a result of legislation before the Northern Territory parliament for the establishment of the Charles Darwin University, which will be an amalgamation of the Charles Darwin University and Centralian College in Alice Springs. So we will have an entity called a university operating in my electorate. But the sad fact is that the bulk of the community in my electorate will have no chance of ever going to university, because they lack the most basic of educational needs—that is, access to a school.
I note that this government has, over recent years, poured bucket loads of money into the private education system, but it has failed miserably to see the responsibility it has to all Australian citizens and to address the needs of those most impoverished of Australians who live in the communities I am referring to: Indigenous Australians, many of whom—and I put the figure at somewhere between 3,000 and 5,000 in my own electorate—after the age of 13 have no access to any sort of educational institution. Yet here we have a government which says that somehow or other—I do not know how, but maybe it will tell us—these people can look forward to the benefits of the new nirvana which is being established by this government in relation to higher education and can look forward to the possibility of borrowing money to attend university, when they cannot even attend a school. I doubt they will.
I note that this legislation, simple in its form as it is, will in part increase the grant levels to Australia's higher education providers to reflect changes in salary costs and the CPI. And, as the previous speaker, the member for Dickson, pointed out, it will provide funding for the re-establishment of Mount Stromlo, which I think is a very good idea indeed. I applaud that initiative. We in the Labor Party will be supporting these grants, but I note that the shadow minister, Ms Macklin, the member for Jagajaga, in her contribution to this debate made it very clear that, while the Labor Party support the provisions for indexation in this bill, we call on the government to adopt Labor's policy to put in place a proper process of indexation that would see the universities' operating grants from the Commonwealth keep up with costs. As she said, Labor have announced that we would introduce a new index based on the wage cost education index developed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics that, within a composite index, would measure the real impact of price changes on university funding. This would lead to an increase in funding for our universities of over $312 million between 2004 and 2007, which—as she pointed out—is money that the universities desperately need.
It is sad to see that, as another funding year goes by, the government has not attempted to really address the ongoing crisis in higher education funding, particularly for education providers in regional Australia. On a number of occasions previously in this place—in the last parliament and in the current parliament—I have canvassed the plight of the Northern Territory University, now to be named the Charles Darwin University, as a result of policy decisions made by this government. The government is saying that somehow or another the sandstone universities are what we should be on about. The fact of the matter is that we need a great many additional resources to provide people who live in regional Australia, particularly those people in my own electorate in Northern Australia, with the opportunity to attend an institute of higher education that provides them with the broadest possible course range. 
Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, you come from a regional area and you will understand the pressures that are upon families, particularly working families, to send their children away to institutions of higher learning. In my own community of Alice Springs, even though the Charles Darwin University will have a presence there, at the moment very few of the people who would be eligible to go to university from Alice Springs go to the Northern Territory University, or the Charles Darwin University; they go somewhere else. As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, the cost of sending students away from their homes—not only the emotional cost to the family but the economic cost to the household budget—is enormous. There is nothing in the proposals that have been put forward by the government which will alleviate that pressure—far from it. In fact it is to the contrary—they will increase the pressure on those family budgets and on the costs to those families into the future.
I note that these proposals, as I have said previously in this place, have come from a minister who was able to enjoy the benefits of the reforms of the Whitlam government and who did not have to pay anything for his education. Now he is regaling the Australian community with speeches about the importance of the government, the opposition and the community recognising that we all ought to make a contribution to our own education. I have yet to see this minister—or any other minister or member of the government—come up to the table at this parliament and say, `Here is my cheque for my contribution to the education I got for free as a result of contributions made by the Australian taxpayer.'
—Some of the ministers paid for their degrees. You don't know what you're talking about.
—Despite the interruptions from the minister opposite, the fact of the matter is that we have a minister here who got a medical degree as a result of the contributions made by the Australian taxpayer, and now he is saying—even though I accept that the Labor Party introduced the HECS fees in the first instance—that HECS fees should be elevated because, even though he got a free education, no other Australians should accept that as a possibility; in fact, they should be putting their hands into their own pockets to make a greater contribution than they are currently required to make under the HECS arrangements in Australia. I suggest to the minister, and to any of the other members opposite who received a free education and who did not have to contribute anything through HECS, that they come to this place with a cheque and make their contribution—the contribution they are requiring Australian taxpayers and their communities to make when they attend a university. We will not see it, because that is not the way this government operates.
Then we had the minister proudly saying—as he did here today during question time—that, if you get a year 12 score of 99.2 and you cannot get into the course of your choice, you will now be provided with the capacity to get a loan so you can buy your way into a university course. We know that the full fee costs of some of these courses are extremely high. Let me again repeat the figures that were used by the member for Jagajaga in her contribution to this debate. At the University of Sydney a full law degree costs $85,000. A full fee veterinary science degree costs $144,000 at the University of Queensland. At the University of Melbourne the vice-chancellor let the cat out of the bag by letting us know that he has priced a full medical degree at $150,000.  
What working family in Australia is going to countenance the possibility that they have to go out and borrow $150,000, to be paid off into the never-never, for a medical degree? Never mind the fact that in the longer term they may well be compensated in terms of their pay packet: not all medical practitioners earn $300,000 a year; some earn very meagre incomes. I note from the work that is being done by the vice-chancellors that they are even saying that people are now deferring the possibility of taking out a house mortgage because of the cost imposed upon them by the HECS structure which this government has in place at the moment and proposes to increase. What possibility do these people have of achieving the great Australian dream of owning their own house when they are forced to go and borrow money to pay for their higher education, in the way which is being proposed by this government, because they have not been able to go into a HECS funded course? The lunacy of that ought to be obvious to everyone in the government, as it is certainly obvious to the people in the opposition.
On 28 May this year the minister told the House about the government's proposal to offer students a loan if, as he said at the time, either they cannot access resources or their families do not have them. I believe that at current rates it is likely that these poorer students, the ones who were not raised in such privileged areas as Bradfield or Bennelong, will pay at least six per cent interest on these loans, should they choose to take them out. What we are seeing here is the great possibility, the very high likelihood, that fewer and fewer Australians of working families, those in the lower socioeconomic groups, will be able to access higher education. The previous speaker, the member for Dickson, went on about the personal benefits, the private benefits, that people who have a higher education achieve. I acknowledge that, in terms of income earning capacity, generally speaking—not only and not totally but generally speaking—people who have a higher education have a higher capacity for earning than those people without a higher education degree. But there is also a public benefit as a result of people having got a university education. I refer to the issue that we took to the last election about a knowledge nation, recognising that to be competitive in this world—in the international community, in the global village in which we live—you need to have people who are highly qualified: scientists, industrialists, teachers, doctors and nurses. We need to recognise that there is a broad community benefit to be gained by having people educated. I do not know one family in Australia that does not have aspirations about their children getting a decent education. But what we are seeing here is the door being slammed in the face of thousands and thousands of Australian families by this mean, tight-fisted government in the way in which they are addressing the issue of higher education.
It is true that, under the propositions being put forward by this government at the moment, young Australians graduating from universities will be graduating with a debt as big as many home mortgages. I do not believe that we should in any way countenance the proposition that we should foist upon these Australians the obligation that, when they leave university, they should have a debt as big as the house mortgage that they would hope to have by then if they were going to settle down or purchase a property, because they will be denied that opportunity. Then we had the member for Dickson talking about housing affordability. We know that the cost of housing is increasing and that the cost of housing mortgages is increasing. What we are confronting here is a double whammy, a dual mortgage situation confronting young Australians when they graduate from university. If they actually aspire to getting a university education, they are now being offered the opportunity to get a loan which will be equivalent to a mortgage. Then, if they do graduate and they are earning a graduate income—which may well be a decent income for some but not for many—what the government is saying, when housing prices are increasing, is that, as well as the mortgage that they have taken out for their higher education fees, they can take out another mortgage for their housing. We know that will not happen because the banks will not lend them the money. They will have incurred such a debt that the banks will not say to them, `You've got an asset there on which I am prepared to lend you another $300,000 or $400,000'—given the median house price in Sydney or Melbourne—`even though you already have a debt of $150,000'—or $184,000, depending on the degree course they have. The lunacy of this proposal ought to be plain to everyone. 
What we do know is that, as a result of decisions taken by this government, only three OECD countries invest less in their universities than Australia does under John Howard and now Minister Nelson: Italy, Korea and Japan. We know that $5 billion has been slashed from our universities since 1996 and that the consequences have been devastating. Last year the minister's own department released a study of recent changes in academic workplaces. Fifty-four per cent of the academics surveyed felt that the degree standards had been dumbed down and 45 per cent said the quality of contact with students had declined. The Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee reported last year that student-to-teacher ratios blew out by 22 per cent in the first five years of the Howard government. That is a recipe for mediocrity. If the member for Dickson were here, I would say to him that is a real recipe for mediocrity. At some institutions the increase was as much as 70 per cent. In the last few years the government's fee-for-degrees focus has coincided with claims of pressure to pass fee-paying students in several Australian universities. This crisis is doing enormous damage to the reputation of institutions and the academics that work within them. The government are not content with simply starving universities of funds; they are now trying to impose on them a workplace reform program. They offer institutions $404 million of additional funding over the 2005-2007 funding period but they say that this funding is conditional on universities adopting a number of governance and workplace reforms, including moving staff who are on enterprise agreements onto Australian workplace agreements—pure ideology driving the funding of universities.
—Productivity!
—We already know about productivity. I just gave some figures about the increase in productivity imposed upon these universities by the $5 billion worth of funding cuts made by this government since 1996. In the communities that I live in, people are very concerned about this ham-fisted way of dealing with higher education. We need to make sure that we reject absolutely the proposition that the funding for these universities should be tied in the way in which the government proposes. This is an abuse of process and it should be condemned by the Australian community. I have already stated my concerns about the regional universities, particularly Charles Darwin University. That also extends to the very highly successful Batchelor Institution of Indigenous Education, Australia's only Indigenous tertiary education provider.

"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",NP,2003-08-12,"—I rise today to speak on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2003. In 2003, Australia is at the crossroads of turning one of the most respected tertiary education systems into a world-leading sector that will help to drive our nation through the 21st century. Empowering universities to meet the demand for their services is very much at the heart of the coalition government's commitment to Our Universities: Backing Australia's Future. The vision in detail, which the federal Minister for Education, Science and Training has included in his blueprint for higher education institutions, is an excellent example of how we can mobilise the sector to meet the future needs of our society. The quest for improved qualifications and value in our academic pursuits has to be at the core of any reforms. In essence, we must provide our universities with the opportunity to fulfil their potential. Just as importantly, we must allow our leaders of tomorrow the chance to access the best possible education and justify the significant investment in our tertiary education sector by the Australian taxpayer. 
The legislation before us today is an additional measure which will add to the sustainability and growth of our higher education bodies. In the new and ever-changing economy, education is one of the real economic drivers of our regional communities. You only have to look at the Coffs Harbour campus in my electorate of Cowper to see at first hand how a vision can realise tremendous economic, social and academic outcomes for a town that is a major distance from a major metropolitan centre. Under Our Universities: Backing Australia's Future, the federal government is making commitments to our tertiary institutions which will secure the sector's future. For example, an additional $1.5 billion will be committed to higher education over the next four years. By 2009-10, with the reforms fully in place, an extra $870 million per year will be spent by the Commonwealth on higher education. This represents a real increase of 17 per cent over 10 years.
The government will invest $775 million over the next four years on extra Commonwealth grants for universities. As part of the increased spending on universities, the package will also provide new funding of $123 million over four years towards the cost of education in regional campuses. From 2005, universities will have flexibility in setting fees for Commonwealth supported places. Universities will be able to set their fees lower than, as well as up to a maximum of 30 per cent above, standard HECS rates. The HECS repayment threshold will be lifted from $24,365 to $30,000, allowing students to earn more before having to pay HECS. The government will spend $162 million over the next four years to develop three new scholarship programs to enhance access to and participation in higher education for financially disadvantaged students.
The government is committed to addressing the shortage of teachers and nurses in our schools and hospitals. The budget will invest an additional $161 million over the next four years for teaching, nursing and other priorities. This includes at least 574 places in nursing by 2007. Provision will be made for over 200,000 international students to study in Australia each year, generating over $5 billion in export earnings each year. The government will build on our achievements in this area by providing $113 million over four years for quality assurance and promotion of Australian education and training in overseas markets. The government will also introduce a higher education loans program from 2005 to improve access to higher education. By reforming the system, students will be able to study without the need to pay up-front fees.
Regional universities and campuses will also receive a significant boost from the government's higher education reform package. The Commonwealth recognises the unique contribution made by regional higher education institutions and campuses to their local communities and to the students from rural and regional areas. From 2004, the Commonwealth will provide an additional $123 million over four years to support students at regional campuses of public higher educational institutions. An additional loading will be incorporated into the Commonwealth grants scheme, which will be allocated according to the regionality of a campus as determined by its size and distance from a mainland capital city. The loading for institutions will be distributed within four bands, ranging from 2.5 per cent for larger institutions that are closer to capital cities to a maximum of 30 per cent for institutions located in the Northern Territory. 
Many institutions in regional areas play a key role in the economic and social life of their communities that goes far beyond traditional educational activities. This initiative recognises that universities which provide places at regional campuses face generally higher cost structures than some of their metropolitan counterparts. In my opinion, there is no better example of this scenario than at Coffs Harbour. These higher education reforms will deliver the Coffs Harbour campus of Southern Cross University the highest increase in funding outside the Northern Territory. Once implemented, the Coffs Harbour campus will receive 7.5 per cent funding on top of their recurrent funding. That will place Southern Cross University in a much more competitive position so that it can expand its operations and attract more students to our regional centre.
Southern Cross University, in my opinion, is taking a highly progressive stance when it comes to its curriculum development and integration with other educational tiers. Last Monday, Southern Cross University announced an initial commitment of 20 places for a Bachelor of Nursing program. The challenge to attract more nurses to regional areas is made easier if the nurses can train in regional areas. I know that medical authorities from Coffs Harbour down to Port Macquarie will welcome this announcement. Southern Cross University is heavily involved in formulating an innovative approach to educating young students through secondary, technical and tertiary education in order to establish a solid supply of professionals to meet ongoing demand. That type of pragmatic and responsive approach will allow Southern Cross University to grow its reputation, be more attractive to students and be very focused in securing training for fields which are in demand.

"Byrne, Anthony, MP",ALP,2003-08-12,"—Tonight I rise to speak about carers and the burden they are facing under the Howard government. Australia has 2.3 million carers who provide roughly $20 billion per year in unpaid services. Many of them are amongst the most disadvantaged individuals in our community. I have met with carers and listened to their concerns, and one thing that I hear again and again is that they are tired of battling for the services that they receive. They are tired of battling for recognition for the work that they do. They are tired of fighting for even the most basic assistance that their children need. I cite the example of Cranbourne North resident Amanda Stapleton, who says:
I guess where our disadvantage is—
in terms of their lobbying for improved services— 
is that we are often too committed, too tired or too busy to be heard.
The Howard government's treatment of carers is symptomatic, in my view, of its policy of social Darwinism. The strong and well-connected—for example, the Prime Minister's mate Dick Honan's company—receive $20.9 million in subsidies in a financial year, whilst the most infirm people in my electorate are subject to policies that deny them even a modicum of dignity.
The Howard government's plan to strip the carers allowance from 30,000 families with children with disabilities was exposed in the recent budget estimates. Thus far, 5,000 families have already been stripped of their allowance, and ultimately up to 70,000 could be affected. The fact that the Prime Minister is happy to spend $10,000 for one night in an Italian hotel yet begrudges these families a mere $87 per fortnight indicates where the government's priorities are.
Today Senator Vanstone announced that six disabilities will be added to the list that automatically entitles some families to the child carer allowance. The values of a government which allowed disabilities such as down syndrome and cystic fibrosis to be removed from this list in the first place must be questioned. Workers in the disability sector say that this announcement is window-dressing to deal with the more visible disabilities, whilst the more difficult to understand and hidden disabilities face barriers to recognition and assistance. To me, this is symptomatic of a government which is completely heartless. The Howard government's reconsideration of this review has failed the majority of families receiving the child carer allowance. Families whose children have conditions such as autism, ADD, ADHD, cerebral palsy, severe asthma and diabetes will still have to justify to the government why they deserve the child carer allowance.
It seems that one of the most disadvantaged groups in our community can expect no mercy from a government that insensitively makes more and more demands on carers whilst giving a free ride to its corporate supporters. It is worth keeping in mind that the $20.9 million subsidy provided to the Manildra Group would have paid for 9,166 carers to receive an allowance for a year. Australian carers should be commended and supported rather than having to bear the increased burden, the costs and the discrimination of this government. I have been told by carers of the insult and humiliation they feel when they have to complete a 30-page questionnaire of inappropriate questions about their child's disability.
The Howard government is even refusing to assist the parents of children with special needs who need to place their children in child care during working hours. Through its freeze on the Special Needs Subsidy Scheme, the Howard government has ensured that by the time a two-year-old disabled child on the end of a waiting list finally gets a supported child-care place he or she will be in primary school. The Special Needs Subsidy Scheme allows children with special needs to obtain invaluable socialisation skills and is an essential program for children, particularly in my community. On the one hand the Howard government is refusing to provide even minimal financial assistance to full-time unpaid carers of children with special needs, yet, if these parents need to work, it is also refusing to adequately fund a program which would allow parents to place their children in child-care programs. This is an abomination and constitutes the most brazen display of scorn towards carers since this government decided that their 24-hour care was worth $6 a day.
The contribution of unpaid carers in Australia is enormous. Their selfless contribution saves Australian taxpayers billions. However, the contribution they make to the lives of the people for whom they care, and to the health of our community, cannot be captured by the bottom line. Carers Australia stated in a November 2002 media release: 
Their unpaid work ... represents a huge cost saving to the Australian economy. Yet these carers are often forced into poverty because they are unable to work or to juggle the competing responsibilities of work and caring.
The Howard government obviously does not listen to carers. It does not seem to understand what it means to be a carer. If Senator Vanstone understood what it meant to be a carer, instead of enjoying long lunches and luxurious holidays, she would not be wasting time with this nonsensical review.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Health: Carers</title>,Adjournment,18,1
