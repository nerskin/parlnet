"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-09-26,"—I oppose this move. The list of bills is long. There are some 20 or more bills. The government knows full well that some of those bills are opposed very strenuously by me on behalf of the Greens and, I have no doubt, by other senators. If you look towards the end of that list, Madam President, you will find the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2001. Let me make this clear. This bill is hugely important to my home state of Tasmania. It has, amongst other measures, a compensation clause so that, if any further forests are protected in Tasmania, the people of Australia will have to pay the woodchip companies simply for keeping their chainsaws out of those forests. I am not talking here about tens of dollars or hundreds of dollars or hundreds of thousands of dollars or even millions of dollars. We are looking at tens or hundreds of millions of dollars being given to big woodchip corporations like Gunns—the biggest forest destroyers in the Southern Hemisphere—for doing nothing, for having created nothing, simply for not destroying some of the grandest forests on the face of the planet and their wildlife. 
The government has this bill on a list to be exempt from the cut-off and therefore to be allowed to be immediately considered by the Senate—which has not, by the way, even seen the truncated committee proceedings result in this place as yet. A memo has gone around the traps overnight saying that our friends the Democrats were responsible for holding up this bill. I do not know what other people think about that. I point out that, without my having been in this place to tackle this bill at every juncture, it would have gone through by now. I say that on the basis of a great deal of analysis of how that bill has gone in this place. You will know, Mr Acting Deputy President Murphy, that when the bill came in here last time it was one of the longest debates in parliamentary history. I tackled it clause by cause, participle by participle, and I will do that again. The only way this bill could get through this place would be by the Labor Party applying the guillotine so that the chainsaws may be unleashed in the next two days. I know, Mr Acting Deputy President, that you would not have a bar of that.  
So putting this bill on this list is simply an inflammatory action by a government which wants to have its legislation expedited in the next couple of days. The Greens are going to facilitate any reasonable move to ensure that legislation does go through here—
—You represent a majority of Tasmanians, do you? 
—Senator Calvert has been reading the latest opinion polls, too. The recent poll that was released on the matter of the destruction of forests by the woodchippers in Tasmania shows that 70 per cent of Tasmanians want it stopped. The fact that 70 per cent or more of the members of this Senate want the chainsaws to go in faster has not cowed the people of Tasmania. They have greater sensitivity for their forests and they object to the job shedding woodchip industry, which is marauding those forests and giving a pittance to Tasmania. The Deputy Premier of Tasmania, Mr Lennon, and the Premier, Mr Bacon, with their chainsaw driven policies, have failed to produce jobs in that industry. They totally back Prime Minister Howard in giving the forests of Tasmania to the woodchippers, at the same time as jobs are being shed. The Tasmanian government says, `Great, we have the biggest export per capita income of any state in Australia.' But do you know what, Mr Acting Deputy President? Tasmanians are also the poorest people per capita in Australia. That means we get the biggest amount for exports per head of population but the lowest real income. I will tell you what that means. It means that we are being ripped off. We are being ripped off by an industry which is scalping Tasmania's natural resources and lining its pockets. That is Labor policy. That is Liberal policy.
If the government wants to continue to bring on to the agenda this piece of legislation for the destruction of forests, then I will continue to oppose it. I did not get into this place to sit here lamely and allow pieces of legislation like this to be pushed through in the last days of a parliament. This bill has been sitting on a shelf for three years. I will tell you, Mr Acting Deputy President, why it is here today: because the government, if it has not been in agreement with the Labor Party, has flagged that it wants the Labor Party to guillotine this legislation. There is nothing covert about that. The Minister for Forestry and Conservation, especially appointed by Mr John Howard, Wilson Tuckey, has publicly said, `Come on, Labor Party, guillotine this legislation through the Senate; knock out the Democrats and the Greens in doing so.' I ask the Labor Party: are you going to go along with that? It is very important to what is going to happen here in the next couple of days, I can tell you—and the Leader of the Government in the Senate ought to be listening to what I am saying.
—He has got other problems.
—He might have other problems, Senator Ray, but he has a big one here and he should concentrate on it. He is going to have a very hard time of it. I am not going to go home to Tasmania saying, `Oh well, what could I do?' Some 150,000 log trucks this year alone were to go from the forests to the woodchip mills, only to get a pittance for those woodchips in Japan and Korea with all the on-costs for Tasmania, and the government just puts the legislation on a list and says, `We want to slip that one through in amongst other pieces of legislation,' including the Air Passenger Ticket Levy (Imposition) Bill 2001. The blasting of forests will hit the Tasmanian tourist industry. Tourism is putting on jobs in Tasmania; woodchipping is losing them. Who gets the forests which are central to the health of both those industries? The woodchippers get them. I will tell you why. They have the influence in the halls of power in this place. They have their pens poised over cheques for the fighting funds for the big parties for the election. Mr Acting Deputy President, being a Tasmanian I know you will—
—You are not a Tasmanian. You did not come from Tasmania. You were not born there.
—I know that—
—You stop every damn thing that we try to do in Tasmania, and you know it.  
—Listen to the bleat of Senator Calvert, who wants to put an imposition on the Tasmanian tourist industry. He wants to put $10 on every ticket as a disincentive for people to come to Tasmania. That is what the Liberal senators are doing. Are Labor senators going to support that? Yes, they are. Not only do we have the log trucks carting the health of the tourist industry to the woodchip mills but we have another piece of legislation which the government wants to slip through and deal with without proper debate, because it wants to go to an election, which is going to hit Tasmanian tourism and hit it hard. 
The collapse of Ansett, as you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, has been a disaster for Tasmania. I am very concerned about small business. Some small businesses have been very dependent on package tours from Ansett. The problem is that they give the tourists on those package tours their accommodation and their victualling and Ansett pays them six weeks later. Now they are caught in the position where, for the last six weeks, they have been providing the service and they may not be paid. That is very damaging to small business. That is very damaging to jobs. It should not be Labor policy to do anything but to underwrite those people in Tasmania. 
Instead of that they seek to impose a $10 tax on other people coming to the state—wind it down further. We will get a debate on that one as well. I am not in favour of that escaping the proper forms, the proper debating processes, the proper consideration and the proper input from the public that enables it to be part of this motion. There are many pieces of legislation here. Some of them need looking at. Some of them we can sensibly come to an agreement on have been canvassed or are machinery pieces of legislation that simply help the good working of legislation that is already in place. That is a different matter. But I am not going to be party to a process for ramrodding pieces of legislation through the Senate which injure Tasmania's interests.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,0,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-09-26,"—I speak to this motion which seeks to exempt around, from a quick glance, 22 bills from the cut-off provision, which in effect enables all 22 to be debated over the next two days or possibly Friday if, by some strange circumstance, we end up sitting on Friday as well. It does not mean that all will be debated—in fact, I am sure they will not—but it enables them to be debated. 
I am not going to oppose the motion as a whole, but, as I have outlined a number of times before on behalf of the Democrats, we not only are opposed to the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2001 but also believe that the underlying issues behind the bill need further examination. Through the Selection of Bills Committee, the Democrats attempted to have that bill referred to a committee for proper consideration. It was referred to a committee but clearly not for proper consideration—clearly inadequate examination—and that was a source of not only frustration but also great anger to people who have been trying to get the facts on the greater scrutiny of the operation of forestry agreements. It is consistent for the Democrats to continue to ensure that this bill does not come on for debate before adequate scrutiny is undertaken. The Senate, in my view, would be considering it in an ill-informed way. It would be tying the taxpayers in to potentially hundreds of millions of dollars of future compensation without fully knowing the reality of the industry. I think that would be negligent in the extreme.
On behalf of the Democrats, I certainly oppose exempting the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2001. We do not believe it is necessary to debate that legislation this week; we do not believe it is appropriate to debate that legislation this week. If it does come on for debate, I can assure you that we will not only be sitting here all day Friday but also through the weekend, if necessary, to try to ensure that this legislation is not passed, given the lack of adequate information that has come to light about the detail behind the industry. Given the importance of getting some of the other legislation through, I do not think that would be a terribly constructive approach. There is possibly one other bill on the program, although it is not listed here, that has already been exempted from the cut-off, and that would probably meet a similar fate if it were brought on. I do not think it is in the interests of anybody, including the government, to have the sparse available remaining hours used up in that way.  
This Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2001 is one that does require full examination. It should be done properly through a committee inquiry receiving evidence from people with expertise in this area. Ideally, it should be an independent inquiry that can delve into some of the dubious practices of the industry, but we have not been able to establish that yet. We do not believe this legislation should come on now. I think the best way of dealing with it procedurally would be for me to propose that the motion be amended to omit the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2001 from the cut-off order, if that is able to be proceeded with. I move:
Omit “Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2001”.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,0,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2001-09-26,"—I am normally against the exemption from the cut-off. The cut-off is there in standing orders for a very good reason: so that this chamber, which is a house of review, can exercise its responsibilities. But I understand the difficulties all of us are in at the present moment and the desire held by the government. I think all of us, although some will not admit it, do not want to be sitting here on Friday and miss their aircraft. Much as we like Canberra, we like home better, so I have sympathy with the motion.
Contrary to one comment made by Senator Brown, I do think we should exempt the Air Passenger Ticket Levy (Imposition) Bill 2001 and the Air Passenger Ticket Levy (Collection) Bill 2001 because unless we deal with these pieces of legislation, like it or not, thousands upon thousands of former Ansett employees will not get their entitlements. If we are here for the workers, we have to stand up for them in this matter. I will be supporting the exemption of those pieces of legislation from the cut-off order. However, during the debate I will be advancing my view that there should not be a levy on all tickets and that consideration should be given to whether this should be imposed upon regional Australia—including on travel to and from the state of Tasmania. Of course the bulk of the employees are in Sydney and Melbourne. Without further ado, I support the cut-off motion.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,0,1
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2001-09-26,"—I am not sure of the latest statistics on the cut-off, if this motion is passed. I think we will reach 150 in the session. That is quite a milestone. I heard what Senator Brown had to say about cut-off motions. I think this is the reality: giving these bills a cut-off and seeing them passed is almost irrelevant, depending on the nature of the bill—that is, if they are non-controversial, they will go through, so we will not have to worry about them. There are one or two bills that we would acknowledge no government could have planned for—that is, the ticket levy legislation—and we would like to see that legislation passed. I understand Senator Harradine may be moving amendments to that legislation, so it cannot be regarded as non-controversial. But, frankly, if most of the rest of the legislation is regarded by the Senate as controversial, it is not going to get up this week and we doubt that the parliament will be sitting again prior to a federal election.
This just reinforces the variety of management problems we have had this week. I am pleased to see Senator Ian Campbell back in the chamber, and I know he will accept our condolences for the circumstances that resulted in his absence earlier in the week. My experience in all these things is that you need certainty, and the government is not giving us certainty as to what we are doing over the next two or three days. I know there has been a variety of discussions, but my knowledge of these things is only second-hand. Things were put on the table yesterday, final answers have not been given and now, not only with this motion but with several others, pre-emptive action is going to be taken. Let us come together, agree on what we can agree on and then take the necessary pre-emptive action.
—Yes, I can pretty much second-guess the nature of the discussion, Senator Harradine. Probably one of the reasons I am addressing the chamber at the moment is to facilitate these amiable discussions that are going on, given the fact that we are going to have a guillotine introduced very shortly. As I said, the bills in this cut-off motion fall into three categories—controversial, not accepted in the chamber, and not going to be debated this week no matter what the government's intention is. 
Just so the government's intention is understood, they want to squeeze the Labor Party on the package of migration bills and force us to guillotine them, because they know we have given a guarantee that the bills will be completed this week, although we never said when this week. That, in turn, is intended to provoke the Democrats to guillotine through the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill 2001 in revenge for our dealing with the migration bills: win-win for the government. If they are a bit lucky, they will go for three out of three, with another piece of controversial legislation that Senator Brown and the Democrats do not want up. So win-win-win for the government. Well, I do not think so, I do not think we will be playing that game—not until the government come in here and say what their agenda is for the rest of the week. We do not want any weasel words; no saying that they have to go off to consult with the Prime Minister and that they have not had a response yet so they can then salami-slice us. If that is the intention, if that is the strategy, if that is what they intend to do, we do not intend to play that particular game.
What we want to know is what the end line is. It is not going to be explained to us in response to the points being made on the cut-off motion. We have had to delay the motion for the meeting of the Senate later tonight because we cannot get a resolution of where we are heading, and as soon as this matter is resolved the Leader of the Government in the Senate intends to move that the migration bills be urgent and to guillotine them through by midday. That does not accord with any of the previous negotiations and tentative agreements reached, nor have the government fulfilled their obligation to deliver a response on what they were supposed to respond on. What they are doing is playing games. What they are going to do is salami-slice things through. They are not going to get away with it—not now, not ever. It is time for a bit of honesty. What is your bottom line? Tell us what your bottom line is and we can get on with the business of the Senate. Don't tell us what the bottom line is and we are going to have a very fractured time before we reach the bottom line, which may be taken out of the government's hands and determined by others.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,0,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2001-09-26,"—We have a situation arising which is not unprecedented in the Senate's history. In the last week of a parliament and in the last week of a sitting similar circumstances have arisen. However, in a week when we are obviously sitting for the last time before an election—it is widely rumoured that the government intend to make the necessary arrangements to have CHOGM cancelled and to have an election called on the weekend—we can expect there will be an additional pressure on the legislative program. I see government senators are shaking their heads, presumably to indicate that the government would not act in such a manipulative manner and that they would of course at all times honour what they say. The truth of the matter is that there is ample evidence to suggest that that is not the way in which this government function. On the contrary, given the media reports, there is very strong evidence to suggest that what this government intend to do is to have CHOGM cancelled and to call an election as soon as possible to maximise what they perceive to be their short-term advantage arising from the refugee question and to seek to capitalise on the deterioration in the international situation. 
We all understand that governments get an advantage out of those sets of circumstances. What does that mean for us in this chamber? We have a situation here where at the beginning of the last sitting week before the election the government has declared that they want 47 bills processed through this chamber. Some of those bills are highly controversial and in normal circumstances it would be expected that some time would be spent considering their implications. The Labor Party's caucus position and the decision of the Labor Party, which all us here have committed to implement, are such that the package of migration bills will be carried. There will be debate and a reasonable amount of time made available to discuss those matters, but they will be carried. The government has our commitment on that. 
What we then have is a whole series of other measures that the government seek that we carry. In this debate we have the issue of the application of the cut-off motion to 21 bills. Of those, only three are currently in the chamber. Three have been received by the Senate; the others are still in the House of Representatives. That is a measure of the chaos in the government's management of its own legislative program. No doubt there will be appeals made in the public arena—we have seen them overnight—to suggest that somehow or other this lack of management and appalling chaos in the legislative program is the responsibility of the opposition. That is the way it is run, according to this government's lights: problems are not of their making; they are always someone else's.
We have a situation to which I think we have to respond. If we look at the numbers, we see that there have been something like 335 bills exempted from the cut-off by this opposition during the last two parliaments—that is, during the life of this government. We have another 21 here today that the opposition are also supporting, because we say that the approach to these matters has to be based on the assumption that the government are entitled to have their legislation considered in a reasonable manner, with due regard to the rights of others. So we are not trying to deny the government the right to consider their legislative program; we are in fact trying to assist them to get some management into the program. It is an irony, is it not, that the opposition have to provide advice to the government on the best way to proceed? We do not say that we are necessarily going to support each piece of legislation, but without some assistance this government would be in a helluva state. That is all we are trying to do: provide them with some assistance. But what we do not like is having to sit down, as we did yesterday, and discuss with the government a proposition which would see a managed approach to the consideration of these bills—which the government say are so important—only to find the next day that we still have no answers to the questions that were asked.
Let me take a moment or two to put that in perspective. As of last Wednesday and Thursday, I have, on behalf of the opposition, been seeking from the government a list of priority bills. We have been trying to establish what it is that the government itself wants to achieve out of this last week of the parliament. We have been presented with two lists so far. One came very late in the piece last week, which we were told was not a final list—and we understand how difficult it is for the government to reach its priorities; this has made it transparently obvious that it is not able to determine priorities. This is a government that cannot work out what it wants to do. It wants everything but does not know how to achieve it. So we have a situation where the government basically wants to play off one group within this chamber against another group. That is what the government believes is the best way of working through the problem when it cannot determine its own priorities.
Last night, the opposition once again suggested to the government that there needed to be an approach that incorporated all the different components of this chamber. That is the way in which the Senate works best: with an acknowledgment that there are strongly held differences of opinion here and that the nature of the electoral system is going to mean that it is not possible for the government just to walk in and say, `This is the proposition and you're going to have to accept it.' That is not the way the Senate works. Governments always complain about it. I know that we did when we were in government—and, no doubt, after the next election will come the time when we are in government again and there will be future complaints from us. But the fact remains that anyone who knows anything about how this place works knows that you have to reach accommodations with people.
—And keep your word. 
—The other component that Senator Ray reminds me of—and perhaps he pre-empted me in some ways—and that I have tried to put to this chamber on many occasions now is that it is critically important that, if you say you are going to do something, you do it.
—Thank goodness Senator Campbell is back.
—Senator Campbell, I do appreciate the difficulties that you personally have been experiencing in recent times, and we have all passed on our condolences in that regard. But I am so pleased that you are able to return to get some order into this government, because it is quite apparent that it does not know what it is doing. It is not capable of reaching a decision.
What has been suggested is pretty straightforward. We are saying we are prepared to make sure that the government's program is considered and considered properly, and that there be a definite end to consideration of the migration bills. We are not going to allow these bills to be discussed ad nauseam. People are entitled to put a view and to do it in a timely way. We are more than happy to exercise a balanced approach on that matter. We are also saying, though, that a lousy piece of legislation designed to help out a political organisation that is essentially incapable, as this government is, of running its own affairs—namely, the Liberal Party of Australia—should not receive the largesse of the taxpayer when the party cannot organise itself to sort out the differences between its national office and its state branches.
We have a bill that this government seeks to present which would see a problem, as it is put, sorted out within the Liberal Party—a $15 million problem sorted out within the Liberal Party, to the point whereby this parliament is supposed to intervene to assist the Liberal Party to come to a resolution between its national offices and its state branch offices with regard to the distribution of public funds. We say that that is not our job. If you cannot govern yourselves, you cannot govern the country: that is the old adage. But we are expected to use valuable time in this chamber to give that issue priority over such matters as education, the royal commissions, fuel, the Ansett passenger ticket levy, the intelligence bills and various taxation bills. We are supposed to give those issues lesser consideration so that the government can spend more time sorting out its political problems.
We have before us 21 bills that you are saying we should give exemption to. We will give you the exemption, but we will say this now: when you move the guillotine, we are entitled to know what the response is to the package that was discussed yesterday. We are entitled to know the government's response. These are matters that are with the Prime Minister at the moment. Who is holding up the legislative program here? John Howard. Be clear about that: it is John Howard. The government is incapable of making political decisions, because it wants everything and has totally disregarded the legislative processes to achieve its legislative program. It has to work out what it regards as more important.
Handing $15 million to the national office of the Liberal Party at the moment would appear to be more important than the consideration of all the other issues that are on the program. That is the question the Prime Minister has to work out. He could organise his state branches, his state divisions, to make those arrangements to make sure that the national office of the Liberal Party is funded. That is how we do it; it is not so difficult. It is not appropriate, however, to try to hold the entire Senate legislative program hostage because you cannot organise a couple of letters and cannot talk to one another within the Liberal Party and come to some basic conclusions about the way in which these matters should be considered.
As I said, probably this will take it to 250-odd bills that we have exempted from the cut-off. In the last parliament, we rejected one bill—the electoral bill—although that was finally carried against our wishes. In the 38th Parliament, there were 18 bills that were rejected for exemptions, and in the last parliament there were none. So we have a situation where the government now has to make some hard decisions. We are entitled to know where it stands. We want a definite answer. Is it rejecting the proposition that was negotiated yesterday? Is the Prime Minister saying no to that? If he is, then let us hear it. If he saying yes, then we can get on with this and make sure that there is appropriate time allocated to allow the proper consideration of the legislative program. 
Amendment agreed to.
Original question, as amended, resolved in the affirmative.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,0,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-09-26,"—by leave—The Democrats oppose the following items in schedule 2, as set out on sheet 2395:
(4)	Schedule 2, item [4], page 7 (lines 8 to 20), TO BE OPPOSED.
(6)	Schedule 2, item [5], page 7 (line 21) to page 8 (line 3), TO BE OPPOSED.
(8)	Schedule 2, item [6], page 8 (lines 4 to 16), TO BE OPPOSED.
Given that I anticipate there will be a guillotine applied on these bills at some stage today, I will truncate my comments severely, if very reluctantly, because in truncating my comments, I in no way wish to imply that these are not important issues. But I do want to have the opportunity to, even if fleetingly, get through some of the issues at least to a degree.
Schedule 2 removes third country provisions which require that a person must seek asylum in the country in which they first have the opportunity. In our view, this is dangerous. It means in the way that it reads that, basically, someone cannot seek protection in Australia if at any stage they resided for a continuous period of at least seven days in a country where they could have sought and obtained effective protection. I have a question of the minister in relation to this, which I will ask in a second when he is listening.
Our concern is that this is too blanket. It applies, as I understand it, to a number of different potential visas, and we think that is fairly dangerous because, quite clearly, whilst a person may have passed through a country where they may have been able to seek effective protection, there is no guarantee when they are in Australia seeking to obtain protection that that avenue of protection in the third country is still available to them. It does not take into account that circumstances could have changed. In the Democrats' view, it therefore creates too great a risk that somebody could be removed when they are not able to obtain effective protection elsewhere. 
I wanted to ask the minister a question about this because, as I understand it, these three clauses will prevent people from applying for a refugee subclass 200 visa, a global special humanitarian visa or a visa for the woman at risk class. That therefore applies to anybody seeking those visas from anywhere outside Australia; it is not actually specifically linked solely to someone who is in the exclusion zone. It applies to somebody who is making an application from anywhere outside Australia—so anywhere else in the world in that effect. That is my understanding of it and I just want to clarify that with the minister. In any case, our objections to that remain.
I have circulated some fall back amendments which I will not proceed with, given the time, but they were aimed at providing a little more flexibility in the event that somebody had travelled through a country in which they may have been able to apply for a visa. The alternative proposed is that, in order to be disqualified, the person must have a continuing legal right to enter, reside in or re-enter the third country, and we think that would be a safer approach and leave Australia less at risk—or, more importantly, leave the person less at risk. In any case, the Democrats oppose those items. I would seek clarification from the minister in relation to the question I asked.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (EXCISION FROM MIGRATION ZONE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1

Not knowing when the guillotine will be applied—and we still have 5½ bills to go in the package—some of my questions will relate to things further down the track. Other bills might be guillotined and I might not be able to ask my questions later, so I will get them on the record now.
As we are dealing with applicants applying for refugee status, I want to ask the minister questions vis-a-vis where we are at with the so-called Tampa boat people. Minister, has the government been given any indication that, other than New Zealand, any other countries would be willing to take the so-called Tampa boat people after they have been processed on Nauru?

Which country may or may not take people and what may or may not happen is a question that the government cannot answer, and it really should not because it would be unwise to do so. When you are dealing with other countries, you cannot go out and say who you think might or might not take people. Senator Schacht knows that very well. In the realm of international relations, that is something you have to be sensitive to. This government and previous governments have been of a like mind in relation to how they deal with other countries and the sensitivities which are involved when you are dealing with negotiations on the international level. ",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (EXCISION FROM MIGRATION ZONE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,2001-09-26,"—I appreciate that, Minister, and I have not pressed the point. I am sure that the government at the moment would probably not want to raise any spectre of there not being successful negotiations. But I will not press the point. My next point is this: New Zealand has agreed to take 120; it has publicly announced that it is going to take 120 of the 400-plus so-called Tampa boat people. They would then get residency status in New Zealand. Under our bilateral arrangements with New Zealand, once they have residency in New Zealand, will they have the opportunity to come to Australia within two or three years?",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (EXCISION FROM MIGRATION ZONE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2001-09-26,"—If they become New Zealand residents, just like any other New Zealand resident, it is conceivable that they could make that application.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (EXCISION FROM MIGRATION ZONE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,2001-09-26,"—I just make the point, Minister, that we have so far spent $150 million stopping them coming to Australia. That is the government's plan: to stop them coming to Australia. New Zealand has made a generous offer to 120 and they are going to be, within three years, within Australia, as I understand it, if they want to come. It is a very expensive process just to delay them for a maximum of three years before they, if they wish to, can come to Australia. It just shows you that, in my view and the opposition's view, much of this policy has been decided on the run without thinking through the real implications. At $20 million a week, it is a pretty expensive policy on the run.
I now get to the cost issue. Figures have been speculated on in the press. I have used the figures here and so far in the debate you have not denied the figures I am quoting. For the record, is it a reasonably accurate estimate that in total, for the use of the Australian armed forces patrolling in the Indian Ocean and all the other expenses, this present exercise is now running at a cost of $20 million a week to the Australian taxpayer?",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (EXCISION FROM MIGRATION ZONE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2001-09-26,"—I have not acquiesced in any way in relation to the figures that Senator Schacht has mentioned. Yesterday, Senator McKiernan asked for a financial impact statement on this and that is being assessed at the moment and we will advise that in due course. It is an ongoing cost.
I stress, in relation to the question of New Zealand residency, that it is not automatic that these people would be here in three years. I said it was conceivable. These people would have to pass the usual tests of New Zealand residents wanting to come to Australia. Such things as skills and other matters would be taken into account. I reject very firmly that these people will go to New Zealand, become residents and then automatically come to Australia.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2001-09-26,"—My advice in relation to Senator Schacht's question is that, if these people became New Zealand residents, the situation in relation to them coming to Australia is that there is a process they would have to go through. The advice was that the aspect of skills would be one of a number of considerations.

"McKiernan, Sen Jim",ALP,2001-09-26,"—These are extraordinary circumstances. We are now told that there is a skills test for New Zealand residents entering Australia. If that is the case, the minister ought to outline what the changes in the legislation are to allow that to occur. It is my understanding that there is free movement of people between Australia and New Zealand and New Zealand and Australia. In fact, for a New Zealand citizen who wants to move to Australia and settle in Australia, there is absolutely no test. I would not have expected Senator Ellison, the Minister for Justice and Customs, to know that. But I do expect the senior officers of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to be in a position to advise the minister so that the minister in turn can advise the committee of this very important law, which is not a new law. It has been in place for many years.
We saw an example here last night when Senator Harris got up and spouted about something he did not know about. Senator Harris can be excused because he is a new senator. Senator Ellison can be excused because it is not within his portfolio. But the officers of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs cannot be excused for not knowing about these provisions. We are entitled to a proper answer to the question that has been asked. Otherwise, if it is left, you are in danger of misguiding the Senate.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (EXCISION FROM MIGRATION ZONE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1

 (Senator Murphy)—The question is that schedule 2, items [4], [5] and [6], stand as printed.
Question resolved in the affirmative.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (EXCISION FROM MIGRATION ZONE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-09-26,"—I will not progress with Democrats amendments (5), (7) and (9) on sheet 2395, given the time. It is a similar issue. It is just trying to be helpful in providing another option, but, given the amendments are not going to get up anyway and given the time constraints, I will move on. 
I move to the next section: schedule 2, item [7], clause 447.224, which the Democrats are opposed to. It opposes the quota on particular classes of visa. This is again an interesting component of the legislation that, among many, probably has not been given a lot of attention, in amongst all the other various things. The section, as I read it, relates to the criteria that need to be satisfied at the time of the decision as to whether to give a visa. This is yet another new refugee visa class, the `secondary movement offshore entry (temporary) visa'.
A range of criteria has to be satisfied at the time of the decision for the person to be able to get one of these visas. One of those criteria is that the number of these secondary movement offshore entry (temporary) visas granted in a financial year must not exceed the maximum number of visas as determined by Gazette notices that may be granted in that financial year. Also, the number of particular visas—including refugee humanitarian class XB visas, which I think is one of the ones we were just dealing with—should not exceed the maximum number of visas. As I understand it, it puts a cap on the number of secondary movement offshore entry (temporary) visas that the minister will grant in any particular year. So it would be in the minister's power by gazettal. 
I would like to ascertain, firstly, from the minister whether that number that is gazetted will be disallowable or not. A hypothetical future minister in the next government—it may be that One Nation sweeps into power and Pauline Hanson is the immigration minister—could set the cap at one. Perhaps Senator Harris will be immigration minister, and he is more humane, so he sets the cap at five. Does this provide that power? What is the rationale for that? Is this the first time that we will be putting that sort of cap on people who are in effect onshore arrivals, even though they are offshore because we have excised it from the migration zone? Secondly, what happens to everybody else who makes applications that are eligible in all other ways except for the fact that the cap has already been met, the number has already been filled?",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (EXCISION FROM MIGRATION ZONE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2001-09-26,"—Senator Bartlett raised a couple of questions. To answer the first, it is not a disallowable instrument. In relation to this method of capping, I understand there is a capacity to cap the migration program. I understand that is done by gazettal. I can foreshadow that Senator Bartlett will then want to know if that is disallowable or how that is governed. I am getting instructions on that as well. In relation to the method of capping, that is done elsewhere in the migration program as well, so this does not necessarily stand alone. It is not a unique aspect; capping does exist elsewhere.
 (Senator Murphy)—The question is that schedule 2, item [7], clause 447.224 stand as printed.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-09-26,"—I move Democrat amendment No. 11 on sheet 2395:
(11)	Schedule 2, item 7, page 11 (lines 12 to 16), omit clause 447.311, substitute:
The applicant is a member of the family unit of a person who satisfies, or has satisfied, the criterion in clause 447.211.
This amendment basically removes the requirement that a member of the family unit of a person applying for a visa must be in the same country as that person. As I understand it, it would provide greater scope. The legislation as it stands at the moment would require, under clause 447.311, that the applicant is in the same country as the person as well as being a member of the family unit. The Democrats believe that that is unduly harsh. There is plenty of evidence of people's experiences in seeking protection visas where the families have been separated. This particular component of the legislation will basically increase the prospects of families being separated, through those many families that are separated and are in different countries not being able to be linked in a visa application. We think that is an anti-family measure—from a government that talks about family values—and it strikes at the heart of the extreme torment that many refugees suffer; that is, the ongoing indefinite separation of immediate family, which can be amongst the most difficult aspects for them to endure.

Is there any indication of when we might be getting a response to our questions about the financial impact? The matter was addressed quite early in the committee stage of the debate on the first bill, and I had expected some information on it yesterday evening. Certainly we were expecting that some information would have been worked on overnight and that you might be in a position to inform the committee on the matter.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2001-09-26,"—As Senator McKiernan would appreciate, a number of departments and agencies are involved in this; it is not just the Immigration officials who are here in the chamber today.

Being good bean counters—to say the least—in Finance, they would have an ongoing detailed analysis of what is being spent. I cannot imagine the finance department allowing an open cheque to be spent without their knowing on a daily basis what is being spent.

"McKiernan, Sen Jim",ALP,2001-09-26,"—The question has been on notice overnight. Surely you or your advisers are in a position to give the committee some information. So far, absolutely nothing has come back from you. There are costs to date—and I went through this last night—that you would be in a position to know. People are being held on a naval ship off Nauru—there must be some knowledge in the government as to the cost per day of that. Why won't you give us the information? Why are you hiding this type of information? We are supporting the legislation, but we also have obligations to the taxpayers to indicate to them and find out for them what the cost of all this is. We have seven pieces of legislation and different financial impact statements dealing with each of them. In some of those financial impact statements, it is said that there are going to be savings. For crying out loud, surely the cabinet when it looked at these did some estimates on what the savings would be—not only the expenditures. Why can't we be in a position to fill in some of the holes in regard to these very important pieces of legislation that are being considered by the chamber?
You have us jammed up against a wall because there is going to a guillotine on the bills and we do not want to waste the valuable debating and probing time of the committee. But these are very proper questions to put on notice to ask what the financial costs of all this is to the taxpayers. A bribe is being paid to the government of Nauru. If we were in different times, if we were not at the end of a parliamentary session, you could bet your life that we would be spending a day or maybe more probing the conditions of that bribe. How is the Australian taxpayers' money that is being paid to the government of Nauru going to be spent? Will it be spent properly, or will it be divested to private interests, as previous money has been divested by some individuals within the government? We are not going down that track at this stage; we do not want every single dollar and cent accounted for. But there must be some estimates of what it has cost to date, what it is costing currently and what the projected costs and savings are in the future. Why can't you face up and put something on the record, Minister? ",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (EXCISION FROM MIGRATION ZONE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2001-09-26,"—That question is still being dealt with. I hope to have shortly some information for Senator Brown on that. I will give advice as a follow-up to another question I said I would take on notice. It is to Senator Brown on a matter relating to the conferral of rights to proceed against the Commonwealth. That was section 78 of the Constitution. I said I would give him an example of where the Commonwealth had altered that conferral of rights.
An example of Commonwealth law subsequently restricting that power to bring proceedings against the Commonwealth is the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988, which restricts the ability of Commonwealth employees to bring common law actions against the Commonwealth in respect of injury arising out of their Commonwealth employment. That is an example where the Commonwealth has the power to confer rights to bring proceedings against the Commonwealth, has done so and then has restricted that conferral of rights. That is an example similar to what we were talking about yesterday.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (EXCISION FROM MIGRATION ZONE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-09-26,"—I thank the minister for that. I am not sure about the particular case that he refers to and indeed whether it has been challenged and what the pre-existing law was, because that is quite important. In the current case the legislation removes rights that pre-existed for earlier asylum seekers in the country. The point I was making last night was that section 78 of the Australian Constitution—under the heading `Proceedings against Commonwealth or State'—says that the parliament `may make laws conferring rights to proceed against the Commonwealth'. That is conferring rights on citizens to proceed against the Commonwealth in the courts.
What the Constitution does not say is that the Commonwealth may remove or constrict rights to proceed. It can set the laws, but once there are laws available to citizens I do not see how the Commonwealth can be in the business of cutting across the constitutional right of people to proceed against it in the Commonwealth. It would be interesting to know whether there had been any court action against the example the minister spoke of.
There has been an overnight hunt and they have found one piece of legislation more than a decade ago that might be seen as a parallel. I submit that it is not, and I submit that there are real problems with chapter III of the Constitution in what the government is doing in this legislation today. I think it is a real attempt to erode the Constitution, and it is one of the reasons that the Greens are opposed to it.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (EXCISION FROM MIGRATION ZONE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,2001-09-26,"—On the question of funds, following on from my colleague Senator McKiernan, just let us get this straight. It seems to me that either this government is financially incompetent in managing and monitoring the amount of money being spent—therefore, you cannot tell us what has been spent to, say, yesterday—or you do not want to tell us because you are embarrassed by the amount of money that has been spent. And, as we have discovered, most of those who go to New Zealand  will be in Australia, if they choose to, within three years, despite the expenditure of hundreds of millions of dollars. 
Let me get a little bit more specific to help the bean counters. Is the $30 million to Nauru being paid as a general grant? Is it being paid as a tied grant? Is it being paid as budget supplementary assistance to Nauru? Is it being paid out of the Immigration line? Is it being paid out of AusAID? Are you going to claim and count it as foreign aid, to boost what we spend on overseas aid as a percentage of GDP? If the officers do not know which department has sent the cheque for $30 million and how it is being paid, this is monumentally incompetent.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (EXCISION FROM MIGRATION ZONE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2001-09-26,"—Can I recap on the question of financial impact. Today we are getting a different sort of question from what we got yesterday. Senator McKiernan asked a question, which he is entitled to ask, wondering whether there are any more figures on the finances and costs of the legislation. Then Senator McKiernan said that it would be helpful to the committee if there were `some indication of the cost to the taxpayer of the new regime that is being put in place'. Today we have Senator Schacht saying, `What are the costs up to yesterday of what has taken place?' We have two different questions here. One is the estimated cost of the legislation—that is, a projected assessment as to what this new regime will cost—and then there is the question of what it has cost up until yesterday. So there are two different questions to be addressed, and the third question is about the method of funding to Nauru. I understand that we can have details to you shortly on that latter question.
When I have indicated to the committee that we would get information shortly we have done so, and we are clearing up those queries. There is no problem with that. But, when you have a question as to what this all will cost, that is a very different assessment. It is saying: what will the new regime cost the taxpayer when it comes into force and over what period of time? The other question is more definite: what has it cost up until yesterday? They are the questions we are addressing. In relation to the third question as to the method of funding to Nauru, we will have information shortly. We are pursuing the other more definite question and the other question will take longer because it is about a projected cost that we have to look at.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (EXCISION FROM MIGRATION ZONE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,2001-09-26,"—Some of us have had some experience in government and I cannot imagine, unless there is an absolute shambles in cabinet, any minister fronting up with any legislation or a policy proposal without it going through the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet with the appropriate costings on it. When we were in government, if you put that up they would not even let you get on the discussion paper, even on the agenda. You are trying to tell us now that the officers do not know and they have to go and find it. I would have thought that it was the first thing they would have brought in the briefcase with them to be in the advisers box. Whether it is a matter of what you have spent already or, as in the case of Senator McKiernan's very good question, what is the financial impact of the legislation, that has to be in the cabinet submission. If it changes, you would have to put a supplementary memo in. I cannot understand the shambles that you are operating in or whether there is just incompetence in trying to explain it.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (EXCISION FROM MIGRATION ZONE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"McKiernan, Sen Jim",ALP,2001-09-26,"—The minister selectively quoted from some of the questions that I asked last evening. If he looks through all of the questions that I asked last evening, I started just after 8 o'clock asking him about the financial impact statement and two hours or so later I asked whether there were any answers forthcoming. None were. On one particular occasion, when I followed through with a question, the minister just sat there dumbfounded.
The end result of all of this is that we have not got any information as yet. This is inexcusable. We are dealing here with legislation which has retrospective effect. There is no need for the minister to try to run around corners on this. The bills have got retrospective effect and the money in many cases is already spent, and there must be some indication or some information within the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs—certainly within the Department of Finance and Administration—and overall within the Prime Minister's office or within the cabinet office of what the expenditure has been to date. Not answering the questions or not providing any information at all is creating a scare campaign in the community. We are talking about big dollars of expenditure here, some of which I, as an individual, would be supportive of. We, as an opposition party, are supportive of the legislation. But we are entitled to know what the expenditures are. Indeed, we are entitled to know what the estimates of savings are as well, because that is an important offset. But so far we are not getting anything. That is inexcusable.  
The legislation, as I said, has got retrospective effect. There have been dollars spent so far. We are aware of the bribe to Nauru. We do not know what the conditions are on it and, had we had more time and were not under the threat of a guillotine and pressure from the other five bills that need also to be debated here, we would press the matter even further. We need information on the financial expenditure and on the financial impact statement. Senator Ellison, if you were in our position, you would be pressing this matter as well. It is quite a responsible thing for an opposition party to be pressing on.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (EXCISION FROM MIGRATION ZONE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,2001-09-26,"—I will make it even easier, Minister. You are the Minister for Justice and Customs, I understand, and are in charge of Customs. Customs are involved through Coastwatch. I will ask you simply: starting from the day the government intervened in what we call the Tampa affair, what has been the increased cost to Customs and Coastwatch? In your own department, have your own officers advised you how much you have spent? It is a simple question.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (EXCISION FROM MIGRATION ZONE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2001-09-26,"—As I understand it, in relation to Coastwatch there have not been additional costs for new crew or new resources, because we are still working with the crew we have and the resources which this government has provided to Coastwatch. So, in that respect, we have simply prioritised Coastwatch's efforts on these issues, as we would with anything else. The advice I have is that there is no increased cost in that regard. We have prioritised Coastwatch to task in certain areas. You have asked what the cost has been to date. That is a question in relation to the Coastwatch operation. I am not going to go into detail where we have tasked certain flights for operational reasons.
—I am not asking that.
—But I am saying that we have not purchased additional planes or engaged extra crew and, therefore, there has been no extra cost. It is a question always of prioritising where we have flights, and that is how we do it with Coastwatch. We do that quite normally. We had the interdiction over a tonne of cocaine: we obviously tasked Coastwatch flights down to the Shark Bay area to look at that. Where we have intelligence, we task Coastwatch to look out for where we think there may be incursions. That is the answer that I have in relation to Coastwatch.
I might just add in relation to another question Senator Schacht raised—and I think that this does indicate that we do take these questions on notice seriously and we have been answering them—about Port Jackson that I am advised the whole of the waters of Sydney Harbour are appointed as a port under section 15 of the Customs Act. I am also advised that it is therefore a proclaimed port under the Migration Act—in particular I refer to section 5. This in turn means that the whole of the waters of Sydney Harbour are within the migration zone. The relative instrument under the Customs Act was made on 25 March 1998.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (EXCISION FROM MIGRATION ZONE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,2001-09-26,"—Thank you for that answer. I presume that the definition of Port Jackson is from the line across the entrance between North Head and South Head and all the waters contained within it.
—Contained within the harbour.
—Thank you for that, Minister. I am somewhat astonished that, at this moment when the Prime Minister has announced almost a crisis with the problem of boat people, the number one agency established by the previous government and continued by this government to protect our borders against the penetration of illegal immigrants—Coastwatch, which is part of Customs—has, you have told me, not been provided with one extra cent in this so-called immigration crisis. I am astonished. When the crisis was announced I would have thought, knowing how bureaucracies work, that Coastwatch would have been the first in to see you, saying, `Minister, there is a crisis, the Prime Minister has announced there is a crisis: this is a chance for us to get more money for more planes, even on a leased short-term basis, to fly more patrols and to get more people to crew our own Coastwatch boats so that we can patrol more days per week and more weeks per month.' But you tell us that the only change that took place was a prioritisation of existing resources. 
I agree with you that that is an operational matter. I know that as a former Customs minister. I am not going to get up here and ask where units were shifted from—because that might be useful information for people who want to be involved in illegal activities—but I am astonished that the government did not give one red cent more to Coastwatch, the pre-eminent protector of our borders, in this crisis where the Prime Minister has announced that we are being flooded with illegal immigrants. This just proves to me that it is time we had, as the Leader of the Opposition announced, a properly funded coastguard established in Australia.
You are saying, despite all the rhetoric, that you have not given Coastwatch one cent more. Instead, as I now understand it, you have said, `We are not going to give them one cent more, but we will get the Navy and the Air Force up.' So I ask the question: have the Navy, the Army and the Air Force made any specific requests for increased funding for steaming time, wages and resources for them to be steaming backwards and forwards and around in circles in the Indian Ocean to stop more boats coming in? Can we get that figure? I would be astonished if Defence have not already put a bill in to Finance and Treasury saying, `This is what the cost is.' I presume that is where the leak has come from that this is costing $20 million a week in Defence expenditure.
If you cannot tell us how that $20 million a week breaks down, there is a crisis in how you are managing the finance and cash flow or how you are not managing it—or is there just an open cheque? I cannot imagine a Treasurer or a finance minister ever agreeing to an open cheque, no matter how badly the Prime Minister wants something. So we have cleared up that there is no extra money for Coastwatch. Can you now give us the figures on what Defence are spending? And why did the money go to Defence rather than to Coastwatch?",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (EXCISION FROM MIGRATION ZONE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2001-09-26,"—Of course, Senator Schacht is totally wrong when he says that we have denied the importance of this matter by not giving Coastwatch any extra funding. We have given record funding to Customs since we came to power. This is a government that has given record funding to Customs and Coastwatch—$120 million for the Prime Minister's coastal surveillance task force and $58 million for eight new Customs vessels. The Prime Minister's coastal surveillance task force saw the purchase of new aircraft for Coastwatch. This is record funding which the previous government had never, ever given. We have resourced other law enforcement agencies in a similar way.
What we have done in this instance is enhance the partnership between Coastwatch and Air Force and Navy. We have always had that. The previous government involved Navy in this, and this government has too. We have seen a task force, formed of personnel from Air force and Navy, looking at the north-west of this country, and that has worked in with Coastwatch. We have seen, I think, five vessels deployed around Christmas Island, sea based radar and surveillance with P3 aircraft from the Royal Australian Air Force. It is no secret, and quite appropriate, that Coastwatch has engaged the Navy for Fremantle class patrol boat hours. That was going on before. Even before this matter, we had Navy working with us—and quite rightly so. We have very good cooperation with Navy and Air Force. I witnessed that just recently when I went to Christmas Island. 
So the involvement of Navy and Air Force is nothing new. It has been going on for some time. Yet Senator Schacht says that that in some way justifies a coastguard, which is going to cost about $1 billion—or more like $2 billion in today's terms. In 1984, it was the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, who said that a coastguard would be unnecessary and ineffective on a cost basis. It was rejected then, and in today's terms it would cost billions of dollars if you were have a coastguard. For Senator Schacht to be raising that red herring now is really rather shallow. The issue of cost has been taken on notice, and I stress again that we are working on that.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (EXCISION FROM MIGRATION ZONE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"McKiernan, Sen Jim",ALP,2001-09-26,"—If ever there were a bill that required referral to a committee for scrutiny, it is this bill and this set of bills. I think the exercise that we are going through has now proven, once and for all, that the Senate committee processes are absolutely necessary. We have been jammed up on this, and we understand why we have been jammed up. Had this gone to a committee, the questions we are putting now would have been directed to the officers of the department. Were we to be given the fudging answers that the minister is giving us now, we would have brought the matter back to the chamber and been prepared to press the minister—to push the matter—to get the required information. The absolutely necessary detailed information is just not forthcoming because we have not got the Senate committee processes in place.
We have really made a mistake in regard to that. It is absolutely necessary. I was criticised in the other place yesterday because of the statements I have made about the bill—that I am supporting it now but, later on, I will move to change it. Absolutely I will move to change it—absolutely we will move to change it—when we get the information. Why aren't we getting the information? Why are you hiding, Minister? What are you hiding?
You are going into an election with your surplus being dribbled away as it goes, thousands upon thousands of jobs being lost daily, and you do not give an iota about that. There is a requirement for you as the responsible minister to give the committee some information on the costs of the legislation that is going through the chamber. You are fudging it. I suspect that the information is there. I suspect that you have the information. I suspect that it has been considered in cabinet. We know about the $20 million bribe. That is out in the public. But what about the rest of it—$150 million on this thing, $150 million on that, another $20 million here and another $30 million there? Why is the information not yet available to us?
It was not the opposition's timing to bring these bills in, it was not the opposition's timing to bring about the Tampa crisis, but we have to fulfil our obligations in its place to get information about the various costs. I put it to you, Minister, that the information is at the fingertips of the officers at the advisers desk. Why will you not relate that to the committee? It is not as if you have not had notice on this. From a committee point of view, the notice was given last night. From your own point of view and from the Department of Finance and Administration's point of view, the notice was given in the drafting of the bills, because they require that type of information before they give the okay on it. There must be some estimates at least—if not estimates, then actual costs to date—and I am grateful for the little bit of information you did give to Senator Schacht in regard to Coastwatch.
I put to you, Minister, that you are actually hiding something here. Why are you hiding it? Is it because of fear of an electoral backlash because of the amount of taxpayers' dollars that you are expending on this matter without any accountability? The next parliament, whoever is in government—and I certainly hope it is the Australian Labor Party—will have to revisit this. Even if we are not in government, Minister—
—You will have to.
—you will have to do it. Because the Senate is a house of review we will fulfil this and we will go through the estimates process. This will come out. We might as well start the process on that now with the information that you have got available to you, because there is information. We can almost be certain and sure that there is information. ",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (EXCISION FROM MIGRATION ZONE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-09-26,"—This last half-hour or so highlights the immense frustration of the process we are going through with each new question that comes up. As I said earlier this morning, the Democrats are barely saying anything, despite our immense opposition to these bills, just to make sure that we get some opportunity to scrutinise the various bills. The questioning has been left to the ALP predominantly and to Senator Brown. But with each new question that comes up we see another hole in this legislative arrangement, another piece of subterfuge. It really begs the question about all of the great, proud statements that are made about how the Prime Minister has the majority of Australians on side with his approach—they back his approach. I am sorry, but I just refuse to believe that. If the Australian public were aware of the facts—and they are not even able to be here to be made aware of some of the facts—they would not be supportive of such a farcical approach to dealing with this. Even if they do not have the bleeding heart approach of the Democrats, even if they have a more rigid approach to how arrivals should be processed, there is no way people would knowingly support such a farcical and shabby approach as this.
I agree totally with the comments Senator McKiernan has just made. I acknowledge his saying that we have made a mistake in not referring this to a committee. I have to make the point that it was not the Democrats' choice to bring these bills on now; it was the ALP supporting the government's intent on that. I just say again for the record that that is a shame.
—It was the government's choice. Fair go. They are in charge of the business, not us.
—To take that interjection: it is always in the power of the opposition, even if you are going to say it is the government's legislation, to at least send it to a Senate committee to, if nothing else, ensure that we can do it more efficiently there rather than do it in the less efficient way we are doing it here and not getting the answers.
—You get to sit at the cabinet table more often than we do.
—If only. I do have a question on the aspect of this bill that creates two new temporary visa classes: the secondary movement offshore entry temporary visa and the secondary movement relocation temporary visa. I have already spoken in this debate about the negative aspects of temporary visas and the number of negative consequences that have applied and made the point that when they were first introduced with the support of the Labor Party in 1999 the Labor Party said that this will not work and the government will have to come back and explain why. What they are doing is coming back and saying, `Give us more,' and they are getting it. Again, the opposition are saying that it is not going to work and is going to cause a lot more hardship in the process.
The temporary protection visa has been significantly criticised by a range of human rights organisations, refugee advocates, welfare organisations and legal groups which have expressed that it does contravene some of our international obligations. In my view, apart from anything else, it is causing immense suffering to a lot of temporary protection visa holders who are genuine refugees. They are not permitted to leave the country, cannot sponsor family members to Australia, are denied access to a range of settlement services and assistance in getting work, have curtailed social security payments and are subject to a range of other mechanisms that basically are aimed, quite deliberately, at making their lives as unpleasant as possible—and here we are now extending that.
With the secondary movement offshore entry temporary visa, which applies for 36 months—three years—the visa holder is permitted to travel to enter Australia. Once they are in they cannot leave or, if they do, they lose their visa. At the end of that period they cannot apply for a substantive visa other than another protection visa. Firstly, I want to clarify whether that means that they can only apply for another temporary visa or they will be able to apply for a permanent protection visa at that stage. Secondly, does that also mean that if, say, in that three years they have been here they have married or something like that they will not be able to apply for a spouse visa or any other similar visa or any other family reunion visa even at the end of that three-year period? 
Does the same thing apply with the temporary relocation visa, which is now for 60 months, or five years? Can the minister confirm that that temporary visa is retained for five years? Do the same restrictions apply in terms of access to government services and the like that apply to other temporary protection visa holders currently? Is it the case similarly with that that at the end of the five years they cannot apply for any visa other than another protection visa? Is that subsequent protection visa also only a temporary one?

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2001-09-26,"—There were, I think, in excess of eight questions on that point from Senator Bartlett. We will take those questions on notice and endeavour to have those answers to Senator Bartlett shortly. In the meanwhile I seek to table information on the Business Skills Migration Program that touches on a question asked by Senator Brown. It contains other information in relation to the Business Skills Migration Program and deals with the amount of assets that are involved. I seek leave to table that information.

—Have a look at it first and see what you think. 
—No, minister. I have asked in the committee for the information to come from you so that it goes into Hansard. The tabling process means that does not happen. What I wanted, rather than me now photocopying that and distributing it to members of the Senate, was a simple exposition from you, if you would not mind—through you, Madam Temporary Chair—on what the wealth provisions are for people coming into Australia. ",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (EXCISION FROM MIGRATION ZONE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2001-09-26,"—We are attending to the distribution of that now. I will consider that second request of Senator Brown's. In the meantime we are pursuing those other questions of Senator Bartlett's, which were both numerous and complex, and we will endeavour to have some information shortly. ",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (EXCISION FROM MIGRATION ZONE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-09-26,"—I am not going to be fobbed off like that. I asked last night for this information. We know that the government is about to move the guillotine on this legislation and slam debate shut in here. I will deal with that when it comes. But the minister and his minions have had all night and this morning to answer a simple question, which is: what are the wealth provisions that allow people to queue jump into Australia? This is legally queue jumping, sure, but the minister knows the point I am getting at is that if you have enough money in your pocket and you want to come to Australia you can buy your way in under the existing law. I want to know from the minister how much money you need in your pocket. What are the conditions? He indicated last night that it was complicated. It may be complicated for him. He now wants to put a couple of pages onto the table, which avoids a record going into the Hansard and avoids him giving the simple sort of exposition that the people of Australia should get on this. This is a debating chamber. 
—Tabling in the Senate is an appropriate course of action. 
—It is not. You have not tabled the answers to any of the other questions that have been asked here and I am not going to let you get away with it on this one, particularly as the guillotine is coming. I am taking from this that the minister simply does not know; he cannot get his head around it. But if he can, then I challenge him to tell the chamber what the provisions are that allow people to buy their way into the country, to get to the front of the queue, to avoid getting into sinking ships and to get on a jetliner, travel first-class, land here and get into the country because they have wallets that are big enough to do it. That is the question I have been asking the minister. Tabling a document in response to an important question like that is totally unacceptable.

DEPARTMENT OF IMMIGRATION AND MULTI-CULTURAL AFFAIRS
24. BUSINESS SKILLS MIGRATION
The Business Skills visa class of Australia's Migration Program encourages successful business people to settle permanently in Australia and develop businesses.
What benefits to Business Skill migrants bring to Australia?
These migrants bring with them knowledge of overseas markets, business networks, cultural practices and languages other than English, as well as their specific business skills and experience.
·	It is intended that they will benefit Australia by:
·	developing international markets;
·	transferring capital and making investments;
·	creating or maintaining employment;
·	exporting Australian goods and services;
·	introducing new or improved technology;
·	substituting Australian-made products for goods that would otherwise be imported; and
·	adding to commercial activity and competitiveness within sectors of the Australian economy.
What are the results so far?
Aggregate data from survey of Business Skills class migrants shows that (for arrivals after 1 July 1995):
·	83 per cent are engaged in a business;
·	each new business employed an average of 4.7 staff;
·	64 per cent of businesses had export earnings. 4 per cent of businesses had export earnings worth over $1 million;
·	13 per cent of those in business had an annual turnover of AU$1 million or more;
·	on average cumulative funds transferred to Australia by principal migrants were $843 000; and
·	average financial investment in the business was $325 000.
Where do business migrants come from, and where do they settle in Australia?
In 1999-00, the top ten source countries were: Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, South Africa, Hong Kong, Singapore, Germany, the United Kingdom, Kenya and South Korea.
·	33 per cent had settled in NSW, 15 per cent in QLD, 27 per cent in WA, 17 per cent in Victoria; with the other states and territories gaining less than 1 per cent each.
What is the demand for the program?
Demand for business migration has increased in recent times. In 199-00, 6,260 business migration visas were granted to business people and their families. This compares with over 6080 visas issued in 1998-99 and 5,300 visas issued in 1997-98.
What sort of business people can be granted a Business Skills visa?
Business owners, senior executives and investors are eligible to apply for a Business Skills visa. Business people may make an application for most Business Skills visas overseas or in Australia.
Business owners are required to demonstrate that they have had a successful business career overall and that for two of the four fiscal years preceding their application they have:
·	had net assets in business of not less than AU$200 000;
·	been involved in and responsible for the overall management of a business in which they have at least ten per cent ownership;
As well as meeting these requirements, business owners must pass a points test which assesses factors such as turnover, annual labour costs, total business assets, age, language ability and net personal assets.
Senior executives must demonstrate that they have had a successful business career and:
·	for two of the four years preceding their application they have been employed in the top three levels of management of a business which has an annual turnover of not less than AU$50 million;  
·	pass a points test which assesses factors such as age, English language ability and net personal assets.
Investment-linked applicants must demonstrate a history of successful ownership and management in business and/or investment activities. In addition, applicants must:
·	make an investment into a State or Territory government security of between AU$750 000 and AU$2 million, for a period of three years;
·	demonstrate that they have assets worth at least 50 per cent more than their proposed investment; and
·	pass a points test which assesses age and English language ability.
Established Business in Australia applicants can only apply for this visa while in Australia, and while holding a  temporary visa other than a Bridging visa or a Criminal Justice visa.  They must demonstrate that they:
·	have managed a business in Australia in which they have at least ten per cent ownership, for 18 months prior to application; 
·	have had assets in Australia worth $250 000, of which $100 000 must be invested in the business, for 12 months prior to application;
·	have been resident in Australia for a total of nine months during the 12 months prior to the application;
·	pass a points test which assesses turnover or exports, number of employees, net assets, age and English language ability.
Regional Established Business in Australia applicants can only apply for this visa while in Australia, and while holding a temporary business entry (long stay) visa. (subclass 47). They must demonstrate that they:
·	have managed a business in a designated area of Australia, in which they have at least ten per cent ownership, for two years prior to application. (Designated areas are: all of Victoria, SA, NT, Tasmania and the ACT and anywhere in QLD except Brisbane and the Sunshine and Gold Coast, WA except Perth and NSW except Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong;
·	have achieved an annual turnover of at least $200 000 or exports of at least $100 000 in that business for each of the two years prior to application;
·	have had assets in Australia worth $200 000, of which $75 000 must be invested in the business, for two years prior to application;
·	have been resident in Australia for a total of one year during the two years prior to the application;
·	pass a points test which takes account of age, English language ability, number of employees and net assets.
State/Territory sponsorship
There are also options for State/Territory governments to sponsor a migrant who is a business owner, a senior executive or a regional established business owner. The requirements for applicants sponsored under these arrangements are lower than those for other applicants. 
What must the business migrants do after they arrive in Australia.
The expectation is that they will:
·	establish a new business; or
·	become an owner or part-owner of an existing business in Australia with a significant level of ownership; and
·	actively participate in the management of the business; or,
·	having established a successful business as a temporary resident, remain in Australia permanently to continue that business.
The progress of business migrants is monitored after their arrival in Australia. Where no significant steps have been taken towards engaging in business within the first three years of arrival, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs has the power to cancel the right to Australian residence of the business person and his/her family. Some 76 visas were cancelled during 1998-99.
Information on Australian immigration matters is available through the Internet on:
http://www.immi.gov.au 
The Department also operates a national telephone inquiry line on 131 881, for the cost of a local call anywhere in Australia.
Fact Sheet 24. Produced by the Public Affairs Section, Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. Revised on 25 August 2000.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (EXCISION FROM MIGRATION ZONE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-09-26,"—The same question arises. We are here to debate this issue. Let the minister get up and not only tell members of this chamber, but listeners and people in the gallery, what the conditions are that enable people to buy their way into the country. He has ducked it twice. The information is there if people want to go scrambling for it, but it is still not here for the immediate debate in this chamber. This process is not acceptable.  
I see the hawks are gathering. I see the tumbrels are rolling. I see the guillotine approaching. I see the minister ducking at the same time. What a travesty this is. What a travesty that this government should be moving to gag this debate as the minister ducks answering a question like that. What a travesty it is that we have such important matters still to deal with in this chamber and the government wants to guillotine the legislation. I should explain, Madam Temporary Chair, in case you are not aware of it, that to your right there is a group of ministers standing in the chamber, including the Leader of the Government, Senator Hill, and the Manager of Government Business, Senator Campbell, with the yellow documents in front of them which give them the words that enable them to guillotine the legislation so that we end this debate and so that they can get on to other legislation which is far less significant in terms of the good running of this country. One of the things that we are not going to get to debate if that process goes ahead is mandatory sentencing. The government wants to truncate this debate so that we do not get to look at the matter. 
—Order! There are a million discussions going on in here. There is a discussion going on between the speaker and the chair. Senator Carr and Senator Hill, I would appreciate it if your discussion were not held in between the speaker and the chair. 
—I object too, Madam Temporary Chair. I want that discussion to end because I know what is happening here—
—Senator Brown, We cannot ask senators to stop discussing things but we can ask for some order. 
—Nor would I want to, but it is disorderly to discuss things between you and me and across the table.
—I have made that point, Senator Brown.
—You have quite rightly made that point, and finally it has ended. What they were discussing, by the way, chair, for your enlightenment—and the discussion is now going to take place outside the chamber—is the Labor complicity in moving the guillotine on this debate. Can you believe it? I have not seen it before in the five-plus years I have been in this chamber. I have never seen the Labor Party getting together with the government to gag debate on an issue as important as this, particularly when at least two of these bills have been opposed for the last three years by the Labor Party. I will tell you why they were opposed. It was because they deprive people of their right to go to courts in Australia and of their right to take class actions to get justice in Australia. 
They are two principles that the Labor Party ought to be upholding. What are they doing here? They are moving to ensure that the government gets seven bills through, including those two, in the course of this morning. What am I trying to do? Trying to explain this process before that guillotine drops. I have just 10 minutes in which to do that. 
I want to go back to mandatory sentencing. Over the last five years, the Democrats and the Greens, together with the Labor Party, have been opposing mandatory sentencing. People will remember mandatory sentencing in the Northern Territory, which ensnared people in pretty desperate circumstances, quite unjustly, and took away the right of the courts to determine, if they were guilty, what the appropriate punishment was. The Labor Party, the Greens and the Democrats got through the Senate the Greens' legislation overriding the mandatory laws of the Northern Territory. In the House of Representatives, where Labor took up that legislation, with a very feisty and positive performance from Mr Andren, the member for Calare, the Howard government was forced to act by sheer public outcry and concern by members of its own backbench. 
As a result of that, mandatory sentencing, at least for children, was effectively removed in the Northern Territory. Interpreters were brought into the courts for the first time, so indigenous people could understand what was going on, and diversionary programs that were appropriate and educative were made available rather than jail, which was effectively a university for further crime. Now we have a Northern Territory election which has changed the government up there and is leading to the abolition of mandatory sentencing altogether. It is a Labor government doing that in the Northern Territory. But not in this chamber, not in this parliament. We now have mandatory sentencing being brought into federal legislation for the first time in this nation's history. What a black spot that is. People who are involved in helping desperate others to get into this country face five- or eight-year mandatory jail sentences.  
And what about those who get caught up unintentionally by this rushed legislation? It happened in the Northern Territory; it will happen under this legislation. The minister says that we will not have the situation where people who give harbour to a group of refugees in Australia are caught up under mandatory sentencing. My legal advice is that that is not the case. For example, people harboured East Timorese refugees when the Indonesian military was in charge of their country. We had illegal East Timorese refugees flee to Australia. There were 1,500 of them, if I remember correctly. People who were harbouring them or making it known that they would give harbour to others who came from East Timor could be ensnared by this legislation. They could go to jail for five years or eight years. The court cannot intervene. And Labor is supporting it, can you imagine?
What is more, the next amendment for the Greens will be cut short in a moment by the Hon. Senator Hill, who is now in the chamber on the telephone, getting last-minute instructions from the Prime Minister. The Greens amendment, which says, `Let's not have retrospectivity in this law,' will also be cut down. What is that retrospectivity there for? It is there to enable any breach of the law by Mr Ruddock or any Commonwealth officer on the Tampa in the gross mishandling of an incident where a ship's captain went to the aid of refugees and was then ensnared by domestic politics in Australia. That was a disgraceful episode which has done enormous damage to Australia around the world. 
The government here is legislating to say, `If we committed illegal acts there, we are going to get off. If Mr Ruddock gave orders which were against the law of this country, we will get round that by retrospectively saying, `It's okay for him.' Tell that to the Australian public. Ask them how they would like legislators who simply put through pieces of legislation to say, `I broke the law, or I may have broken the law—I'm not even sure about it—but I'm going to put through a bill to make sure I don't have to go to court over it and I can't be challenged in the court.' That is what Mr Ruddock is doing in this piece of legislation. And guess what? Labor is supporting it. Can you believe that?
—That's the new spirit of cooperation.
—Senator Lightfoot opposite says it is the new spirit of cooperation between the government, the Labor Party and One Nation, who have led the charge—and I give due acknowledgment of it—in terms of the policy direction which is encapsulated in these seven bills. It is One Nation territory. It was One Nation first; the Howard government followed; the Beazley opposition is now with them. This unholy triumvirate is cutting down the rights of not only asylum seekers to this country but also Australian citizens who continue to have the decency to want to uphold international law and want to be humanitarian towards people who are fleeing desperate circumstances. So it is left on the other side for the Greens, the Democrats and Senator Harradine to be taking a stand against that.
If ever there was an argument for the Senate to act as a house of review, this is it. If ever there was an argument for there to be more than the old parties in the Senate, this is it. Whatever happens at the next election, I hope people remember this hour and can see value in making sure there are more non-big-party people in this chamber after that election so that there can be a bigger opposition when it comes to hugely important legislation such as this. 
Just a while ago, Senator Schacht was asking for information about how much taxpayers' money has been wasted on the Tampa fiasco. It is somewhere between $100 and $200 million—enough to have put them all on the QEII and sent them to Canada. We would still have had change out of it. But this government got itself into that enormous expenditure of taxpayers' money, doing the wrong thing, because it was pressing an election button. It now intends to have an election somewhere in the middle of November through that misdirection of both policy and taxpayers' money. This nation is going to be the one that picks up the long-term tab for that. 
If there is one thing that makes me feel good about being a Green, it is being here to be able to fight for the principles which have been abandoned by the government and Labor in this set of legislation. By crikey, I feel that there needs to be a voice for humanitarian principle and for a fair go in this chamber when the big parties get together as they have done on this occasion. It is not only that we are going to see the debate guillotined, it is the principle that is involved in this nasty legislation that we have got to fight. The government is going to say that it has to expedite this legislation. But you know, Chair, and it is abundantly clear to everybody watching the debate, that there has been no filibuster on this debate; nobody could say there has. 
The majority of time in the debate has been taken up very properly by the opposition asking questions of the government and Senator Bartlett taking a very formidable role in putting the alternative point of view, with me. But there has been no filibuster. This has been a very proper debate, particularly in the absence of a Senate committee allowing the public and the community groups and the interest groups right round this country to feed their point of view into this important Senate debate. There is no filibuster involved in this guillotine that is coming up. This is pure expedience and cutting across proper functioning of this parliament by the government, backed by the opposition. It is the lowest form of abuse of the standing orders.
 (Senator Knowles)—Senator Carr, could you sit down please? 
—To kneel before the government!
— Senator Brown, do you wish to continue your remarks?
—Not while there is a conversation taking place between you and me. It has finished so now I will continue. The guillotine is being used here, in the lowest form of abuse of parliament. It is being used to cut off a debate which is decent, which is warranted, which is essential to the proper functioning of this parliament. What a disgusting hour in Senate history we are enduring at the moment.
Motion (by Senator Ian Campbell) proposed:
That progress be reported.
—I think it would be very good of the manager of government business to give a reason for reporting progress at this time.
— Senator Brown, I am sure you know that this a procedural motion.
—Yes, it is a procedural motion. I am just trying to inject some decency into it.
— Senator Brown, I ask you to resume your seat.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
 (Senator George Campbell)—Order! The Temporary Chairman of the committee, Senator Knowles, reports that the committee has considered the Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) Bill 2001 and related bills, has made progress and seeks leave to sit again.
Motion (by Senator Ian Campbell) proposed:
That the committee have leave to sit again at a later hour.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (EXCISION FROM MIGRATION ZONE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-09-26,"—I oppose the motion. I do not believe that we should be sitting at a later hour of the day like this unless the government has come up with a reason for doing so. I have not heard that reason. If we are going to sit at a later hour of the day, what are we going to move on to discuss now? This is a change of the schedule that we have before us. That is not on the red anywhere that I can see. I would like to have an explanation from the government as to what we are going to do between now and sitting at a later hour of the day, and indeed as to what the later hour of the day is going to be. I suspect that the government has just fluffed its approach to the guillotine but I do not know that. If we are going to sit at a later hour of the day, is that so that there can be further discussions undertaken between the government and the opposition as to how they are going to apply the guillotine? We were having a very constructive debate in the committee. The minister was having some difficulties in answering questions but nevertheless that debate was taking place. 
There are a number of important amendments to be dealt with right now, which come from the Democrats and me. One of those amendments is to overrule the provisions in the border protection bill which would allow retrospectivity to the law so that the minister, Mr Ruddock, or the Prime Minister or anybody involved in government would escape the law if there were challenges to what they have done over the last couple of months. The implication in the legislation is that the government is aware that it may well have broken the law. What is the legal advice? What is it that the government has been advised is against the law in its handling of the Tampa affair? Was it sending the SAS troops onto that ship, poorly instructed and without proper government backup that enabled a challenge to take place in the Federal Court and now an appeal to the High Court being mooted or are there other matters that the government is wanting to avoid having to face in the courts further down the line? Indeed, what is the legality of the current handling of the people aboard the Manoora? 
Just in the last day, the government has indicated that it may well be using force to remove people who have been taken aboard the Manoora from that ship. When that happens, we will get another bout of international criticism and condemnation. No doubt the government has been caught on the wrong foot as far as the Manoora is concerned. It should never have taken the action of sending that ship to Nauru. It should have brought the original asylum seekers ashore at Christmas Island. That way we would have found that the processing would be well under way, $100 million would have been saved of taxpayers' money, and those people aboard the ship who may be cheats would be well on their way to being sent home. The process has taken much longer and will be much more intractable now that the ship has been diverted to Nauru and its passengers on to New Zealand. The government has made a mess of it, but it has compounded that with this iniquitous legislation it has brought into the Senate today. I oppose this motion. Unless the government can give good reason as to what the Senate will debate and why this package of legislation should be interrupted to do that. It would have been a courtesy to the chamber for Senator Hill to have informed us about that when he moved the motion.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (EXCISION FROM MIGRATION ZONE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2001-09-26,"—The Senate would well be aware that there are a considerable number of important packages of legislation on the Senate Notice Paper and that the Senate is anxious to have their passage. Some of the packages of legislation are extremely urgent. Apart from the seven migration bills, there is important legislation to deal with the funding of primary and secondary schools, the royal commissions legislation to facilitate the two royal commissions that are being set up, the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill 2001, which the government regards as a bill of high priority, the air passenger ticket levy bill, which will enable the funding of government support for entitlements of Ansett workers, and the fuel legislation bill which deals with alternative energy and will enable the existing scheme to exist for a further year. There is a critically important package of legislation to do with our intelligence services and, for Senator Brown's interest, includes parliamentary scrutiny. There are important tax bills—the New Business Tax System (Thin Capitalisation) Bill 2001 and the New Business Tax System (Debt and Equity) Bill 2001 which, I understand, involves about $400 million. There is the Motor Vehicle Standards Amendment Bill 2001 dealing with the importation of motor vehicles, the regional forest amendment bill that Senator Brown refers to from time to time, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) 2001 and the Jurisdiction of the Federal Magistrates Service Legislation Amendment Bill 2001 which will allow federal magistrates to deal with migration matters. I could go on but they are just a few of those bills. The point I am seeking to make, for Senator Brown's interest, is that there is a large legislative workload before the Senate and the government, while not wishing to unduly rush any part of it, is nevertheless anxious that each part be debated.  
The seven migration bills are very important bills. I do not disagree with that. They put into place the government's response to illegal entry. The government have taken what we believe is a firm but fair position on illegal entries and want legislative support in the form of these seven bills. The debate has now been around for some considerable time. During our last sitting, we debated a couple of bills which were in similar terms to these, including the border protection bill. Since returning for this week of sittings, the Senate has debated these bills since Monday. We sat the Senate until midnight on Monday night, we sat the Senate until midnight on Tuesday night, and we have been sitting the Senate this morning on the migration package. It is the view of the government that there has been adequate time to scrutinise the detail of this bill, as well as allowing a time for a second reading contribution from every senator, other than on the government side, who wished to participate in that debate. We heard the philosophical position on these issues from many senators around the chamber. 
In the view of the government, time is running out. We believe it is important that we proceed with a vote on these bills. The purpose of seeking to sit again, if subsequent motions are passed, will be to request that the Senate vote on these bills. We will vote on each amendment to the bill—we are not trying to cut that short—starting at midday today. That is what the government is about. There is no surprise. I am surprised to hear Senator Brown say that he is surprised because we have been talking about this since yesterday. Senator Brown had a representative present at a meeting yesterday. I confirmed to the Australian Democrats again last night that we would need these bills to be voted on by midday today. It is apparent to the government that without this restraining influence there will be no end to this debate. Therefore, we do not see that we have any alternative but to move this series of motions and seek a vote on the bills before the Senate.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (EXCISION FROM MIGRATION ZONE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2001-09-26,"—In speaking to the question before the chair I wish to make a few points about the procedural issues that the Senate is currently considering. I think it is well known to senators that there are some elements of the government's legislative program that certainly do not warrant urgent debate or that—in the case of the Commonwealth Electoral Bill—do not warrant debate at all, given that the need for that particular legislation could be obviated by a simple letter— 
—A 45c stamp.
—Forty-five cents, as Senator Ray says—from the Federal Director of the Liberal Party to the Australian Electoral Commission.
—I am going to give them a stamp and an envelope, privately bought.
—I have always said you are very generous, Senator Ray. Senators would be aware—this chamber has debated the urgency of that bill—that the view of the opposition is that that should not be dealt with prior to the conclusion of this sitting period. I think it is also important to place on record, given the nature of the contributions that have been made, that it is the view of the Australian Democrats, and Senator Brown on behalf of the Greens, that the Regional Forest Agreements Bill should not be dealt with in this sitting period either. This is the thing that occurs sometimes in the Senate: there are different political imperatives from government, opposition, minor party and independent senators. For the good functioning of the place we all have to take account of those different views and priorities. Sometimes the Senate has to consider trying to limit debate, which in this place, on any piece of legislation or package of legislation, can blow out to an inordinate degree. 
In relation to the bills that Senator Hill has asked us to declare urgent—that is, the migration package—the opposition had a different view to the government. It is true to say that at a discussion amongst the parties that was convened on the initiative of the opposition—I asked Senator Hill whether he would consider doing so and he did have a leaders and whips meeting, which I think was the right advice, and Senator Hill took the right action in convening that meeting—it was made clear that the government wanted to declare these bills urgent, with voting to commence last night. I think, to be accurate, Senator Hill, that the time was 11 p.m. last night. I note that Senator Hill nods in acknowledgment.
The view of the opposition is that it is a very important package. You have to get a balance between not having all the Senate's time taken up on debating that package and, equally, ensuring that the amount of time for debate is adequate on such a significant package of bills. It was our view that it was appropriate that the sittings of the Senate on Monday night be extended to midnight and that the sittings of the Senate last night be extended to midnight to debate this package. It was our view—and I expressed it to government and the minor parties at the meeting that Senator Hill convened on our initiative—that we felt that perhaps it would be reasonable to see this debate conclude and for voting on amendments to commence after the taking note of answers to questions in question time today.
That was the view of the opposition. In other words, we felt that 2½ days debate with extended sittings in the Senate was a reasonable amount of time to debate and consider a complex and important package of legislation. You have to make these decisions; at the end of the day you have to try and find an appropriate balance. That was the one that the opposition found and I think it was appropriate. I did indicate, on behalf of the opposition, that if agreement could be reached about the balance of the program, our view would be that within those time constraints it would be reasonable to move a guillotine motion.
I know that is not going to find favour with the Australian Democrats; it is not going to find favour with Senator Brown. I appreciate that they have different views to the opposition on that particular issue, but I would like those senators to acknowledge that the opposition is extending a courtesy in relation to the guillotine motion that was not extended to it on a previous occasion. We made it very clear around the table that we would not tolerate, or even contemplate, a gag on the guillotine motion. On the issue that Senator Hill raised, I made this point very clear at the meeting that was convened in relation to all amendments before the chair being put. The standing orders of the Senate were changed in 1999 allowing for that to occur—again because of the difficult experiences the opposition faced when a guillotine was proposed and gagged and questions before the chair were not even put.
The committee did not have an opportunity to express a view on matters that had been properly moved and which warranted at the very least a view of the committee being expressed. That is a very important principle. There are very different views in the chamber about political priorities and unless you try and come to agreements outside the chamber in a sensible atmosphere whereby people can express those views and come to a balanced conclusion, you do not get very far in this business.
I repeat that the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill 2001 is one that the Labor Party says should not be dealt with in this sitting. We are very clear on that and have been consistent on that now for a long time. I appreciate that the Australian Democrats and the Australian Greens have a view about the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2001. It may not be shared by government and opposition. But if debate commences on a bill like that it can be never ending; it can swallow up the whole program, because it is not too hard to filibuster in this place, as everyone knows. That is why it is important to come to agreements on these sorts of issues. 
I indicate on behalf of the opposition that even though the proposed guillotine is for voting to commence on these questions before the Senate at an earlier stage than the opposition suggested—we suggested after question time today, not before—it is within the broad parameters, I suppose, of what we suggested. On that basis, I indicate to the Senate that, given the opposition has been successful in convincing the government to extend the time for the Leader of the Government in the Senate to declare urgency on these bills, the opposition will vote for that proposition when it is put a little later, after this particular matter before the chair is dealt with. That is our position. We will vote for the proposition that the bills as outlined by Senator Hill be declared urgent.
But I also want to say this: I have suggested to Senator Hill in a private conversation—normally I do not repeat private conversations, I will quickly add, but on this occasion I think it is a not unreasonable thing to do—that we ought to have another discussion about how we handle the remainder of the program, and he agrees, because we only have 1½ sitting days left. There is urgent business: the Labor Party have consistently acknowledged that a significant number of bills before us are essential bills. They need to be dealt with; they have to be dealt with in this, the last week of sitting of the Senate before an election is called. We accept that. We are responsible and sensible about how we approach these issues. There is essential, urgent legislation that needs to be dealt with and we will give priority to that legislation and we will always try and consider mechanisms that allow us—understanding different views in the chamber and the need for adequate debate—to deal with such essential legislation.
We reject that mechanism being used to bring forward legislation like the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill 2001, which is clearly not urgent—it is not even required at all; it is being used as a lever by the government to try and advantage its own party political self-interest. I think it is important for the Senate to acknowledge that that has been attempted here consistently by the government. I think another discussion about handling the balance of the remainder of the program will be important but I accept, and the opposition accepts, that this package of migration bills is urgent; it is essential; it does need to be dealt with by the Senate. Although we might quibble about a couple of hours more debate, give or take, I think that will be the approach that the opposition takes on this issue.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (EXCISION FROM MIGRATION ZONE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-09-26,"—The Democrats oppose this motion. For the procedurally minded, my understanding of the effect if the motion goes down is that we then go immediately back into committee and reconsider the important work that the Committee of the Whole was doing. It is important to oppose this motion because that would enable us to get on with the business of examining the many flaws in the package of legislation.
I remind the Senate that we only got to the tail end of the second bill and we were finding plenty of flaws along the way. Indeed, that bill introduced two brand new categories of temporary protection visas. I had some fairly straightforward questions. The bill does this major thing—it introduces two new major categories of visas—and I asked a question about what the implications of those are and I could not get an answer. They had to take it on notice because it was too complicated. That is the sort of level of preparation and understanding the minister has about this particular bill. That was just one important aspect of one of the seven bills.
It is important, in the view of the Democrats, that we do not accept this motion and that we get back into the important role of considering that legislation in detail because, despite statements by Minister Hill and to a lesser extent by Senator Faulkner, I do not believe there has been anywhere near adequate time given to consider these bills. And that has been highlighted as much by the questions asked by Labor senators as it has by questions asked by the Democrats or others. They have clearly highlighted that there is a lack of information and a lack of answers about the impacts of the bills and about how they are going to be put into operation—even further, a lack of opportunity to clarify and outline what the real impact is. 
As I said before, I believe there is no way that the Australian public would be anywhere near as supportive of the Prime Minister's approach if they actually knew the detail of these bills. We are being prevented from making them aware of what the details are. We are not able to get explanations from the government—not that we would probably get them anyway, because they do not seem to know. We are not able to outline them ourselves because we are being cut short.
Passing this motion will enable the minister to go through the procedure for declaring the bills urgent bills and then bringing down a guillotine. I understand from what Senator Hill said that the guillotine will come into play from 12 o'clock, which means it will be an instant cut-off. That will in effect gag any further debate at all on the bills or any further statements of any sort other than debate, potentially or possibly, on the motions he is going to move about declaring them urgent. Unless we vote against this motion, any further opportunity for examination of the bills and for the government to be held to any sort of accountability will be lost. That of course is what the government wants. That indeed is one of the major purposes of the package of bills—to prevent the government's actions in the whole area of refugee and migration law from being open to scrutiny by the parliament or the courts. This is symbolic of what is happening here now.
It is worth saying—as I have said in the debate a couple of times over the past couple of days—that we look back now with a great degree of shame on the debates and what the parliament passed in 1901. I believe we will do the same in relation to these bills when we look back on 2001. In that sense, I say to the people in the gallery that you are witnessing a bit of history that will be pointed to for many years to come. You do not always see historic things happening in the Senate. Usually it might appear a bit dry and drab. Maybe this is still sounding dry and drab, but let me assure you that it is quite historic. The processes that we are going to go through now, I believe, are going to be looked back on by not just historians but legal analysts and political analysts as one of the darkest days in Australia's history of parliamentary process—and not just because the appalling range of terrible measures contained in the legislation being passed undermine human rights, undermine the rule of law, prevent scrutiny of government activities, give absolute power to a government minister, his department and officers of the Commonwealth, including thousands of people, and give absolute power beyond scrutiny of the courts to this government and governments to come.
It is incredibly draconian legislation way out of proportion with the issue that it is trying to deal with. We will look back on it with horror not just because of the content of the legislation that is being passed but because of the political dynamic that surrounds it. It is not just a failure in terms of the appallingness of the legislation; the failure of our political process is almost as appalling. There is a very strong probability that a majority of people in this chamber—including on the coalition side—are, if not opposed to all of these bills, opposed to components of these bills. The proper will of the parliament is being subverted by the immediate short-term interests of political parties and the rigid political party discipline that applies in Australia. One of the things I could at least say in the favour of the parliament of 1901, in reading the debates, is that when they were debating the White Australia legislation there was clearly a lot more flexibility in how people voted on particular clauses and bills. At least that legislation took four months to debate, although they still got it horribly wrong.
On this occasion, it is a clear case where the short-term political interest of the government is to give themselves absolute power, to put themselves beyond the rule of law, to give themselves the opportunity and the ability to keep genuine refugees out of Australia, and to be able to turn people away without any fear of retribution. More importantly than that, seeking political advantage in the upcoming election means the government are willing to divide the nation and generate anxiety, fear, hatred, antagonism and vilification within the community for their own short-term political ends. That is their political agenda. That has won out over their principles, aims and concern about due process of law, due processes of the Senate or even decent law. I know, given how many lawyers there are in the coalition, that plenty of them know that these bills are full of rubbish, even from a legal point of view. 
From the Labor Party's side of things, their political agenda is that they recognise that they have been outmanoeuvred politically by John Howard on this one, in my view because they did not take a strong leadership position in the first place in opposing Mr Howard's and Mr Ruddock's divisive, destructive agenda—or not opposing it strongly enough. There was no clear alternative position for the public to grasp on to. When Mr Howard says he is doing something, people think, `We're not sure if we totally agree with it, but at least he's doing something. Somebody has got to do something.' Unfortunately, the something that he is doing is completely appalling and will not even address the problem. It will increase the suffering of very vulnerable people and will increase the burden on the taxpayer by millions and millions of dollars. But hey, at least he is doing something! They do not see any alternative from the opposition, because there is no alternative other than a few more coast guard boats out there and talking nicely to Indonesia.
In that sense, because of lack of leadership, it is no wonder that there has been a political vacuum for John Howard to exploit. Now Labor's political positioning and short-term agenda is that they want to neutralise this issue as one that cannot be used against them, by letting all this rush through, despite the acknowledgment by most of them that these bills are significantly flawed in many ways. It is a bit of a confusing message from different people in the Labor Party about how flawed the bills are and which bits are flawed. Indeed, Kim Beazley himself, in his comments in the Hansard in the House of Representatives, said that Labor is supporting these bills because they are good bills. He said they will be effective and workable.
That is obviously a very different message to what we have been hearing not just in the Senate from Labor members but from others in the other place when they have been allowed to speak—which has not been very often. Outside this place a lot of them are saying that these are not actually terribly good bills, they are not going to work, they are very flawed and we might have to come back and fix them up. Indeed, we heard today that not only would Labor have to come back and fix them up but even the government would have to come back and fix them up, because they are so flawed—and that is quite likely the case.
The political agenda of the ALP is clearly to neutralise the issue; it is a bit unfortunate that some refugees will suffer in the meantime and that our rule of law will be undermined, but that is the price that you pay. For completely differing reasons, there is a coalition of very short-term political interests between the Liberal Party and the Labor Party, each of them combining to basically toss aside and ignore the incredibly severe deficiencies in this legislation and the incredibly appalling consequences that will flow from our passing these bills. In that sense, it is almost as dark a thing as the legislation itself—the fact that our political process has got to the stage where instantaneous short-term political expediency has won out so comprehensively over our responsibilities as parliamentarians. Sure, we all have a role in being political; sure, political interests and political positioning come into it. But there has to be a balance and there has to be a line in terms of our responsibilities and our role. Surely our first, second and third responsibilities have to be—particularly in major areas of legislation—the impact, the effect, of the legislation on individual human beings, on groups of human beings, on communities, on society, on Australia, on the globe. All of those groups are going to be affected by what we are doing here today and all of those consequences are being ignored.  
Again I note the comments from Mr Beazley in relation to these bills that the legislation `is being supported because it is legal, because it is workable and because it will be effective', as opposed to the comments from Senator Schacht, who said:
... it is true that we could vote it all down and do what the Democrats ask us. But the more I read of this legislation, the more I think we absolutely ought to let it pass and let the government stew in the hilarity that this sort of legislation is going to create. It is unworkable. 
I do not think the refugees will be `stewing in hilarity' as a consequence; I do not think they will find the situation too hilarious. Many people in the Australian community cannot quite see the humour either. It is interesting to note, and appropriate to refer to, an advertisement that appeared in today's Age newspaper from a range of prominent Australians calling for a change in the treatment of asylum seekers, disagreeing with the treatment of asylum seekers by Australia and calling for a change in policy. One thing that is different from parliament 100 years ago is that, when they were debating the White Australia Policy, they were not checking the latest news updates on their laptop in the chamber. I have just seen on the AAP news service that Kim Beazley said he had not seen that advertisement but that his message now is not that this legislation is workable. The article states:
Mr Beazley said it was the government's legislation and it stood to be judged on the success of it.
It sounds like he is coming round to Senator Schacht's way of thinking: `blame the government; it is not our fault.' The article continues: 
“... they've got their acts through, they've said those acts are necessary to protect those borders (and) we'll see if they protect the borders,” he told reporters.
“My view is that you're not going to protect the borders until you get in place a decent agreement with Indonesia and you get in place a coastguard.
So his view is now that the legislation will not protect the borders because we are not putting in place a coastguard or a decent agreement with Indonesia—but he is still passing the legislation. It is good to see that Senator Schacht's line of argument is so influential that it has now converted Mr Beazley away from his previous position that these bills are workable, legal and will be effective in protecting our borders. Today Mr Beazley is saying that that will not occur. Today he is saying:
You will not be able to sustain this level of naval activity for a huge length of time. It's unaffordable.
He has been reading Senator Schacht's speeches, just as I have, and he is echoing Senator Schacht's comment that it is unworkable. It is amazing.
Obviously, Mr Beazley is incredibly embarrassed by the advertisement in the Age calling for a change in treatment. It is supported by all the usual suspects: various professors, a number of fine upstanding members of the community and the Hon. Malcolm Fraser. Everyone knows that he is just a bleeding-heart former Liberal Prime Minister that somehow or other has got a heart in his old age—a quaint person that the Liberals wish they could disown somehow! Obviously that is no embarrassment to Mr Beazley. But alongside the Hon. Malcolm Fraser is the Hon. Michael Duffy, a fairly esteemed former Attorney-General of the Labor Party in the Hawke years. Also on the list is the legendary Hon. Gough Whitlam, the great Labor Party icon, who is held in high esteem. He also is calling for a change in the treatment of asylum seekers. 
I hope that Labor members listen to their elder statesperson in relation to this call. They still have the opportunity; they can vote against this motion and we can get back into debating the bills and trying to get a change in the treatment of asylum seekers. This is their opportunity. I really do hope that they take up that opportunity because I believe that, whilst we are all guilty at times of being political and looking at the political angle, we cannot let that get in the way of our broader responsibility to ensure that we uphold our role as parliamentarians, as assessors of legislation, as protectors of the rights of the Australian community and as protectors of, in particular, the rights of the weak and the vulnerable more than anyone else. Refugees are amongst the weakest and the most vulnerable in our communities. Many of the people that will be affected by the legislation we are dealing with are members of the Australian community already. Many more, as a consequence of these bills, will still end up in the Australian community but with fewer rights: they will be Australians with fewer rights than other Australians. That will be the outcome of these bills. On top of that, the legislation will affect many other people around the world. Some in this chamber say that we should worry only about Australians and not everybody else, that it is the problem of other people. I do not hold that view. I hold the view that we have a responsibility first and foremost to Australia as Australian representatives but that we have a broader, general responsibility for global citizens as well. This legislation will also impact on them. 
It is very significant legislation, and I believe that we should re-examine the issues whilst we have the opportunity. As Senator Brown said, we have not been filibustering on this debate. Indeed, this morning most of the questioning has come from Labor members and they have exposed quite skilfully some of the holes in the legislation. We are certainly not wanting to talk this out; I could even give the commitment that we would allow it to come to a vote before the end of the week. But we do believe that it desperately needs some more spotlight shone on it, if for no other reason than to get increased community awareness about the absolute moral bankruptcy of the coalition government in relation to this legislation.
We are passing up an opportunity to really expose the full depths of the moral, intellectual, political and legal bankruptcy of this coalition government represented through these bills and the devastating social consequences that are occurring as a result of the fact that the Prime Minister has won this debate in the community at the moment because there is insufficient opposition and insufficient awareness of the morally bankrupt way in which he is operating. In effect, letting these bills through without further debate will not just pass very bad law but will again enable the Prime Minister to stay ahead of everybody else in continuing to push his divisive and destructive agenda.
In conclusion I should note that Senator Hill, in his comments, mentioned a number of bills that the government was keen to have debated and included amongst those was the Regional Forest Agreements Bill. He may not have been aware that this morning the Senate refused to exempt that bill from the cut-off, so I am assuming he just had not caught up with that and that that bill is not going to be dealt with.
I listened with interest to the statements that Senator Faulkner made on previous guillotines that had been applied in this place. I acknowledge those and take them on board. If all of us examine how things are done and have been done in the past, we might think about how they could have been done differently. It is useful to get contributions about how these things can be done in different ways to at least provide the best opportunity for each side being able to get their stances on the table. As for the process that was followed then, different people had different aspects of control over it, but I think it is a fair point to make that that was not an ideal mechanism or an ideal process.
Guillotines are never ideal, but there is no point in adopting a position of mock purity about it. As Senator Ray said the other day, I think all of us, with the possible exception of Senator Brown, could support them. I am sure that if the circumstances were right Senator Brown could also be persuaded to support a guillotine if it meant saving Tasmania's forests as a consequence. I am sure even he would consider a guillotine then, although I am sure it would be a humane one. So the issues are as much about recognising when the will of the Senate might be that that be put in place while trying to do that in an effective a way as possible and acknowledging that it might not have been done in the best way in the past. I am not sure this is the best way either and I would have liked a lot more time, and for that reason I would like to see this motion opposed.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (EXCISION FROM MIGRATION ZONE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2001-09-26,"— I would like to thank the Greens and the Democrats for not fully exploiting the government's stupidity of trying to move to a guillotine out of committee. You always move a guillotine when you are in normal business. The whole standing orders are constrained to limit that debate. We could have had in fact 10 speeches of 20 minutes each on what we have just heard. The Greens and the Democrats have not decided to exploit it—I thank them for that—but it is a very stupid act. You do not just get out of committee to move the guillotine, you wait until you are well outside of it; otherwise we could have had 10 speeches of 20 minutes each on whether we resume at a later hour this day. So I would like to at least thank the minor parties for not exploiting it. ",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (EXCISION FROM MIGRATION ZONE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2001-09-26,"—I rise to indicate that I oppose the guillotine, particularly as it is on a very, very important issue which goes to the lives of so many thousands of people. I do not intend to speak any further because the more that I speak the less time there will be for committee considerations.
—No, that is not right—12 o'clock is the proposed time, 10 minutes ago.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—I am sorry. Things have changed since last night, have they? I am concerned about the fact that the guillotine is coming down now. I indicated in my speech on the second reading my great concern about this legislation—how it undermines so many things that Australia really stands for. I understand that the government has concern over the security of Australia's borders. That is a matter not only of government interest but of interest to all of us—we all agree with that—but in no way at any time during the committee stage debate has the government advanced any real proof that our borders are under attack and that they are not properly protected. Of course, if it is suggested that they are not properly protected, the government is falling down on the job.
The whole point is that persons cannot be provided with a visa unless those persons are determined, in accordance with proper procedure, to have a well-founded fear of persecution if they are returned to the country from which they came. Too little has been said about that, but those are the facts. Whether it is convenient for the government to make those assessments elsewhere than on mainland Australia is for them to determine. Whether it is convenient or not is not the issue; it is whether our own borders are properly protected and whether our obligations are being discharged, particularly our obligations not to refoule. Those are the important questions that we need to be considering.
Furthermore, we need to increase our efforts to seek cooperation from other governments in the area, including the Indonesian government. One of the reasons that I was not here for the start of this debate is that I have just come from a meeting between members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and the new Indonesian ambassador. What we need to do is put more effort into cooperative measures to stop people smuggling through Malaysia and Indonesia. I feel sure that that cooperation will be forthcoming. I oppose the guillotining of this debate. There are a large number of issues which need to be discussed and, because of the guillotine, we will not be able to give these matters the thorough consideration that they all deserve.

"Senator ALSTON,",LP,2001-09-26,"—I rise to again pursue the matter of Senator Faulkner's sewer and the apparently preferential treatment received by him from Sydney Water. I note at the outset that, when I spoke on this matter on 9 August, Senator Faulkner complained:
As usual, Senator Alston did not do me the courtesy of indicating that he was going to address these matters.
This really is a bit rich. The matter first found its way into the public arena as a direct result of Senator Faulkner rising in this chamber on 9 August and saying:
I want to tell you a story about my sewer.
He then proceeded to bag me and Senator Heffernan. Did he forewarn us? Of course not. The fact is that Senator Faulkner has established the ground rules for etiquette in this matter but, as usual, with his acute victim complex he is totally unable to accept any responsibility for his own behaviour.
I also make it plain that, contrary to allegations made by Senator Faulkner, I have not relied on or spoken to any Liberal Party informant in relation to this matter. Instead, I have based my concerns on documents made available by Sydney Water. Senator Faulkner's attitude to date seems to be simply to tough the matter out, no doubt on the advice of his good friend and mentor, Senator Ray, who on his own admission has been through all the relevant documents and financing arrangements in considerable detail.
The critical issue which remains unanswered is that, despite Sydney Water making it clear that Senator Faulkner should pay for the cost of the extension or lead-out to the adjoining property, as a result of what he chooses to describe as argy-bargy, he managed to persuade Sydney Water not to charge him one cent for the extension works. How did this come about? Anyone familiar with the practices of government utilities such as Sydney Water would know that, despite the fact that extensions to adjoining landowners' properties are not strictly for the benefit of a primary landowner such as Senator Faulkner, many thousands of citizens have found themselves in this situation and have been required to bear the cost of such extensions. Yet Senator Faulkner appears to have been able to engineer a much more favourable result for himself, a result which ordinary citizens can only envy. 
I raised some very important questions about how Senator Faulkner achieved such an outcome, and I asked whether he talked to the New South Wales Labor government to obtain this result. My information is that he did speak to Mr Craig Knowles, the then New South Wales Minister for Urban Affairs and Planning, and that Mr Knowles asked for Senator Faulkner's problem to be sorted out. I also asked whether he contacted the ministerial section of Sydney Water and, if so, why. My information is that he did. I am also informed that Senator Faulkner was irate and abusive with Sydney Water staff over a period of several weeks. What is truly extraordinary is that, despite very serious allegations being put on the public record on 29 August, Senator Faulkner chose not to say one word about them until I again raised the matter in the chamber on 19 September, three weeks later. 
As soon as I did so, Senator Ray jumped to his feet and made it plain that he had been through all the documents, the financing arrangements and the issues with Senator Faulkner. Following my second contribution on the matter, Senator Faulkner immediately came into the chamber and made it plain that he was unaware of what I had said, although he was happy to claim that I had `probably made wild and unsubstantiated allegations' which he said he would have a look at some time in the future. He then proceeded to provide a rambling and discursive contribution which did not deal with any of the matters of substance raised by me and certainly did not throw any light on whom Senator Faulkner had approached, directly or indirectly, within the New South Wales government or Sydney Water and how he had managed to persuade Sydney Water to forgo their claims. Instead, he went on at great length about how he did not want a sewer line under his house but was forced to have one. It is not at all clear whether this was intended to refer to the extension or the lead-out or whether it was simply yet another red herring cast by Senator Faulkner to cover up his refusal to deal with the substance of the issues.
The most that Senator Faulkner was prepared to volunteer was that `it is true that I paid by way of a variation of the building contract at the time at least $3,000 and possibly up to $8,000 towards that work'. It is beyond comprehension that Senator Faulkner cannot be more precise about how much he paid, to whom and for what works. Senator Faulkner is clearly able to produce all the relevant documents, as he has already told the chamber that they are available for inspection by anyone other than the Liberal Party. Unless he does produce those documents, it is quite clear that he is not prepared to come clean about the circumstances of this matter.
In two previous speeches I have asked Senator Faulkner to state whether he brought political pressure to bear in relation to this matter and, if he did, what kind of pressure he used. What does Senator Faulkner mean when he refers to `frustrating argy-bargy'? I have asked whether he exerted political influence for private gain, and again he has refused to respond. I have asked these questions for a very good reason. Today, I wish to table a new document that makes it clear that political influence did occur in this matter. The document is a fax cover sheet dated 9 September on Sydney Water letterhead. It refers to the work at Senator Faulkner's property, and states:
As a matter of urgency, i.e. political influence, this work has been started today.
I repeat: 
As a matter of urgency, i.e. political influence, this work has been started today.
What this document reveals is that political influence was exerted in relation to sewerage work at Senator Faulkner's property. It does not say who exerted that influence or exactly what the result of that influence was: nevertheless, it is now clear that Sydney Water was subjected to political influence in relation to this matter. So we have a situation where the documentation clearly states that political influence was exerted in relation to the private work being done by a senior politician. We also have a situation where the documentation also clearly indicates that a sewer extension that was to be paid for up-front by Senator Faulkner ended up being paid for by Sydney Water. 
I note Senator Faulkner's presence in the chamber. I also note that he has no documents with him. I therefore presume he is once again going to simply make some very general statements on the matter without responding with any seriousness to the matters raised. Given the seriousness of these matters and Senator Faulkner's consistent and cavalier disregard of normal accountability processes, I have decided to refer this matter to ICAC, in order that a detailed and impartial assessment can be conducted. Perhaps I could show that letter to Senator Faulkner, and then—
—You can just table it.
—All right. I table the document.
—It is just that it has not been shown.
—You did not tell me you were going to speak, either.
—I made my reasons for not doing so plain at the beginning. It was because, when you first raised this matter in the chamber and bagged me and Senator Heffernan, you did not alert us to the matter.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,"<title>Faulkner, Senator John: Alleged Smear Campaign</title>",Matters of Public Interest,3,1
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2001-09-26,"—Senator Faulkner asked me a question yesterday in my capacity as Minister representing the Mini-ster for Defence. I seek leave to incorporate a response in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The response read as follows—
SENATOR FAULKNER asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence on 25 September 2001:
My question is directed to Senator Minchin, representing the Minister for Defence. Minister, what is the cost of the additional surveillance being undertaken by the Australian Defence Force in the Indian Ocean and to the north of Australia? Can I also ask whether Defence will be supplemented for this additional tasking, or is the Defence portfolio being expected to absorb these unforeseen costs? 
Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for taking the question on notice. I also ask the minister to confirm that it is now the government's intention that the current naval operation being conducted in our northern waters, which according to some sources is costing more than $20 million a week, will actually continue indefinitely. Will any other Royal Australian Navy operations and exercises have to be cut in order to pay for this indefinite operation?
The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable Senator's question:
There have been numerous media reports on costs incurred by the Department of Defence to support the Government's initiative on the management and deterrence of unauthorised boat arrivals.
The Department has stated on the public record before the Federal Court of Australia that its costs as of 2 September were approximately $3 million per day for the deployment of Defence assets on and around Christmas Island.
However, it should be made clear that $3 million a day is a full cost figure that covers both direct costs (such as fuel, spares, servicing, personnel and supplies) and indirect costs (such as depreciation of assets). Defence would incur most of these costs if the assets were performing other tasks and were not engaged on these operations.
The net impact of these operations on Defence is much smaller than the $3 million per day full cost. The best estimate for the net additional costs is around $200,000 to $250,000 per day. Other long-term costs, such as additional maintenance, are yet to be determined.
The Government is yet to decide how this net impact is to be funded.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2001-09-26,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Justice and Customs (Senator Ellison) to questions without notice asked by Senators Carr and Crossin today relating to SES funding of schools.
The opposition has obtained a copy of a damning indictment of the government's new education funding model which had been much touted by Dr Kemp, which he says is much fairer and is the basis on which the Commonwealth allocates $14 billion worth of public funds. This is a funding model that provides some $3.6 million extra per year to schools such as Caulfield Grammar School, $3.9 million extra per year to schools such as Wesley College in Melbourne and $3.1 million extra per year to Trinity Grammar School. That is the funding model that we are talking about today.
This is the funding model which has been the subject of a profound critique by one of not only this country's but the world's leading statisticians in this field. This is a report prepared by Dr Ken Ross—the same Dr Ken Ross whose name is used for the indices that are actually used to allocate this money. This is a man who actually knows what he is talking about—unlike what we have seen today from the government, which has sought to denigrate his response and to say that it has a better method of allocating money, better than the way the world expert says is how it should be done. 
In fact, the government today acknowledges that it has undertaken its own review and that, subject to its own review of the SES funding model, a Ms Ann Hardy out of the University of Canberra has undertaken a consultancy for this government entitled `Advice on aspects of the special socioeconomic status', which I understand is the basis for this new review. This is why we asked the question about how the non-government schools can have any confidence in the government's model when everybody who knows anything about it understands just what a flawed and corrupted system of allocating money we have before us.
Under this model Adass Israel, an extremely poor small Jewish school in Melbourne, has a higher SES score than Haileybury, higher than Geelong Grammar, higher than Geelong College, higher than King's School in Sydney and higher than Trinity Grammar. This model produces those sorts of results, and you have to ask why that is the case. Dr Ross points out to us:
... the formula construction “recipe” that was used to transform raw census data into the SES Index contains major technical errors ...
The paper goes on to say:
As a result of those technical flaws, the SES Index, in its current form, is not suitable for the purpose of guiding large-scale resource allocation decisions among Australia's non-government schools.
I seek leave to table this report. 
—Is leave granted?
—We have to see it. 
—Subject to you seeing it, I take it that leave will be granted. 
—No. Leave has not been granted at this stage. You can try again after it has been read by the government. You may like to try at the end of your speech. 
—We have here a document which shows that the purpose of this formula is essentially to meet political guidelines. `Senior policy makers', the government says. The report quotes Dr Kemp directly: 
Senior policy makers said that the EER program was inadequate to meet the government's needs and as a consequence it may well have influenced the way in which the processes of producing this corrupt model were developed. 
The paper claims: 
 ... in developing the SES model no serious attempt by the department was made to capitalise on widely available knowledge. 
I put the view that there has been quite clear political interference in the production of the model which allocates $14 billion. We have what the report describes as a complete corruption of the standardisation process. We have, essentially, a model which produces a result which demonstrates just how unfair the government's funding model is—a distorted model, a model which does not take into account the resources of schools, a model which presents those that are paupers as if they were wealthy and those that are wealthy as if they were paupers. We have a government which has approached the non-government schools and which oversees substantial sums of money being allocated to the already wealthy. There is deliberate manipulation in the way this government has presented this funding model.

"Tierney, Sen John",LP,2001-09-26,"—Here we have another example of Senator Carr systematically working his way through the education system, trashing its reputation bit by bit. He started with the TAFE system about two years ago. He claimed all sorts of terrible things were wrong with the TAFE system. What the inquiry found after 18 months was that there had been considerable improvements, in the record of this government, in the TAFE system—in the way it was reorganised, in the way it moved to private provision, and in the way quality controls came in. Even though Senator Carr at the time was claiming there were all sorts of problems, what the research showed, particularly in Western Australia and in South Australia—
—That is not true.  
—Senator, it is true. The inquiry showed that one per cent of the providers were creating problems and the states moved quickly to rectify that. Any industry that has only one per cent of problems is doing pretty well. That has been rectified. Senator Carr then tried to trash the reputation of Australia's universities with his inquiry into higher education but could not find any vice-chancellors who said that quality had reduced. We had a question earlier today from Senator Cook claiming that public funding for universities had dropped, when the reality is that it has been stable. In the last six years funding for students has been stable and this is all about to increase considerably over the next two or three years. 
It is a great pity that what Senator Carr did with the universities made the papers in Asia, because they were very minor and often easily corrected problems. The soft marking particularly is a matter that could be handled by the universities. Unfortunately, the impression he left overseas was that these problems were widespread. That was not the finding of the report. Tomorrow when we debate that matter, with the tabling of the report, I will deal with that further. 
Senator Carr, having gone through TAFE and the universities, is now dealing with schools. I would like to place on the record, in the broad framework, that public schooling in this country is 88 per cent funded by the state departments of education. They are putting up funding in a very small way—in the case of New South Wales about two per cent a year. We contribute 12 per cent of the funding to public schools and we have been putting our share up at a rate of five per cent—now six per cent—per annum. So we are really pulling our weight in that area. That brings me to the point of what Senator Carr is discussing today in relation to the funding of the private school system which, because of the way our constitutional arrangements have evolved, has become more the responsibility of the federal government. 
Let me put one point very strongly. The average student in a public school is funded by taxpayers at a rate of over $6,000 a year. The average private school student is funded at over $4,000 a year. In other words, there is quite a gap. Who makes up that gap? Parents make up that gap and there are other ways in which schools can raise funding. The net effect of this is that the taxpayer is saved $2.3 billion every year because parents put that funding into private schools. Then we come to the question of the public money that goes into private schools and whether that is fairly distributed between the schools. Certainly under the Labor Party the answer was no. 
The old educational resource index everyone agreed was a failure. It was distributing the funds in an inequitable way and it needed reform. Even the Labor Party, at the end of last year, voted with the government to reform the system. The SES system that we have brought in is far superior, and it actually got the support of the Labor Party at the end of last year. It corrects a lot of the anomalies of the old education resource index. A lot of schools were grossly underfunded over the years and the new system has corrected that. It is a far better system. It is a system that was supported by Labor and it still deserves that support.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Education: Funding for Non-government Schools</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2001-09-26,"—I rise on the motion to take note of the answers given by Senator Ellison to the questions asked by Senator Carr and I regarding school funding. Unlike my colleague Senator Tierney, I will stick to the relevance of taking note of the answer to the question. The question was not about TAFE funding or higher education funding. Perhaps on another day I will respond to the very inaccurate statements that Senator Tierney made in relation to those two elements of the education industry. 
The report referred to, entitled The right ingredients but the wrong recipe, was used by the Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs. Senator Ellison said that the report was simply provided for that department; that is not correct. This report is in fact a paper about the technical issues related to the construction of the new SES index used. The SES funding model used by this government in allocating funding to schools came into place this year. Let me just go to the conclusions of this report, which says: 
It was shown that there were particularly a large number of very serious technical problems associated with the construction process. As a result of these problems, it is quite clear that the SES index, in its present form, is not suitable for the purpose of guiding large-scale resource allocation decisions for Australia's non-government schools.
This report comprehensively shows that this government has botched it again when it comes to looking after the education system in this country. This report shows that the technical issues related to how schools will be funded in this country are seriously flawed. It is a very good analysis of the way in which the census collection data are used against a school system. It talks about the fact that the SES system uses only occupation, education and income dimensions. It does not talk about tenancy, family stability or Aboriginality. It does not talk about the assessment of isolation. It does not include a measure of ethnicity. In other words, this is a funding model that is seriously flawed. 
The suggestion was that the department take much more time in looking at the technical issues relating to this funding model before it was implemented. But no, the minister was hell-bent on getting rid of the previous ERI model. He felt that the ERI model was not adequate and he had very negative views about it. In an exercise of political expediency, he hurried through the research and the implementation of the SES index. He put it through very hastily to coincide with the next four years of the quadrennial funding for schools.
This government has provided $700 million extra to the non-government school system over the last few years. This government has had a definite policy emphasis on propping up and promoting the non-government school system at the expense of the public system. This government provides $1 million a year to each of the 58 schools in category 1, as compared to only $60,000 a year to Catholic schools—apart from any inflation they might benefit from—and $4,000 per year to public schools for the whole of the school. It goes from $1 million to $60,000 to only $4,000. 
Yet this government—and we have just heard Senator Tierney say it a minute ago—thinks that this new system is fair, that it is a just and equitable funding system. We have uncovered this system today thanks to the work of Dr Ken Ross and his report used by DETYA. This system is seriously flawed. It has technical problems and it has matters that need to be seriously addressed and revised. This government was so concerned about propping up the non-government sector that it rushed through this funding model despite the fact that there are serious problems and serious inadequacies in the way in which this funding system is applied.

"Tchen, Sen Tsebin",LP,2001-09-26,"—Senator Crossin was right in one aspect when she said that Senator Tierney, when he started, did not focus on the question before the Senate, but it was important for Senator Tierney to do that because it gave a sense of the history of how this question came about. The question we are discussing concerns school funding, but it is also a fact that Senator Kim Carr, who is the self-anointed education expert on the Labor side—
—He's our spokesman.
—He's the parliamentary secretary.
—He is not the shadow minister, though, is he? The self-anointed education expert has spent the last three years hunting around for some topic to talk about. He started with TAFE, went on to universities and eventually ran out of other topics and reached school education and school funding. It is important that Senator Crossin has a sense of this history as well. Obviously, she has no understanding of how Senator Carr came to develop these views.
There were a couple of things self-evidently wrong in Senator Carr's speech, but I will come back to them later. First, let us look at the basic idea of the fundamental issues that are being changed by the government in the non-government school funding area. Non-government schools have over the years been funded through the education resources index system. We all know that. The problem with the ERI system, put simply, is that the more you have the less you get. A school which had been prudent and had managed its resources well, regardless of whether it needed more money or not, would not get additional funding under the old system. As Senator Tierney said, the ERI system has been thoroughly discredited. It has even been abandoned by the Labor Party, although Senator Kim Carr seemed to be still fighting a rearguard action to defend it.  
The new system, the socioeconomic status system, looks at the parents' needs rather than the schools' needs, because underlying all these changes is the government's idea that education is a matter for the parents to decide. It is important that the parents of the children have a choice, have a say, about where they wish their children to have their education. It does not do justice to the parents' aspirations if we—because of some ideological barrier—deny to schools that provide good education the funding to continue to provide the sort of education excellence that not only serves those children at the schools but, by example, also lifts the education standard right across the spectrum. 
The SES system is based on looking at the parents' socioeconomic status on the basis of the census information. It matches the parents' addresses against census collection districts. The important thing about census collection districts is that they are the lowest level that you can get detailed, credible, reliable statistical information for households. No other system is as reliable. That is the important point. That is why census information is used rather than a school based system, because a school based system always relies on voluntary information of a questionable standard. There are students from poor families in rich schools as well. Senator Carr made some points about very rich, or well-managed, schools getting extra funding. The important thing is surely what sort of education standard those schools provide. Senator Carr does not care about what sort of education they provide, just about how rich they are. He does not care about whether they are using their money wisely.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2001-09-26,"—Unfortunately, in this discussion in the chamber today, both Senator Tierney and Senator Tchen have missed the point. The government's message here does not even seem to be consistent. The issue being challenged by this leaked document is that the claims by the government that the SES funding index would provide a more equitable way of distributing recurrent funding and that the SES system would foster equity, transparency, simplicity, flexibility and cost are wrong. The government claims are wrong and their own department is telling them so. 
Senator Tierney, in his contribution, attempted to discredit Senator Carr. Senator Tchen sought to follow but did not really quite follow how this place conducts itself. I will address that point in part before I go into the problems with the government's case here. Senator Carr is the Labor-anointed parliamentary secretary for education. He is not a self-anointed expert; he has a representative role in this chamber and that is quite clear, Senator Tchen. As part of that representative role, he today has highlighted serious problems with the SES model and he has given credit to those problems through a departmental report that has been leaked. We have sought today to table that report. As I understand it, the government will not allow leave, so it is incumbent upon us to refer to components of that report which highlight these problems. 
In question time today, the minister acknowledged the problems cited in this report and he would not deny that further changes could occur now to this botched SES model. People listening to this debate might recall that this model is so botched that, although the government originally pretended that it was based on a system utilised within the Catholic system, even the Catholic system did not want to touch it. Here are some of the reasons why. Rather than the system fostering equity, what this report has found is that, as a result of the bungled formula, some rural and isolated communities, some communities with high rates of unemployment and some communities with large concentrations of recently arrived people from non-English-speaking backgrounds have been judged to be wealthier than they really are. 
The consequences of this and this formula have reduced the proportion of funds going to these needy communities. I would have asked—if additional questions had been allowed today—whether the minister will immediately release the new modelling proposed in this report, and when he will tell us how he is going to address the corruption that occurred with this SES model. The Labor Party's position with respect to this model is not new. It is clearly outlined in the minority report produced by Labor senators as a result of the inquiry into that model. Let me read further from this leaked report, corroborated again by what we put in our report to the Senate on this legislation: 
... the formula construction `recipe' that was used to transform raw census data into the SES Index contains major technical errors which include: the use of the wrong units of data analysis, the erroneous application of standardization procedures, the use of incorrect data element weights, and problems with the choice of census variables and socioeconomic dimensions. As a result of these technical flaws, the SES Index, in its current form, is not suitable for the purpose of guiding large-scale resource allocation decisions amongst Australia's non-government schools.
The minister had his chance today to address these very serious claims—they are more than claims; this is a departmental report about how this tool operates—and he missed it. He missed the opportunity to deny that inequity is being produced by this system or to inform the Australian public about what he is going to do about it. What is the minister going to do about his own department's loss of confidence in the tool that he pushed through the system and held the Australian public and parliamentary system to ransom over, in terms of denying school funding to the sector for the year ahead in order to get this blunt instrument through?

That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (7) of standing order 111 not apply to the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2001, allowing it to be considered during this period of sittings. 
I also table a statement of reasons justifying the need for this bill to be considered during these sittings and seek leave to have the statement incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 2001 
Purpose of the Bill 
The purpose of the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2001 is to provide legislative commitment and support for the outcomes of the Regional Forest Agreements and for ongoing action to implement the Forest and Wood Products Action Agenda through the Forest and Wood Products Council.
Reasons for Urgency
Ten Regional Forest Agreements (RFAs) between the Commonwealth and three state governments have now been concluded since the agreement between governments to implement RFAs in 1995. Some state governments have challenged aspects of the outcomes of these agreements, introducing uncertainty about continuing government commitment to the RFAs.
The substance of the bill has been extensively debated in the parliament. This bill honours a commitment to regional communities, industry and some state governments. It will commit the Commonwealth unequivocally to the outcomes achieved in the RFA process and increase the certainty essential to RFAs being effective. Failure to pass the bill in this session potentially means there would be a long period of uncertainty about the future of the RFAs.
This could undermine the work of successive Commonwealth and state governments, since the National Forest Policy Statement of 1992, to improve intergovernmental institutions and decision processes to support comprehensive forward planning of forest use. Passage of the bill would also underpin ongoing action under the Forest and Wood Products Action Agenda through the Forest and Wood Products Council.

"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,2001-09-26,"—On behalf of Senator Coonan and the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I give notice that at the giving of notices on the next day of sitting I shall withdraw business of the Senate notice of motion No. 1 standing in her name for 12 sitting days after today for the disallowance of Space Activities Regulations 2001, as contained in Statutory Rules 2001 No. 186 and made under the Space Activities Act 1998. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the committee's correspondence concerning these regulations.
Leave granted.

Dear Minister
I refer to the Space Activities Regulations 2001, Statutory Rules 2001 No. 186, that provide for a licensing and safety regime in relation to space launch activities.
Regulations 2.02 and 2.03 specify, respectively, that a launch facility and a launch vehicle “must be as effective and safe for its intended purpose as is reasonably possible” having regard to its design, construction and purpose.  It is not clear what is intended by the word “reasonably” in this context, since what is possible is qualified by the factors of design, purpose and (in the case of a launch facility) construction.  The Committee would appreciate your advice on whether the word `reasonably' is necessary in these two regulations.
Paragraph 2.04(2)(j) requires the holder of a licence to notify the Minister in writing of certain details about employees and deemed employees.  The details include name, qualifications, usual place of residence, and employment history for the past 10 years.  The Committee notes that this reporting requirement covers deemed employees, a category which includes persons who perform a service for the licence holder, and the Committee seeks your advice on whether the Privacy Commissioner was consulted about these requirements and, if so, what the views of the Commissioner were.
The Committee would appreciate your advice as soon as possible but before 10 September 2001 to enable it to finalise its consideration of these regulations. Correspondence should be directed to the Chair, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG 49, Parliament House, Canberra.

Thank you for your letter of 9 August concerning the Space Activities Regulations 2001, Statutory Rules 2001 No. 186, which set out a licensing and safety regime in relation to space launch activities.
In safety regulation, the concept of risks being as low as reasonably possible (or ALARP) recognises that the cost and physical difficulty of avoiding a risk plays a part in assessing whether or not a particular safety management regime is acceptable. This is normally achieved by weighing each opportunity for an incremental reduction in risk against the presumed benefits in terms of avoidance of injury. If it is shown that there is a gross disproportion between the benefit and the cost. the risk reduction being insignificant in relation to sacrifice required to achieve it, the person upon whom the duty is laid discharges the burden of proving that compliance was not reasonable. However, it is ultimately a matter for courts to decide, on a case-by-case basis. whether duty-holders have complied with duties qualified in this way.
Deleting the word “reasonably” would carry the implication that duty holders would have to take all possible steps to reduce or avoid risk, regardless of the cost or physical difficulty involved. This would produce a regime that is impractical, because of the enormous burden it would place on duty holders. Accordingly. it is recommended that the word “reasonably” be retained in Regulations 2.02 and 2.03
You also refer to paragraph 2.04(2)(j) of the Regulations, which requires the holder of a licence to notify the Minister in writing of certain details about employees and deemed employees. This Regulation supports Section 18(e) of the Space Activities Act 1998, which requires that the Minister is satisfied that granting a space licence will not compromise Australia's national security, foreign policy or international obligations. I am advised that discussions with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Attorney- General's Department indicated that information sought by paragraph 2.04(2)(j) was the minimum required to make an assessment and. assure the Minister about such matters.
Officers from my Department consulted the Attorney-General's Department about the Privacy implications of paragraph 2.04(2)(j) of the Regulations and were advised that applicants should be notified of their obligations under the Regulations and that advice be provided on how the Government planned to use the information provided. These matters are addressed in the `Guidelines for Industry on the Space Licence', which are currently being finalised and will become, a public document.
Yours sincerely
Nick Minchin

Dear Minister
Thank your for your response dated 29 August 2001 concerning the Space Activities Regulations 2001, Statutory Rules 2001 No. 186.
The Committee notes your advice that the Attorney-General's Department advised that applicants should be notified of their obligations under the Regulations and that advice be provided on how the Government planned to use the employee information provided. However, it is unclear how this obligation affects deemed employees.
The Committee therefore seeks clarification on whether a deemed employee is made aware at the time that he or she agrees to provide the service that information about them (10 year employment record) will be supplied to the Minister.
The Committee would appreciate your advice as soon as possible but before 17 September 2001 to enable it to finalise its consideration of these regulations. Correspondence should be directed to the Chair, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG 49, Parliament House, Canberra.

Thank you for your letter of 30 August 2001 concerning the issue of privacy concerns for deemed employees under the Space Activities Regulations 2001.
The Space Licence Guidelines, which are to be provided to industry to assist in the preparation of applications for space licences, will clearly applicants of the need to comply with Schedule 3 of the Privacy Act 1988. The Guidelines will further state an applicant must inform employees and deemed employees, at the time of engage of the requirement to provide their personal particulars to the Space Licensing and Safety Office, including their 10 year employment record, as part of the documentation requirements for a Space Licence and that this information may be closed to other government agencies. 
I note that the Guidelines are still in draft form and that they will shortly be circulated to industry for comment. A copy of the relevant section of the Guidelines is attached for your information

6.1 Disclosure of Information
The information contained in the application form and accompanying documents will be used to assist in determining whether the applicant is fit and proper to be involved in activities regulated under the Space Activities Act 1998 and the Space Activities Regulations 2001. The information is required to be collected under the Space Activities Regulations 2001 and may be disclosed to the relevant Commonwealth Departments involved in the assessment of national security, foreign policy or international obligations. The accompanying documents may also be provided to other bodies, such as relevant State/Territory and local governments, for the purposes of obtaining comments on the plans to enable the Minister to assess the application. Failure to provide this information could affect the applicant's eligibility to be granted a space licence or launch permit.
Applicants should be aware of any obligations they may have under the National Privacy Principles set out in Schedule 3 of the Privacy Act 1988.
Applicants are also advised of the need to inform employees and deemed employees at the time of their engagement of the requirement to provide personal particulars to the SLASO, including information on their ten year employment history and place of residence and that this information may be disclosed to relevant agencies as noted above.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Presentation</title>,Notices,8,1

"McKiernan, Sen Jim",ALP,2001-09-26,"—I present the report of the Legal and Constitutional References Committee on the provisions of the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 6) 2001, together with the Hansard record of the committee's proceedings and documents presented to the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I am not going to canvass the contents of the report. It is a very short report. The Senate intervened in the proceedings of the committee's inquiries yesterday and decided that the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 6) 2001 which was under inquiry would be dealt with in the chamber itself. That has happened and there is no need now for me to canvass the contents of the bill, much as I would like to. But time is at a premium, so I am going to resist all temptations to do that. It is appropriate on the occasion of presenting the last report for the year of the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee to put on the record my thanks to my colleagues on the committee who have assisted us in what was a very busy year. In particular I thank the deputy chairman of the committee, Senator Marise Payne, but all other colleagues on the committee who ensured that the deliberations of the committee were thorough and professional and that the witnesses who appeared before us were treated with the respect they deserved. We think that we fulfilled our obligations to the Senate.
I would also at this time pay tribute to the secretariat of the committee. It is not an easy task being a member of a secretariat of a committee which has the task of servicing not only the committee itself but also sometimes the minorities that are contained in the committee. The secretariat that services the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee also services the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, and that has been experiencing an equally busy time with very short turnovers for the presentation of reports. The committee secretariat is led by Dr Pauline Moore and I, on behalf of all committee members—and I am sure on behalf of members of the legislation committee—put on the record our thanks to her and her dedicated team for the assistance and advice they have given to us in the course of this year.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-09-26,"—I would also like to speak to this report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee on the provisions of the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 6) 2001. It is a brief report but it is an important issue both in terms of process and the content of the committee's inquiry and hearing. Firstly, I would like to back up Senator McKiernan's comments and thanks to the committee secretariat for their work throughout the year, including on this last report which was, of course, truncated ahead of time. The final couple of hearings were cancelled, even though they had been organised and booked, I understand. I would also like to pass on my thanks to the committee secretariat and pay tribute to the chair and deputy chair of the committee who, I think, do quite good job, amongst the best that I have had experience of. You can certainly tell the difference between a bad chair and a good chair and bad committee members and good committee members, and the chair and the deputy chair have come out on the good side of the ledger by a good margin. Given that this is the last report of the committee for the life of this parliament, I think that it is appropriate to put that on the record. 
It is also appropriate to put on the record the history of this report. The report is five paragraphs long. The list of people providing submissions is longer than the content of the report itself, I think, which is a bit of an indication of the unusualness of the report. We are debating the report on the legislation after the Senate has actually passed a vote on the legislation, which I think is fairly unusual. I do not know whether it is unique, but it is certainly very rare and it is certainly very undesirable. Indeed, it is probably a bit misleading to say `after' the Senate has debated the legislation because we were stopped from considering it in committee and then we were stopped from debating it in the chamber. We did get a debate on the second readings of the bill but only in conjunction with six other bills; so it was difficult to focus precisely on the contents of just that one bill, although I did do that to some extent and couple of other speakers did as well.
The amendments that I had drafted to the bill were based very significantly on a couple of the submissions that were made to this inquiry. If we had not had the attempt to get this aborted inquiry started, then I probably would not have been able to develop those amendments. Yet even those amendments were not able to be considered; they were just mashed in with every other members' amendments and put as one single vote without any explanation about what they were about. That pretty much symbolises the government's whole approach to this. Let us not forget that this is the government's legislation, and the government should be condemned for it and condemned for every step of the way that they have taken with this. This report, in a sense, is a sad little footnote that symbolises the government's approach to this bill and the whole issue. 
The amendments that the Democrats put forward in the chamber were specifically drawn from some of the submissions that were provided to the committee. That highlights why we do all of this committee work and why we have the secretariat doing what they do and why we use the committee process to save the time of the chamber here. We have lots of complaints from the government that we have got lots of other bills and we cannot spend so much time on the migration bills. We had to spend time on them here because we were not allowed to spend time on them in committee. That is another reason why the committee process is so valuable. We had one hearing which had the department officials, Dr Mathew from the ANU in a private capacity and four representatives from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, including their regional representative. The UNHCR put forward a number of concerns on the bill and I framed a number of my amendments around those. They suggested that the bill would be improved if we did these things and I drafted amendments in response to that. I could not do it through the committee process because our deliberations were cut short by a joint vote of the coalition and the Labor Party. But it is the government's legislation, of course—let that not be forgotten. Without debating the legislation itself—even though I did not get a chance to do that—it is worth highlighting the number of concerns that were raised, including by the UNHCR, which obviously has special expertise in the area of refugees and in protecting the rights of refugees and in ensuring that we do not breach our international obligations and, more importantly, that we do not breach fundamental human rights in sending people back to face persecution. It is a pretty fundamental thing.
I think most Australians, despite some speculation to the contrary at the moment, would not support deliberately, openly and blatantly sending someone back to a situation where they would face serious persecution. We need to consider that in relation to this bill. The UNHCR quite specifically stated that this bill, if passed unamended, could well lead to Australia breaching that fundamental obligation of non-refoulement. This is incredibly serious, and normally the committee would note that in its report and bring that back to the chamber. It would be a serious piece of information for the chamber to consider and it would be taken into account in considering the legislation and any potential amendments. But in a sense, even with the hearing that we had, we were not able to bring that information back to the chamber, because we were not able to present the report and we were not able to debate the bill in detail to provide that information. It was a clear case where, I believe, the Senate voted on something where people did not know what they were doing. I am sure that the government, including the minister in the chamber who had carriage of the bill, did not know precisely what the ramifications were of even this one piece of legislation. 
I would like to thank the people that put in submissions to the committee and made an effort in a very short time frame to provide feedback about potential problems to assist the committee and the Senate in its duty and responsibility to assess the legislation properly, ensure that it did not breach fundamental rights and even ensure that it met the government's suggested policy aims. The policy aims of the government of restricting the definition of `refugee' was not something that I supported, but it was quite clear that the way in which the government was doing this was not even the most effective way. It was done in a way that led to a much higher risk and a much greater probability of going outside our obligations under the refugee convention than the government would like to have admitted.
The organisations and individuals that provided submissions included the Refugee and Immigration Legal Centre; Amnesty International from Queensland; the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ms Helen Finch; Pat Coleman; the WA Amnesty International refugee team; and the Uniting Church in Australia, who have been scathingly critical of this government's legislation and its overall legislative package. In fact, virtually all the mainstream Christian churches throughout Australia have condemned outright, with little equivocation or qualification, this government's approach to this area. This so-called government of Christian values has been repeatedly condemned outright by Christian churches throughout the country for its approach—condemned on moral and ethical grounds, as well as, through submissions such as these, on technical legal grounds. I think the government should stand condemned on that.
—It is interesting that the government members are so sensitive about the facts of the matter being put on the record, even in this situation. They have tried to close down the debate in the Senate so that the public cannot not be made aware of what they are doing and they have tried to stop people being aware of the universal condemnation by church leaders and people with expertise who have looked into the issue in detail—who have moved beyond the cheap, shallow, divisive rhetoric that is ripping our community to bits and actually looked at trying to take a constructive approach. It is that sort of thing—that sort of straightforward approach—the government does not want people to hear.
—You have a shameful poster in your office, and you know it!
—I agree, Senator Ferris, it is shameful and it is a disgrace that we have not been able to properly address this issue. Others that provided submissions included the Maryfields Friary; Ms Rebecca Smith, in a private capacity; Amnesty International Australia; Dr Susan Kneebone; the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, as I mentioned before; and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, another body set up to try and provide protection for individuals and protection of individual legal rights from excessive abuse of power by government. Protecting the rights of individuals from abuse of power by government is the sort of thing that you would think the Liberals would stand up for—but obviously not anymore. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission highlighted some extreme concerns with this bill, as they did with the whole package. Then we had submissions from Dr Mathew and Ms Walker. 
I thank those people for providing submissions. I apologise to them that the committee was not able to consider them fully because of the thuggery of this government in forcing this legislation and the package through without proper consideration. As I said before, this is a dark day for democracy and a particularly bleak day not just for refugees but for many Australian citizens who have had their legal rights fundamentally restricted as a consequence of this and other pieces of legislation that passed this day. I would have said more previously, but I was prevented from doing so.

"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2001-09-26,"—I would like to start my address by paying tribute to the Chair of the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee, Senator McKiernan. I have known him for many years now. He is a fellow senator of yours, Mr Acting Deputy President Lightfoot, from Western Australia. I see in front of me Senator Evans, another great Western Australian. Of all of these great Western Australians, I want to concentrate particularly on Senator McKiernan and pay tribute to him for the way he has led this committee over the last few years. He has produced great reports, and I think the committee as a whole owes him a great deal, as does this chamber and the parliament—and as does Australia.
I also acknowledge Senator Bartlett's efforts, work and drive in this area of migration and the work of other members of the committee: Senator Payne, the deputy chair, who did grand work; Senator Mason, who has now taken over as deputy chair and who has made great contributions to this committee; and Senator Coonan, who brought a very keen and generous mind to the committee.
The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 6) 2001 that the committee was looking at has now passed into law, subject to the Governor-General's action upon it. As has been said, that makes the work of the committee redundant, but perhaps I can say this about the legislation that has passed here today. Parliament is supreme with its legislation in respect of the powers it has under the Constitution. But there is an issue of the separation of powers, and there is an issue of what we do to our courts. The courts underpin the civil life that we all enjoy. The courts have come in for some attack in recent times, particularly in respect of migration legislation, but the courts are made up of outstanding men and women who are dedicated to seeing that the rule of law prevails in this country.
It is a pity that the legislation that was put through today constitutes a massive attack on the judicial quality control that the courts exercise in this area and that they should exercise in this area, because it is important that justice is done, and the courts of this land are noted for that throughout the world. The courts form an institution which protects us all under the rule of law. Parliament certainly must take great account of what the majority says, but the minority has rights. That is what the Ten Commandments are all about: setting out rights that prevail across the whole of society, whether for the minority or for the majority. We as a parliament must take account of not only the numbers but also the morality of the situation. In doing that, we play a part in the way the system works, and the courts are a most central part of that. I want to pay tribute to the judiciary and, speaking for myself, I think it is a real problem that courts have now been largely removed from an area in which they should be allowed to operate.
Perhaps I can also say in that area something about the case which was brought in Melbourne in respect of the Tampa. The boat that was bringing people down to Australia got into trouble and the Tampa picked them up as they came—
—`Ship', more properly.
—from Indonesia. Ship, more properly; Senator McKiernan, thank you for correcting me there. An action was brought in respect of matters involving the Tampa, and some criticism has been made of those who brought the action. They were people from the Victorian bar and the Victorian legal profession generally. As I look down the list, I know many of them and they are most honourable people. I would like to name them all but I have not got time. 
I should point out that I have an interest which I should declare in this. My daughter-in-law Emma Hunt was intimately connected with that case—and so I should state that when talking about this matter—and I should say that, since that case, she and my son Sean have got their daughter, Eleanor, a small kitten. Eleanor is my only grandchild. In any event, the cat she had previously died, and so they got her a kitten, which they have called Tampa. That does indicate that I have a conflict of interest—well, not a conflict of interest but an interest in putting this matter forward.
—A vested interest.
—A vested interest, as Senator McKiernan says. I want to return to the issue of these people who brought this case and the solicitors and the barristers who were involved in it. I want to read a part of the judgment of the Hon. Justice French—a judge, Mr Acting Deputy President, who comes from your proud state of Western Australia. You would of course know that, Mr Acting Deputy President.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—He comes from a fine legal family, in fact.
—Yes, thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. He comes from a fine legal family, as you say. He found against the applicants, those people who were bringing the action in the interests of the people who were on the Tampa. Four judges, as you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, considered this matter. Mr Justice North, a most distinguished judge, was the judge at first instance, who found in favour of the applicants. Then on appeal the presiding judge was the Chief Justice, the Hon. Michael Black, a most highly respected jurist, one respected throughout the common law world, and he found in favour of the people on the Tampa and found on behalf of the applicants in effect. Justice French found against them, but he had this to say—and I think it is proper, especially on a broadcast day, that I read this out:
The counsel and solicitors acting in the interests of the rescuees in this case have evidently done so pro bono.
In other words, they did it for nothing, out of their commitment to justice. Mr Justice French went on:
They have acted according to the highest ideals of the law. They have sought to give voices to those who are perforce voiceless and, on their behalf, to hold the Executive accountable for the lawfulness of its actions. In so doing, even if ultimately unsuccessful in the litigation they have served the rule of law and so the whole community.
Mr Acting Deputy President, as you would expect from people from Western Australia, they understand that, even though a person or a group of people might have been unsuccessful, they ought be acknowledged for the high ideals that they bring to the matter. I see that the yellow light is on and that my time is nearly over, so I will not be able to name them, but I would like to acknowledge those people on both sides—not only the applicants but also those who were responding—but particularly those on the side of the applicants, because they were acting pro bono and were pursuing a great cause. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Calvert, Sen Paul",LP,2001-09-26,"—On behalf of Senator Gibson and the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I present the following report of the committee: Report No. 386: Review of the Auditor-General Act 1997. I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I seek leave to incorporate the tabling statement in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
Madam President, on behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I have pleasure in presenting the Committee's Report No. 386, Review of the Auditor-General Act 1997.
Madam President, the success of Australia's democracy owes much to the ability of the Parliament to scrutinise and hold executive government to account. This is a key feature of successful parliamentary democracies.  
The Auditor-General, as an independent officer of the Parliament, plays a key role in the accountability framework by supporting the Parliament in its scrutiny function.
It is essential that the legislation underpinning the Auditor-General is current and provides the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) with sufficient powers and privileges to scrutinise the administration of government agencies.
The Auditor-General Act 1997 (the Act) came into effect on 1 January 1998. The Act provides for the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit (JCPAA) to examine the budget estimates of the ANAO and to make recommendations to Parliament on the proper resourcing of the office. 
In addition, the JCPAA determines the audit priorities of the Parliament and advises the Auditor-General of those priorities. 
Madam President, the role of the JCPAA provides for a strong and practical relationship between the Auditor-General and the Parliament.
Other features of the Act include a number of provisions which strengthen the Auditor-General's role as external auditor of Commonwealth agencies, authorities and companies and their subsidiaries. 
The Act provides the Auditor-General with a comprehensive mandate to conduct, with some limited exceptions, financial statement and performance audits of all government entities.
In view of the Committee's significant legislative responsibilities to guard the independence of the Auditor-General it was considered timely to conduct a review of the Act. 
The overall finding is that the Act provides an effective framework for the ANAO to carry out its functions. The Committee, however, has identified the following sections of the Act where legislative amendments will provide enhancement:
Section 19 - Comments on proposed reports
Section 19 of the Act provides the framework for ensuring that a proposed report is provided to an agency and, where necessary, persons with a special interest in the report. These groups have 28 days to respond with written comments and the Auditor-General must consider those comments before preparing a final report. Currently there is no provision in the Act which provides for the Auditor-General to circulate extracts of draft reports.
The Committee supports the ANAO proposal that section 19(3) be amended to allow extracts of draft reports to be provided to affected parties. While the Auditor-General currently provides extracts of the report to parties with a special interest, this is done outside the legislative framework and therefore recipients are not subject to the confidentiality requirements of section 36(3).
The major concern raised during the inquiry is whether Parliamentary privilege applies to ANAO working papers and draft reports. Advice from the Australian Government Solicitor concluded that although the `position is not clear, unless and until a court decides to the contrary, the Auditor-General could properly argue that the creation of working papers and the preparation of draft reports are part of proceedings in Parliament'.
The Committee considered that in view of the uncertainty as to whether Parliamentary privilege applies to Auditor-General working papers, draft reports and extracts of draft reports, there should be more examination of this matter. The Committee, therefore, recommended that the Privileges Committees of both the Senate and the House of Representatives examine this matter.
Under section 19(4) recipients of a proposed report have 28 days to provide written comments for consideration by the Auditor-General. The Act does not direct the Auditor-General to include comments provided by recipients of draft reports. The Department of Defence indicated that the fact that the power is discretionary does not give due consideration to the interests of agencies.
The Committee believes and has recommended that the Auditor-General must include recipient comments, in full, in a proposed report.
Sections 32 and 33 - Access Powers of the Auditor-General
Sections 32 and 33 of the Act provide the legislative framework for the access powers of the Auditor-General. 
Madam President, the Committee has long held a view that the Auditor-General's access powers should be increased to include within its scope access to the premises of Commonwealth contractors.
The Committee notes that standard access clauses have been developed jointly by the ANAO and DoFA and are available on the DoFA website.
The Committee considers that the standard access clauses should be included in all government contracts unless there are strong reasons not to. In those cases where government agencies decide not to include in their contracts clauses which give the Auditor-General access to the premises of Commonwealth contractors, then they must account for this decision. 
The Committee, therefore, has resolved that, as part of its power to review and change the Annual Report Guidelines, it will require government agencies to include in their Annual Reports a list showing all contracts by name, value, and the reason why the standard access clause, which provides the Auditor-General with access to the premises of Commonwealth contractors, was not included in the contract.
Section 15
In relation to section 15, the Auditor-General indicated that the requirement to provide a copy of an audit report to the responsible Minister is restrictive in that other Ministers with a special interest in the report cannot be sent a copy. The Auditor-General proposed that section 15 be amended `to allow the distribution of single agency reports to any Minister with a special interest in the report'.
The Committee supports this proposal and has recommended amendments to subsection 15(2) to provide the Auditor-General with the power to provide a copy of a completed report to a Minister who has a special interest in the report.
The Committee is confident that these proposals will enhance the Auditor-General Act 1997 and will ensure that the Australian National Audit Office can continue to perform efficiently and effectively.
In conclusion, Madam President, I would like to express the Committee's appreciation to those people who contributed to the inquiry by preparing submissions and giving evidence at public hearings.
I would like to thank the members of the sectional committee for their time and dedication in conducting this inquiry. I also thank the secretariat staff who were involved in the inquiry: - the Secretary, Dr Margot Kerley, Ms Maria Pappas, Mr Ngan Thai and inquiry secretary, Mr Stephen Boyd. 
Madam President, I commend the Report to the Senate.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2001-09-26,"—I move:
That the Health Insurance (Diagnostic Imaging Services Table) Amendment Regulations 2001 (No. 4), as contained in Statutory Rules 2001 No. 157 and made under the Health Insurance Act 1973, be disallowed.
The opposition has moved to disallow the Health Insurance (Diagnostic Imaging Services Table) Amendment Regulations 2001 (No. 4), because its inquiries indicate that the regulations were made for an improper purpose: they were made by a minister who is determined to take his revenge over the scandal that effectively has ended his career—the MRI scan scam. A few weeks ago, the Minister for Health and Aged Care announced that he would be bowing out of politics at the next election. This came as a surprise to many but it appears that Dr Wooldridge has been unable to go into retirement without taking a parting short at Dr Carr's practice. These regulations can only be seen as an attempt by Dr Wooldridge to use his power as a minister to pursue a personal vendetta against a doctor who blew the whistle on the biggest Medicare fraud in Australia's history. 
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order: is it parliamentary to make accusations of a personal vendetta against one of the most honourable ministers of this government? Should Senator Evans be allowed to make those comments in his speech?
 (Senator Lightfoot)—There is no point of order, Senator Macdonald.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I understood that question time finished at about 3 o'clock. The history of this matter is a little complex but, in essence, on the fateful night of the 1998 budget, there were 59 MRI machines operating and there were another 54 contracts to buy new machines, 33 of which had been signed in the previous six days. The 59 existing machines were never part of what came to be known as the scan scam and no benefit flowed to the operators of these machines from inside knowledge of the minister's decision to include machines under contract in the extension of Medicare rebates.
North Shore Radiology and Nuclear Medicine is a major radiology practice that has operated outside the Royal North Shore public hospital for many years, and is now located inside the new North Shore Private Hospital. It was among the first to get into MRI and bought its first machine in 1991. This machine was still operating and due for replacement in 1998, and the partners ordered a replacement machine some two months before the 1998 budget; they later ordered a second machine to expand their capability, using the new technology of open architecture MRI. These machines were installed in new premises in 1998 and 1999 respectively, and they continue to operate.
In September 1999, the minister was finally forced to act in an attempt to bring the scan scam under control. He set a deadline for submitting statutory declarations if people holding orders wanted to claim that they had a binding contract prior to the 1998 budget. A month later, the minister made another change to try to deal with the mess that he had created. He continued the eligibility of all the machines that had been operating on 12 May 1998 and he revoked the eligibility of all machines installed since the 1998 budget, with three exceptions. They were machines that replaced machines existing before that date—four machines which had been under contract since before 10 February 1998 and three machines contracted after that date but which were in regional towns of high need. This brought the total number of eligible machines to 66, which included the GE Signa Horizon operated by North Shore Radiology. This number increased to 67 earlier this year, when a Perth radiology practice showed that its scanner had been ordered on a contract that replaced a contract signed before 10 February 1998.
On the advice of the Government Solicitor, the government accepted that the machine had to be treated as eligible under the minister's rules. The partners at North Shore Radiology did not submit a statutory declaration for their second machine before the cut-off, and hence it has never been eligible for Medicare rebates. It will not become eligible by virtue of this disallowance. It will remain a private machine. However, the first of the new machines owned by North Shore Radiology had been approved by the Health Insurance Commission for receiving Medicare rebates, because it was a replacement of the original machine installed in 1991. Under the minister's regulations, it was clearly eligible and it has been attracting Medicare rebates since it was installed. This replacement machine is called a GE Signa Horizon MRI and it is the target that the minister has hit with these regulations to punish this particular radiology practice. 
On 4 April 2001, the HIC reviewed its position in the wake of the Perth case and wrote to North Shore Radiology and Nuclear Medicine to say that it no longer believed that the Signa was eligible. It did not give specific reasons for this and did not explain why it had taken the view that this scanner no longer met the requirements. After an exchange of legal letters and the receipt of further advice from the Australian Government Solicitor on 21 June this year, the HIC finally conceded that it had no grounds for removing the eligibility of the Signa Horizon machine at North Shore Radiology under the regulations as they stood. This advice was given verbally in a phone conversation on 28 June and confirmed in writing by a letter dated 24 August. This letter states that the HIC was satisfied that the Signa Horizon had been eligible under the previous regulations since 1 November 1999. However, as a result of the new regulations adopted on 1 July 2001, only those machines listed in the schedule would continue to be able to access the Medicare rebate. In other words, what the lawyers had agreed to was undone by the minister intervening with these new regulations now before the Senate.
There is direct evidence of the minister's personal intervention. Thursday, 28 June was the last sitting day of the budget session of parliament. It was the day that the HIC decided to concede that the Signa Horizon scanner was eligible—and it was on that same day that the minister intervened and overrode this decision. We know all this because we have the benefit of a file note taken by a lawyer at Blake Waldron who discussed the issue with an officer in the Professional Review Division of the Health Insurance Commission. The note makes it clear that the matter has been decided by the HIC but that `upper management' then prevented a letter to this effect being sent. The note quotes a senior officer saying, `The minister wants to be privy to the issues.' In other words, it is transparently clear that the minister is the person driving this regulation. He has decided to adopt it because his previous attempt to exclude this MRI scanner had failed on legal grounds.
The only thing achieved by these regulations is that one particular MRI machine is excluded for eligibility for Medicare rebates. This is achieved by replacing the previous criteria, which spelt out which machines were eligible, with a schedule giving the actual machines and their locations. If the GE Signa had been included on the list, the same 67 machines would be eligible today as they were on 28 June. If this disallowance is carried, it will have no effect on the other MRI machines; it will simply restore the eligibility that the minister took away by regulation on 28 June this year.
The question here I think is: what is the minister's motive? Why has he taken it upon himself to pursue this issue and use any means possible to exclude this one machine? There has only been silence from the minister on this question, but we believe that the answer may well be found in who the leading partner in this practice was at the time of the scan scam. Dr Peter Carr was not only the person responsible for placing the order for this machine, he was also a member of the Royal College of Radiologists negotiating committee and was present at the fateful meeting on 6 May 1998. More than this, Dr Carr also spoke to the Sunday Age, which reported on 27 May 1999 his recollections of the meeting and the fact that he had declared his pecuniary interest because he had two MRI scanners on order from earlier in the year. This was a crucial point because it was the strong corroboration for the fact that the minister had raised at the meeting his intention to extend rebates to machines under order as well as those operating—and this was the key issue about whether or not there had been a leak about the budget decision which had led to so many orders being placed.
The minister tabled two statutory declarations—from a public servant, Ms Penny Rogers, and one of his staff, Dr Rachel David, who both claim that Dr Carr had not made this disclosure. These statutory declarations were later shown to be incorrect on material issues, but the Auditor-General finally reported that he was unable to determine what had taken place at the meeting. The minister escaped with his reputation tarnished, but the crucial proof about what was said at the meeting was never found because there was no tape of the conversation, the department surprisingly took no minutes and there were no other records that came to light. 
Dr Wooldridge recently claimed that he had a photographic memory for facts, citing his ability to remember the names of people he was introduced to at a debutante ball and repeat them in order. However, when it really counted, Dr Wooldridge could not remember who was at the meeting with radiologists or what he told them. His photographic memory suddenly evaporated and his disclosure of budget secrets has been forever clouded in mystery. Hopefully, one day, the truth will emerge—either the participants will break their silence or a new investigation will turn up evidence of what really led to the largest medical fraud in Australia's history.
In this light, it is somewhat less mysterious that the outgoing minister has moved to silence one of the people who could bring his story undone. By acting against North Shore Radiology, the minister is trying to give a message of intimidation to anyone else who dares to speak the truth. This is simply unacceptable and contrary to every principle of ministerial duties. There are no legal grounds for these regulations targeting one particular machine, and any rationalisation provided by the government will be seen for what it is—a continuation of the cover-up of the MRI scan scam.
I therefore ask the Senate for their support for the disallowance of these regulations. While this action will have no effect other than to restore to North Shore Radiology what is rightfully theirs, it is an important principle and it is important that we protect people against misuse of ministerial power. I hope that this vote will remove one of the gags that has kept the truth about the MRI scam from the Australian public.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH INSURANCE (DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING SERVICES TABLE) AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2001 (NO. 4)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,23,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2001-09-26,"—I rise to speak in support of the disallowance motion. These amendments to the Health Insurance (Diagnostic Imaging Services Table) Amendment Regulations 2001 (No. 4) relate solely to the administration of eligible MRI equipment and providers. On 24 August 2001, on the advice of senior counsel, the Health Insurance Commission expressed the commission's satisfaction that the high field MRI scanner operated by North Shore Radiology and Nuclear Medicine met the status required of eligible equipment within the definition of the Health Insurance 1999-2000 Diagnostic Imaging Services Table Regulations effective from 1 November 1999.
However, from 1 July 2001, the regulations were amended to provide that only scanners listed on the schedule to the regulations would be considered eligible equipment for the purpose of claiming a Medicare benefit. The scanner at North Shore Radiology and Nuclear Medicine was then not included in the schedule. However, every other practice with a scanner installed in the practice on budget night 22 May 2001 now enjoys Medicare rebate approval, with the exception of the North Shore practice. 
North Shore Radiology and Nuclear Medicine is a highly respected practice. It provides quality MRI services, with a valuable and full range of MRI studies to both outpatients and sick in-patients at North Shore Private Hospital. This practice has been established for over 10 years and, during that period, many radiologists have been trained at that facility. This disallowance motion will not disadvantage any other MRI providers, and it will in no way disadvantage patients requiring MRI scans. However, the amendment to the regulations do affect the right of North Shore Radiology and Nuclear Medicine to practise their trade with Medicare rebate eligibility. Denying their eligibility to Medicare rebates affects their business and their livelihood. On behalf of Pauline Hanson's One Nation, I support the disallowance motion.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH INSURANCE (DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING SERVICES TABLE) AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2001 (NO. 4)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,23,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,2001-09-26,"—I am not sure whether the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Aged Care will be responding to any of these comments today. I begin by saying that I do not think this is quite a completely black and white issue, but I do not think we can avoid the fact that the original MRI machine had been operating since 1991 and that the debate is over a replacement machine. I also acknowledge the additional information provided by Dr Wooldridge's office. But after trawling through all of that and reading the information and having my staff—and I thank Kerrie Thornton for all of her work on this—meet with the people from North Shore radiology I think it is fairly obvious that either this one has slipped through the net or, as Senator Evans has discussed, there was some question mark as to some relationship between people's membership on a committee and the decision to leave this particular machine off the list. 
The Democrats will be supporting this disallowance motion. It is most unfortunate that this one machine has been somehow—and I leave that for perhaps further explanation from the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Aged Care—overlooked through the process. I acknowledge that there was a third machine involved and that a rebate was asked for. This is a replacement. This has since been withdrawn. So we are basically down to the question of whether it is legitimate that a company be allowed to replace an older machine with one that they described as state-of-the-art. How did this all get mixed up in what became known as the scan scam? And what is the government going to put on the record as their explanation as to why this one odd machine has been left out?
We support the new system that is now in place where we have an open and transparent mapping of where the machines are. We have the demographic information as to how many machines there are per head of population. I draw the minister's attention to my home state, where I know the Queen Elizabeth Hospital is very concerned about their ineligibility. Western Australia is probably the next state that is going to need some adjustment to the access to magnetic resonance imaging. It is a technology that we do not want to deny people who have an urgent need, but it is certainly not one that can spread uncontrolled, otherwise costs will simply blow out of all proportion. This certainly is a technology that needs to be regulated, and we support the new system but not this set of regulations that somehow has avoided listing this one particular machine.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH INSURANCE (DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING SERVICES TABLE) AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2001 (NO. 4)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,23,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2001-09-26,"—Can I, first of all, just say how disappointed I was with Senator Evans's speech, in that in the safety of this coward's castle he chose to make a very personal, offensive, inaccurate and cheap attack on the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Dr Wooldridge. Dr Wooldridge is one of the most successful health ministers this nation has ever known. He is honest, he is committed, he is respected and he has done more for the health of Australians than any other minister in the history of our Commonwealth parliament. I particularly say that as a regional Australian myself and on behalf of rural and regional Australians. The work that Dr Wooldridge has done for country Australians will live long after Dr Wooldridge has left this place. The money and the facilities that he committed to helping people in rural and regional Australia in last year's budget and in this year's budget was, off the top of my head, almost $800 million. That sort of assistance to rural and regional Australia was never thought of by health ministers under the previous Labor government and, I regret to say, under health ministers before the 13 years of Labor.
This regulation is all about ensuring access to MRI services throughout Australia. Before this government acted to put MRI onto the MBS, there were only 18 publicly funded units. The fact that Australians will now have access to 72 funded MRI units, whereas three years ago they had access to only 18, shows that we are committed to improving access to MRI, especially in those areas where it is most needed. The government appointed an independent committee chaired by Professor John Blandford to examine the best way to continue to improve access to MRI. This committee determined that, while access was good with a base of 66 units, there were some areas that were underserviced and in fact needed a MRI unit. The Blandford review decided that the most effective and accountable mechanism to apply the MBS to additional units was the tender process. This process has now been completed and six additional units have been allocated to outer metropolitan and regional areas in Australia: at Liverpool, Penrith, Dandenong, Southport, Nambour and Orange. 
This process has been excellent for patients. The additionally funded units will provide by far the majority of their MRI services at no cost to patients. In its 13 years in government the ALP was completely unable to get the medical profession to agree to this kind of charging policy on diagnostic imaging services. In fact, it did not even try. The independent MRI Monitoring and Evaluation Group that this government has established will continue to work to ensure that other underserviced areas throughout Australia will gain access to MRI. The government is determined to ensure that the recommendations of the Blandford review on the location of machines are not subverted by additional machines being located in places where they are not required—that is, in North Shore. A machine that goes into North Shore is a machine that could have gone into helping country Australians, and I would have thought that Senator Harris might have been interested in country Australians rather than in looking after the North Shore people, who do not really need this.
It is disappointing to me as a country Australian that the opposition parties are combining to defeat this regulation which would have provided additional help for country Australians perhaps in preference to those fortunate people who live on the North Shore. To disallow this regulation would simply result in additional cost to the taxpayer, but of course the Democrats and One Nation, never having any prospect of being in government, do not worry about those things and Labor obviously do not care if they think they can make a political point. I call upon the Senate to put the interests of patients first and allow this regulation.
Before I sit down, I should also mention that Australia has not only been blessed by having such an effective health minister but also been particularly blessed by having the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Aged Care in the form of Senator Grant Tambling. Senator Tambling may not be with us all that much longer, but he has done an outstanding job in his work as parliamentary secretary. In many instances it has had an international flavour. He regularly works on the joint New Zealand-Australian groups that oversee drugs and other activities. Senator Tambling has a justifiably enviable reputation for the work he has done in the field. I guess this week marks the passing of two of the most effective and most dedicated people we have had in charge of health in Australia for a long time.

While you are doing that, perhaps you can explain to me how it is that the government has met all the guidelines, as it claims, despite the fact that a number of schools have been approved as new schools but quite clearly are campuses of existing schools.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2001-09-26,"—Is that the first question?
—I have asked you three questions so far.
—You have not sat down to let anyone answer. In your typical rude fashion, you ask the questions and then do not sit down and allow anyone to answer them. In answer to your question, if needs be I can seek advice from my advisers and answer the questions. I am sure Senator Ellison, who has done a fabulous job in this area for a long time, will be down very shortly. He will probably be able to answer the questions without the assistance of advisers. Until that occurs, I can certainly proceed, with the assistance of the advisers.
It is important to emphasise the work that the Howard government has done in this area, and the work that Dr Kemp has done. He has been a particularly successful minister. Senator Ellison himself did a lot of work in this field, both in his own right in his former portfolio and now in representing Dr Kemp in this chamber. The work that the Howard government has done over a long period of time will help Australia in the future. It will certainly help all those involved in the education system, and that is again something that the Howard government has been committed to doing for a long time. Whilst I would have loved to stand here and answer all the questions in detail, I see Senator Ellison has arrived.

Senator Tambling represents the Northern Territory very well in these aspects and it is going to be a shame and a great sadness to see Senator Tambling go, because the Northern Territory will be all the poorer for his departure and we will miss his good and sound representation. Senator Tambling, you have been a great advocate for the Territory and it is a shame that some people up there do not realise it. We have got very important legislation here—

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2001-09-26,"—I have been trying to be helpful. Senator Macdonald is clearly out of his depth, as usual, and not able to answer very simple questions as to why the government has failed to fulfil its basic obligations under its own guidelines. It has a 330 per cent increase in the appropriations for the payments of new establishment grants for alleged new schools. I asked the minister why this was and he was unable to answer. I asked the minister whether it is true that the guidelines have been fulfilled in all cases and he was unable to answer. 
The last time we were discussing this issue, I raised the question of the Christian College Geelong and I was told by the officers, through the minister, that the available information at the time was that this school had been granted the establishment grants not on its application but automatically. We discovered that there are essentially two components to the guidelines: new schools must be registered and must be genuinely new schools, not existing schools. If they are merely campuses of existing schools, they are not entitled to the money.  
Of course they have to meet certain other criteria apart from state registration and the fact that they are a genuinely new school. They have to be schools that are not for profit and they have to meet certain other requirements for state registration. In terms of the Commonwealth requirements, very little seems to be done. In particular, the question arises as to the capacity of DETYA to make its own investigations of any new group calling itself a new school. I raised the question of the Christian College Geelong and I was told that, on the basis of the information available, they were eligible for the grant. 
It concerns me that there is the Christian College Geelong—which is going under the business name of the Christian College Highton, according to ASIC— and later in the appendices there is an umbrella body of the Christian College Geelong, or the Christian College Highton, called the Christian College Institute of Senior Education. They are both registered in Victoria but the latter is registered as the `Christian College senior campus' on the official forms before ASIC. That is in fact the designation the school gives itself. My reading of the guidelines is that, if a school is a separate campus of an existing school, it is not eligible for money. Why is it, when a school describes itself as a senior campus in its registration forms before ASIC, that it is getting money? That is the question that concerns me. What action was taken by the Commonwealth department to ascertain the veracity of the claims being made that this was in fact a new school? 
I also note that on 31 December 1995, Mr John Enos ceased to be on the board of both the Christian College—which now runs the Christian College Highton—and the Christian College Institute of Senior Education, that on 22 July 2000, Wilga Ruth Morris was appointed to the boards on both companies, and that on 29 August 2001, Mr Albert Ernest Bell of Dimboola became a director of both the Christian College Institute of Senior Education and the Christian College Geelong. We have the same people being appointed to the different bodies on the same days and registered on the official registration processes through ASIC. Mr Christopher Golden became a director of both companies on the same day on 29 August 2001. Christian College Geelong and the Christian College Bellarine have for several years—back to 1997—lodged identical documents with ASIC on the same dates. 
It strikes me that there is a prima facie case according to these documents that they are in fact one and the same entity. Minister, what action did the department take? Given that there are the same personnel involved in both institutions and that one school is registered on the ASIC site as a senior campus of the other, and that the changes that have occurred within the official registration process are reflected in all the various institutes that I referred to—giving the impression, on a prima facie basis, that they are one and the same body, although with separate legal registration—there is no doubt that there is a senior campus operating here of the other institution. I ask the minister: what action did the Commonwealth take to ascertain the veracity of the registration process in Victoria?",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2001-09-26,"—Senator Carr asked about the role of DETYA in relation to examining the funding in that situation. When a new school applies for funding, the Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs assesses the application to see if it meets the relevant legislative and administrative requirements for approval for Commonwealth general recurrent grants funding. There are a number of quite different criteria to be met where a school applies for general recurrent funding as a new school, as opposed to the establishment of a new campus. They include state recognition as a new school, the approved authority being incorporated and the school being not-for-profit. A funding level is also determined for the new school. None of those matters are relevant where an application is for a new campus of an existing school. Because of the funding implications involved, a key focus for the department is whether an application is for a new school or a new campus. Where an application is considered to be for a new campus, the students at the campus continue to be funded on the basis of the existing schools funding level. A new school, however, receives its own level of funding.  
I will deal separately with the cases that Senator Carr mentions. During the course of the hearing by the Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Legislation Committee concerning the reference on the Innovation and Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2001, Senator Carr asked a series of questions about the Christian College Highton and the Christian College Geelong. These questions were taken on notice, and Senator Carr received detailed answers to those questions. In the circumstances, I think that covers the queries that Senator Carr has raised. The Christian College Institute of Senior Education was legitimately approved as a new school and therefore was eligible to receive establishment grants. This decision was made after consideration of a number of factors and on the balance of the evidence available at the time. A further consideration of the case since then has confirmed the original decision to be correct. The application was for a new school, not as a campus of Christian College Highton. It predated any announcement by the government about the availability of establishment grants. It was considered in detail by the department and on its merits to ensure that all requirements under the legislation and guidelines were met. 
I think Senator Carr also mentioned Kewdale college in Western Australia. The Western Australian registration authority recognised Kewdale college as a new school and not as a campus of an existing school. Senator Carr made much of a reference by the school to itself as a campus. While we legislators have great consciousness of the technical meaning of various terms, we should acknowledge that the use of language in relation to schools can be quite flexible. For example, we can refer to a state school, a public school or a government school, and they can mean all sorts of things in different states. In this case, the school, Kewdale, is referred to as being a campus. The language is clearly used loosely because the school's application was for a new school and, on the basis of advice from the Western Australian authorities and the department's own examination, it was a new school.
Recently, the department formally checked with the office of non-government and international education in the Western Australian department of school services. That office has advised that the school at Kewdale went through the full registration process for a new school. In fact, the Kewdale school went through the prior planning process as a new school and the Western Australian minister was satisfied that it had met the various criteria for approval to start up in Kewdale. The school underwent a full inspection of its teachers, curriculum and buildings. This process is much more rigorous to that which applies to the establishment of a new campus.
This sets out quite clearly the rigorous approach that the Commonwealth has adopted and how it works in tandem with the state authorities in relation to the approval of a new school. I think that deals with the question raised by Senator Carr in relation to Victoria and to the Kewdale college in Western Australia.",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2001-09-26,"—I thank the minister for his answer. I repeat, though, that the state registration processes are measuring entirely different things. They are not examining the establishment of a new school for the purposes of a Commonwealth establishment grant. However, the Commonwealth takes it to be the case that mere registration is the start of the process and automatically upon registration, it would appear, the moneys will flow. The Commonwealth takes no independent action to establish the veracity of those registration processes. I have indicated in the case of the Western Australian school that it does refer to itself as a new school, but so does the school in Geelong. For instance, in its latest telephone listing—it is a simple matter: you check the White Pages—it describes its campus as a `senior campus'. These are publicly available documents. It is not just in the ASIC registration; it is on their web site, in the telephone book and in a range of other documents. This suggests to me that very large sums of public money are being expended for a program where the Commonwealth has lost control of the eligibility assessment processes. The Commonwealth office relies upon the states to examine a registration process which is for an entirely different process and purpose.  
—Don't you trust the Labor state of Western Australia?
—This was actually taken before the last election in Western Australia, Senator Ellison. You know only too well that that is the case. It matters little whether it is a Labor state. When it comes to the spending of Commonwealth money, you know that the states are only too happy to spend money. Irrespective of the nature of the political party in office in any of the states, be it in Victoria or Western Australia, the registration process that operates for the establishment of new schools by the states is an entirely separate process to the payment by the Commonwealth of establishment grants. When the Commonwealth relies upon the state processes that are set up for an entirely different purpose, you are making a fundamental administrative error. 
—You did the same thing when you were in government.
—Minister, I put to you that you do not have the capacity any longer because of what you have done to the Commonwealth department of education. You have stripped it, you have ringbarked it and you have gutted it. You have essentially taken away the capacity of the Commonwealth to control the expenditure of its own revenues.
I understand we are under some pressure of time, and I will honour that. We will get this bill through by teatime. Minister, you say that it is a new school—
—Do you support it?
—There are requests here. The request—as you well know, Minister—is that we should have a balanced approach to this. We are seeking that $30 million be spent on government schools, as well as this money. We are saying that, when it comes to expenditure on schools, we have to consider the issue of need. We are not saying that people are not entitled to support from the public purse. What we are saying is that the allocation has to be made on the basis of need. The position the government is trying to present to the public—
—We saw what a bodgie arrangement the SES turned out to be. You have known for six months that the leading authority on the SES has canned your SES model. Dr Ross knows how corrupt it has been. He has been speaking to the department. I see that Mr Evans is in the advisers box. He would know only too well the accuracy of what I am saying. At this point I seek leave to table Dr Ross's report. 
 (Senator Hogg)—Is leave granted?
—The minister is making it available anyway, but leave is granted. He has beaten you to it, Senator Carr.
—I appreciate the minister's generosity in that regard. Dr Ross will be only too happy to hear that his very thorough report has been given such wide coverage. No doubt that is why people write these reports, so that they can be debated—this internal confidential work for DETYA. What he says is that the process is essentially being corrupted, that the existing model for the distribution of moneys is not suitable for the widespread allocation of such large sums of money. He goes on to refer to senior policy makers in the department. In fact, he quotes Dr Kemp as saying:
... inequitable, ... inflexible, .... discourages private investment ...
And so on. Dr Ross goes on to say:
This view of the poor performance of the Education Resources Index may have encouraged the researchers to accelerate the construction and implementation of the SES Index without allowing sufficient time to reflect upon what had already been learned from 25 years of systematic research. 
So the government knows just how bodgie the SES arrangements have been. We have heard today that the government is undertaking its own review of the SES formula. Ms Ann Harding's work in Canberra, the special socioeconomic status consultancy, is the basis for that review. It was commissioned by the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling at the University of Canberra. That is the truth of it, Minister. You are not denying what I am saying. It was commissioned on 1 May this year. That is the basis for the review that you have undertaken. We know the score. We also know what Dr Ross is indicating. You know Dr Ross, don't you, Minister? You were part of the process that established the SES formula. You were the schools minister at the time. You know that he is the pre-eminent authority in this area, both here and internationally. In fact, the Ross indices are named after him. This is the man whose opinions you say do not count for very much.
—I never said that.
—You did not say that? I am pleased that you agree that he is a pre-eminent expert in the field and that his opinions do count for a great deal. When he says that the dimensions of the SES formula were being corrupted, he is right. They have been corrupted by political influences. This brings me back to the point that, when it comes to the payment of establishment grants, the Commonwealth does not have the capacity any longer to determine the veracity of the registration arrangements made by the states. I ask the minister: if you do not have that capacity, do you have the capacity within the department to at least check the Internet sites?
Take the case, for instance, of All Souls St Gabriels School, a new school in Charters Towers. According to its web site, it is having the 25th anniversary of its amalgamation from two separate schools—an event that occurred in 1977. But you say that it is a new school—25 years out of date. If they are having a reunion of all the ex-students of the new school, that is not a bad effort. Minister, can you explain to me why that school gets treated as a new school when it is having a 25-year reunion?",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2001-09-26,"—Senator Carr has referred to All Souls St Gabriels School in Charters Towers, Queensland. It was formerly owned and operated by the Queensland Anglican school system. In January 2000 the system advised the department that it had closed the school and paid out all the staff. It had sold the land and buildings to the Charters Towers City Council and the Dalrymple Shire Council. A new governing body was formed, which entered into an agreement to lease the land and buildings from the Charters Towers City Council and the Dalrymple Shire Council. There was no transfer of assets from the Anglican diocese to the new governing body. The school applied for approval as a new school and was registered as such by the Queensland Office of Non-State Schooling. Senator Carr needs to remember that. It was registered by the Queensland authorities as a new school. While the new school opened on the site of the old school, a new owner had purchased the school and a new company took over the running of the school. You have a situation where the old school was sold and the staff were paid out. There was a complete change in the school. You had the closing down of an old school and the starting up of a new one. The Queensland authorities recognised this as a new school. There is nothing untoward in relation to that.
On the question of the SES funding of the non-government school sector, the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Dr Kemp, released a statement today and also a copy of the Ross report. There was no hiding of this report or running away from it. The minister said:
The new socioeconomic status method of assessing the needs of non-government schools was developed over three years with extensive consultation with all sections of the non-government school sector. It was subjected to rigorous testing, including a large-scale validation exercise, the results of which were published in 1999. The department invited and analysed an alternative method of calculating the SES. When outcomes for the two methodologies were compared, they had a .999 correlation; that is, the outcomes were virtually identical. 
And that is what I said in question time today. The results of that analysis have been released by the minister and the point made by the minister is that this is a complete beat-up by the opposition. It is a shabby attempt to discredit the government's new fair and equitable method of funding for the non-government school sector. As the minister said, the opposition needs to look more closely at the Ross analysis, the outcomes of which are almost identical to those adopted by the government. That is a matter of record.",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2001-09-26,"—Since the minister has been so forthcoming on the question of the Ross report, let me draw the Senate's attention to what it does say, because far be it for me to misrepresent what a pre-eminent statistician like this is saying about what is the cornerstone of the government's allocative mechanism for the spending of $14 billion. I think it is only reasonable. He says the report:
... was accompanied by a great deal of discussion and debate concerning political and financial impacts. In contrast, there appears to have been little or no systematic commentary or debate on the technical issues related to the construction of the SES Index.
What he says is:
... the raw census data `ingredients' that were used to construct the SES Index have been shown on many occasions since the 1970s to provide an excellent information ...
And so on. That is the old ERI. He goes on to say:
The second message is that the formal construction `recipe' that was used to transform raw census data into the SES Index contains major technical errors which include: the use of the wrong units of data analysis, the erroneous application of standardisation procedures; the use of incorrect data element weights, and problems with the choice of census variables and socioeconomic dimensions. As a result of these technical flaws, the SES Index, in its current form, is not suitable for the purpose of guiding large-scale resource allocation decisions amongst Australia's non-government schools.
Unfortunately, it is clear from DETYA's reports, publicity brochures and press releases (concerning a “new approach” to formula funding for schools) that no serious attempt was made to capitalize on widely available knowledge.
He goes on to say:
It is quite significant to note here that the sole source of technical advice for the construction of the SES Index was a university Faculty of Medicine and not a Faculty of Education. 
Of even greater concern is that the researchers involved in the construction of the SES Index appear to have overlooked high-quality State government reviews and extensive public consultations (for example, Ministry of Education, Victoria, 1990) and also to have completely missed opportunities—to profit from research advances in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the USA, and the UK that have used more holistic analyses of educational need for the design of school funding formulae.
He also says, and this is quite tragic really when you think about the implications of it:
However, it is widely known that senior decision-makers considered that the Educational Resources Index had a number of deficiencies ...
He then quotes Dr Kemp. Then he goes on:
This view of the poor performance of the Education Resources Index may have encouraged the researchers to accelerate the construction and implementation of the SES Index without allowing sufficient time to reflect upon what already been learned from 25 years of systematic research.
That is essentially what we have been saying right through this state grants debate. I have to ask myself: how is it that the officers in the Commonwealth department of education allowed this to happen? Why didn't they say to the government or the Senate estimates committee, `Look, we've got some pretty serious concerns about this based on the information we have available'?
Quite clearly, the government has been engaged in a major cover-up. It has had this report for over six months; Dr Ross, I would expect, has been making comments to the department for a considerable period longer than that, given that he is such a pre-eminent authority in this area. I think we are entitled to ask: why is it that the political intervention by this government to manipulate—what Dr Ross describes as `to corrupt'—this formula, this allocative mechanism, was allowed to proceed?
The Labor Party and the Democrats have clearly identified, in the process of examining in the committee this particular measure, that there were serious problems because it did not reflect the real needs of Australian children. We understood just how serious it was. But of course the department and the government have maintained throughout that they have produced this perfect model. Their own experts have blown the gaffe. The truth is out there. It is up to—I presume—the government to come clean on the extent of the review that they have now undertaken of the SES model and the extent to which they intend to change the funding mechanisms and the allocations to schools over the current quadrennium. If they know that the system is really crook, what action are they taking to address it? I would be surprised if there are not proposals floating around to change the allocations. That is clearly something we want to have some answers on. 
But we are discussing that in the context of this particular bill. If I ask, Minister, perhaps you can give me some advice about another school according to these guidelines. It is the Murdoch College in Western Australia. This is the new school of the campus of the Murdoch University, jointly owned by the university in a commercial company, Alexander Education Group. It has been established by the Murdoch University for commercial gain and caters largely to overseas students. I understand that it has about 100 students from Australia enrolled in it but it is essentially established for commercial gain. Murdoch University has, we all know, been obliged to turn to various commercial and profit making ventures because of the cuts that have been imposed on higher education by the Commonwealth government. This particular operation is one of them. Within the guidelines, I understood that schools were supposed to be operating on the basis that they were not for profit. Why did this particular entity receive assistance?",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2001-09-26,"—I thought we dealt with this the other day.
—No, not this one.
—We certainly dealt with the question of not-for-profit. In relation to Murdoch College, I do have some information and we are just getting that now. Certainly, as I said the other day, one of the criteria is that the school cannot be run for profit. The question that has been raised by Senator Carr is: have establishment grants been paid to schools that are run for profit? He cites Murdoch College as an example. The Commonwealth schools legislation stipulates that schools funded must not be conducted for profit. The department requires the approved authority of each applicant school to provide a copy of its constitution to ensure that this requirement is met.
Many schools have some activities which generate a financial surplus. For example, a large number of schools provide education for overseas students and make a surplus on this activity. This is in line with the Commonwealth's policy of fostering the export of Australian education. For schools to become involved in exporting education from this country is entirely good news for Australia. If they have a surplus from that, all the better. This is in line with the Commonwealth's policy of fostering export of Australian education, as I say again. The making of a surplus is acceptable under Commonwealth schools guidelines, as long as that surplus is used within the school and not for the benefit of individual members.
Overseas students are quarantined from Commonwealth general recurrent funding. The constitution of Murdoch College in Western Australia was examined to ensure that this requirement was met. At the 2001 schools census day Murdoch College had 304 overseas students. It also provided school education for 167 local students. What I have seen myself is that there have been schools which have charged fees for overseas students, and as a result of the surplus that is derived from that they can pass on the benefits to local students. I have seen that in regional Victoria, where it worked very well at one school I went to. The success that the school had with overseas students could be passed on to the benefit of local students who came from regional Victoria. I would hope that you would not disagree with that as being a good idea, because it allows equity in relation to education and the benefits from this to be passed on to Australian students.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2001-09-26,"—I take it from what you are saying that the department has undertaken an audit of the school. Has the department undertaken an audit of this school to establish the veracity of the statements you have just made or are you relying upon alternative sources of advice? I will ask you some specific questions. You have acknowledged that the guidelines require the school to be operating on the basis of not-for-profit—you are now defining a surplus as not-for-profit, which is an interesting concept in itself. Can you confirm the school is jointly owned for a profit company, Alexander Education Group? Is it the case that the Alexander Education Group has set up a new upper secondary school in Western Australia, the Alexander Institute of Technology? They did so this year. Did this school—and I ask specifically—receive an establishment grant? I understand the answer is no. What I would really like to know is, if you could confirm it for me: did this school apply for one? If it did, why did the Murdoch College receive an establishment grant and not the other institute? I will come back to the original question: did the department undertake its own audit to establish the veracity of the claims you have made in regard to the operation of this school?",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2001-09-26,"—The financial accountability for establishment grant funding is the same as that required for general recurrent grant funding, but the grants of course are separately accountable. That is, the approved authority of the school must furnish the secretary of the department, on or before 30 June of the year following the relevant program, a certificate signed by a qualified accountant stating that an amount equal to the amount or sum of the amounts provided under the agreement and paid for the year has been spent or committed to be spent in respect of that year for the purpose or purposes for which it was granted, namely, to assist new schools with their recurrent costs incurred in their formative years and to enable them to be more competitive with existing schools.
In terms of educational accountability, the approved authority must agree to do each of the following not later than a date or dates determined by the minister for the purposes of each paragraph: participate in the preparation of an annual report; provide to the minister for inclusion in that report matters addressing the requirements for performance information; provide the minister a report of the kind required by the minister in relation to programs of financial assistance covered by the agreement; and participate in the evaluation of the outcomes of those programs of financial assistance. You have here an accountability which would flush out any aspect of the school running for profit.
I have mentioned that the school might have a surplus in relation to overseas students. That is fine, so long as it is put back into the school. I mentioned one example in Victoria where that surplus goes to the benefit of local students in regional Victoria. That is within Commonwealth government policy. These accountability mechanisms are stringent and, we believe, appropriate in keeping a check on whether these schools are running for profit.",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2001-09-26,"—The answer to my question is that the government have not undertaken an audit. Under the requirements of the guidelines, the school will send them a note from an accountant to say that the money is going to be spent in accordance with the guidelines and that it will be spent for recurrent purposes. What is the checking mechanism? What is the great accountability mechanism that we are now asked to take notice of? The school writes a letter to the department and says, `Yes, of course we're following the guidelines and we will spend it accordingly.' If they want to spend it for recurrent purposes or as part of the salary package for the principal—he wants to buy a new suit or a new car—that is consistent with the guidelines. 
Here is a clear case that is not consistent with the guidelines. Murdoch College is jointly owned by a for-profit company, Alexander Education Group. The government acknowledge that it makes a profit. They acknowledge that it has over 300 international students on the site and a little over 100 domestic students. It is a for-profit school; it is clearly outside the guidelines. No procedure was undertaken by the department to audit those arrangements. The college has received eligibility for an establishment grant, and the department has no capacity or opportunity under this government to properly check the facts. The department relies upon a statement from an accountant. This is the mentality that cost us HIH, this is the mentality that cost us Ansett—relying upon an accountant to tell you that you are doing the right thing. What an extraordinary approach to public administration. 
Take a school like Hills Montessori School in New South Wales. It was first registered, according to the New South Wales Board of Studies, in February 1998. It was reregistered in 2000. In March 2001 it advertised in the Internet edition of the newsletter Melbourne Child a tea party for former students and their parents to celebrate its 20th anniversary. The New South Wales Board of Studies says that it always registers developing and new schools for a limited period of one to two years and then it reregisters those that pass muster. This process can be repeated several times for particular schools. How can a school that was registered in 1998 but was operating for many years prior to that regard itself as a new school? 
I understand that there are similar practices in other states and territories. This exposes the flaw in the whole federal approach, where the government says it relies on the states to tell it whether or not eligibility requirements are met for Commonwealth programs. There is an inherent deficiency in that approach. 
I also draw your attention to Brighton Montessori School in Victoria. Apart from the fact that it is in Dr Kemp's electorate, it has existed for 23 years. It is largely a preschool, outside of the guidelines; it has only 32 school-age enrolments. It was first registered in Victoria in February 1999. Did it receive an establishment grant? Yes. Was the department aware that it had been operating for 23 years? Was it an extension of existing provisions for a preschool? Minister, what are the circumstances surrounding the two schools I have just mentioned? Given that we are running out of time—
—There was Hills Montessori—what was the other one?
—There were two schools: Hills Montessori in New South Wales and Brighton Montessori in Victoria. While you are looking for information on those, I will draw your attention to Somerville Baptist College in Western Australia—another campus auxiliary of Murdoch University.
—Give the Baptists a break—poor old Baptists!
—I am just making a point, Minister. This is not confined to one group or one state. Riddled through this department is a level of incompetence that is really quite extraordinary. Why is this the case? Because you have run the department down to the point where it is a mere shadow of its former self. It no longer has the capacity to protect the Commonwealth revenues for these important programs. Consequently, last year in October the department realised it did not have enough money from the appropriations. It told the minister, and the minister chose to do nothing about it. The government prepared new legislation instead of amending the legislation that was before the parliament at the time. To cover up the mistake, it tried to bundle the legislation all together in an omnibus bill, hoping that we would not notice a 330 per cent increase in the appropriation and, furthermore, that we would not notice the extraordinary number of schools that, prima facie, are way outside the guidelines. Presumably, money was declared to be available to them when the money was not in the kitty.
So we have two problems: we have had a sudden explosion in the number of non-government schools, and the average size of the schools has doubled. There has been an extraordinary increase in the number of new schools that are seeking additional moneys, and the department is unable to check the basic facts—not able to check the telephone book, not able to check ASIC, not able to check fundamental public documents that are available—which seem to be in sharp contrast to the opinions given to them by the states. 
I have mentioned the Somerville Baptist College in Western Australia; I understand that it is a campus auxiliary of Murdoch University and is a further spin-off from an existing school. It shares the same buildings and facilities as the Winthrop Baptist College—again, outside the guidelines. The Western Australian education authorities were only too happy to provide this information to me; were they able to provide it to the department? Did the department seek advice on these issues? The Western Australian education authorities are only too happy to tell anyone who asks them that Somerville Baptist College is not really a new school. Has the school applied for recurrent funding? Has the school been made eligible for an establishment grant? If it has not, please explain to us why this school falls outside the category when so many others do not. I have 10 minutes or so left, so I will go through a list of schools and perhaps you could give me a response to them.
The next one I would like to ask you about is the Galilee Day Program, a school that operates in the Australian Capital Territory. It was defunded; it became part of a private operation under contract to the ACT education department. As I understand it, it provides services to students who are already enrolled in the ACT government school system. It has five enrolments. Was this school eligible for funding under the establishment grants program?
Another one while you are looking that up is the ninth one I would like to raise today, and there are many, many more. I am just putting a sample to you to indicate what I see as a serious problem, a serious deficiency, within the public administration of education in this country. The Southside Educational Centre in Queensland is a private provider. It has provided services to the Queensland education department. It seems to have a very similar structure and arrangement to the Galilee Day Program in the Australian Capital Territory. The Southside Educational Centre has eight branches, including the particular one in Queensland I have referred to here. It is listed on the Queensland education department web site as a private `provider providing alternative education' under its PPAE Program. This program provides, according to the web site, `educational programs for students on or at risk of suspension' in Queensland state schools. The question is not whether or not it is a worthy institution and not whether or not it is doing a good job, Minister; it is whether or not it is eligible for access to this particular program. I am told that this particular institution provides services including those for profit; that is, as a private school. It is also a TAFE college and training provider. I understand it has an enrolment of 42 in this particular case. Minister, is that school eligible for moneys? Has it applied? Will it, according to this legislation, be receiving grants under the operation of the existing administration guidelines?
I come back to this simple point: has there been any discussion with the states as to whether or not the state registration process is actually designed to recognise a new school as a new school or otherwise, or is it a device that is actually used for the states' purposes? Given that the states are so disinterested in whether a school is new or some other entity, has there been any discussion with the Commonwealth about finding a new mechanism to establish the bona fides of these schools in terms of the Commonwealth guidelines?

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2001-09-26,"—At the outset I table two documents—Farish response to Ross draft paper and SES Simulation Project: Validation Report—both of which comprehensively debunk Senator Carr's argument in relation to his attacks on the SES method of funding. I will now turn to the questions that Senator Carr raised in relation to a number of schools. Firstly, in relation to Somerville Baptist School in Western Australia, Senator Carr was making much about this not being a new school and he asked if it had got funding. I am advised that the school is not eligible for establishment grants, and I think that takes care of Senator Carr's inquiry in relation to that school. It has not been given the establishment grants, and that is the end of the matter there. 
Hills Montessori School, New South Wales: it is alleged that this is an extension of an existing preschool. The New South Wales Department of Community Services registered Hills Montessori School as a preschool. It subsequently applied to receive Commonwealth general recurrent funding as a primary school. Hills Montessori School was approved as a new primary school for receipt of Commonwealth recurrent funding from 1 January 2000, having been registered by the New South Wales Minister for Education and Training to provide school education from kindergarten to year 2. Hills Montessori School may have been in existence for some time as a preschool, but it was first approved for Commonwealth funding as a school in the year 2000. State registration of preschools is under different legislation to the registration of schools.
Senator Carr mentioned three other schools—Galilee, Southside Educational Centre and Montessori Brighton. I understand that the Galilee Day Program was registered as a special new non-government school in 1999. It was not previously registered as a school in the ACT, and therefore that clarifies the position. We are obtaining further details on the other two schools that Senator Carr mentioned. The Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs, as part of its scrutiny of these schools, also provides random checks of them and actually sends in its officials to conduct those. That is not an unreasonable method of checking up on schools. I reject entirely the allegations of any negligence or unprofessionalism which have been levelled against the department by Senator Carr. The other questions we are taking on notice, and we are trying to get those details for Senator Carr.",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2001-09-26,"—I was not going to make a contribution to this stage of the debate but I feel moved to respond to the report that I have just been given copy of, which was tabled earlier by Senator Carr and the minister. I must say I am not surprised that this report has been written and provided to the department, but I am surprised by the minister's ready dismissal of it. It is a scathing report. It points very much to departmental incompetence and to the ready acceptance by the minister of that incompetence in the name of pursuing an ideological position in the shortest possible time.
We are not surprised because we could see, when the bill was first shown to us, that this was a flawed model. I would also like to say that this is a sort of cover-up of major proportions that I have not struck in legislation that I have dealt with in the past, and I think that is worth remarking upon. This is the second last day of sitting, if we are to believe what is said about the next election, and it is probably the last opportunity for us to quiz the minister on this report. I would like to ask what the minister intends to do. I note he has tabled some other documents. Obviously there is not time today for us to read those documents, and I would ask specifically: how are the minister and the department responding to the specific and very strong criticisms in this document? Will we see a document which, line by line, answers those accusations which have been made? I regard this as a very serious matter indeed, and I would like to hear the minister's answer—not just some other document that says the SES is fine but a detailed response to this report.",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2001-09-26,"—I understand the minister has tabled his response in the other place. The situation, as I said at question time, is that the department will continue to monitor the ongoing implementation of the new SES funding for non-government schools. What I said earlier, Senator Allison, was that the outcomes in relation to the assessment of the different methodologies were very close indeed. When the outcomes for the two methodologies were compared they had a 0.999 correlation; so they were virtually identical. There may be other comments made in that report, but what the minister is saying is that, when you look at the upshot of it all, the results of the analysis are very close. The Farish response, which I have just tabled, deals with the Ross draft paper in quite a detailed and comprehensive fashion, some four pages of analysis, and I think that in the circumstances I could not be fairer than that.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2001-09-26,"—I thank the minister for this response, although I have not had a chance to read it yet. It seems to me that, if you have a flawed process and if by luck or by chance at the end of that process it turns out to be a similar answer to what might have been arrived at by a correct procedure, it is still not adequate. I would ask the minister to give the chamber some undertaking that there will be a serious review of this situation. I remind the chamber that when we debated the states grants legislation in December last year the Democrats had already been told by numerous people that in the non-government sector as well as the government sector this would likely deliver some very strange anomalies. That is in fact what has happened. For that reason, we moved an amendment which would have delayed the implementation of this model for 12 months, during which time an independent body—we suggested a national schools board—could examine the model and look at it in terms of its effectiveness as well as the related equity issues. Had the ALP supported us in that amendment, we would not be in the mess that we are in today. 
We are facing another flawed aspect of this legislation in the establishment grants. The Democrats voted against the whole bill the last time we dealt with it. We will continue to vote against this legislation. However, we will support the ALP request. We think that, if we are going to be saddled with this inequitable piece of legislation, we should garner some extra funds for government schools which badly need capital works. I keep going into schools that have got falling-down classrooms and portables and totally inadequate equipment. So $30 million—whilst I think that is about $100 a student in the government sector—is not to be sneezed at because a few schools will be able to benefit. I say again how disappointing it is that we in this place have to deal with legislation which is so seriously flawed.",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2001-09-26,"—I certainly will convey Senator Allison's comments to the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs when I take the matter up with him. There are no plans for any formal review at this stage. It would be unwise to do so because we had a comprehensive review of the funding for non-government schools with the review of the ERI system. If you announce any further review, you would introduce more uncertainty. The non-government school sector is only just getting used to the new system. I think we have in place a system which has been welcomed by the non-government sector and one which is much more equitable and fair. It really hits the target. We certainly do not want to get in the path of having another review. That, no doubt, would be very favourable to Senator Carr from the Labor opposition. They have got so many reviews on the agenda now. I think it is up to 160 reviews or committees that they have announced. 
We grasped the nettle and we set about bringing in a new SES method of funding for the non-government school sector, and it has been widely welcomed. There have been great reforms in education under the stewardship of Dr Kemp. We believe that you need to provide clear direction for people in education and having this review upon a review would just bring in more uncertainty.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2001-09-26,"—Minister, is the government intending to divide on the motion to put these requests or can we take it as read that the support is here for those requests to be carried? You are not going to divide?
—No.
—If that is the case, I will then sum up. I do notice the Farish comments. Dr Kemp has today circulated some comments regarding the government's response to this damning critique by Dr Ross, the internationally renowned expert, whose report The right ingredients but the wrong recipe has clearly demonstrated just how manipulated the SES formula has been. I also note that Dr Ross draws to our attention that it is important to note that the Farish response is taken from a university faculty of medicine, not a faculty of education. That in itself, I would have thought, is an interesting observation in formulating a model that is obviously of such critical importance. 
If we do proceed with the request now, can we get an undertaking that the answers that the government has taken on notice will be given to the opposition by tomorrow? I know that it might take you a little time overnight to establish that. Is that the case, Minister? Is it possible to secure that?

I will take that in the manner in which you have presented it. Obviously, tomorrow we will have an opportunity to reconsider this bill when it is bounced back from the House of Representatives. The opposition will maintain its position on this request. 
There is nothing more important than the education of our children. That is a pretty fundamental principle. We argue that it is through the school system that children grow up and it is at school that they discover themselves and become adults, that at school children learn about the world and their place in it, that schooling is central to the lives of young people and that the policies that underpin schooling shape their experience. School is a place in which values are transmitted. It is incredibly important to the social system and, in fact, to the reproduction of our society. Schooling, as all educators know, has the potential to transform society and to transform individuals.
Australian children are entitled to the full support of this parliament. We have an obligation as legislators, and we have an obligation to Australia's teachers and to parents, citizens and taxpayers. All of those things come together to the point where we have important responsibilities to examine the legacy of schools education that we are leaving behind. The Labor Party say that our commitment is to a universal, comprehensive public education system, and we are also committed to ensuring that people have access to public resources if they want to send their children to non-government schools. But the funding should be allocated on the basis of need.
Knowledge Nation argues that we have an obligation to fulfil that basic commitment to ensuring that our schools do provide centres of excellence, that they are genuinely universal and that they are able to provide genuine quality for every child. Everyone ought to have a fair go. This government, on the other hand, is about ensuring that there is a disproportionate share of public resources going to the already wealthy. It is a very unfair, very unjust and extraordinarily divisive policy. Our request is that there be an additional $30 million for public education to even up the score a bit, to provide some balance in the funding policies of schools. Many might argue that that is not sufficient. That is an instalment. We ought to make sure that this parliament makes a commitment to the children of this country to provide a balanced and fair approach to schools funding. It is on that basis that I have moved this request. I trust the chamber will support it. I hope that the government will see the wisdom of supporting this request when this matter is sent back to the House of Representatives.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2001-09-26,"—in reply—I draw the Senate's attention to the motion—we were slightly distracted earlier today—which is to disallow Health Insurance (Diagnostic Imaging Services Table) Amendment Regulations 2001 (No. 4). Debate followed about the attempt to remove, from one MRI machine, eligibility to access Medicare rebates. I do not want to delay the Senate very long in reply except to say that I urge the Senate to support the motion. I also urge those who have an interest in this matter to read the government's defence—because there was none. There was a very colourful tribute to the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Dr Wooldridge, but there was no attempt at all to justify what clearly was an act of vindictiveness: to remove eligibility from a particular MRI machine and so affect the viability of the business of this individual, Dr Carr. No justification at all has been given for this change to the regulations that would deny that MRI machine and that practice access to Medicare rebates and it seems to have been attempted for purely personal, vindictive motives. So, as I say, the defence, if you can call it that, was quite telling in that no argument was advanced in defence of these regulations. I commend the disallowance motion to the Senate. As I say, I think the government's position confirms the need for us to pass this disallowance motion and ensure that fair treatment is meted out to that particular radiology practice.

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2001-09-26,"—The opposition supports the Royal Commissions and Other Legis--lation Amendment Bill 2001. The Royal Commissions and Other Legislation Amendment Bill is intended to ensure that royal commissions can provide information regarding possible contraventions of a law to the agencies responsible for the administration of that law. Specifically, that would include agencies such as the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. The bill is also intended to ensure that royal commissions are able to obtain information from ASIC and AUSTRAC. Royal commissions are interesting creatures. They are literally an exercise in executive power to establish inquiries to advise the executive branch of government on particular policies that should be implemented to address issues that they have identified or to refer, as this bill will do, matters to relevant law enforcement agencies for prosecutions to occur. It is important that the context of how royal commissions collect their evidence and how they liaise with other agencies is clear. 
To a degree, royal commissions and commissions of inquiry have the power to compel witnesses to answer questions and produce documents. While the executive may establish royal commissions, the executive cannot confer these powers unilaterally. They must be conferred by statute and are therefore subject to restraints on legislative power. Historically, evidence given to a royal commission was presumed to be admissible in subsequent legal proceedings. However, it may be more accurate to say that the issue turns upon the wording of the relevant act. 
Currently, the Royal Commissions Act states that evidence is not admissible against a witness who has appeared before a royal commission `in any civil or criminal proceedings in any court of the Commonwealth, of a state or of a territory'. In this context, civil or criminal proceedings includes administrative proceedings such as those conducted by agencies like the ACCC or ASIC. The prohibition against the use of compelled evidence in any civil or criminal proceedings is a significant limitation not only on the courts but also on the royal commissions themselves. It poses a significant obstacle to any government that seeks to prosecute conduct that is discovered as a result of the activities of a royal commission. It effectively prevents a royal commission from investigating matters that may form the basis of subsequent civil or criminal proceedings. In the context of the collapse of the HIH Insurance group, it is important that the parliament sorts this matter out. Not surprisingly, the origins of this bill are closely tied to the unwinding of the former insurance giant HIH and the response of the Commonwealth government to the problem.
In February this year, the HIH Insurance group started to come to pieces. It was forced to disclose to the market some of its serious internal problems. On 27 February 2001, ASIC announced that it was conducting an investigation into HIH's market disclosures. Trading in HIH shares was suspended on that day, and has not resumed since. Since announcing its initial investigation, ASIC broadened its investigation to cover other potential breaches of the Corporations Law. Importantly, ASIC had decided to look at whether HIH had been trading while insolvent and also whether any of the directors had breached their duties. 
The opposition maintained from the outset that what was required of the HIH disaster was a royal commission to be promptly established. There is no doubt that HIH has been the biggest corporate collapse in Australia's history. Its losses are estimated to be up to $5 billion—not million but billion. HIH creditors may also face up to a two-year wait for interim payments. At first the government resisted opposition calls for the establishment of a royal commission into the collapse of the HIH Insurance group. The government argued that the Australian Securities and Investments Commission could properly investigate the matters. 
It was not until a controversy arose regarding the fact that the Chairman of ASIC, Mr David Knott, was also on the board of APRA, the body whose task it was to regulate and oversee the insurance industry, that action was taken. On Monday, 18 June this year, the Prime Minister finally announced the establishment of the HIH royal commission. The commissioner, Justice Neville Owen, started his work on 1 September 2001, some six months after the collapse of HIH. The stated purpose of the royal commission is to `Inquire into the reasons for and the circumstances surrounding the failure of HIH prior to the appointment of the provisional liquidators on 15 March 2001'. The opposition has made it clear that, while it supports the terms of reference, it was concerned by the delay in commencing the royal commission. The opposition was also concerned that there was no specific term of reference relating to the hundreds of thousands of dollars HIH donated to the Liberal Party over the last five years.  
The royal commissioner's terms of reference revealed underlying concerns regarding the overlap and possible conflicts in the powers and functions of the royal commission and the HIH investigation. The terms of reference expressly noted that ASIC was `also investigating certain matters surrounding the failure of HIH'.
—I'd like to make a speech about this.
—Would you? Let me then draw my remarks to a conclusion. Let me just finish this point, if I may, because I think it is an important one. I said that the terms of reference expressly noted that ASIC was `also investigating certain matters surrounding the failure of HIH'. They also required the commissioner, Mr Justice Owen, `to the extent practicable', to cooperate `with ASIC', avoiding `duplication' of ASIC's investigation and any adverse impact on any civil or criminal proceeding arising out of ASIC's investigation. I commend the bills to the chamber and I am sure my colleague Senator Faulkner will speak on this matter as well.",SENATE,<title>ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2001-09-26,"—I was drawn to make a contribution in this debate on the Royal Commissions and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2001 because of those words of Senator Cook. I commend the speech that he has delivered to the Senate. It was one of the more insightful second reading debate speeches that I have heard in this chamber, and I thank him for the comments he has made. I thought it might be useful for me to pick up where Senator Cook left off. After all, it is worth looking at one of the more thoughtful analyses that has been made of how the different inquiries in the HIH collapse will work together. I suspect that is where Senator Cook may have taken this issue.
Stephen Donaghue is a respected legal commentator on royal commissions. He is a barrister from Victoria and has also recently written a book on royal commissions, titled Royal Commissions and Permanent Commissions of Inquiry. On 20 June 2001, in an article in the Age newspaper, Stephen Donaghue noted: 
If [ASIC] lays charges, the [royal] commission will not be permitted to use its coercive powers to question any witnesses against whom charges have been laid, because such questioning (even in private) would constitute contempt of court. The laying of charges would therefore seriously impede the commission's ability to conduct its own investigation. If ASIC delays the decision to lay charges, it will become harder to obtain a conviction when charges are eventually laid. That is because answers or documents a witness is required to give to a Royal Commission cannot be used against that witness in subsequent court proceedings. This protection is significantly wider than the protection that operates during ASIC investigations.
Mr Donaghue's argument in the Age was that a royal commission, as an instrument of the executive, cannot interfere with a civil or criminal proceeding being undertaken by the judiciary. Further, Mr Donaghue was concerned that there is a statutory requirement that evidence given to a royal commission cannot be used against the witness in any subsequent civil or criminal proceedings.
The opposition shares those concerns and is not convinced that the government has fully dealt with these matters in the amendments it has moved to its own bill. Arguably, the government's amendments will ensure that the HIH royal commission will have the power to discover the truth in relation to the HIH collapse while allowing ASIC to pursue civil prosecutions, the more common and more successful elements of corporate regulation. However, we are concerned that the amendments in relation to possible criminal prosecutions are not sufficiently targeted. Public interest in the administration of justice arguably requires that evidence relating to criminal liability should be admissible for certain limited purposes. Time will tell whether the government has established the right framework for dealing with these matters. 
There is clearly a need for cooperation between ASIC and the HIH royal commission. A link between ASIC and the HIH royal commission would enable information to pass readily between the bodies, facilitating both inquiries. Importantly, this bill deals with the transfer of such information. Nevertheless, it is unclear how both inquiries will operate effectively and avoid any problematic overlaps. As a practical matter, the paths of the ASIC investigation and the HIH royal commission are likely to cross at some point in the future. It may not be sufficient simply to permit the bodies to exchange information or to direct Justice Owen to conduct the commission with a view to avoiding adverse impacts on subsequent civil or criminal proceedings. Nor would it seem to be sufficient for governments to issue simultaneous letters patent.
The possibility of conflict between the inquiries and the implication that the HIH royal commission could raise more issues than it resolves is significant—particularly because the costs associated with the conduct of the commission could be well over $10 million in total. Some have estimated that the cost could run as high as $20 million.
Regrettably, the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation has not addressed some significant concerns in relation to the HIH collapse. These include concerns over the staffing of APRA, the ratios of liabilities to assets of insurance companies, and what the minister was advised regarding the capacity of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. There is no doubt that public confidence in the insurance industry and in the proper, objective, fair administration of this sector has been tarnished by the perception that substantial political donations from HIH to the Liberal Party may have influenced the consideration that they obtained from the executive arm of government—whether it be APRA, the department or the minister's office. I understand that those allegations will be vigorously denied, but the point I am making is that there is a public perception that that may have been the case. 
The public perception that that may have been the case is as concerning as the actuality. I refer, for instance, to a series of headlines that have appeared in newspapers. The Sun-Herald of 20 May 2001 stated, `Party cash in link to gong,' which referred to the HIH founder, Ray Williams, receiving an Australia Day honour in circumstances where HIH had contributed to the Free Enterprise Foundation. There was reference in that article to the contribution by HIH of some $696,000 over the years to the Liberal Party. I acknowledge that the minister says that that did not influence their treatment, according to law. But, nonetheless, there is a substantial question that needs to be answered. The Sunday Mail on 20 May 2001 reported: 
Australian Electoral Commission records show HIH Insurance also handed over almost $800,000 directly to the Liberal Party from 1996 to 1999.
So there is a substantial issue: did the lack of scrutiny, at least in part, result from preferential treatment because of political donations? I state that as a question rather than as an assertion to make the point that the perception that that may be the case is an issue that needs to be addressed. I hope Hansard picked up my punctuation in that very important sentence in this speech.
One of the terms of reference of the HIH royal commission needs to be a consideration of whether the scrutiny of the affairs of the HIH group of companies and/or the accountability of the HIH group of companies were affected by the substantial political contributions they made. No company gives $800,000 without an expectation of some benefit, and that is something the public need to have considered so they can be reassured. The opposition will be watching the royal commission and the ASIC investigation closely to ensure they do fully investigate the collapse of HIH. The opposition's concerns about the terms of reference and the political links between HIH and the Liberal Party do not stand in the way of our supporting this bill and the amendments moved by the government. I commend the opposition's approach to the Senate. ",SENATE,<title>ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,2001-09-26,"—I seek leave to incorporate Senator Stott Despoja's speech.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
The Bill is intended to enhance the flow of information between Royal Commissions and agencies responsible for the administration and enforcement of the law. The Bill facilitates both the flow of information generated by Royal Commissions towards regulatory agencies as well as allowing regulatory agencies to provide some confidential information to Royal Commissions.
The Bill was designed to facilitate the operation of both the HIH and construction industry Royal Commissions. It will also provide similar capacities for any future Royal Commissions.
The Government's amendments will help with the smooth and efficient operation of Royal Commissions.
This week the Royal Commission into the collapse of HIH began. Royal Commissions play an essential role in ensuring that both policy makers, and the Australian public are well informed about not just significant events, but the adequacy of the policy process that was in place at the time those events occurred.
It is essential that we learn from the mistakes of the past if we are to avoid repeating them. The current crisis in the airlines industry is a tragic case in point. The Australian people deserve access to all information concerning the process that led up to the grounding of Ansett. If the government didn't make any implementation mistakes, then it suggests that the overall policy approach is a mistake.
The same is obviously the case with HIH. We must uncover whether it was individual incompetence or systematic failure that led to the collapse of a national insurer. The failure of HIH imposed massive costs on tens of thousands of hard working Australians. We must ensure that either the people or the systems that led to those costs are brought to account, punished and reformed.
Speaking about bringing people to account, it is time we brought someone to account over this government's inaction with regard to protecting Australian workers entitlements and making Directors responsible for their actions.
Time and time again this Government has feigned surprise when major firms collapse without having made appropriate provisions to fund their workers entitlements. This year alone we have seen HIH, one.tel and Ansett collapse suddenly. Sadly now it looks like Pasminco may join them.
It appears on initial examination that the company has done the right thing and set entitlements aside. The Democrats hope this is the case, but workers should not have to rely on hope. They should be able to rely on sound government policy.
Pasminco employs more than 3,800 workers. It is the world's largest integrated lead and zinc producer supplying more than 8% of the world's demand for finished zinc and lead metal. It has smelters in Hobart, Newcastle and Port Pirie. 
Such a collapse  would hit regional Australia hard. Coming on the back of the collapse of Ansett it would be a devastating blow.
The government must take its head out of the sand. There are solutions to this problem. But those solutions will need to be based on policy and legislation, not hope and a booming economy.
The government should:
·	Require firms to contribute regularly to a secure fund in order to ensure that sufficient reserves to meet accrued entitlements are always in place.
·	Ensure firms take out insurance to meet any unfunded obligations that may exist when a company goes into bankruptcy.
·	Remove the limited liability protection for directors in instances where it can be shown that Directors have been negligent in meeting their responsibilities for workers entitlements.
This government has placed so much faith in the capacity of markets to solve all of society's problems it seems completely incapable of action when markets collapse and workers and customers are harmed.
Markets work well when the regulatory structure works well. Businesses will meet their tax obligations when the regulatory structure requires them to do so. Businesses will meet their environmental obligations when the regulatory structure requires them to do so. Sadly, until the regulatory structure is made sufficiently rigorous we can not expect that workers entitlements will be adequately protected.
Debate (on motion by Senator Patterson) adjourned.",SENATE,<title>ROYAL COMMISSIONS AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2001-09-26,"—The cognate bills, the New Business Tax System (Thin Capitalisation) Bill 2001 and the New Business Tax System (Debt and Equity) Bill 2001, establish a new thin capitalisation regime and define debt and equity for taxation purposes. More specifically, the thin capitalisation bill, as I will call it, amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 and the Income Tax Transitional Provisions Act 1997. It does so primarily to introduce a new thin capitalisation regime to prevent an excessive allocation of debt for tax purposes to the Australian operations of multinational companies and to ensure that Australia obtains appropriate tax from those entities that operate internationally. The debt and equity bill also amends both the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 as well as the Taxation Administration Act 1953 principally to implement new rules for determining equity and debt in an equity and, in particular, to define the debt equity borderline for tax purposes.
I am pleased to indicate the opposition's support for this legislation. After all, the Labor Party has committed itself to supporting the package of integrity measures that the Treasurer promised he would introduce in order to achieve a revenue neutral budget position associated with the business tax review measures. Of course, we know that the Treasurer has failed to keep his promises on the introduction of the entire package of measures required. This has demonstrated yet again the problems the government faced by trying to do too much too quickly without sufficient attention to the details and to the ramifications. It appears that it could not get other integrity measures right so it has either given up on them or tried to patch them up, largely unsuccessfully. I note that the date of effect of these bills is 1 July 2001. So, even with this measure, the government has been pretty slapdash. How much certainty can it give to businesses affected by this measure that are already having to change their arrangements based upon legislation that was introduced on the last sitting day in June and that has not come up for debate in this chamber until tonight?
As these bills deal with anti-avoidance in the new tax system environment, I think it is appropriate to canvass an issue of tax avoidance that has been of considerable concern to the Labor Party, and to the Australian community, coming out of the government's other substantial change to the tax system—the goods and services tax. This issue is the matter of the Groom FEC's GST avoidance scheme. On the wire service tonight, under the Australian general news category, this story appeared: Dateline, Brisbane, September 26th, source AAP. It states:
Australian Taxation Office officers have interviewed several Queensland Liberal Party members over an alleged GST scam. The officials today seized documents relating to the matter after interviewing party members in the federal seat of Groom, Channel 10 news reported. The Queensland Liberals have been engulfed in a scandal after allegations that a branch in Groom, held by Small Business Minister Ian Macfarlane, illegally claimed GST credits. Mr Macfarlane has denied any wrongdoing and Groom Federal Electorate Council officials have said it was an honest mistake made on the advice of an accountant. An ATO spokesman declined to comment.
That news item on the wire tonight indicates that what the Labor Party has said in this chamber about the GST scam by the Liberal Party in the federal seat of Groom is based on substantial evidence and truth. It is clear that members of the Liberal Party believe that the GST applies to all Australians except them, and that it is appropriate for them to act, according to this description in the news report I quoted, `illegally' in order to avoid the GST.
But let me return to my remarks, which expose this scam in all its detail. As I said, these bills deal with anti-avoidance in the new tax system environment, and I want to canvass an issue of tax avoidance concerning the GST scam in the Groom Liberal Party FEC. We have heard a great deal from members of the government about how this was all just a misunderstanding and a mistake, and those words were repeated again to the media tonight, but let us have a closer look at the facts of the Groom Liberal Party FEC GST scam. Since the matter was first made public by Labor on 23 August this year, Mr Macfarlane has given five versions of his knowledge of the scam. In his first version, on Thursday, 23 August this year, he told parliament: 
I am not aware of anything untoward that has been done in the FEC.
In his second statement, on the same day but later in the evening, he said:
The matter was drawn to my attention by the Treasurer's Office in early March and I subsequently raised the issue with the president of the Groom FEC.
In his third version, a short time after releasing that statement, Mr Macfarlane told the ABC's 7.30 Report that the issue had been discussed on 19 December at a meeting of the Groom Liberal Party FEC at his home. In his fourth version, a statement issued late the following night, he revealed that he had been told of the scam in a telephone call by Margaret Watts on 18 December. His fifth and final version was on 27 August when he told parliament that Mr Neville Stewart had told him of the scam sometime in December. Which story is correct? When did he find out? Was it in December or was it in February or could it have been in March? Who told him about it? Was it Mrs Watts? Was it Mr Costello, the Treasurer? Was it Mr Neville Stewart? 
I was beginning to think the next story we would hear was that it was Professor Plum in the kitchen with the candlestick who told him the story. At least in Cluedo you eventually get to the truth. If this were not such a serious matter, it would indeed be great comedy, but it is not: it is a cover-up of a potential tax avoidance scheme involving the misleading of parliament. As well as compounding his own deceit, Mr Macfarlane's statement on 27 August raised serious questions about the complicity of senior officials of the Liberal Party in the GST scam. The Liberal Party confirmed on the same day that, far from being a one-off, the scam had already been used by at least two other Liberal Party branches—the branch in the Leichhardt electorate of parliamentary secretary Warren Entsch and the branch in the electorate of Lilley.
—I rise on a point of order. I ask that Senator Cook withdraw the aspersion he has just cast on Mr Macfarlane.
—I think it would be appropriate to withdraw that, Senator Cook.
—I am not sure what I said that was against standing orders.
—You used the word `deceit'.
—I withdraw that word. Returning to the scam, Mr Macfarlane says Groom entered into the scam on the direct recommendation of Queensland Liberal Party president Con Galtos and of state director and now South Australian Liberal Party director Graham Jaeschke. As my colleague Simon Crean revealed shortly after the Labor Party's expose of the scam, the Liberal Party was well aware of its GST obligations as far back as 14 June 2000. Claims by the Prime Minister that the scam was due to a misunderstanding caused by the complexity of the GST cannot be sustained. It is odd that the Prime Minister should invoke the defence of the complexity of his own tax law when he has claimed to small business everywhere in Australia that this law can be managed—that is despite the deafening protests of the small business community that it adds to the complexity of their work, takes extra time, adds hours to their working life and involves them in higher expenditure because they have to hire accountants to do work that they would otherwise have done themselves. However, that is a matter for the Prime Minister.
On 29 August, senior Queensland Liberal Mr Neville Stewart, who is facing a police investigation over more than $25,000 in expenses that he claimed as Chairman of the Toowoomba Turf Club, returned from overseas to give yet another take on the Groom FEC scam. He told ABC radio the next day that he was `in shock' over the allegations that the GST had been falsely claimed for party fundraisers. His story is that party branches have experienced problems in working out how to handle a GST for fundraisers, and Groom's FEC was no different. He said: 
Groom didn't know what to do with the GST situation when we were given the accounts.
The matter had been put to the former state director Graham Jaeschke who sought advice from the party's senior accountant who, at this point, remains unnamed. Mr Stewart further said:
We voted to accept the advice of Jaeschke, which we did. My understanding of the advice that we were given would be that accounts ... would be paid by headquarters and all GST from the division that was collected would be remitted to headquarters.
What an interesting twist. Not only does this confirm that the Groom FEC decided to ignore the pretty direct written advice that they received back in June 2000 from the state office, it also presents yet more evidence of inconsistency in the story being told by the Liberals at local, state and federal level. Mr Stewart said that the advice the Groom FEC had got was that the accounts they received would be paid by headquarters and that the GST collected from the FEC would also be remitted to headquarters. But there was no GST collected by the Groom FEC. They are unregistered, so do not charge the GST. That is the whole point. The Queensland Liberals' advice was that the Groom FEC should be able to get the benefit of claiming the input tax credits through the state branch but would not have to pay the GST on the tickets it sold. A perfect scheme.
Further revelations were made when the letter from former Groom treasurer Margaret Watts to Liberal Party federal director Lynton Crosby was quoted in the Australian newspaper on 3 September 2001. The excerpts from the letter showed that the small business minister knew right from the start the scheme was wrong but deliberately did nothing about it. The letter said:
This `scheme' surfaced in Groom in December 2000. I advised Ian Macfarlane prior to the FEC meeting of my concern that it would develop into a political problem if it became public knowledge. His comment to me was `I won't be there for the vote—it won't affect me.'
Rather than take immediate action to shut down the scheme, Mr Macfarlane instead deliberately chose to let it run, thus benefiting his re-election campaign by over $800 at the expense of Australian taxpayers. His comment `it won't affect me' shows he was well aware of the consequences of the scheme and was already constructing an alibi in the event the scheme was made public. Beyond questions of the conduct of the small business minister and how the scam was effected, there are also technical questions remaining on exactly how the Liberal Party is trying to characterise the Groom FEC transactions and others in other FECs. The thrust of these questions is that the basis of the argument, outlined in the most sketchy terms by the Liberal Party, is premised on the notion that the transaction between the Queensland Liberal Party and the Groom FEC was truly a legitimate taxable supply. This was the transaction involving the payment by Groom of $8,264.14 on 20 December 2000 and the issuing of a tax invoice by the Queensland Liberals over a month later on 23 January 2001.
One of the key features of a taxable supply under section 9-5 of the GST law is that it is made in the course or furtherance of an enterprise that you carry on. Can the Liberal Party seriously tell us they are in an enterprise of providing a `cost netting' service—and at a loss? And what a strange `service'! When the invoice itself says it was `to net of Picnic Point function—November 23, 2000' does the government really think that what the Queensland Liberals really engaged in was the provision of a service? Doesn't a service require a little more than the payment of money from one organisation to another and the issuing of an invoice more than a month later? This transaction was contrived and should be viewed as being part of a scheme to avoid GST under division 165 of the GST law.
As many in this chamber will be aware, the Labor Party has been conducting its own GST inquiry over the last month right across Australia. I can tell you that I have heard again and again that the GST has done nothing to reduce the size of the black economy in Australia despite the promises made by the Prime Minister that the GST would close it down. Moreover, the people I have spoken to have told me how annoyed they are with the expanding black economy and they have also indicated they are furious that the Liberal Party themselves are dodging tax. This view is particularly strongly put by those small businesspeople who are trying to do the right thing—they pay the right tax and complete the right forms—when the Liberal Party contrive to avoid the tax.  
The damage done to small businesses in this country is shocking, and more than a year on the fallout from the government's GST continues to be felt. But now the harm is made even more heinous by the fact that the Liberal Party themselves have engaged in systematic abuse of the very laws they have forced on the Australian community. No doubt the final budget figures released by the Treasury today will be of very little comfort to those struggling under the GST. While the Treasurer likes to crow about his surplus, small business, families and low income earners will not be joining in the celebrations. They have never been under greater financial pressure as result of the soaring tax burden under Mr Costello. 
The Howard-Costello government tax take in 2000-01, even allowing for the removal of state taxes, was $10 billion higher in today's dollars than in the Keating government's final budget—that is an extra tax grab of $2,000 from every Australian family. Mr Costello likes to compare his five years as Treasurer with Labor's last five years in office. In Labor's last five years, the average tax burden was just 21.8 per cent of GDP. The average tax take under Mr Costello has been 23.8 per cent of GDP, an extra $14 billion of tax on Australians in a year! Mr Costello calls his budget good economic management. The truth is it is just Australians paying more tax—except, of course, those Australians who happen to be in the Groom Liberal Party FEC. 
In conclusion, while the Labor Party are happy to support these cognate bills because we have a true commitment to ensuring the integrity of the tax system, we say with some emphasis that the Liberal Party should show a similar desire to see that tax is paid. They must own up to their attempts to avoid the GST, pay the GST amount that remains outstanding, and commit to paying their fair share in the future. That is the kind of integrity measure we would love to see from this government.",SENATE,<title>NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (DEBT AND EQUITY) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-09-26,"—The Australian Democrats are a party that believes that this government and the next government need to continue doing the work to shore up the revenues that are needed to deliver the services that all Australians are demanding. By my estimate we are easily short of about $10 billion of revenue which is demanded in such areas as health, education, infrastructure, defence, industry policy—we could run through them all. Frankly, the coalition government's efforts in increasing the revenue needed in this country should not be condemned but praised, because you cannot deliver the services people demand unless you attend to the issue of revenue. We, the Australian Democrats, are unashamedly a high revenue party. We are not a high tax party. We agree with John Ralph and Peter Costello, who say, `Broaden the base and lower the rates.' We agree with that.
But, frankly, you need a lot more money if you are going to deliver the social justice, the social security, the health, the education, the infrastructure and the defence this country wants and is demanding. All the emphasis on tax always has to bear in mind that the purpose of revenue is in fact to deliver the services demanded by the citizens of this country. This is a duo of very important bills which address the Ralph reform recommendations and the very issues I just outlined. Not that you would have known it from the earlier remarks made with respect to the second reading, but this will fulfil the promise to produce over $1 billion worth of revenue over a four-year period: that is a lot of money.
The original proposition was in fact that $1.3 billion would be produced and that has been adjusted down to $1.1 billion as a result of government consultation on the exposure draft of the bill and the recognition that certain transitional measures were necessary. I am not sure if they have not gone a little too far but, believe you me, when people want hospital beds filled, roads built and schools accommodated, I am going to take the $1.1 billion. I am very glad that the government has moved these bills up the order of priority. 
The bills, apart from raising revenue, have the desirable effect of knocking off what is essentially an undesirable tax minimisation practice. That practice has revolved for years around the manipulation of debt versus equity. Equity, as a capital item, has limitations in terms of the tax benefits you can generate. But the association of excess debt or high gearing—of loading up a company with debt—in certain relationships to equity can result in substantial tax benefits to the party doing so, particularly in this instance where it is in fact foreign companies doing just that. Apart from the desirable objective of fulfilling the mantra of lowering the rates and broadening the base, this bill addresses not just a tax mischief but actually what borders on a tax rort. In consequence, the Democrats are pleased with it from both perspectives.
The thin capitalisation rules were examined as part of the Review of Business Taxation. Thin capitalisation simply means that you have not got enough equity and that to create the finance necessary to maintain and run your business you are deliberately factoring in excess debt. The financial impact of this is laid out in the explanatory memorandum to the New Business Tax System (Thin Capitalisation) Bill 2001, and that is outlined as $10 million in 2001-02—that is when the transitional arrangements are finally locked in, although with respect to some of them it is 2004—in 2002-03, $395 million will be pulled in; in 2003-04, $350 million; and in 2004-05, $350 million. So that is over $1.1 billion.
The second bill, which is its companion, referred to as the New Business Tax System (Debt and Equity) Bill 2001, states:
The revenue impact of this measure is unquantifiable, although it will protect the revenue base from erosion from deductible returns on certain future financial instruments that are equity in economic substance but debt in legal form.
Some of the people who write these things are positively poetic. That is a beautiful statement of how to drive an integrity issue. To continue:
To the extent that the revenue base is not protected, there could be a potential significant loss to annual revenue.
I think they are being modest. I think that bill in fact will generate revenue. It might be unquantifiable but I think it is a plus not a minus. I am pretty pleased about that because everywhere I go I hear squeals about more money for aged care, for legal aid, for railroads. Hopefully, if you are returned, Senator Minchin, you will put more money into rail, please.
—We are building Alice to Darwin.
—I have got a long list, as you know. It is a serious matter. That is what governments are about: generating the money. It is all very well having a crack at the Labor Party when they are in government or at the Liberal Party when they are in government but both have to have the objective of producing the money to fulfil the needs of our society.
The thin capitalisation rules which provide the circumstances under which a deduction for interest payments would otherwise be allowable will be reduced for an entity. It will mean that the equity component should be increased in terms of its importance. The objective of the thin capitalisation regime is to ensure that multinational entities do not allocate an excessive amount of debt to their Australian operations. This is to prevent multinational entities taking advantage of the differential tax treatment of debt and equity to minimise their Australian tax. The new business tax system bill provides the new rules concerning what is debt and what is equity under the taxation law. As I said, they were reviewed by Ralph and have been improved as a result. It is an integral part of the new thin capitalisation regime, which is to reduce the effect of thin capitalisation, but it is also important in other areas such as imputation. 
If taxpayers can choose the categorisation of either debt or equity simply by regard to the legal structure of an instrument without regard to the substance of the arrangement, that would involve—and has involved in the past—significant revenue cost. The new rules attempt to tax interest according to its nature rather than facilitating the manipulation of tax treatments depending on who are the parties to the transaction. Without this approach, taxpayers could issue instruments that are identical in nature but that are either frankable or deductible to suit the purposes of the parties at the expense of the revenue.
One of the measures that I must refer to briefly in this is a concern that the Property Council had with the original bill. They were concerned with the impact of the associated entity test on managed investment schemes. We are pleased that they advise us that, through consultation with the Australian Taxation Office and the Treasury, the unintended impacts of the bill on the property industry have apparently been addressed. We are assured by them, so I hope that is so. 
In conclusion, you would gather from my remarks that the Democrats strongly support this bill. We think it does fulfil the promises made by the government in reaction to the Ralph report. We think it does improve the integrity of the tax system. We are certain that it will generate significant income, as outlined in the budget figures. I am hopeful, on my own reading of things, that they are in fact conservative. I therefore thank the government for bringing this forward, and assure you that we will support it fully.",SENATE,<title>NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (DEBT AND EQUITY) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-09-26,"—These taxation bills constitute an important anti-avoidance measure agreed to as part of the business tax package. Labor have agreed to support a more comprehensive thin capitalisation regime and will be supporting these bills. While we support the bills, we are concerned that they do not deliver the same regime that the Treasurer announced back in late 1999. Since then, there have been substantial changes to the legislation at a cost of around a quarter of a billion dollars over the forward estimate period. The Treasurer, Mr Costello, promised this business tax package would be revenue neutral. It is not. It was on this understanding that the Labor opposition adopted a positive and cooperative approach to business tax reform and supported measures such as lower rates of company and capital gains tax.
The quarter of a billion dollars that the government will forgo in this backflip, or roll-back, of thin capitalisation was intended to offset some of the costs of these tax cuts. However, the Treasurer has breached the commitment he gave, and he is undermining the revenue neutrality of his own business tax reform, at a cost of millions of dollars, through this backdown of thin capitalisation off the budget bottom line. In the same way, he gave away substantial dollars on the budget bottom line through his backdown on the taxation of trusts.
The two bills we are considering provide for a new thin capitalisation regime and, secondly, a comprehensive regime for defining debt and equity for taxation purposes. They are designed to ensure that the excessive interest deductions against the Australian tax base are not available to the Australian businesses of multinational companies. This is a crackdown on tax minimisation by multinational companies, and the government has backed down. Thin capitalisation refers to the practice of overgearing the Australian business of a multinational for tax purposes. Overgearing—carrying higher levels of debt relative to equity—generates a higher tax deductible debt cost, mostly interest repayments. This allows multinationals to claim higher tax deductions—at Australia's expense, at the cost of the general taxpayer— than would otherwise be the case. As a result, thin capitalisation represents a threat to the integrity of the Australian corporate tax base. This puts additional pressure on the taxes to be raised from income tax or from a GST, which most of the rest of the community is required to pay. The thin capitalisation regime is necessary to deal with that threat. 
Labor recognised the necessity of this measure in 1987, when we introduced dividend imputation and the current thin capitalisation regime. Both policies were designed to counter the bias towards debt generated by the tax deductibility of interest payments. Dividend imputation was introduced to improve the incentive for investors to utilise more equity. The existing thin capitalisation regime sets limits for tax purposes on the ratio of foreign debt to foreign equity for certain business entities. It does not set a binding limit on relative debt levels, but it means that interest paid on foreign debt over the allowable ratio is not deductible. 
Under the current regime, the allowable ratio of foreign debt to foreign equity is two to one, and six to one for financial institutions, reflecting the different nature of their business. The current regime has worked well but it is not comprehensive. It only applies where the debt has been provided by a foreign entity that owns more than 15 per cent of the Australian company. This bill provides for a more universal regime and should therefore be supported. The thin capitalisation regime is extended to cover Australian owned multinationals with non-portfolio assets overseas and branches, as well as subsidiaries of foreign multinationals operating in Australia. The legislation changes the formula for the maximum debt to equity ratios to include total debt and total equity but also, at the same time, increases the maximum ratio under a two-tier system.
The first tier imposes a safe harbour limit of three to one on a deductible debt to equity for businesses other than financial institutions. The government has argued that this increase in the maximum ratio is justified because of the use of the total debt rather than foreign debt in its calculation. The second tier allows for interest deductions on debts above this level up to an arm's length amount. The arm's length amount is the level of debt that the business could maintain as an independent entity. In addition, a worldwide gearing amount applies to outward investing entities and allows for tax deductible gearing of up to 120 per cent of the average worldwide debt of the entity divided by its average worldwide equity. The legislation also broadens the thin capitalisation regime for authorised deposit taking institutions, commonly known as ADIs, by including outward investing ADIs and by providing for minimum capital amounts based on risk weighted assets. The legislation also imposes new record keeping obligations on affected entities. 
As I mentioned earlier, this legislation represents an important structural improvement to the corporate tax base and it should yield significant revenue. Indeed, according to the explanatory memorandum more than $1 billion is estimated to be raised from the measure during the next four years. The second bill, the New Business Tax System (Debt and Equity) Bill 2001, provides new definitions of debt and equity for tax purposes. These new rules are important for the thin capitalisation regime as well as other areas of tax legislation such as dividend imputation. The new rules define instruments as debt or equity according to their economic nature rather than their legal characteristics, which can currently be manipulated for tax purposes. Without this approach, taxpayers could issue instruments that are identical in nature but are either frankable or deductible depending on the interests of the parties involved. Such arrangements represent a risk to revenue that this legislation seeks to address. This legislation will be important in safeguarding the corporate tax base and should be supported. 
My colleague the shadow Assistant Treasurer, Mr Thomson, pointed out in the House during the debate on these measures that this second piece of legislation is already operating. But regrettably—and we have seen more examples of it this week—the government has so mismanaged the legislative program that the bill was only introduced into the parliament at the end of June and was therefore only debated in the House on 7 August and only brought on for debate in the Senate today, despite being listed for the previous sitting week. 
As I mentioned earlier, the Labor Party are supporting these bills as far as they go. They represent important improvements in the tax system, building on the solid foundations that Labor laid in 1987. They go much of the way—not totally—towards reducing the threat to revenue from thin capitalisation arrangements. They play an important role in offsetting some of the costs of business tax reform, but in this respect they do not go far enough. In fact, the bills do not go as far as the government promised. The government initially accepted all the recommendations of the Ralph committee of review regarding thin capitalisation, and it released an exposure draft to this effect in February 2001. But what we have seen is pressure from the big end of town. The government cracked under the pressure and announced so-called `significant transitional measures' and a relaxation of some of the provisions.  
The consequences of the government's backflip mean that the new rules will apply to an entity's financial year commencing after 30 June 2001 so that entities which do not have a financial year commencing on 1 July will not have to adopt the new rules during a financial year. Secondly, where the proposed new debt and equity rules alter the status of an instrument, entities will be able to elect to retain their current status until 30 June 2004. I emphasise that: 30 June 2004. Taxpayers who claim interest deductions of less than $250,000 will be exempt from the thin capitalisation rules. If you are claiming interest deductions of, say, $240,000, you must be engaged in a fairly significant business. If they were interest deductions even of $20,000, I would argue that you were engaged in some significant business activity. The exemption level is set at $250,000 in interest deductions. If one assumes an interest rate of 10 per cent for the sake of the argument, depending on the period over which the loan is taken, and interest free payments of $250,000, you would have to have borrowings of principal of millions of dollars—and these people will be exempt from these thin capitalisation rules. Further, the safe harbour capital requirements for financial institutions will be reduced from seven to four per cent. Also, certain large low-risk assets, such as leases, will be excluded from the definition for financial institutions. 
The cost of the measures that I have outlined is significant. It is standing at almost a quarter of a billion dollars that was not covered by other measures in the business tax package. What we effectively have is additional pressure on the budget as a consequence of these changes, and these changes were made as a result of pressure from the top end of town. This is one of a number of weakened measures that have eroded the revenue neutrality of the business tax package.
This $245 million backflip is the latest instalment in a spectacular array of gymnastics by the Treasurer, Mr Costello—and the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, for that matter—this year. This level of backflip is starting to equate to the famous—now infamous—commitment, promise, made by the Prime Minister never, ever to introduce a GST. The most costly of the Liberal government's backflips was the withdrawal of the entity taxation legislation at a cost of $1.2 billion over the next four years. These are two examples of the weak approach by the current government to business tax reform that have cost the Australian public almost $1½ billion. That is $1½ billion off the bottom line of the budget that cannot be spent on schools, hospitals and aged care and cannot, for that matter, be spent on the proposed income tax cuts that until recently they were so fond of talking about. I think they were always phantom tax cuts but they have now been ruled out, according to the news media this afternoon.
As I said earlier, Labor adopted a constructive and cooperative approach to business tax reform. We supported reductions in company and capital gains tax, but we did this on the explicit condition that other measures would be introduced to offset the reduction in revenue. In other words, the overall package would be revenue neutral. This is an agreement in writing that was presented by the Treasurer, Mr Costello, to the caucus living standards and employment committee, the Labor Party caucus committee that has jurisdiction over economic matters.
Labor supported building a fairer, more efficient and competitively neutral business tax system. This meant lower rates of business tax, but it also meant eliminating the loopholes that are available to some businesses but not to others, loopholes that are neither fair nor efficient. The letter that I referred to earlier—to the shadow Treasurer, Mr Crean, sent by the Treasurer, Mr Costello—committed the government to `introduce all the business tax changes announced in full'. That is not what we have got. This is just another example of a very tricky government. 
We have had announced tax changes and a pledge to introduce them in full and, when the time comes to bite the bullet and introduce them, either they are in watered down form or we do not have any legislation at all, which is leaving a gaping hole in the bottom line of the budget of close to $1.5 billion. Let us not forget: if we had this $1.5 billion, then the special tax that we are going to have introduced—and passed tomorrow, as I understand—on airline tickets, to cover the debacle of the Ansett collapse and the entitlements of employees, would not be necessary. If we had this $1.5 billion, we would be able to meet our commitments in the defence areas that have recently had to be upgraded. These are just some examples of the difficulties the government is creating for the rest of the community by this backdown at a cost of $1.5 billion.
Recently we have had examples of a number of senators opposite bemoaning the fact that Labor did not join Mr Howard and Mr Costello on their great tax adventure and support the GST. There are very many reasons that we have debated on many occasions why Labor vigorously opposed the GST. That is of course before and after that shady deal to get it through between the now banished leader of the Democrats and what should be and hopefully will be a banished government. We opposed the GST because it was unfair to families, it would cause significant problems for small business and it would damage the economy.
—I note Senator Cherry has just interjected. It is true he was not a senator in this place who voted for the package—
—But what was his role?
—Senator West has drawn my attention to the critical role that Senator Cherry played as the supreme architect, the supreme designer, of the GST package that the Democrats ended up supporting, and we obviously do not forget that.
—What are you going to do about it?
—We will be announcing our roll-back; we are very proud of it. We will be announcing our roll-back when we know the bottom line of the budget. We have already commenced to announce it. We will be rolling back the GST on funerals, for example. This deceitful government has passed 1,800 amendments to the GST since 1 July last year. We have had massive roll-back by this government on beer tax and petrol tax. We have had a roll-back on charities, priests, swimming lessons and caravan parks—you name it. This government has delivered at least part of the roll-back that should have occurred. We will name our roll-back and detail it in the coming weeks, and we have already commenced to do that. Indeed, I note that the head of the funeral parlours association who is on the Liberal Senate ticket in Tasmania has come out endorsing our roll-back, so we have endorsement from the Liberal Party for the first public announcement of our roll-back on the GST.
Debate (on motion by Senator Minchin) adjourned.",SENATE,<title>NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (DEBT AND EQUITY) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2001-09-26,"—On behalf of Senator Conroy, I seek leave to incorporate the opposition's contribution to the second reading debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2001.
Leave granted. 
The speech read as follows—
I would like to remind all Senators of one simple fact:
Business research and development in Australia is in serious decline.
Not only is it in decline now, but it has been in steep decline since 1996, when John Howard's newly elected Coalition Government made the extraordinary and short-sighted decision to slash public spending on research and development.
Until 1996, the measure of Australia's business R&D performance had only ever grown each year - there had not been even one single year of decline.
With every new set of statistics released by the ABS showing a continued declining trend in this area, the credibility of the Prime Minister and his cohorts diminishes by a similar degree.
Ironically, both the Prime Minister and the Minister responsible, the Minister for Industry, have hit out at criticisms levelled at their industry policy (or lack thereof) made by commentators in the lights of these statistics.
They claim that these measurements do not take into account the proposals put forward by the Government in the January Backing Australia's Ability statement.
That may be true, but let no person in this place be fooled - what these statistics do measure is the effect of those 1996 Howard policies that saw hundreds of millions of dollars of public support torn from the research sector.
With all the trumpeting and carry-on surrounding the BAA statement, and all the derision heaped on Labor's comments over these matters, the Prime Minister should not think he has carried off a triumph in trying to disguise the cause of this national diminution of our research capacity. 
Both industry commentators and participants alike know the truth the Howard Government caused the problem, and is now trying to take “the credit for the single largest increase in funding in this area in Australian history” (Senator Alston - “Once again Labor ducks the issue: Kim Beazley's `Do Nothing Nation'” August 7th 2001).
While Senator Alston's staff were preparing this release, they should have been mindful that the Coalition Government also presided over the largest cuts to public research in Australia's history, and the largest (only) decline in business research and development in recorded Australian history.
It doesn't take a genius to recognise that if you create a massive problem, then your solutions will need to be even larger, and you will face the anger of those affected.
The Howard Government has presided over an ad hoc approach to industrial policies, lacking a broad, central strategy and certainly operating without any appropriate sense of urgency.
Although several reports, including that of the Chief Scientist and the Innovation Summit Implementation Group, have recommended substantial and immediate action to stem the decline in business R&D, the government has taken the simple option of increasing expenditure on measures to promote their short-term political interests, ahead of the harder and more complex task of building long term, strategic investment in Australia's future.
This belated action (belated by several budgets) announced on January 29, is likely to do nothing more than going some way to repair the damage created by their own decisions and will do little to develop the sort of industrial momentum and commitment to innovation so clear in the economies of other nations with whom we compete.
As the President of the Business Council of Australia and others have put the matter recently: “unless we embrace ... change, others who do embrace it will eat us for breakfast.”
It is now more than clear that this failure to spend more on research is stifling innovation and dragging down other parts of the economy. The Howard Government simply does not appear to understand that future industries are built on today's research.
It is not surprising that Australia is now perceived by many of our international peers as on old economy with few (and diminishing) prospects of participating fully in emerging industries built on information technology, biotechnology, nanotechnology and renewable technologies.
A carefully constructed Innovation and Industry strategy is needed if we are to reverse these trends. It will require significant effort and investment in education (particularly in science, mathematics, engineering and technology), research and research infrastructure, and industry research and development.
Perhaps more importantly, and certainly an area where the Government has failed the nation, is that fact that such a strategy also depends on an intellectual property regime which rewards innovation and a financial system with the capacity and willingness to fund longer-term, more risky investments in innovative products and processes.
These must be priority areas for policy attention, but under the Coalition, all we have seen are sustained attacks on the research sector, shrinking funding, and even attacks by the increasingly aggressive ATO on specific characteristics of new economy sectors, like the structure of contracting within the IT sector, and the treatment of web development expenses by companies.
So just what is the current state of Australian research and development?
As a result of Howard government policies, business investment in innovation and spending on R&D has fallen sharply. The decision to cut the R&D tax concession from 150% to 125% in 1996 produced an immediate decline from a peak of 0.86% of GDP in 1995-96 to just 0.64% of GDP in the most recent 2001 statistics.
Our expenditure now compares very unfavourably with other industrialised nations. At a time when other nations are investing heavily in the knowledge bases of their economies, the Howard government has effectively reduced business R&D alone by $1 billion per year.
The current investment is 33% lower than it would have been had it continued to increase at the same rate as over the three years before the cut. A plethora of small and ad hoc grants programs are not an effective alternative and have not filled the gap.
Unless we reverse this trend and start to catch up with our competitors, Australia will miss opportunities to improve our standard of living and squander the skills and creativity of our people. The Chief Scientist's report describes innovation as “the only way forward.” 
In the case of Australia's innovation environment, it is interesting to note the advancing maturation of parts of Australia's innovation sector, despite the damage caused by Coalition economic decisions.
The development of a culture of research innovation and development in Australia, manifest through the development of such institutions as Co-operative Research Centres, and the centres of research excellence found throughout our Nation, is a priority for my colleagues and I in the field of public policy.
The value to our national economy of a strong, stable, research and innovation sector is clear - and this Bill, in it's present form, does little to achieve this end.
Among other reports, the recent Yellow Pages Global Entrepreneurship Monitor Report, which seeks to create international benchmarks for innovation characteristics and performance across similar economies, demonstrated that high levels of innovation activity are strongly correlated with high economic growth.
The study found that Australia ranked well in terms of some entrepreneurial businesses practices, ranking:
·	Fifth in new firm participation, with 3.3 percent of the population owning all or part of a business established since 1997.
·	Fourth in overall entrepreneurial activity, an index combining start-up and new firm activity.
·	Fourth in female participation in business start-ups, a factor correlated with high entrepreneurial activity.
·	Third in start-up activity, with just over eight percent of the population involved in starting a business at any one time.
·	Second in company-sponsored start-ups, with 1.4 percent of the population working on starting a business for their employer in which they would have an ownership stake.
However, while strong in these areas, Australia's performance against other key benchmarks is somewhat lacking. The Yellow Pages survey found that Australia's venture capital industry is under-developed compared with other similar economies.
In terms of venture capital invested as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Australia ranked only 15th out of 19 similar economies in terms of classic venture capital investment.
The United States' percentage of Gross Domestic Product invested was more than seven times that of Australia.
In the critical area of Information Technology, Australia ranked 16th out of 17 countries for investment in the IT industry sector. To again use America as a comparison, the United State's percentage of GDP invested in IT firms was 24 times that of Australia.
It is perhaps in this sector that the damaging succession of several poorly thought-out Coalition policies is having the most troublesome effect.
Despite the relatively recent emergence in commercial terms of consumer technologies in the ICT sector, Australia has not developed a strong, growing domestic industry in terms of the design and production of hardware, software and digital media content, relative to other countries of similar size and economic conditions. In fact, some data suggests that growth will in fact decline over the next three to four years.
Arguably, the lack of concrete public sector support for innovations and development in these critical areas has contributed most to this slide.
Perhaps more importantly, profitability growth in the sector is also predicted to decline in coming years, particularly with competition increasing from international suppliers, and the potential removal of existing import restrictions, most commonly described as parallel importation.
The Australian information industries currently account for only two per cent of the world's information sector activity, and therefore only represents a minor part of what is increasingly becoming a heavily integrated global market for so-named “new-economy” goods and services.
This is remarkable, given the trumpeting by the Prime Minister and others about our alleged
In Australia, the ABS reports the industry generates about $50 billion across all its component sectors. The industry is highly concentrated in some areas, with the vast bulk of sectoral activity in NSW and Victoria - combined, these States represent more than 70 per cent of employment in the sector and almost three quarters of information industry revenues.
Despite the fact that Australia's combination of a well-educated, innovative workforce and a pleasant physical environment make it ideally suited to this new economic environment, surveys of Australian-based managers of multi-national ICT firms have shown them to be highly critical of Federal Government policy in attracting information industries. 
R & D tax treatment
A national industry R&D, policy should meet the several key objectives. It should:
1.	Increase spending R&D spending over present levels and over what would be done in the absence of incentives to at least equal the average OECD level.
2.	Demonstrably improve public benefits such as employment, exports, import replacement etc.
3.	Encourage linkages between public sector R&D institutions and business.
4.	Facilitate high-technology based business start-ups and commercialisation of, Australian ideas.
5.	Encourage international alliances, in-bound investment and R&D collaboration.
6.	Address the needs of all sizes and types of companies.
Such a policy should be based on the recognition that businesses need certainty and continuity in order to plan for innovation. Simplicity of administration is also essential to keep compliance costs low and to maximise take up rates, especially for new and emerging SMEs.
This Bill does very little of that.
The Bill proposes changes to the definition of R&D that will make it a requirement that eligible activities must involve both innovation and high levels of technical risk.
This proposal has been put forward several times in recent years. Each time in the past the Government has either ended up opposing the proposal or abandoning it after consultation.
Analysis provided to AI Group suggests that the outcome of cases cited by the Government as justification for this measure would likely be unaffected by the change in definition proposed.
The proposal represents a further effort to curtail the existing scope of the concession, and should be opposed.
Treatment of Plant
The Bill purports to give effect recent Government announcements relating to the treatment of expenditure on plant for the purposes of the R&D tax concession.
These announcements were made in an effort to placate industry concern about the potential impact of a draft ATO ruling, issued in November 1999. This ruling is still yet to be finalised by the ATO.
However, the Bill also appears to include additional measures, for which there has been no previous announcement by Government and no consultation with industry.
In particular, the Bill includes provisions that would act to `clawback' the impact of the R&D concession for expenditure on plant by requiring that companies offset any eligible deduction against profits earned as the result of the production of any saleable product that derives from the use of the plant in R&D activities.
This aspect of the Bill is complex in its effect and could only be improved with significant amendment. In essence these provisions of the Bill would seriously undermine the effect of previous Government announcements to provide pro rata access to the tax concession for plant expenditure which has a dual commercial and R&D purpose.
Incremental Tax Incentive
The Bill gives effect to the 175 per cent Premium R&D tax concession, based upon the simplified formula announced in May 2001. However, the Bill also contains additional provisions that provide for adjustment of a company's entitlement, depending on the level of variation in R&D expenditure from year to year.
If a company's level of R&D decreases by more than 20 per cent in any given year, an adjustment amount may be calculated, that may affect the subsequent level of deduction under the premium tax concession. Successive adjustment amounts can be aggregated to provide an adjustment balance.
The inclusion of an adjustment amount and adjustment balance appears to greatly complicate the administration of the incremental, or premium, R&D tax concession, particularly for smaller businesses. It is likely to limit the usefulness of this additional incentive to those companies that have access to a sophisticated level of tax advice. It is also likely to penalise some companies that experience a high level of volatility in R&D expenditure, whatever the reason.
John Howard's document Backing Australia's Ability was an attempt to correct the Government's own mistakes. 
But the document has failed.
As Kim Beazley has rightly said, Australia faces two choices, and they are stark and they are simple: we will be either a knowledge nation or a poor nation.
In practical terms, becoming a Knowledge Nation will include:
·	Strengthening our manufacturing and service industries through the application of new technologies and the reskilling of the workforce;
·	Encouraging innovation in emerging fields such as biotechnology, information technology, and green technologies;
·	Encouraging every school - public as well as private - to become a centre of excellence;
·	Having a world-class university system that attracts the world's leading researchers and teachers;
·	Establishing leading-edge telecommunications, transport and research infrastructure;
·	And last, but by no means least, a Knowledge Nation will mean helping all of our citizens to improve their skills and gain a secure and well-paid job through properly-funded vocational education and lifelong-learning programs.
Labor's vision to deliver a Knowledge Nation is the right option for Australia's future.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,32,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2001-09-26,"—My speech in the second reading debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2001 will not be as short as the one I have just given, because I do wish to address some of the issues in this legislation, which has been of particular interest to the Australian Democrats, both before we actually viewed the legislation—that is, after the announcement was made by the government in January this year in relation to Backing Australia's Ability—and of course since we saw the legislation and were aware of some of its flaws and deficiencies as well as some of the positive aspects of the legislation. We have since worked with the government to reach an agreement on aspects of this bill and to improve it in quite a valuable way. 
I would like to firstly put on record that the Democrats are quite happy to acknowledge the government's preparedness to negotiate on this bill—which is an important bill—and I am certain that it will contribute to a much more healthy business research and development performance in Australia. This bill comes at a particularly crucial stage in Australia's research and development capability. Our total investment in research and development as a nation is not internationally competitive. In fact, the most recent OECD data—from 1998—shows that average gross expenditure in R&D is 2.05 per cent of GDP. In 1999-2000, Australia invested 1.43 per cent of GDP, a gap of 0.62 per cent or $3.9 billion. When you look at it in a monetary sense, it is actually a lot of money.
Since the imposition of changes to definitions and the lowering of the rate of the tax concession from 150 per cent to 125 per cent in 1996 under this government, we have actually seen an obvious decline in business expenditure in research and development. Business expenditure in R&D has declined each year in real terms and also as a percentage of GDP—that is, the current policy settings for business research and development cannot be described as successful. I am aware of the government's rhetoric in wanting to foster an innovative culture, and obviously a key component of that is ensuring that there are incentives for business and industry to invest in research and development. Currently, the climate does not favour that kind of investment.
This bill does implement some of the changes to the R&D tax concession foreshadowed by the government in the innovation statement from January, Backing Australia's Ability—which, in turn, was a partial response to the Chief Scientist's report A chance to change and the Innovation Summit Implementation Group's report Innovation: unlocking the future. I should point out that, while a number of the measures in Backing Australia's Ability are welcomed by the Democrats, we are concerned that the $2.9 billion package merely slows down the decline in gross expenditure in R&D relative to OECD averages and, moreover, is substantially backloaded, with only $155 million committed in the first year of the four-year phase-in. 
The Democrats support implementation of the two main measures contained in the bill: a tax rebate offset for SMEs and the 175 per cent `premium' concession. However, there are a number of major definitional, compliance and timing issues that are of great concern to the Democrats—and, I should add for the record, to industry generally. We have certainly met with a number of key industry organisations—lobby groups, advocacy groups—and they have put on record their concerns not only to us but also to the government. I suspect that is why we have managed to reach some of the agreements that we have on this bill. We have no doubt that, in its current form, the bill is likely to further reduce national R&D effort, not increase it—that is, without the agreements struck by the Democrats and by the government, the bill, in its original form, would have actually had a deleterious impact on investment in research and development in this country.
It is telling that at the hearings organisations like Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, PricewaterhouseCoopers, the Australian Taxation Institute and Business Strategies International were quite explicit in their verbal submissions to the inquiry and in their responses to questions from senators, particularly from the Democrats. When they were asked explicitly whether the bill should be passed or defeated by the Senate if the government would not accept any amendments, they were quite keen that it should be opposed if that were the case. While all acknowledged the benefits of the two main measures in the bill, they argued that the compliance impediments and the narrower definition mean that the package, in aggregate, will be a disincentive for increased business investment in R&D and therefore should be defeated in its current form. So even if the government was not at first willing to listen to the Democrats' concerns, certainly the response from those key industries and companies have made it imperative that they respond and accept some of the amendments proposed by the Australian Democrats.
The Democrats have taken a leading role in the debate over the changes to the concession, and we are acknowledged by industry for having done so. That is because we, too, are committed to the notion of an innovation culture. We believe that education underpins the very heart of that creative and skilled culture that we require. We are very strong supporters of an investment in our human capital, particularly the notion that education and money for education are investments, not costs. With those views, we were keen to ensure that Backing Australia's Ability was implemented in a way that would be positive, particularly for R&D and particularly for business R&D.
I am actually quite delighted to say that the government has listened to our concerns. As many members would be aware, the government and the Democrats will be moving a raft of amendments that will significantly improve the bill when it comes to the committee stage. In brief, these changes are: firstly, no change to the current definition of R&D, including proposed extension of the exclusions list; secondly, removing trading stock and feedstock provisions from the R&D plant changes; and, thirdly, including R&D Start history if no tax registration history for access to the premium. I want to emphasise that this is a retrospective measure. Companies that are already part of the R&D Start program will be able to count that towards their three-year eligibility. Fourthly, we do support the government's intention to require that companies provide an R&D plan and agree that this will help companies take a strategic approach to R&D. However, we are concerned that the guidelines might be a little too prescriptive. Therefore, we will include an amendment to explicitly say that the guidelines are to be mindful of the size and the complexity of projects so as to ensure that small firms do not have heavy compliance burdens.
Fifthly, we support the introduction of the tax rebate as a genuinely helpful incentive, but we are concerned that the $1 million threshold may result in perverse outcomes by being a disincentive for companies who would otherwise spend $1.1 million, say, on R&D. Accordingly, we will be amending the Industry Research and Development Act 1986 to require that the Industry Research and Development Board annual report include a report on firms' access to the rebate. Sixthly, all measures are to come into effect from 1 July 2001, except plans, which will come into effect on 1 July 2002. This means that companies can take advantage of the positive incentives in the bill immediately. We are very keen to see that happen. It also allows sufficient time for the Industry Research and Development Board to develop appropriate guidelines, in consultation with industry, and for companies to develop their plans in a timely and considered fashion. 
There are still items in here and matters contained in the legislation that we would have preferred to change. However, while not optimal, the agreement does substantially improve the bill, and I know it will be welcomed by industry and the R&D community broadly as a positive step forward. Again, I acknowledge the government's preparedness to listen to the concerns outlined by Democrats and industry groups and research and development groups. I am glad that our amendments have been accepted, and I support the amendments that will be coming to us in the committee stage. My office has been in contact with other parties in the chamber to outline the measures that we sought to implement and to provide briefings if wanted. Certainly Senator Harradine's office has been in touch, as has the office of Senator Len Harris from One Nation. We offered the Greens the same information, but they have not taken us up on the offer. I am sure that that is because they are very supportive of the changes that have been made. In closing, I am confident that this legislation and the changes contained therein will contribute to a more healthy business climate and to investment in research and development.

"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2001-09-26,"—I rise to speak on these bills, the Air Passenger Ticket Levy (Collection) Bill 2001 and the Air Passenger Ticket Levy (Imposition) Bill 2001, which were introduced to mitigate the drastic consequences of the sudden collapse of Ansett on the entitlements of Ansett workers. The government announced that Ansett employees' entitlements for wages and annual and long service leave and pay in lieu of notice were to be met in full, except for redundancy, for which they will be funded only up to eight weeks. The government has established a special employees entitlements scheme for that purpose, and it will be funded by a $10 levy on airline tickets.
These bills impose that levy and make arrangement for its collection on certain air passenger tickets. In the House of Representatives the government introduced a range of amendments to the original legislation that change the definitions and principles that were set out in the original bill. We welcome those amendments as they make the operation of the bill a bit clearer. The levy which is the subject of these bills will be payable on each ticket on or after 1 October 2001 for an Australian regular public transport flight that originates in Australia.
The opposition is supporting these bills but I wish to make it clear to the Senate that it is only as a last resort. The fact is that there are some aspects of these bills that Labor does not fully support, and I would like, as my colleague Mr Martin Ferguson did in the House of Representatives, to outline these reservations. Firstly, and let us not make no mistake about this, this is a new tax on the Australian community and on jobs. The Prime Minister has broken yet again his promise about taxes by imposing another tax on the community to add to the very long list. Secondly, the tax is being imposed to pay for the incompetence of this government. Thirdly, this is a tax on tourism, the very industry that has been hit by the collapse of Ansett and the decline of international aviation following the US terrorist crisis. Fourthly, this government is prepared to raise $500 million to pay entitlements in the event that the company becomes insolvent but has ridiculed Labor's calls to put in $200 million to help get the airline back in the air and steadfastly refuses our calls to provide this assistance and help out. 
Fifthly, we firmly believe that the government saw this coming and sat idly by and therefore failed to protect the jobs and interests of Australian workers. We will support this bill because we do not want to cause any further uncertainty for the workers employed by Ansett in the event that they lose their jobs, but I would like to make it clear that we do not think that this levy is the best solution that could have been found to fix the problems that the government allowed to develop following the collapse of Ansett. 
The entitlements package proposed by the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business is inadequate because it does not provide 100 per cent of the entitlements due to the workers. These are entitlements that have been legitimately and legally accrued. The government has arbitrarily decided that these entitlements and conditions are not normal, that they are not legitimate and that they should not be funded under the scheme. Instead, they have come up with the term `statutory entitlements' to put a limit on the legitimate entitlements of the Ansett workers. We have said that our scheme will cover 100 per cent of the entitlements, and the government has failed to match that. The government's inaction on the Ansett ownership issue and its failure to ensure sustainable competition has now caused another slug on family and businesses, higher air fares, fewer services to regional areas and between key regions, the collapse of yet another icon, job cuts and the failure of small businesses. 
Labor acknowledge the role of Air New Zealand's mismanagement of Ansett as a factor in this crisis, but it is blatantly obvious that it is also a consequence of negligent government. The government has announced a number of examples where small amounts, usually loans of $3 million, are being offered to regional operators. Whilst those amounts are making some difference, we simply say that it is not enough to counter our preference to see the airline operating again. The loans to regional areas are helpful, but they will not see the full resumption of services and all the jobs returned. But it is a start, though the resumption of a proper aviation system with sustainable competition, I have to say, seems beyond the reach of this government. The Labor Party, the administrator and this government know that there are at least a couple of groups out there willing to take a broader stake in returning the airline to the skies. A modest investment by the government, as Mr Kim Beazley has already called for of $150 million to $200-odd million, whether in equity or in loans, easily recoverable from the final sale of KSA, is an option which could have been considered. But the government seems indifferent as to whether or not Ansett keeps operating. Basically it is interested in bandaid interim solutions, not broader and more self-sustaining ones. 
This collapse has spread inconvenience, hurt and uncertainty for people and communities right across Australia. In my home state of Tasmania, interstate guest speakers and delegates have been unable to attend local conventions. Conferences have been cancelled, teams were unable to attend the veteran hockey tournament in Hobart, accommodation bookings and the tourist trade have collapsed. Tourists and residents alike have been hard-pressed to get in or out of the state as 85 per cent of passenger traffic across Bass Strait is by air. This is obviously not confined simply to Tasmania, but we do have particular problems. Clearly, there is Bass Strait—it is pretty difficult to drive across that! Similar effects have been felt across the entire country. It should be enough, I believe, to jolt any decent government into action. It is clear that as Ansett was imploding the Howard-Anderson government was prepared to walk away from the many thousands of people caught in this crisis: Ansett employees, their families and the travelling public. The government's complicity in the destruction of this great Australian icon, and with it the potential loss of up to 16,000 direct jobs and tens of thousands of indirect jobs, will not easily be forgotten. The plain fact is that the ramifications of the Ansett collapse will be felt across Australia for many years to come. Not only has its hurt the thousands of direct employees of Ansett but it will hurt many, many others who work for companies related to Ansett in catering, security, cleaning, clothing manufacturing and many other industries. 
Probably most importantly from my portfolio's perspective, it is another blow to regional Australia, a huge blow—and I see my colleagues here in the Senate will be making contributions in relation to this. Before this collapse Ansett played a key role in the operation of air services in regional Australia. Ansett formerly operated almost 100 regional routes, including servicing over 70 sites or routes exclusively. Regional Australia has just witnessed what it regards, I believe, as the final blow in the long list of failures by the coalition government to maintain basic services in regional Australia. Regional Australia needs access to these services so that distance from capital cities does not become an obstacle to prosperity, growth and economic development. Why should people be penalised because they do not live in a capital city? The collapse of Ansett lays to rest once and for all—if it had not already been lain to rest—the now infamous Nyngan agreement by the Prime Minister that there would be no more cuts to regional services, that there would be a red flashing light in every minister's office and that there would be a line drawn in the sand in relation to cuts to regional services. I recall, ironically, within two weeks of making the famous Nyngan declaration, Dr Ziggy Switkowski announced that 10,000 jobs would be cut from Telstra in regional Australia. 
Now the red light is flashing again, Prime Minister! In tourism the nation is facing a crisis of a magnitude not seen since the late 1980s, with hotels and motels across the nation bracing themselves for a massive downturn. The tourism industry has already been hit by a ticket tax that the government increased from $30 to $38 early this year, plus, as always, the job-destroying GST, which we witnessed was a factor in the redundancies of Coles Myer and the decision of Daimaru yesterday to withdraw from Australia. Labor showed at the time that the government was already collecting about $50 million more than it cost to pay for those services. We showed earlier this year that the government was also overcollecting aviation fuel taxes intended to subsidise regional control towers and aviation services. 
Tourism is a $60 billion a year business for Australia, an estimated one-third of which is generated in regional areas in Australia. Labor recognises that regional tourism faces a crisis and needs an investment now to save regional jobs and businesses now. Whilst the government does nothing, Labor has outlined a tourism rescue plan announced by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Kim Beazley, today. This plan will aim to get Ansett back in the air, protect jobs, boost airline seating capacity, revitalise regional tourism infrastructure, provide interim protection measures for tourism businesses and stimulate tourist demand. We have announced that Labor would invest $50 million for tourism business in concessional loans, give an immediate boost of $10 million to the Australian Tourist Commission's budget and double funding for regional tourism infrastructure through the Commonwealth regional tourism program. This is a responsible package. It is a rapid response to the extraordinary situation facing the Australian tourism industry, an industry which many regions in Australia rely on totally.
People should not have to suffer because the Minister for Transport and Regional Services was, as they say, asleep at the wheel. People should not have to suffer because he seemingly cannot cope with the impost of the job he has. Ansett did not need to fall over, and the transport minister could have acted and—as my colleague Martin Ferguson pointed out in the other place—should have acted to save it. Instead the government, under the guidance of the transport minister, did nothing and attempted to blame everybody else for its inaction. What an outrage when the transport minister allowed the travelling public, Ansett workers and their families to go to bed last night not knowing their future, even though he knew the company was about to collapse—and he knew the company was about to collapse. 
—What would Labor have done?
—I think you should go back to trying to get the RFA bill back in, Senator Watson. What an outrage that the minister allowed Ansett to continue to sell tickets on Thursday. He was unwilling to stand up and be honest and tell people exactly what state Ansett was in. And it is not as though he and the government did not know what the true state of Ansett was. There is no doubt that he did know. Despite the minister's denials, the evidence is overwhelming that he knew as long ago as late June and again in mid-August that Ansett was in diabolical trouble. There will be a Senate hearing tomorrow where I, together with my colleagues Senator O'Brien and Senator Forshaw, will have a look at this, to see to what extent the government was involved and to attempt to ascertain what information the government had prior to the collapse of Ansett. The Senate inquiry into that will commence tomorrow. We will not be giving up on this issue.
Come the next federal election—and it cannot come soon enough for people in regional Australia, might I say—people will get the chance to vent their anger at the dishonesty and disdain that has been heaped upon them by the transport minister by his calling Ansett a `carcass', which was a total insult to everybody. People know, in regional Australia particularly, that the nation needs a proper aviation plan that serves the best interests of the whole community. But, after this debacle, I think many people are questioning whether the current transport minister is up to it.
Friday, 14 September was a black day in Australian aviation history. It was a day when the Howard government showed us that they believed there was one rule for their own and another rule for ordinary Australians. The government's role in the fall of Ansett will be uncovered through the scrutiny processes of the Senate and in other ways, and as far as I can see it will come back to haunt it, at the next federal election, in regional Australia. Regional Australia is already hurting because of many of the measures that have been introduced by this government—something which I am sure will be amply expanded upon by my colleagues here in the Senate.",SENATE,<title>AIR PASSENGER TICKET LEVY (IMPOSITION) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,35,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2001-09-26,"—Tonight I rise on behalf of the Australian Democrats to support the Air Passenger Ticket Levy (Imposition) Bill 2001 and the Air Passenger Ticket Levy (Collection) Bill 2001. We do so on the basis that ensuring entitlements are paid to terminated Ansett workers is an immediate concern—not on the basis that this bill is necessarily the best way of doing that, nor on the basis that this bill addresses any of the underlying issues that have led to this debacle in the first place. Some 16,000 jobs have been lost as a result of the collapse of Ansett; over 72,000 other employees have been affected through related companies that have suffered losses of business as a result.
There are two related bills being considered here now. The first is the Air Passenger Ticket Levy (Imposition) Bill 2001. This bill will impose a levy on each ticket used for flights originating in Australia in order to ensure that some entitlements of Ansett employees are paid. The government will establish a special employees entitlements scheme for Ansett group employees, and this is the fund that will distribute the entitlements. The actual system for implementing the levy has not been determined and will, apparently, be determined in consultation with the airlines. Airlines will bear the cost of administration.
The second bill, which also comes into effect on 1 October, is the Air Passenger Ticket Levy (Collection) Bill 2001. The purpose of this bill is to collect the $10 levy charged to each ticket until some percentage of Ansett employee entitlements are satisfied, up to a limit of $500 million. It is with some concern that we note that the levy does not apply to inbound international visitors. According to the explanatory memorandum, the bill seeks to `minimise the impact of the levy on international inbound tourism'. Australian tourists and businesspeople travelling to Australian destinations or even to overseas destinations are effectively being told by this government that they are less important than the overseas visitor. This is doubly concerning because the overseas visitor is arriving in this country to a dollar devalued to the benefit of many overseas visitors. The bill will impose a certain level of regional disadvantage. Short haul, low cost flights will bear a disproportionate effect, and the impact on regional tourism and travel is likely to be greater. 
Part 4 of the bill sets out the offence, inspection and enforcement provisions of the bill, including the penalties that attach to the failure of an operator to lodge a monthly levy return. Proposed section 22 limits the total amount of the scheme to $500 million. Should the total entitlements requirement exceed that amount, the discretion for distribution of the entitlements will rest with the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business. The minister may determine which companies are eligible for entitlements and which entitlements are eligible for the scheme. There is no guidance in this bill as to which companies will be selected as eligible for the scheme, which entitlements will be eligible, how distributions will be made, when they should be made and in what amounts. Proposed section 22(2) permits the minister to determine the `entitlements to be covered by the scheme' and the `terms on which payments under the scheme are to be made'. The discretion in the distribution of the funds has the potential to cause additional pain to Ansett employees unless clear, accountable and equitable distribution guidelines are implemented.
We Democrats understand the need to cap the scheme—it cannot operate in perpetuity or without limit. That would benefit neither the government nor the employees. But if there is to be a cap, then the discretion given to the minister as to the entitlements is completely unacceptable. This bill needs to be far clearer regarding who gets paid, when and how much. 
The Democrats originally drafted two amendments to section 22 making any determination under subsection (1) a disallowable instrument and ensuring that the basis for selecting or excluding companies from eligibility was clear. This would have ensured that the parliament had oversight in relation to any determination and would have ensured that the process of selecting eligible companies and eligible entitlements would not be politicised. The Democrats have decided, however, not to move one of those amendments simply because of timing. The amendment seeking to make determinations disallowable would require further sittings of parliament. Further sittings are unlikely, which means that the entire scheme would then have been delayed as a result. This simply points again to the chronic haphazard nature of the government, particularly in their recent lack of legislative process and accountability. 
The scheme, while more generous than the situation that has traditionally faced Australian workers who have lost their jobs and entitlements through no fault of their own, will still fall far short of satisfying the actual entitlements of so many Ansett employees. Many Ansett employees are longstanding and have great loyalty to their employer. A high proportion have many years of service in the company and the offer to underwrite their entitlements to the limit of eight weeks redundancy will represent a loss of thousands of dollars to their actual legal entitlements. This is regrettable. Loyalty should have its rewards and to deny so many longstanding employees their entitlements implies a penalty for such loyalty.
It is also the case that many Ansett employees share a family loyalty and affiliation with the company. There are many examples of intergenerational employment with Ansett and of couples who both worked with the company. This means that many families and extended families are now reeling from the loss of their jobs and the loss of their legitimate entitlement to much larger redundancy pay. Of course the great majority of these employees do not want redundancy at all; they want their jobs. Our highest priority must remain getting Ansett back into the air one way or another. 
Our other main priority must be to ensure that entitlements of Ansett employees are met to the greatest extent possible by their employers, Ansett companies. We must not lose sight of what these entitlements largely are. They are the earned income of employees. They are payment for services already rendered—for holidays and long service that have already been accumulated. They should be paid by the Ansett group of companies, not by the flying public or the taxpayer, as is the case in the government's other stopgap measure, the Employee Entitlements Support Scheme, which offers some protection to employee entitlements for non-Ansett workers.
We note that the government has upgraded the terms of that scheme of late to come close to those available to Ansett workers. But make no mistake: many non-Ansett workers out there are very angry because they have faced long waits in getting their entitlements paid out of this scheme and resent the government's knee-jerk response, in a highly politicised environment, to the needs of those working in a big company like Ansett when many, many employees in smaller companies, in less dramatic circumstances, have also lost.
I note the advice of the Bills Digest that points out that the entitlement payment available to Ansett workers is superior to those available to other workers who are made redundant and apply for assistance under the government's new scheme, the General Employee Entitlement Redundancy Scheme, GEERS. I ask the government to please clarify what appears to be straightforward inequity between the two schemes. Is it the case that under EESS employees are paid their entitlements at the usual weekly pay rate without any cap while under GEERS the pay rate is capped at $75,200? If this is the case, what is the rationale for the cap for one and not for the other? If this is correct, it seems straightforwardly discriminatory against non-Ansett workers and will inflame those already aware of the quick action that the government has taken in a pre-election climate for one set of workers while others face long delays and worse terms.
In some of the non-Ansett cases that have been drawn to the attention of the Democrats in recent days, employees have lost much more than their wages, long service, annual leave, pay in lieu of notice and redundancy pay. Some have lost their superannuation. In one case a group of employees discovered that their bankrupt employer had not made contributions to their superannuation fund for some years. This has understandably devastated employees and it requires very substantial legal and financial resources from these devastated employees to take action to pursue their legitimate entitlements. 
All of these experiences are a powerful action for a systematic national approach to the protection of employee entitlements in Australia. We cannot have companies dipping into employees' wages and entitlements and, more than that, they should not be able to dip into their actual bank accounts. Even long established national icons like Ansett cannot, under some management regimes at least, be trusted to preserve employees' entitlements. The temptation to dip into them, when companies come under financial pressure, is too great for too many managers. We need a national scheme and we need it as soon as possible. Employers must be required to establish separate trusts for earned entitlements or to undertake appropriate insurance measures, and it is clear that we need to legislate to establish these requirements. Many European countries already do so, and we are way behind the pack.
Instead, we are establishing real expertise in the knee-jerk response. We may be feeding a corporate dependence or expectation of government bail-out in such circumstances. If companies know that the government will step into the breach when things go wrong, then some may well be encouraged to clean out the coffers before calling in the administrators. This is bad policy: it is bad for the taxpayers and, in the case of Ansett, it is bad for future travellers, regional communities and the tourism and travel industries. They are paying the price for the mismanagement of the Ansett group of companies and their failure to face up to obligations.  
The first priority of the government must be to pursue these companies so that they meet as much of the debt of entitlements of their employees as possibly can be extracted. We Democrats certainly hope that the $500 million cap is sufficient to cover all entitlements that are part of the scheme, but no-one really knows how far $500 million will go. That is a massive amount of money. Employees of Ansett estimated before the company went into receivership that they would need significantly less than this in order to purchase the company and have an employee owned airline. Unfortunately, the government failed dismally to respond to opportunities to keep Ansett in the air. They failed to respond to these warnings. If they had, we may have found that this debacle cost the taxpayer nothing in the long term. Instead, the government has tried to make a virtue of their failures by agreeing to pay entitlements.
We must remember that this scheme does not find jobs for the 16,000 former employees. It does not retrain them. It does not cover the cost of mortgages, school expenses or commitments made in the expectation by many employees that they would be with the company for the long haul. It does not protect them during any period they may have to wait in order to receive their entitlements.
The response of the government has been better than nothing, but we should be under no illusion that the response has been a good one or an intelligent one. In fact, one does not have to be too cynical to say that, if Ansett employees have had any good luck in the last three weeks, it is in the fact that we are close to an election. Had an election not been on the horizon, one legitimately could have expected the government's response to be a little different.
We might remember too that the flying Australian public will be paying the earned entitlements: the past obligations of a corporate entity. This bill does not constitute a solution to the wrong people paying this particular debt. It is clear that longer term changes are needed. The government cannot continue to protect workers' rights because of corporate collapse, corporate incompetence or corporate asset stripping. A national systematic response to employer provision of entitlements is sorely needed, and we are yet to see a policy on that from either the ALP or the coalition.
After the collapse of One.Tel, the Prime Minister foreshadowed legislation that would allow bonuses paid to company directors to be reclaimed if companies failed. We have seen nothing since, and the bonuses paid to Air New Zealand directors while 16,000 workers struggle to receive earned entitlements should be haunting this government.
On three occasions since 1998, the Democrats have put forward amendments to Corporations Law to make related companies liable for the debts, including entitlements debts, of insolvent companies. Those amendments were in accordance with a recommendation of the Australian Law Reform Commission in 1988. On every occasion, the government has rejected those amendments.
How many more companies are going to collapse? How many more publicly funded rescue packages will there be, while company directors run home with large bonuses, before this government actually tackles the root of the issue? This bill is a product of exactly the sort of poll driven legislation that has produced the appalling and antidemocratic migration bills we have been debating this week.
The Democrats support this bill, with amendments, because the employees of Ansett should not be the ones made to suffer for the failures of the corporation and its parent companies and the failures of the Australian government in its determination that the best government is no government. The government's failure to face up to the long-term challenge of employee entitlements means that the Australian community is paying a high price for its policy failure.",SENATE,<title>AIR PASSENGER TICKET LEVY (IMPOSITION) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,35,1
"West, Sen Sue",ALP,2001-09-26,"—I join in this debate tonight on the Air Passenger Ticket Levy (Imposition) Bill 2001 and Air Passenger Ticket Levy (Collection) Bill 2001 to continue to express my concerns about what is happening—or, probably more to the point, what is not happening—in regional and rural New South Wales, the state I represent, and in the rest of regional Australia, I suspect, in terms of the ramifications of the Ansett crash. We are having here a ticket levy applied so that the workers at least can get some—and `some' must be the word underlined—of their entitlements. These people, who have worked for Ansett, many of them for many decades, and given valuable service—and, of course, those who have worked for and given valuable service to the subsidiaries of Ansett—face a very uncertain future, and that has to be addressed. 
If this government had been fair dinkum about this issue, it would have addressed this several years ago when we, as an opposition, moved numerous private members bills to address the issue of workers' entitlements. This is not the first company to go belly up, to go into receivership or to go into administration. We have had a whole litany of them this year and, I suspect, there are more to come—some of them because of the GST, but that is not the case here. This is an issue that we all should be concerned about. I am sorry that we are here tonight debating this issue because, if the government had agreed with our legislation, we would not be debating this legislation.
We keep hearing about how the planes are flying. They are flying in regional areas to some ports—some ports only. Qantas has maintained its flights to its ports in rural and regional Australia. But what of Hazelton and Kendell? We have not seen Kendell back in the air in or into New South Wales yet, but Hazelton is flying to some ports. It used to fly to Wagga, Griffith, Narrandera, Parkes, Bathurst, Merimbula and Moruya, just to name a few. How many of those flights, may I ask, have been resuscitated? I will tell you: not too many. Bathurst is still waiting, Parkes is still waiting, Narrandera is still waiting and the South Coast, I think, is still waiting. Flights are going into Orange—that is fine. Orange now has three flights a day. It used to have four flights of its own, but it now has to service the much larger area of Bathurst, Orange, Parkes and Cudal, just to name a few. But the interesting thing is that there are restrictions on being able to purchase a ticket. No longer will the airlines take MCOs and no longer are account holders able to use their accounts; it is cash up front. That is rather an imposition on many people. But that is okay, we can get over that.
I went through some old tickets I had in my drawer and discovered that in June of this year I took a flight from Orange to Sydney and it cost me about $156 or $158 one way. When I fly home on Friday—and because of the initial restrictions they had on, I have had to pay for the ticket already with my credit card and will have to claim the money back from DOFA, which is a bit of a nuisance—that flight will cost me $210.55. That is an increase of over $50 on a $150-odd ticket. Professor Fels makes a great thing about competition and price. I sure as hell hope he starts looking a this, because I think it is nothing more than blatant rip-off.
Let us look at Broken Hill. My state colleague there flew in early September, a few days before the crash. The return air flight cost $877.80. I am trying to visit Broken Hill next week. I will not be flying to get there; I will be travelling on the Indian Pacific. Coming home, the ticket is going to cost $466.20 just one way. That adds up to a total, in my maths, of $932.40. I might be wrong, but it is in the vicinity of again being close to $60 dearer for that return flight.
—Who pays for it?
—In my case, the taxpayer pays for it, but what about the people out there who do not have the same access to travel entitlements that my state colleague and I do. This is the only flight in and out of Broken Hill at this stage. People wait with bated breath to see if the Adelaide flight with Kendell gets resumed. They hope and they pray, but they have already lost a large conference on mining at the beginning of next week. Add to that the fact that Pasminco is in voluntary administration. They are not feeling very happy with the world and are not very happy with this government. They are suffering and struggling very hard.
Today I just wanted to bring to people's attention the fact that we might have some planes flying, we might have some services, but the flights are reduced in number and they are more expensive. That is going to have a major impact on regional Australia and on industry in regional Australia. I think, for example, of Bathurst, with a population of 30,000-plus. It has quite a diversified infrastructure and economic base. It has a number of private boarding schools where the kids are about to start school holidays. There are a number of children there who board at those schools and whose parents are Australian expats working in overseas countries. Those children are going to have great difficulty actually getting out of Bathurst to go to Sydney to catch their connecting flights.  
We have Uncle Ben's, Devro and Simplot. Uncle Ben's have their own aircraft and use charters, because they have an Albury plant and there is a lot of communication between the two plants and a charter that runs regularly there. But what about the other industries? People from Simplot may wish to visit and have meetings in that group of companies. The meeting could be in Manly, in Brisbane, in Tasmania or in New Zealand. How are they going to get there? If they had a meeting in Brisbane, Adelaide or Melbourne, they could do the flight in one day. Not any more. They will have to get up at 4 o'clock in the morning to travel up to Orange to get a flight out—if they are lucky enough to get on a flight.
In Orange we have the state headquarters of the department of agriculture. People there use aircraft travel quite a bit to move around the state. They use regular passenger transport services. The airline crash will have an impact on the running and the efficiency of those departments. It will also do terrible things to their budgets. There will be an increased cost of administration for all the Commonwealth and state departments that are registered in Orange.
Not this weekend but the following weekend we have the Bathurst car races. That is a major tourism event in Australia—and internationally if you are a car racing fan. Normally Hazelton or whichever airline runs into Bathurst runs a number of additional flights, and many charter aircraft come in. The crash of Ansett will mean a reduction in the availability of charter aircraft. It will have an impact on the race and on Bathurst's income from that race—on the tourism and the tourists that go to the area. 
I know the vast majority of those people drive, but a significant number fly. We cannot afford to be missing out on even a couple of hundred people not flying, because they tend to be the biggest spenders—they are the ones who can afford to charter. They are often the companies or the racing syndicates. This will inconvenience them. One has to ask what will be the long-term impact. Those that can get seats will find that they are up for additional money. That has an impact on their bottom line and their budget. It is very important that we not lose sight of the fact that people are saying that there are flights. The number of flights is down and the costs are up—and significantly up. I would be fascinated to know why the costs seem to have risen by about $50 to $60 a return ticket. That is of concern to me. 
Yesterday my staff went to Harvey World Travel in Orange to seek flight costs. For Orange to Sydney they were quoted $421 return. But when they asked what was the previous cost, they were told that was confidential. They would not tell them the previous cost of the tickets prior to the Ansett crash. That is very interesting. It is puzzling. I might ask some more questions about that at a later date.
If you want to fly in and out of Dubbo now with Hazelton, it will cost you $488.16. For Broken Hill, the figure is $900-odd. For Griffith it is $586.74. The poor old people from Narrandera drive up the road to Griffith or down to Wagga and pay nearly $600 return. That is big money. We are talking about something that is not accessible to the ordinary person becoming even more inaccessible. 
It is very hard to find out when these flights are available and bookings can be made only about one week in advance. There are no cheap flights, because they are all booked out. The planes are full of people who are desperate to fly, and they have to pay the full fare. Those who want to take the cheaper flights are certainly having great difficulty accessing them. In fact, I doubt there would be any available. The impact of this is of major concern to me, and I think we need to keep this issue in our sights. It is not just an issue of availability on the trunk routes; it is an issue about the impact that this is having on regional Australia. When you go to regional Australia you have the issue of employment, and consequently tourism, and the whole economy of these regional and rural areas stands to be battered quite severely by this particular occurrence. ",SENATE,<title>AIR PASSENGER TICKET LEVY (IMPOSITION) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,35,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2001-09-26,"—I rise to speak on the Air Passenger Ticket Levy (Imposition) Bill 2001 and the Air Passenger Ticket Levy (Collection) Bill 2001. To get the correct perspective on this issue relating to Ansett, I believe we need to go back and look at a series of incidents that occurred approximately in the early 1980s. At that time, Qantas was allowed to take over Australian Airlines. An international carrier, effectively government owned, was allowed to consume a domestic carrier— again, a primarily government backed function. This allowed Qantas to operate overseas on the more lucrative international runs while it upgraded its domestic fleet over some period of years. At the same time, Ansett applied for an international licence and was knocked back. That is significant because, for the two operators operating within Australia, we had two vastly different sets of circumstances. Basically, we had the government backed airline, Qantas, flying both internationally and domestically—and it was unrestricted—while its free enterprise competition, Ansett, was effectively muzzled from being able to access those more lucrative overseas routes.
As a result of those events, along with a series of incidents over the 1990s and coming forward into 2000 and 2001, we are now seeing Australian's icons—that is, our well-established, profitable Australian based companies—gradually being taken over by larger international corporations so that the decisions relating to those companies and their operations within Australia are being made in boardrooms in New Zealand, Singapore and London. There is no fallout in the economies of those counties, whereas the economy within Australia can suffer potentially dangerous and disastrous effects. Very sadly, there is no greater example of that than Ansett itself.
This shocking collapse of Ansett, basically overnight, should be a lesson to the government that you cannot have your essential services deregulated or controlled by foreign companies. The Ansett crisis means massive job losses and the slashing of more services to rural Australia, and that will have an untold effect on our tourist markets. The small companies—the motels and the private hotels—around Australia that have been participating in airline package sales, in some cases for up to 60 days and in a few cases up to 90 days, will be providing services that they no longer will be paid for. The impact of that alone will drive an unknown number to the wall.
The collapse of Ansett is a serious blow to rural and regional Australia. Up to 30 regional destinations will be affected. In some cases, Ansett was the only service to those provincial cities, and our rural heartland cannot be denied the right to air services. Like all other senators, I have been receiving a copious amount of correspondence and emails on this issue. I would like to quote from one communication that was sent to me today. The subject is the Ansett update, and it comes from ansett.news@hotmail.com. It states:
The wet-leasing of jets to QANTAS has fallen through. Indications are that this is due to the lack of rotables (spares) which are reported to have been repatriated to New Zealand.
If this is the case, there are substantial issues that the liquidator or the administrator will need to look into. The email went on to refer to a second issue. It said:
Information reaching the newsletter desk is that the A320 simulator was transferred (purchased) for a nominal sum by Air NZ from Ansett one week before the collapse and the asset moved onto the Air NZ books. It was then leased back to Ansett!!
If we have seen transfers of assets from Ansett to Air New Zealand within that short period, I believe that should be seen in the same light as a preferential payment to a creditor in a bankruptcy issue, and the value of any such assets should, I believe, be redeemed back to the Ansett administrator. The email went on to say: 
On an equally serious note we have received information that union and sickness payments (ie: insurance) have not been paid to relevant bodies since June. It is reported that the deductions were made from salary but not paid through. We understand that claims on health insurance have not been honoured because of failed payments.
That is another serious issue and I believe we need to go to this type of correspondence from the people who are being affected by this collapse to have a real understanding of the issues. Quoting once again from the update, it says:
Since the Ansett collapse this newsletter has been calling on the government to consider bridging or long term loans—not a bail out—to enable Ansett core operations to resume flying. By sequestering debt, enabling non-core asset sell off and providing for core flight operations to resume at least there is a chance for some staff to retain employment and for creditors to obtain payment. The whole is greater than the sum of the parts and its integral operation delivers service and competition to the Australian market as well as cash flow to the company ...
The heads of ASIC, APRA (Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority) and ACCC are conspicuous by their absence at this time. Not surprising. This newsletter has been advocating that these heads roll and we do not move from that position ...
And our concern continues regarding the ACTU, TWU and ASU's continuing stance against contract employment for Ansett staff. Their belligerence and self interest is causing realistic options for Ansett to resume flying or to be purchased to be scuttled. They are supposed to represent the interests of their members, us. Not the interests of a small group of organizers and power seekers ...
It is likely that even with pick up from Virgin Blue and QANTAS that any new version of Ansett would require no more than 6-8,000 people to operate the entire group. Ansett was overstaffed before and suffering under entrenched salary and perquisite demands from certain sectors. Any new Ansett will not be sustainable under those conditions and the union movement needs to understand that. We would all like to get on with our lives so we appeal to our so called representatives to make a deal or get out of the way.
I believe that is the important issue. Personal, political and economic issues need to be put out of the way and we need to look at this issue on its merits, and those merits include the competition that is needed within the Australian aviation industry, the secondary companies that are going to suffer as a result of this and, more importantly, the rights of employees.",SENATE,<title>AIR PASSENGER TICKET LEVY (IMPOSITION) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,35,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2001-09-26,"—I seek leave to incorporate the speeches of Senators Crossin, Hutchins and Gibbs in Hansard.
Leave granted.
Senator Crossin's speech read as follows—
The objective of these bills is to alleviate the consequences of the failure of the Howard government to attempt to keep Ansett flying.
Under this bill the levy will be payable on each ticket issued on or after 1 October 2001 for an Australian regular public transport flight that originates in Australia.
Once again the Australian taxpayer has to pay for this Government's incompetence.
There is no doubt that Australia's $60 billion dollar tourism industry has been shocked by a Howard Government plan to impose a new airline ticket tax to help fund the unpaid entitlements of Ansett employees.
The Ansett collapse and the government's proposed response to partially meet the entitlements of the sacked Ansett workers will impact disproportionately on regional Australia, by imposing this new tax on tourism.
The Howard Government has imposed a GST on the industry, increased the departure tax and cut funding to the Australian Tourist Commission. Now, having been grossly negligent in its handling of the Ansett issue and failing to put in place an effective scheme for protecting employee entitlements, the Howard Government wants to hit Australia's tourism sector yet again.
By doing so, the Government is putting at risk tens of thousands of jobs in the tourism sector which has already been rocked by Ansett's collapse and the crisis in the United States. Many of those jobs will be lost in rural and regional Australia where the Ansett collapse will be felt most.
In the wake of the U.S. crisis and the collapse of Ansett, Australia's tourism industry was looking for assistance from the Government. Instead, it will get a new job destroying tax.
This is clearly the case for the Northern Territory which, because of its distance from the Eastern cities, relies heavily on airline travel.
I want to begin by highlighting the impact on the Territory but also on Ansett workers and people involved in doing business with Ansett. 
Ansett was responsible for around 48 per cent of passenger movements in and out of the Northern Territory. One million people were carried by Ansett in the Northern Territory in the 12 months to June this year.
With Ansett's domestic and intrastate flights, inbound and outbound there were 52 movements each day in and out of the Northern Territory, and Ansett served 22 Territory destinations.
While Ansett had 144 direct employees in the Northern Territory there are another 700 jobs just in the Northern Territory that will be directly affected as a result of the collapse of Ansett.
People in mining, tourism, fresh seafood, early mango harvesting, catering, fresh herbs, cut flowers, cleaning., entire communities in regional Northern Territory, are all on the record as having been seriously affected by the Ansett collapse, as these businesses rely on air transport to supply and move these goods
No cheap fares available, which had been a major incentive to attracting tourists to the Northern Territory and in fact there are very limited flights now that there is only one major airline coming into the NT.
The salaries of Ansett workers contributed about $ 10 million per year to the Territory economy.
Nearly 2000 tonnes of perishables, 42 tonnes of livestock, 34 tonnes of mail, 8 tonnes of newspapers and another 7000 tonnes of other goods made up Ansett freight exports over the same period.
Ansett contribution to direct tourism amounted to 49,490 room nights in the Territory, or $7.3 million dollars into the Territory economy.
Tourism is one of the Territory's most important industries - being worth $1.5 billion annually - either directly or indirectly - to the NT's economy, and employing over 11,600 people.
However the tourism industry in the Territory, and Australia generally, has already been hit hard by the collapse of Ansett, the reduction in international tourism resulting from the recent terrorist attacks in the United States, the implementation of the GST, and now it is faced with the imposition of a $ 10 levy on air tickets.
However as most of us realise this levy is really a new tax - a tax on tourism.
For example in Central Australia where tourism represents about 50% of the local economy, air capacity to Ayers Rock Resort and Alice Springs has dropped from 5,500 to 3,625 a week.
However I am pleased that Labor leader, Kim Beazley has announced Labor's plans for a rescue package for the tourism industry.
Coupled with the impact of the US terrorist attacks, Ansett's demise has brought into sharp focus the importance of the tourism industry to jobs and job security, particularly in regional Australia.
With 87,700 full-time jobs lost since the GST was introduced; up to 73,000 jobs at risk from the Ansett collapse; and large-scale job losses being announced around the country, an immediate response to this crisis is vital.
Given Ansett's domination of the regional market, regional tourism markets have been particularly adversely affected by the airline's collapse.
Some in the Howard Government ministry would have us believe this disaster is nothing more than a little blip on our national radar.
Labor knows the net effect of these crises on our tourism industry is unparalleled in the industry's history.
The current situation has exposed serious deficiencies in the Howard Government's approach to our tourism industry.
Labor is ready to take on the challenges posed by the combined effect of the Ansett collapse and the US crisis. We need to make an investment now, or pay much more later.
When major industries are hit by a crisis, Australian Governments have traditionally responded - drought assistance to rural industries; adjustment assistance to manufacturers; recent packages for the dairy and sugar industries. Labor believes that an industry employing around 1 million Australians merits a response now.
That is why Labor today outlined a plan to rescue the tourism industry.
This plan will aim to get Ansett back in the air, protect jobs, boost airline-seating capacity, revitalise regional tourism infrastructure, provide interim protection measures for tourism businesses, and stimulate tourist demand.
This package is a responsible and rapid response to the extraordinary situation facing the Australian tourism industry, especially in rural and regional Australia.
While Federal Tourism Minister, Jackie Kelly has simply responded to the impact of the Ansett collapse on tourism by describing it as a `blip', Labor has come up with a concrete plan to help Australia's struggling tourism industry.
Labor's rescue plan for the tourism industry includes 50 million for concessional loans for tourism businesses, an additional $ 10 million funding for tourism marketing and to double funding for the Regional Tourism Program 
As I have mentioned as a result of this Government's incompetence, passengers are being asked to pay an additional ten dollars of each ticket.
What we have not been told is whether the GST will apply on the new tax as well - knowing this Howard Government, I think it probably will.
The $10 levy will be incorporated in the price of the ticket you will then pay for the GST on top of that.
Last week I called on the Howard Government to reimburse the 10% GST to those Territorians who paid for dishonoured Ansett tickets by means other than credit cards.
The Federal Treasurer, Peter Costello has confirmed the Howard Government would keep the GST paid on Ansett tickets for flights after September 13, despite the fact the tax was paid for a service that was never delivered.
Many Territorians who paid for their tickets up-front by cash or cheque will lose the whole amount. The GST alone can be over $ 100 on a full price fare.
For the business sector there is a double whammy, with the Australian Tax Office confirming last week that businesses that have already claimed a GST credit on unused Ansett tickets would be to repay the tax, even though they never got to take the flight.
“GST-registered businesses which have paid the airline for cancelled supplies are not entitled to a GST credit and should not claim the credits if they are sure the supply will not be made regardless of whether they have received an adjustment note. If they have already claimed a GST credit on a Business Activity Statement (BAS) they will need to make an increasing adjustment. “
ATO Media Release 21/9/2001
Now we know what Mr Costello really meant when he promised Australians a new tax system - he meant a tax system where even when the airlines is grounded and your ticket is dishonoured, you still pay the GST on the flight you never got to take.
As I have mentioned, Australians are being asked to pay for this Federal Government's incompetence in its lack of competence in dealing with this matter.
The Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister were warned back in June that Ansett would go under unless the Singapore option was allowed to be pursued.
And what has this Government done? Very little - They have simply sat on their hands and watch jobs disappear as the airline collapsed.
Where is the national rescue package for the airline industry or a contingency plan for other industries who may be looking at picking up this business in whatever way is possible.
Minister Anderson is only talking of the short-term fixes, not of the things that will permanently get Ansett up and running.
Right around this country now, and certainly in the Northern Territory, people are starting to understand how difficult life is without sufficient flights with available seats.
The SMH reported today (Wednesday 26th September) that there are no full economy seats available from Sydney to Darwin at least until next Tuesday. This is untenable situation and will cripple a wide range of businesses in the Northern Territory.
And when seats are available, people can't afford the prices. A full economy return airfare from Darwin to Canberra is over $1400 and now there is a ticket levy on top of that.
As a result tourism in the Territory. which relies on availability and affordability has taken a nose-dive.
From the day this crisis began, Labor has been making constructive suggestions and have been mocked and criticised for it.
As every day passes, it is more and more obvious that we were right and that if the Howard Government had acted earlier the situation might not be so drastic and urgent.
Overseas experience after deregulation has shown that when airlines start cutting down on their maintenance costs, it's usually because they are in trouble.
We all remember vividly the grounding of Ansett planes back in Easter.
Instead of getting planes back in the air, they have ensured that we have now a total monopoly in the Northern Territory. While Virgin has made noises about starting a service to the NT, there is currently no competition.
What will be the result for Territorians?
As we know there is a new $ 10 tax and there will probably be increased airfares.
It will be interesting to see how many cheap airfares will be made available.
And what does need clarifying is whether the $10 levy will apply to frequent flyer redemption tickets.
And the winners out of all of this will be Qantas (with a higher market share and the ability to either charge higher prices or offer less discount fares) and the Federal Government which stands to collect more in GST as a result of the higher airfares. 
The government has announced that Ansett employees' entitlements for wages, annual or long service leave and pay in lieu of notice are to be met in full except with respect to redundancy, which will only be funded up to eight weeks.
I personally don't believe that is good enough. I believe that they should receive the full entitlements of workers should be paid. If it was good enough for the company of Stan Howard, the Prime Minister's brother, than ANSETT employees deserve just the same treatment.
Labor introduced legislation to guarantee 100% of workers entitlements but this legislation was blocked by the Howard Government.
The unwillingness of the Federal Government to guarantee 100% of workers entitlements means many Ansett workers will lose substantial amounts of money - money that is due to them and money they will need in the future.
I want to illustrate the impact the Government's failure to guarantee all of the workers entitlements will have with the following two examples.
One Ansett employee with 14 years of service will end up under the Federal Government's scheme with only $23,040 in entitlements (made up of unpaid wages, annual leave, lieu in notice, redundancy and long service leave) as opposed to $45,840 that he is owed.
Another employee with 16 years of service will get $20,955.00 instead of the $42,075 owed to them.
In conclusion let me say that Labor is supporting this bill but only as a last resort.
Labor will support the bill because we do not want to cause any further grief or uncertainty for the workers employed by Ansett if they lose their jobs.
However we are under no illusions, the Federal government is inadequate because it does not provide 100% of the entitlements due to workers.
We should also be clear the $ 10 levy is a tax on tourism.
It is yet another broken promise by this Howard Government not to introduce any new taxes.
We should not forget that this tax is being imposed as a result of the incompetence of the Howard government.
Ansett collapsed because of the failure of the Howard Government to take action to ensure Ansett kept flying and now their actions will have a major impact on the tourism industry.
Senator Gibbs's speech read as follows—
I rise today to speak on the Air Passenger Ticket Levy (Collection) Bill 2001 and the Air Passenger Ticket Levy (Imposition) Bill 2001. I must say, at the outset, that this bill is one that we shall support. It is one we shall support; but only as a last resort. The government has forced the taxpayers of Australia, the air passengers of Australia and the former employees of Ansett into this position.
And none of them want to be here in this position. Neither do we.
There are a number of reasons we are discussing this bill at this time. The first and most obvious of which, is the collapse of Ansett. There has been good news this evening about some Ansett planes getting back up in the air. At this point let me say that I hope even more of the once-proud air carrier can be up and flying as soon as possible. So when I refer to the collapse of Ansett I don't mean to suggest that some of its planes and some of its staff won't be used again. But I hold little hope that there is any chance the entire company will be resurrected in its pre-collapse form.
Ansett is gone. We won't see it back in Australian skies in the exact form we are used to.
We are also discussing these bills at this time because of the Government's failure to put into place any scheme that effectively guaranteed workers' entitlements. The Government has had to scramble to get these provisions into place rather than spend time on actually getting planes back in the air.
The most distressing element of the Ansett collapse is the loss of employment for more than 16,000 workers. Everyone from pilots to caterers; from engineers to check-in counter operators has lost their job because of the collapse of Ansett. And that doesn't take into account the impact on the entire Australian workforce, which I will return to later. On top of that we saw thousands and thousands of people left stranded because of the collapse. We saw thousands and thousands of people who had to scramble for refunds and to book alternate travel.
Two weeks ago the Labor Party said the pressure was on the Deputy Prime Minister John Anderson to determine the fate of workers entitlements and the immediate fate of hundreds of small and medium-sized businesses that were major Ansett suppliers. The pressure was on the Deputy Prime Minister John Anderson to make the difference between economic and aviation chaos or an orderly resolution of Ansett's problems. He failed that test. He made the decision to abandon workers, abandon small businesses, abandon critical services for movement of passengers and freight. 
But they already have form. The Howard Government long ago made a decision to abandon Australian workers and Australia's regions. The Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and Deputy Prime Minister John Anderson have refused Labor's attempts to put in place legislation to stop asset stripping like we have seen with Air New Zealand's gutting of Ansett. The Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and Deputy Prime Minister John Anderson have refused Opposition attempts to put in place Kim Beazley's sensible system to guarantee worker entitlements. The Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and Deputy Prime Minister John Anderson have boasted about aviation competition that is now confirmed as unsustainable. The Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and Deputy Prime Minister John Anderson were told what was coming with Air New Zealand and did nothing - they left it to the market and the dire consequences are before us now.
After the collapse of Ansett, the Government announced employees' entitlements for wages, annual and long service leave and pay in lieu of notice were to be met in full, with redundancies paid out to only eight weeks. The Government set up a Special Employees' Entitlements Scheme for that purpose. The scheme is to be funded by a $ 10 levy on airline tickets.
The two bills we are discussing here impose the levy and make arrangements for its collection on a certain range of air passenger tickets. The levy will be payable on each air ticket issued from October 1 this year onwards for an Australian regular public transport flight that originates in Australia.
The Labor Party supports this bill; but only insofar as we support the full payment of entitlements to workers whose employment is terminated as a result of insolvency. The Labor Party is calling on the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, to give Ansett employees the same support he gave his brother, Stan. The Howard Government has again shown that it believes it is one rule for its own and one rule for ordinary Australians. The Prime Minister, Mr Howard, was happy to bail out his brother's company, but not Ansett workers.
Labor supported assistance to the dairy industry when they were in trouble and other rural industries—now the Deputy Prime Minister John Anderson must concede that the aviation industry has the same needs. Fundamentally, Air New Zealand is responsible and they should be pursued. But in the meantime, the Australian Government must show some compassion to the workers employed by Ansett, its subsidiaries and the related support industries.
We have stated publicly that we will support the levy as a last resort. But Labor is calling on the Government to fix aviation policy. The Deputy Prime Minister John Anderson has made a terrible mess of the whole thing. He has insulted thousands of former workers by this week referring Ansett as a `carcass'.
There are so many victims of this aviation disaster brought on by the Howard/Anderson Government that one hardly knows where to start. The employees are victims. The tourism industry is a victim. And air travellers are victims. All of these groups are victims because this Government has wasted time and countless of opportunities in putting into place an employee entitlement scheme that guarantees 100% of workers' entitlements, so now they need to slug an extra charge on travellers.
There are two other aspects of this disaster that I would like to focus my speech on tonight and they are tourism and jobs. The crisis in America had already destabilised the tourism industry. The Ansett collapse on top of that means the tourism industry is in a lot of trouble.
I shouldn't have to explain to anyone here the importance tourism plays in Queensland. But given the Deputy Prime Minister John Anderson's approach to Ansett's problems in the leadup to the collapse, perhaps I should. Minister Anderson has totally bungled his handling of this issue for the past six months. That bungling will have a disastrous effect on tourism in Australia.
That bungling will have a terrible effect on the hundreds of thousands of jobs in Queensland that depend on tourism.
Maybe I should also take the time out to explain some things to Tourism Minister Jackie Kelly. Today, Labor announced a $60 million rescue package to help the tourist industry recover from the collapse of Ansett and the downturn in numbers following the American crisis. What has the Tourism Minister been doing at the same time - not much. Not much except saying that the collapse of Ansett was a `blip' on the tourism industry. Today the minister stood up in question time and told us that 90% of Ansett's passenger capacity would be restored by tomorrow. We'll be waiting to see if she is right.
I do not believe the tourism industry will collapse because of Ansett's demise. It won't. Queensland is a great place for both international and domestic travellers to visit and it will remain so. The sun will keep shining. We'll keep staging world-class events. But on top of the American crisis this is one thing the industry did not need. It is one thing the Government should have done more to stop from happening. 
It's a double blow because Queensland is such a decentralised state- you can't drive from the top of it to the bottom in under a day, like you can in some other states.
The respected economic forecaster Dr Peter Brain released data last week that showed 53,000 jobs would be lost in Australia as a direct result of the Ansett collapse. That does not include tourism-related jobs. 53,000 jobs. 53,000 people out of work and Mr Howard and Mr Anderson say the Government did as much as it could do. But that's not all. In addition to that Alan Midwood of Midwood Tourism and Development stated that an extra 20,000 jobs will be lost on top of this in the tourism sector.
That's a total of 73,000 jobs - 73,000 jobs on top of the ones lost when HIH went under, 73,000 jobs lost on top of the ones lost when OneTel went under. I support this bill but with reluctance. 
I support it because Ansett workers deserve something in return for the years they spent working for the air-carrier. 
But for that reason I also support our amendment that condemns the Government for the following:
·	Total incompetence and mismanagement of the Ansett ownership issue;
·	An employee entitlement scheme that does not meet 100% of workers' entitlements; 
·	Imposing another new tax on the Australian community that will hurt the tourist industry and therefore the economy and cost jobs;
·	Failing to protect the jobs and interests of Australian workers;
·	Leaving Australian communities without aviation services; jeopardising health and living standards;
·	Totally destroying the integrity of Australia's aviation policy;
·	Announcing that future unspecified levies may be imposed in order to ensure greater entitlement are paid than currently provided under the Government's flawed entitlements scheme; and
·	Not brokering a solution to the Ansett crisis that would save jobs, regional services and aviation competition”.
Senator Hutchins's speech read as follows—
I rise to speak on the Air Passenger Ticket Levy Bills.
My Labor colleagues have already indicated to the Senate that we will be supporting this Bill, but I would like to convey to the chamber tonight my absolute disgust with the Government's handling of the whole Ansett crisis.
I would in particular like to single out the poor performance of the Minister for Sport and Tourism, the Hon Jackie Kelly, in handling this crisis.
This Bill is nothing short of an attempt by the Government to stem the tide of resentment that is coming from ordinary Australians who are angry about the Government's failure to do anything to help workers suffering at the hands of these corporate collapses.
It is policy on the run, a quick fix solution, and a cynical attempt to control the ever-growing amount of damage that the Government is suffering from this issue.
This Bill will provide for sacked Ansett workers full entitlements for wages, annual or long service leave and pay in lieu of notice.
But it will, however, only partially fund Ansett workers' entitlements in respect of long service leave, which will only be funded up to eight weeks. What this means is that every Ansett worker who has worked for Ansett for more than four years is going to miss out on some of his or her entitlements.
Imagine if you were a loyal employee of Ansett who had worked for the company for thirty years, and then suddenly you're told that your job's gone. Then, to add insult to injury, you were told you'd only be getting paid out for 8 weeks of long service leave you had accrued over the years.
Imagine being left out in the cold like that by this heartless, opportunistic government.
What's more, this Bill will provide no money for workers employed in companies dependent upon Ansett for business that are going to lose or who have already lost their jobs.
Workers from companies like Gate Gourmet, who used to provide catering services to Ansett, aren't going to get anything from this Bill.
They've lost their jobs, and have probably acquired masses of entitlements for wages, annual or long service leave, and pay in lieu of notice.
And under this Government, they're not going to see a cent of it. Not yet anyway. They too, are being left out in the cold by this government.
And there are going to be a lot of people out there who are going to find themselves in this situation. There are 17,000 employees of Ansett who are now in the dole queue. 
And it's estimated that there are potentially up to 50,000 more jobs that could be lost in the fallout from the Ansett collapse. That's up to almost 70,000 hard-working
Australians who are going to find themselves jobless and missing out on their full entitlements.
And the Minister for Sport and Tourism has the audacity to get up in the House of Representatives and tell all those Australians that this crisis, this mess is just a `blip.'
17 000 jobs lost? Just a blip.
50 000 more at risk? Just a blip.
Thousands upon thousands of workers missing out on their full entitlements? Just a blip.
I often wonder with the Minister for Sport and Tourism if it is heartlessness, meanness and trickiness that steers her in the direction of these sorts of comments, or if it's just plain incompetence.
Perhaps it is just an unfortunate mixture of both. I don't know.
But one thing I do know is that it is these sort of gaffes that are fast revealing to the Australian people just how out of her depth the Minister for Sport and Tourism is when it comes looking after her portfolio, let alone as a member of this parliament.
Earlier this year, a newspaper article by Fia Cumming appeared in the Sun Herald entitled “Jumping Jackie Flash now the invisible woman. “
In the article the question of “Has anybody seen Jackie Kelly?” is posed, and the Minister for Sport and Tourism's performance is described as “the Case of the Dissappearing Minister.”
Allow me to quote from the article:
“In the whole month of March, the official Hansard record shows she (Kelly) said just a dozen words in three short interjections.”
For an entire month, the Minister responsible for an area that is one of Australia's leading industries said just twelve words - all of them interjections.
In fact, since becoming the Minister for Sport and Tourism, the Hon Jackie Kelly has only made eleven speeches on her own initiative about her portfolio in the House of Representatives. She made none last year, and has made only one this year.
The article also says that:
“She claimed she had not been seen much at national events this year because she had been focussing on her marginal electorate of Lindsay.”
But if you look through the Hansard records, you will note that since the last Federal election, the Minister for Sport and Tourism has not made one single speech about her electorate of Lindsay in the House of Representatives.
It has thus now been almost 1200 days since the Minister raised any issues of concern in her electorate in the parliament.
One such issue might be the recent job losses resulting from her Government's disastrous handling of the Ansett collapse.
This week, the Penrith City Star reported in an article entitled “Not Happy Jackie” that bus loads of sacked Ansett workers last week protested outside the Minister for Sport and Tourism's electorate office in Penrith.
The Minister for Sport and Tourism was invited to come and address the workers.
But in a remarkable display of contempt, the Minister for Sport and Tourism failed to even show up.
Given the gravity of the Ansett issue, and the level of anger that is being directed at the Minister for Sport and Tourism about her outrageous and contemptuous handling of it, you would think that the Minister would be making some sort of attempt to defend herself or her government, or perhaps even put out some sort of spin on the issue.
But if you log on to the Minister's web page, you'll notice that there is nothing at all about the current crisis facing Australia's tourism industry. Not one article. Not one press release. Not one piece of information about what the Minister for Sport and Tourism might be doing to fix the problem or the work she might be doing to try and secure the entitlements due to workers sacked because of the Ansett collapse.
Nothing.
This again just illustrates what an uncaring and lazy member of parliament the Minister for Sport and Tourism really is.
She's done nothing to alleviate this crisis.
More jobs are going to be lost, and the best answer this Government can give to those losses is a partial payment of sacked Ansett workers' entitlements.
What an outrage this Bill is, and what a heartless Government it is that's introduced it.",SENATE,<title>AIR PASSENGER TICKET LEVY (IMPOSITION) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,35,1
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2001-09-26,"—My apologies for my enthusiasm: it is probably because it is getting close to the last hour. Like my colleague, Senator Greig, I would like to speak on the Air Passenger Ticket Levy (Collection) Bill 2001 and the Air Passenger Ticket Levy (Imposition) Bill 2001, and to give them my support. Primarily, I call on the government to put in place a comprehensive, long-term policy to support the growth of the Australian tourism industry, because I think there is a need for that. I state at the outset that the Australian Democrats do not want to stand in the way of any lawful measures that will see some or most of the 16,500 Ansett workers receive their entitlements. We believe this has to happen for the simple reason that these entitlements are the right of those who have worked so hard over so many years to accrue them. 
It is also hard to understand why the tourism industry is being targeted once again as a source of funds, when the government finds itself in another critical situation and in need of large amounts of money. As senators would recall, almost three months ago to the day this chamber was debating the Passenger Movement Charge Amendment Bill 2001. At that time we saw an increase of some 30 per cent in the cost of departure tax on all airline and cruise ship tickets. That tax hike was essentially to fund the government's measures to guard against a foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in this country. All parties in this chamber, and the tourism industry itself, recognised the seriousness of that threat. I think we also recognised that we needed to keep our clean and green image, particularly as it concerned tourism and how we projected ourselves abroad to international tourists contemplating a visit to this country. We all supported the increase in the PMC at that time, even though the Democrats questioned the appropriateness in policy terms of requiring the tourism industry to fund, single-handedly, what was in the first instance an agricultural problem. It was for that reason that I sought on that occasion to move amendments to the bill which would have had the effect of increasing the cost of the departure tax on each ticket by only $2.
Had that amendment been supported by either the ALP or the government, essentially it would have enabled $15 million of the passenger movement charge to be allocated to the Australian Tourist Commission to fund its international promotional and marketing budget, as well as over $56 million per annum to be allocated to the government's foot-and-mouth disease prevention measures. I recall that at the time of that debate Senator Schacht explained that the ALP did not trust the government to allocate the extra $2 of the passenger movement charge we proposed to the ATC; and nor did the opposition want to be seen to be supporting what, at that time, was regarded as an additional tax increase.
Tonight we find ourselves in an unusual predicament, but a position that is very much similar. However, instead of foot-and-mouth disease, we are given the option of blocking the only option this government has been prepared to put on the table to give some relief and some justice to the workers of Ansett. It seems to me that this is hardly a choice, because I do not think anyone in this chamber wants to see any of these Australians subjected to further financial insecurity and hardship. That is the only reason the Australian Democrats are supporting these bills—not because we think that they are a good idea, and certainly not because we think they are good law. It seems to me to be a reaction to circumstances beyond the control of the parliament and, for that reason alone, it is poor quality legislation.
As my colleague Senator Greig pointed out earlier, the two bills are another example of poor quality legislation that the government is putting before the Senate. It is overly complex and, in my view, it will be discriminatory against travellers in more remote parts of the country who need to travel more than one sector to reach their final destination. I find myself in agreement with many of the comments by Senator West in relation to the financial hardship that also has to be borne by regional and rural Australia.
To use the example of my own state of New South Wales, someone travelling from Bourke to Sydney has to travel via Dubbo. The round trip will now cost them $20 more and that is just for their air passenger ticket levy. It is not just a simple $10 increase that we are talking about for each ticket. We are talking about a $10 increase, as I understand it, in relation to each sector that is travelled by any person using air travel to get to their destination. I do not think that it will come as any surprise to fellow senators that airlines are not in the habit of discounting air tickets to destinations in regional Australia. Towns like Bourke, Brewarrina and Walgett in north-western New South Wales are fairly reliant on air transport as a link to centres like Dubbo and Sydney and they already pay some of the highest prices for air travel in this country. Now they are being asked to pay more—probably, on average, $20 for a return trip, or $60 per person per trip if they travel across three sectors to reach their destination. 
For a government that regularly trumpets what it is doing to boost regional tourism in this country, I do not think that these two bills are a high watermark. The kind of policy making on the run that has become a hallmark of this government is, in my view, not in the best interests of tourism in this country, nor is it in the best interests of those in regional Australia that continue to rely upon air transport as a means of conducting their business. There is a need for a comprehensive strategy to deal with the Ansett crisis and to support the tourism industry and regional Australia and it is long overdue.
As I said in my opening remarks this evening, the Australian Democrats again call on the government to work with the tourism industry to put in place a long-term and comprehensive tourism industry strategy. We have been asking for this for over two years now and, in light of recent events in the United States, such a strategy has to be of utmost priority, because I do not believe that the full effects of what is happening in the US have quite been felt here at home and there is perhaps more to come.
We look forward to the outcomes of the Prime Minister's tourism industry working group which will report over the next month. We think that this is a step in the right direction and give credit where credit is due. But why did it take a crisis of the sort that has now been perpetrated upon Ansett for the government to even consider establishing such a body? Why was there not such a body already in place as a matter of course when these issues have been highlighted over a long period? I think we are also on record in recent weeks as having called on the government to develop a comprehensive response to the crisis to ensure that the whole question of meeting workers' entitlements when companies like Ansett go under is resolved once and for all.
Today the Treasurer announced that there is an underlying budget surplus for 2000-01 of $5.6 billion. Maybe the government would consider using one-tenth of those funds to provide a guaranteed interest free loan to Ansett as part of a wider strategy to stabilise the airline industry. We believe that at the least this would keep Ansett in the air for at least two months, during which time some of the other stabilising measures could be put in place. I acknowledge the announcement earlier this evening about the indemnity, if you like, that the government has undertaken in relation to at least putting planes in the air from this coming Saturday for the next 12 weeks.
I also mention today that Senator Murray has circulated two amendments to the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill 2001 which would force company directors to return performance related bonuses paid to them if the company collapses and would make related companies liable for those debts. This is the fourth time that Senator Murray has circulated these amendments since 1998 to give effect to the Australian Law Reform Commission recommendations of the same year. On every occasion the government has rejected those amendments. It will be interesting to see what it does with those amendments on this occasion, particularly if it has already secured the Senate's consent to the air passenger ticket levy legislation.
I think that I also ought to point out in relation to the bills that we are dealing with that there is a need for a sunset clause. If the tourism industry is to be hit with yet another levy, that levy should only apply for the period necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it was created—in this case, to be able to meet the costs associated with the special employee entitlements schemes for Ansett group employees. Yet here we have another piece of legislation that puts in place a levy that is to apply indefinitely, or until the minister identifies a month after which no levy will be payable. And it gets better than that. 
Even when the minister is satisfied that the purpose of the bill has been met, he or she can direct the levy to be paid to `a scheme prescribed by the regulations' of the legislation. And—surprise, surprise—the bill states in clause 23(2) that consolidated revenue is an appropriate scheme for the minister to nominate. Here we have it again that money is being collected for an indefinite period of time and the minister can make a decision that it can go into consolidated revenue. The Democrats appreciate that the government is not in a position to pinpoint a date by which time enough money will have been collected to meet the workers' entitlements. But certainly it is in a position to state in the legislation that once the purpose of the bill is achieved it ceases to charge the levy on future tickets.
I want to ask this question of government: why is the tourism industry again being singled out as a milking cow for the government on these particular issues? Why is regional Australia being singled out in having to pay proportionally higher fares to meet workers' entitlements when, quite frankly, we all have a responsibility to deal with what the government should have dealt with long ago? If the reason is that the government might have to meet the cost of paying other workers' entitlements, then it should take other legislative steps now to amend the Bankruptcy Act as the Democrats have suggested.
The passenger movement charge itself has been going into consolidated revenue for years. We are aware that the government has already been using the departure tax, or passenger movement charge, in a similar way to generate vast amounts of money for consolidated revenue. We only have to look at a recent report from the Australian National Audit Office from last year which states that the passenger movement charge is applied partly as a general revenue raising source and is no longer solely linked to cost recovery or customs, immigration and quarantine services. This has been confirmed by the Attorney-General in his answer to a question on notice, and indeed the Attorney-General stated that he is not considering any proposal to change those existing arrangements.
Furthermore, the Board of Airline Representatives recently went on the public record with the accusation that about $20 million in revenue from the passenger movement charge is not being spent on border control services. This is an accusation that does warrant further detailed investigation and a matter that the Australian Democrats want to see resolved to the satisfaction of all Australians, and most of all to the satisfaction of the tourism industry.
I want to call on the government to particularly take note of clause 23 in the bill and to perhaps give serious consideration to amending that clause to create a sunset clause in this bill. If this request is not met, we indicate now our intention yet again to disallow any regulation which tries to direct the levy into consolidated revenue. It seems the only fair outcome, given that so many—yet not everyone—seem to be footing the bill for entitlements without due consideration to trying to create some sustainabilty in the financial sense for the tourism industry and trying to give people in rural and regional Australia a fair go.",SENATE,<title>AIR PASSENGER TICKET LEVY (IMPOSITION) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,35,1
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2001-09-26,"—I also rise to contribute on behalf of Queensland—in particular, North Queensland—to the debate this evening on the Air Passenger Ticket Levy (Imposition) Bill 2001 and the Air Passenger Ticket Levy (Collection) Bill 2001 The purpose of these bills is to implement a levy on tickets purchased in Australia on or after 1 October 2001 to fund a special employees' entitlements scheme for those Ansett workers who may lose their jobs as a result of what I believe is government inaction. It is proposed to offset costs to the Commonwealth of paying out Ansett employees' entitlements pending action against Air New Zealand to recover those workers' entitlements.
The first question I need to ask is: why are we in this situation? I want to remind the government that nobody at all doubts the responsibility of the government in this whole event: the potential demise of our second airline in this country. It is now clear that the government have known of the problems of Ansett and Air New Zealand since early this year. They still protest loudly that they did not know that Ansett was in trouble. But I ask the question: why did I know? Why did I know as a backbencher in a regional centre? Why did the business people of Cairns and Townsville know that Ansett was in trouble? Why did people in the aviation sector who have spoken to me about this matter since early this year know that Ansett was facing difficulties? Why did people in the tourism industry know that there were significant issues that Ansett was facing? 
No-one doubts responsibility of Air New Zealand directors for the situation that we face in Australia: the loss of our second airline—such an important asset to our transport infrastructure in the vast continent that we have. But the government's response has been to repeatedly completely wash their hands of any responsibility in this matter. Their message has been, `Ansett was a private enterprise and there was little we could do.' I am sorry: that is just not good enough. It is not good enough for the workers of Ansett, who prefer Ansett keep flying; it is not good enough for the tourism industry; it is not good enough for people who live in regional, rural and remote Australia, who rely on Ansett to do their ordinary business, just like people in the city rely on their car.
Labor has a strong commitment to these Ansett workers. In my own city of Cairns, we have lost the jobs of between 250 and 280 direct employees of Ansett: flight attendants, pilots, ground staff and service staff. We have lost the jobs of 25 to 30 Gate Gourmet workers. These people are important people in our community: they have made a financial commitment to our community, they are families with kids in our schools, they have mortgages and they want a future in North Queensland. Many of them are facing a shift.
I would like to provide the Senate with part of an email that was sent to me by one of the flight attendants from Cairns recently. Part of her email says:
It both saddens and angers me that the Federal Government wants to quickly sweep this under the carpet. It makes me wonder what they are trying to hide? Whilst I believe the Air NZ board have to accept the majority of responsibility of Ansett's demise, Mr Farmer and Mr Toomey have insisted that “in no uncertain terms” the Government was informed of Ansett's true financial position in June. John Anderson now defensively says “Singapore Airlines couldn't save it”. I agree. It didn't have a chance with the Government effectively blocking their bid, serving the best interests of Qantas.
While I recognise that ASIC is launching an investigation into this situation, I believe a Royal Commission is essential. The Government had no hesitation in implementing this in the HIH collapse, why not now? It seems to me that they are hoping that this will go away, preferably before the next election. WE WON'T!!!
Her postscript is quite charming. It says:
I am the Flight Attendant you commented on about my big smile at the rally on Friday. As this drags on, I am finding it increasingly difficult to find things to smile about. Please help me to get it back.
It is signed `Stood Down Flight Attendant'. We have lost about 300 direct jobs in the city of Cairns, but that is just the start of it. These are real people who have real futures who want to stay in our city. Many of them, I am afraid, are looking to move away. The message that they gave me last Friday in Cairns was, `Entitlements are important, but essentially we want to fly, we want to do what we do best.' I agree with them. I want Ansett to fly. As a person who lives in a regional centre, I know the value of the second airline in our city. The reality is that we have to deal with the issues of entitlements.
Labor will support this bill, but we do that only as a last resort. We have some major concerns with the legislation. Firstly, we recognise that this is a new tax on the Australian community and on jobs. We note that the Prime Minister has broken another promise by imposing another tax on our community. Secondly, the tax is being imposed to pay for the incompetence of the Howard government. Thirdly, this is a tax on tourism, the very industry that has been hit by the collapse of Ansett and the decline of international aviation following the US terrorist crisis. Fourthly, this government is prepared to raise $500 million to pay for entitlements in the event that the company becomes insolvent but has mocked Labor's calls to put in up to $200 million to help get the airline back in the air, and it steadfastly refuses to back our call to help out. Fifthly, Labor firmly believes that the government saw this coming and sat idle, thereby failing to protect the jobs and interests of Australian workers. 
Labor does have an approach to workers' entitlements. The former Labor government recognised the vulnerable position of work employees who not only lost their jobs but also lost their wages and other entitlements when their employers failed. In 1993 we regulated the Commissioner of Taxation to the status of unsecured creditor in such situations, and therefore below that of these employees. This gave workers' entitlements the highest priority of all non-secured creditors and made more funds available for employees when they had lost their jobs because of their employers' insolvency. Since 1996, in response to a series of company failures that have left many thousands of employees being owed many millions of dollars through unpaid wages and other entitlements, the Labor Party has sought to provide protection for employees' entitlements in a series of private members bills.
These bills proposed a system in which employers would take out insurance to protect their employees' entitlements in the event of insolvency. They also claim to strengthen the Corporations Law and the Workplace Relations Act to prevent corporate entities seeking to avoid their responsibilities for their employees' entitlements by asset stripping to associated companies, as occurred in the case of Patrick Stevedores. Instead of debating these bills and instead of engaging in a serious matter of dealing with workers' entitlements, the Liberal and National parties have avoided this issue and now we find ourselves in this crisis.
Over the last 10 days I have spent a lot of time talking with tourism operators in North Queensland—in Cairns, Port Douglas, Townsville and the Whitsundays. I would like to relay some messages that have obviously not got through to the Howard government about the tourism industry and about the potential impact that the demise of Ansett will have in those regions. I want to remind the government about the importance of the tourism industry to Australia and to Queensland. The tourism industry in Australia is worth about $16 billion to the economy every year. It directly employs a total of 700,000 people, with a further 300,000 associated jobs. The industry is worth a total of around $7.7 billion to the Queensland economy. It is Queensland's second largest industry and employs 122,000 people. We are not talking about a small industry here; we are talking about Queensland's second largest industry. The year 2000 was not the best year for Queensland in respect of tourism. The Olympics were great for Australia, but the flow-on effect in Queensland did not occur in any real way. The year 2001 had a slow start. April and May, according to the tourism industry, were flat. I think that was essentially a result of the lack of disposable income in the community, directly as a result of the GST.
These are essentially good months—usually the better months for domestic tourism, because people tend to travel away from the peak season—but, because people do not have that cash in their pockets, they have preferred not to travel. June, July and August saw a return to expected levels, and the tourism industry in North Queensland was basically powering. We were back to usual. Streets were busy and the flights were full—I tried and could not get a seat out to the Great Barrier Reef. It is in that context that I want to relate these messages to the government. 
The Howard government, and especially their tourism minister, have very little understanding of the value of tourism in our economy. The absolutely offensive comments of Jackie Kelly, the Minister for Sport and Tourism, equating the demise of Ansett with a blip were received with absolute horror by the industry in Queensland. She has no understanding of the need for a second airline in delivering passengers to tourist destinations and in providing competition in the tourism sector, nor any understanding of the role of a second airline in marketing and promotion. Ansett was very good at that, and Ansett was particularly good at providing holiday packages, especially to North Queensland destinations. As with their current response to so many foreseeable events, the government have responded retrospectively. They have said that it is not their problem and that market forces will rule. It is simply not good enough to leave our second airline with the answer `it is not our fault'. 
There are a number of issues of concern to the North Queensland tourism industry, to the aviation sector and to the community. Firstly, I want to talk about the unfair impact of the Air Passenger Ticket Levy (Collection) Bill and the Air Passenger Ticket Levy (Imposition) Bill on small airlines. Skytrans is a small airline that operates in Cape York Peninsula. As Senator West said earlier, this is a small airline providing services to very isolated places. Its passengers rely on air transport for their day-to-day activities. It is not discretionary expenditure that provides the money for these people to get on the plane; they get on the plane for health reasons, for legal reasons or for business reasons—usually in Cairns—or to visit their mum in hospital. There is very little tourism use of Skytrans. The company is a very good company, and it operates a sensible, community focused pricing policy. It recognises the need and the financial capability of its community, and it prices accordingly. 
Ansett did not operate any of the legs operated by Skytrans, so it is very sensible and reasonable to ask why these mostly poor people, who rely on air transport for basic needs, have to subsidise the government's failure to respond to the Ansett demise through a levy of $10 on the $99 fare from, say, Cooktown to Cairns. Where is the equity in charging the same levy to a child travelling from, say, the Aboriginal community of Lockhart River to Cairns to see their grandmother who is in hospital, and to a wealthy business person who is travelling from Sydney to Cairns for a holiday? The answer to that question is that there is no equity.
Maybe a more equitable approach to funding these employee entitlements might have been to apply an income tax surcharge, such as that used by the government for its gun buy-back scheme in 1996. In this way, those who have the capacity to pay, rather than those who have to travel, would have funded the entitlements of the Ansett workers. But the government—acting in retrospect, responding to crisis—has seized on the scheme we are debating tonight. It is interesting to note the number of amendments to the legislation that were made in the House of Representatives when it was debated in that place. I think it shows a lack of thought in and consultation on this legislation. I believe that people in rural and remote Australia will unfairly pay for this government's inaction and its lack of an early response to the demise of Ansett. It is appalling to people in rural and remote Australia, and to the small aviation industry, that they are going to fund incompetence in a government.
Secondly, the message that I want to give to the government tonight is that these bills are in fact a tax on tourism. Remember, this is the tourism industry that is still accepting the increase in the last budget of $8 on the departure tax. I was talking today to operators in Far North Queensland. Down Under Dive is one of the largest privately owned dive companies in Australia and potentially the world. It has 90 employees who are basically all qualified people—skippers, engineers and dive instructors. They are experienced and talented people. In the last 10 days, Down Under Dive has removed one vessel from its fleet—a SuperCat—and it has lost nine jobs. The owner of the company is a very good employer, and they have a sound record in the tourism industry over many years. It is only one example of the hurt that this government's inaction has caused.
Moving to the restaurant industry, I understand that today Red Ochre Grill was recognised in Mietta's guide as one of the best eating houses in Queensland. It is an innovative restaurant, a very enjoyable restaurant, and it is involved in hospitality training and the promotion of Cairns as an interesting destination. It is the sort of establishment that every regional centre would want to have in their locality. Red Ochre has not laid off staff but it has suffered a downturn of 30 per cent in the last 10 days. It has lost 450 booked seats in those 10 days. The causes the owner attributes that to are twofold: the demise of Ansett but also the terrorism in the United States. It was doing very well in July and August; it was back to expected levels, following the year 2000. Since the demise of Ansett—or since the potential demise of Ansett—it has not let any of its full-time staff go but has had to cut all casual staff hours by 60 per cent. 
The owner of the business said to me today, `These staff will not appear on the unemployment lists. Because they are not terminated, they will not get support for any lost entitlements; the business is still viable and very much functioning.' These businesses and their employees have been disregarded by the government. They are the forgotten victims of government inaction in the whole Ansett debacle. I also spoke with the owners of an opal shop which is totally dependent on tourism sales. They report that they have been down 50 per cent on their takings in the last 10 days compared to a similar period last year. It is a small operation with, up till recently, 11 employees. They now have nine employees, and the owners are working longer so that they have a person on the shop floor.
Cairns is a growing market for conventions. Its industry is reliant on frequency of flights, availability of seats and competitive costs of travel. We know that industry is going to be affected if we do not have a second airline in this country. The government needs to understand that tourism is big business in Queensland. It is an important business. It is a major employer of Queenslanders, and it is an extremely important part of our economy.
I welcome Labor's tourism industry rescue plan because that plan actually acknowledges the role of the tourism industry in our state. The plan recognises the need for a second airline, the role of small tourism enterprises and their need for support, the need to promote overseas, and the need to assist regional promotion and infrastructure development. Labor will work with the tourism business to develop destinations and to market products.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2001-09-26,"—There are a great many things I could say this evening, but I will not. The Air Passenger Ticket Levy (Collection) Bill 2001 and the Air Passenger Ticket Levy (Imposition) Bill 2001 are the subject of a procedure this evening whereby it is intended that we curtail our contributions in the interests of passing a package of measures which the government have asked the Senate to pass expeditiously, to enable the Senate to adjourn tomorrow evening and to facilitate the opportunity for the government to avoid coming back here on these bills in three weeks.
The comments I want to make tonight—and, as I say, there are many things I could say and many of them have already been said by other speakers—are prompted in part by a telephone conversation I had this evening with the Mayor of Flinders Island, Mrs Lyn Mason. She is a very dynamic mayor of a small island community in Bass Strait with a small population that is substantially dependent on aviation services for access for the community. There is a vessel that sails across there regularly. I think it is a 23-hour trip, now that it leaves from Launceston and not Bridport. The vessel is a vehicular ferry, and I think there is a little room downstairs where you can sit around on some very nice but not, I imagine, very comfortable chairs over a 23-hour trip. They are plastic garden type chairs to travel across to Lady Barron on Flinders Island. The airport at Whitemark is the main point of departure for most of the residents and arrival for most of the visitors, and of course in the context of that this legislation is extremely relevant. Lyn Mason was saying to me this evening that she was extremely angry that the residents of Flinders Island would be required to pay this $11—that is, $10 plus GST—for their trips to the main island of Tasmania or across to Victoria on the Chieftains that are flying across there at the moment—because over the last few years Flinders Island has had some problems with aviation services. 
Apart from the fuel contamination crisis which isolated the island at a critical time over the last December-January period, there have been a number of occasions when aviation operations have ceased and the island has been left with inadequate services or no services, and residents of the island have been left without their entitlements because of the financial failure of airline operations. Mayor Mason was quick to point out that on those occasions there was no move by the federal government to provide assistance to the employees of the failed airlines, there was no move from the Commonwealth to provide special assistance for Flinders Island occasioned by its isolation during the fuel contamination crisis and there was no move to provide any financial assistance to the airlines which struggled and ultimately failed in trying to provide a service to that remote—if I could put it that way in terms of the difficulty accessing it—part of Australia and that part of Tasmania, Flinders Island. 
Mayor Mason was keen to note that there was a debate this evening about this legislation and keen for the predicament of Flinders Island to be placed before the chamber. Mayor Mason was quite alarmed by some of the comments which had been made to her by other senators—she did not identify them, but I can probably guess who they are. It is up to Mayor Mason to identify those if she wishes but she was quite alarmed by the sorts of responses that she was receiving from other senators about this matter. I have asked my colleagues and she has not spoken to them. Flinders Island would not be alone in feeling that this move is something which bewilders them, given the lack of attention to the needs of regional Australia by this administration in terms of aviation services.
As other Labor senators have indicated, Labor will be supporting this measure because it would be unconscionable for us to place a barrier in the way of Ansett employees receiving compensation for non-payment of their entitlements. They are suffering significantly at the moment. They are not officially out of a job but they are not being paid in the main. They are not entitled to apply for government assistance in the main and so some people are on the verge of losing their houses. They do not think the government is being generous but the opposition will be supporting this measure because it would be unconscionable to leave these people with nothing while there is an attempt to recover moneys from Air New Zealand or out of the assets of Ansett. 
There are a great many things that could be said this evening. I will not be taking my contribution any further tonight because there is still legislation to be discussed before we conclude. I may make comments in the committee stage of this legislation.

"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2001-09-26,"—I rise to speak on the Fuel Legislation Amendment (Grant and Rebate Schemes) Bill 2001. It is a bill that will extend the sunset provisions of the Diesel Alternative Fuel Grant Scheme and the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme for 12 months to 30 June 2003. This scheme provides a rebate for the excise or customs duty which has been paid on locally produced or imported diesel and like fuels for certain eligible business activity such as mining, primary production, marine and rail transport, hospitals and nursing homes. It provides a rebate for the on-road use of diesel alternative fuels in vehicles over 20 tonnes and vehicles of between 4.5 and 20 tonnes in non-metropolitan areas. There are amendments to the scheme which allow for a grant to be payable when fuel is used in an emergency vehicle weighing 4.5 tonnes or more.
The opposition supports this bill—in some ways reluctantly because, if we had a competent, honest and efficient government, this bill would be unnecessary. What we have with the extensions of these schemes is a government acknowledging that they have not done what they promised. When the deal was done with the Democrats to sunset these schemes on 30 June 2001, it was promised that the new Energy Credit Scheme would be ready and in place. The fact is that the Energy Credit Scheme is not ready and we have been calling on the government to get the work done. The trucking industry has been pushing for answers but it has not happened and it is not likely to be done by June next year. It has been the Labor Party's policy to extend the sunset date if the government could not give an assurance that the new Energy Credit Scheme would be ready in time for that sunset. 
The bill before us today is the answer to our question. The answer is clearly that the government does not have the Energy Credit Scheme ready for the June 2002 sunset date. The answer is that the government with all the resources available to it has not done the work it promised to do two years ago when it made the commitment to the Democrats. In that respect, with the admission of a broken promise and incompetence, the government has conceded they will not have the Energy Credit Scheme ready. What we have before us is effectively Labor policy being implemented. It shows a government that is out of touch with what the community expects of responsible governments. They are content to stand by, gloss over mistakes for as long as they can until they are forced to admit them and then unashamedly shoot the bill off to the taxpayer and the community. 
If the new Energy Grants Credit Scheme that is supposed to replace the current Diesel Grants Scheme can still be finalised by June 2002, that is a good thing. But, as my colleague Mr Ferguson pointed out in the other place, we believe the government is conceding that this is unlikely. We were virtually convinced of this when the government said the fuel tax inquiry would not report until March and would look at the Energy Credit Scheme. We did not oppose the Diesel Grant Scheme when it was introduced because it constituted a way to help transport and primary industries to mitigate the impact of the goods and services tax, and we will not oppose this bill. 
The reason for the extension required in this bill is that the government must start giving some idea about what it wants in an energy credit scheme. The time extension will take the pressure off finalisation of the scheme and give certainty to the industry. The government fuel tax inquiry may give some clues on what might be in an energy credit scheme but we do not have the slightest clue about what may be in an energy credit scheme now, something that was committed to the Democrats two years ago. Given it was two years ago, surely the government must have some idea. We believe it is time their thoughts were put forward on what sort of energy credit scheme the government might be interested in. 
My colleague in the other place shed some light on why we have seen inaction and why we have seen no proposal on an energy credit scheme. I have a copy of a government memo that clearly shows that the government ministers simply cannot agree on what the nature of an energy credit scheme should be. The memo is headed `Environment Australia' and it is to the parliamentary secretary. As I understand it, it was to be used by her in a presentation to the Australian Trucking Association at a meeting on 8 March. Inter alia, the notes provided to the parliamentary secretary for this meeting state under the heading `The Energy Grants (Credit) Scheme':
The Department of Transport and Regional Services, in consultation with Environment Australia and the Greenhouse Office, is preparing a Cabinet memorandum on this proposal. The Cabinet memorandum aims to develop the Government's position on the proposal for reform under the Energy Grants (Credit) Scheme and the process to be followed in developing the scheme. The Cabinet memorandum is at an early stage—
this is advice from the department to the government—
of development and it is not possible to provide any details of departmental thinking to the public or the ATA, particularly as there is no agreement between the Ministers at this stage.
This was issued on 8 March this year. Two years down the track, and the ministers cannot agree. That is probably a bit of an indication as to why there has not been any action. There it is in black and white. I would argue that that is still the case today. It is several months later on and the ministers still cannot agree—and if that is not the case we would appreciate some clarification by the government. 
A further note from the briefing shows that the government knew back in March that the industry was anxious to ensure continued entitlements, but it took a long time to ease that anxiety. The government did not talk to the opposition about the terms or arrangements for the diesel grants scheme. We were not in the loop on this issue. We therefore had nothing to do with the original condition that the scheme would terminate mid-2002 or with its replacement with the energy credit scheme. Since the middle of 1999 again, as I state, for over two years we heard nothing from the government on the energy credit scheme. I think that the memo to the parliamentary secretary explains why.
When the Labor Party promised to introduce the legislative changes necessary to extend the Diesel and Alternative Fuel Grants Scheme for an extra 12 months, we promised not to sit on our hands as this government had done; we said that we would need to finalise by 30 June 2003 an energy grants credit scheme or arrangements that would maintain the equivalent benefits to the trucking industry.
We will support that bill with that intent. It is time, from our perspective, that the government gave a genuine commitment on this issue and stopped playing the game that it has been playing for the last two years. We believe the Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme will include incentives and measures to improve the environmental performance of the transport industry. If pressure had been put on the government to that end, then we all would have had a much better idea in the first place of what lay ahead.
It is a matter of fact that the fuel tax inquiry will examine the whole issue of fuel taxes, including the Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme. It is due to report in March 2002. With the extension of the diesel grants schemes, the government now has more time to devise, consult, consider, debate, negotiate, resolve and legislate, if need be, an energy credit scheme to meet the new sunset date. But this extension does not remove the imperative to get cracking on finalising that scheme.
Whoever is in government next year must treat this with high priority. I conclude by confirming that if we are, we will also support the changes with respect to emergency vehicles—and we do now in opposition. It was a nonsense that organisations like rural fire brigades had to distinguish between fuel used on-road and fuel used when they went off-road into the bush fighting fires. That seemed to be a fairly odd situation. We are pleased to see this resolved now. The other minor changes assist the administration of the scheme, and Labor welcomes the government's roll-back of the provisions. It is consistent with our policy of making the GST and its related schemes fairer and easier to administer. We are pleased that the government is also adopting that part of the policy of the Labor Party with respect to the ongoing roll-back of aspects of the goods and services tax.",SENATE,<title>FUEL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (GRANT AND REBATE SCHEMES) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,37,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2001-09-26,"—The Fuel Legislation Amendment (Grant and Rebate Schemes) Bill 2001 seeks to delay the start-up date of the Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme by 12 months to 1 July 2003 as well as to extend the scope of the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme to include the fuel used by emergency vehicles and to make various administrative amendments to DAFGS. The Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme is proposed to replace the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme and the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme. The Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme is a longstanding one, as senators will know, and has provided off-road rebates for primary production, mining and forestry for many years. Last year it was extended to include rail, marine, residential premises, hospitals, aged care persons homes and other medical institutions.
The rebate is worth around $2 billion a year and around $800 million for mining and $600 million for agriculture. The Democrats are disappointed with this delay and with the way in which the government has failed to act or to consult. In his letter of 28 May 1999, the Prime Minister agreed to an energy credit scheme to replace from 30 June 2002 two existing schemes, as I have already said. He said: 
This scheme will be developed jointly by the Government and the Australian Democrats. It will ... provide price incentives and funding for conversion from the dirtiest fuels to the most appropriate and cleanest fuels.
The government has had nearly 2½ years to prepare for this changeover, but to date it has done very little other than to refer the scheme to the fuel tax inquiry. It did not even have the courtesy, as a matter of fact, of letting us know that it was making this referral to that inquiry. The inclusion of the Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme in the terms of reference for the fuel tax inquiry has perhaps conveniently created a situation where it will be very difficult to implement the scheme by the due date—because the inquiry of course will not report until March next year.
I pointed this out to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services earlier this year and said that three months was too short a time frame in our view in which to draft legislation and to get it through the parliament. So we have a bill which seeks to delay the introduction of the energy credit scheme by 12 months. Why does the government need an extra year to develop the scheme, when the inquiry will report in May next year? We would argue that extending the start-up date to October 2002 would give the government enough time, especially considering that the government will by then have had nearly 3½ years to put up a proposal.
I think the answer is that there is not the political will in the Department of Transport and Regional Services to deliver on this agreement. I guess we should not be surprised that the minister for transport has difficulty in responding to a brief which seeks to improve greenhouse emissions by putting in place incentives for change. A minister who is so willing to fund the useless Scoresby Freeway in Melbourne and ignore the needs of public transport and even freight rail obviously has great difficulty in seeing the bigger greenhouse picture.
The interstate rail network audit, undertaken by the Australian Rail Track Corporation at the request of the federal minister for transport, recommends investing $507 million in upgrading the interstate rail network, saying that inadequate investment in rail has resulted in speed and load restrictions, limitations on efficient operating practices and excessive fuel consumption and maintenance costs, which have caused modal shift to road.
For a government said to be interested in lower costs of transport for rural Australia, this is obviously a major problem. It will not be addressed by the Adelaide to Darwin rail link, and there does not appear to be any commitment forthcoming from either of the major parties to provide this investment. I do not suggest that the energy credit scheme should fund the repair of our dilapidated rail network on the busiest route in the country, but it does put the $2 billion worth of diesel rebates somewhat into context.
To return to the energy credit scheme, the Democrats have upheld their end of the bargain and, for more than a year, have been diligently reminding the minister of the need to get moving on this scheme. In the interests of getting the scheme up and running, we put out a discussion paper asking interested groups and individuals for their input on the opportunities that the energy credit scheme might offer in improving air quality and reducing greenhouse emissions. The Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Act 1999 states:
The purpose of the Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme will be to provide active encouragement for the move to the use of cleaner fuels by measures additional to those under this Act, while at the same time maintaining entitlements that are equivalent to those under this Act and the DFRS, including for use of alternative fuels ... In the case of diesel fuel the Commonwealth intends to restrict entitlements available under the Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme to ultra low sulphur diesel from 1 January 2006 when a mandatory standard of 50 parts per million of sulphur will come into effect.
We are very proud of having negotiated fuel and emission standards that will bring Australia into line with Europe by 2005-06 instead of lagging years behind. Under Labor, of course, we had diesel with 1300 parts per million of sulphur and no sign of tighter controls. Labor also did not see fit to introduce on-road vehicle emission testing, and we have one of the oldest vehicle fleets in the OECD. That all adds up to a lot of pollution and, understandably, high rates of asthma and respiratory illness. 
Responses to the discussion paper on the Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme have made the following points. We need to emphasise perhaps the additional measures provision of the act rather than falling back just on maintaining entitlements. Farmers want rebates protected, and civil contractors and mining, exploration and CNG industries want the scheme extended and anomalies removed. It might be possible to convert rebates and grants to a lump sum so that borrowings could be made against entitlements over, say, five years to fund specified capital investments to increase energy efficiency of operations. Perhaps the energy credit scheme could be used to fund a more rapid development of natural gas refuelling stations around Australia.
Respondents said that the energy credit scheme could encourage the cleanest fuels and the cleanest technology; hence, they said, there was a need to conduct a full life cycle analysis of petroleum and non-petroleum based fuels. So we could have a rebate that varies with fuel and engine; provides energy efficiency of existing diesel engines; brings forward the ultra low sulphur diesel fuels since this would give the most significant greenhouse gas reduction; allows government to subsidise catalytic converters, for instance, for existing engines; and applies international standards for off-road mobile machinery and stationary sources across the whole economy and not be sector, region or vehicle weight specific. Perhaps there should be an excise incentive on premium unleaded petrol. Perhaps there is a need to introduce standards for after-market conversions for CNG and LPG, including dual fuelled vehicles. Some responses to the discussion paper suggested subsidising alternative fuels, and doing so for off-road, on-road and medium sized vehicles.
It was suggested that all passenger buses—urban, regional, diesel and alternative fuelled—should be eligible for DFAGS as long as they were Euro 2, 3 or better. The issue of indexation needs to be addressed, and the Commissioner of Taxation should perhaps have the power to make determinations on the scheme. There were numerous other suggestions made in response to our discussion paper. Hopefully, these were also made to the fuel tax inquiry, submissions to which close on 30 September. I seek leave to incorporate the rest of my speech in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
So to wrap up, the Democrats can see why the Government wants to extend the operation of the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme and the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme and delay the startup of the Energy Credits Scheme but it has no one to blame but itself for running out of time. I am sure it is a lot easier for the Minister to shift this off to an inquiry and not have to think about a cleaner greener outcome.
The Democrats remain committed to the objectives of our agreement which is to provide price incentives and funding for conversion from the dirtiest fuels to the most appropriate and cleanest fuels.
We have not had an answer to our question as to why this extension needs to be 12 months. The Democrats will be putting up amendments to bring this time frame back to a more reasonable one and if the Government and the opposition cannot support those, I would appreciate some answers as to why.
We will support the amendment that will benefit emergency services vehicles although I think it would be preferable for these services to be properly funded in the first place.
We also support the other administrative amendments although I will be interested to hear from the minister the circumstances that gave rise to these changes, particularly the authorisation of third party claimants.

"Heffernan, Sen Bill",LP,2001-09-26,"—Less than a year ago David Bradbury, the Labor candidate for Lindsay, lied to and misled the people of Penrith when he vowed that side issues such as federal politics would never distract him from the job of being Mayor of Penrith. The Penrith press of 19 September 2000 said:
Side issues such as federal politics would never distract him from the job of being Mayor of Penrith if he was elected to that position this month. That vow was made by Penrith Councillor David Bradbury, ALP, who confirmed he would stand for the office in the September 29 ballot for Mayor.
Later on in the same article he is quoted as saying:
`Being the Mayor of Penrith is a great honour and if elected I will spend my every waking hour working at the task.'
It did not take long for David Bradbury to break his vow. I have here a memo from the general manager of the City Council of Penrith which details how Mayor Bradbury, who has since become the Labor candidate while continuing to work part time for Senator Steve Hutchins, abused his position of mayor by seeking copies of Jackie Kelly's house floor plans from council files. According to this memo, on 24 January 2001 Mayor Bradbury asked the director of city planning, Mr Alan Stoneham, if any person could look at plans relating to a residential building in the city. Mr Stoneham replied that he thought so and referred him to the council's Building Approvals and Environmental Protection Department. When the council's records officer to whom Mayor Bradbury's request had been referred looked up the owner of the property, it is understood that they established it was owned by Ms Jackie Kelly, the federal member for Lindsay. The officer at that point contacted the legal officer who immediately contacted the council's general manager. The general manager then contacted Mayor Bradbury and advised him that he could not access that information unless it related to business of the council. 
This was not the end of the matter: the aspiring Labor federal candidate, then mayor, handed the director of city planning, Mr Stoneham, a letter from Senator Steve Hutchins, on whose staff Mayor Bradbury was working part time—a great example of Labor incest at its best. The letter asked whether records held by Penrith City Council regarding two properties could be accessed by the public and how this could be achieved. One of the properties was Jackie Kelly's. 
On 9 February Mayor Bradbury responded to Senator Hutchins, his employer, advising him that approval could be accessed under section 12 of the Local Government Act but pointing out that the proposed layout of the residential parts of the building could not be viewed under this section. This clumsy attempt at a cover-up added that a freedom of information order could be made, but there would be need for consultation with the owner occupiers of the house.
What has been exposed here is a grubby exercise cooked up between Mayor Bradbury and Senator Hutchins to gain personal information about a political opponent, the member for Lindsay. Mayor Bradbury has abused his position as mayor and has broken his vow to devote himself to the people of Penrith and not to be distracted by federal politics. In their clumsy attempt at political dirt digging, he and Senator Hutchins have been caught in the sewer. 
—Senator Heffernan, I would urge caution in how you reflect upon a member in this place, the other place or any other parliament.
—I withdraw any reflection. I commend the Penrith City Council officers who stood firm in the face of Mayor Bradbury's efforts to snoop into Jackie Kelly's house plans. I would like to know whether Kim Beazley approved of this contemptible behaviour by Senator Hutchins, his party's New South Wales president and his party's endorsed candidate for Lindsay, Mayor Bradbury. The opposition leader talks a lot about standards of political behaviour; what is he going to do on this occasion? I seek leave to table the memo from Alan Travers, general manager of Penrith City Council.
—It has not been shown to us. If you show it to us we will have a look at it.
—Madam Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order: we have not seen the document that Senator Heffernan intends to table. He has been on his feet now for five minutes. This is the second speech Senator Heffernan has made in about two years. He ought to have had plenty of time to prepare himself to table this document. He would have had plenty of time to provide it to us.
Leave granted. ",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,"<title>Bradbury, Mr David: Access to Residential House Plans</title>",Adjournment,40,1
