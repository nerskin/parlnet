"Wilkie, Kim, MP",ALP,2000-10-30,"—I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Observer Delegation to the Parliamentary Elections in Zimbabwe, 24 to 25 June 2000. It was a great privilege for me to be a representative of this House as part of the Australian delegation to Zimbabwe to observe the parliamentary elections. The members of that delegation included Senator Alan Ferguson, who was the leader of the delegation, Senator Andrew Murray, Mr Russell Chafer, who was the delegation secretary from the House of Representatives, Mr Bala Chettur from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr Ross McKay, who was the Australian Electoral Commission representative, and a number of other members, including Ms Julie Bishop, the member for Curtin, and Senator Sandy Macdonald.
Australia's strong system of representative democracy and its effective administration of elections have been acknowledged internationally for many years. Australian officials and members of parliament are frequently called on to observe the conduct of elections overseas. I am pleased that the Australian parliament was able to send observers to Zimbabwe's parliamentary elections held on 24 and 25 June. The elections were witnessed by 300 international observers, in addition to the parliament's delegation. After three days of intensive briefings in Harare, our delegation split up into three teams which spent between four and six days in the provinces of Zimbabwe, including the polling days on Saturday and Sunday and the counting day on Monday, 26 June. We made a point of visiting some of the more remote areas of the country, as well as the main population centres. The areas we visited are listed in the report.
The elections were held against a backdrop of civil unrest, including the occupation of the commercial farms by veterans of Zimbabwe's liberation war, and escalating violence and intimidation, particularly in rural areas, in the months preceding the election. In common with most international observers, we have no doubt that the pre-election violence was intended to ensure the re-election of President Mugabe's ZANU-PF party. In the 20 years since Zimbabwe was formed, ZANU-PF has grown accustomed to running the country as a one-party state. The ruling party received a rude shock in February this year when its draft constitution was rejected at a national referendum. The draft constitution, which would have enabled the government to seize commercial farms without compensation, had been opposed by the newly-formed Movement for Democratic Change, as well as by civil society organisations under the umbrella of the National Constitutional Assembly.
Shortly after the referendum, the invasions of commercial farms by war veterans and their supporters began. The invasions heralded a breakdown in the rule of law in Zimbabwe and a bid to crush dissent against the rule of ZANU-PF before the elections. The rhetoric of the ruling party—repeated endlessly in Zimbabwe's state controlled electronic media and in the state controlled Herald daily newspaper—condemned the opposition MDC as enemies of the state merely for challenging the power of President Mugabe and ZANU-PF. The application of this rhetoric was devastating. Over 30 people were murdered, most of them supporters of the MDC. The delegation met with many non-government candidates and supporters who had been forced into hiding in the weeks before the election.
Our delegation met with an MDC party agent who had been physically assaulted two days before polling commenced—there is a photo of that person in the report. We also witnessed widespread intimidation by war veterans of farmers and their workers in the form of directions to the workers as to where they were to vote and for whom. Quite obviously, all this had a stifling effect on freedom of association, election campaigning and voter education. We have no doubt that the violence and intimidation of the pre-election period must have influenced the result in some constituencies. 
A particularly unfortunate aspect of the violence was the indifference shown by Zimbabwe's once respected police force. The police effectively ignored an order from Zimbabwe's courts that the farm occupations were illegal and thereafter did as little as possible to control the behaviour of the war veterans and ZANU-PF operatives. This contrasts markedly with the visible police presence at every polling and counting station we visited, which contributed greatly to the generally peaceful conduct of voting and counting on Saturday, Sunday and Monday, 24 to 26 June. Thankfully, we were told by virtually all the people we visited that the presence of international observers contributed to a more peaceful environment in the days immediately before and during the weekend poll. Despite witnessing some incidents of intimidation, we were generally satisfied with the orderly conduct of the voting on 24 and 25 June and with the counting of votes on Monday, 26 June. 
Inevitably we noticed some irregularities but, from our observations, we did not think those irregularities were widespread. At the polling stations we visited it would have been very difficult to tamper with the vote in any significant way. Multiple voting did not appear to be a factor. We were also of the opinion that the vote was accurately, if slowly, counted on the Monday in a very public process. This is not to suggest that the administration of the election was satisfactory. The conduct of the voting was hampered by inconsistent procedures and the last-minute nature of many important election preparations. The preparations were not helped by a power struggle in the weeks leading up to the election between the Electoral Supervisory Commission and the office of Zimbabwe's Registrar-General.
The accuracy and availability of the electoral rolls were criticised by many people we spoke to during our observations. Several polling stations we visited on the first day of voting had still not received supplementary rolls which contained the names of people who had registered late. It is likely that many registered voters were denied a vote as a consequence. As I was saying earlier, more seriously, many people had registered to vote but their names did not appear on the published rolls and they were turned away from polling stations despite producing a receipt. In some polling stations I visited in the Midlands province, the only party polling agents credited, for example, to oversee elections were those representing the ZANU-PF party. With no non-government polling agents and no domestic monitors, safeguards against intimidation and electoral fraud were obviously limited. At one polling station we observed a gentleman wandering up and down the line of people waiting to vote with a large wooden club. Whilst he would not state what party he was from, it was fairly obvious from what was happening. The woman who was admitting people through the gate refused to identify herself as being from any particular party, but she was not an accredited observer. So there are obviously some inconsistencies there. 
President Mugabe was not standing for election on this occasion. A separate presidential election will be held in 2002. The international community will watch the lead-up to that election with great interest. International observers, including from Zimbabwe, have always been welcome to attend Australian elections and we would encourage a continuing exchange of views on the practice of democratic elections. On behalf of the delegation, I would like to thank our High Commissioner to Zimbabwe, Her Excellency Mrs Denise Fisher, as well as Ms Jenny Dee and the other staff at the High Commission for their outstanding support at very short notice. I also extend our gratitude to the many brave people of Zimbabwe who, under very stressful circumstances, found the time to assist us. We wish them well for the future. On a personal note I would also like to thank Mr Bala Chettur from Foreign Affairs who attended with me.",REPS,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,<title>Parliamentary Observer Delegation to the Parliamentary Elections in Zimbabwe</title>,Delegation Reports,0,1
"Bishop, Julie, MP",LP,2000-10-30,"—I trust this is also an opportune time to report to the House on the Commonwealth observer group that included representatives from this parliament, which also received accreditation to observe the parliamentary elections in Zimbabwe. I was part of the advance group of six Commonwealth representatives. Senator Sandy Macdonald and former Senator David MacGibbon were part of the observer team that attended the actual election process in Zimbabwe. It is worth reflecting that Australia and Zimbabwe are both members of the Commonwealth and that the Commonwealth has a formal charter, interestingly called the Harare Commonwealth Declaration 1991. The formal charter, which was entered into and agreed to by all of the 54 countries in the Commonwealth, states that its principles are to protect and to promote the Commonwealth's fundamental political values, which include democracy, democratic processes and institutions, which reflect national circumstances, rule of law, just and honest government, and fundamental human rights, including equal rights and opportunities. It is against that background that the Commonwealth observer team was requested by President Mugabe to be in Zimbabwe for the duration of the parliamentary elections. The experience of the Commonwealth observer team was indeed similar to that of the Australian parliamentary observer group and our findings were somewhat similar. I will not read out the whole of the Commonwealth report; it is at www.thecommonwealth.org. 
It is also important to think a little about the history of Zimbabwe and how it has ended up in these quite tragic circumstances. There are two very large ethnic groups in Zimbabwe: the Shona people, which is the largest ethnic group comprising over 70 per cent and which settled in Zimbabwe many thousands of years ago; and the Ndebele people, who settled about 200 or more years ago. It was in 1890 that settlers of the British South Africa Company under Cecil Rhodes settled in what was then Southern Rhodesia. That brought an influx of white farmers from the United Kingdom, and also from South Africa, who farmed vast tracts of land. The United Kingdom took over self-government of Southern Rhodesia in 1923, and there was a dispute in the 1960s about this. It was in 1965 that Ian Smith's hardline party, the Rhodesian Front, declared independence from Britain. That was a unilateral declaration of independence.
It was at about this time that the black African majority organised themselves into political movements, went underground and waged guerrilla warfare against Smith's regime. Of course, one black African group, ZANU, was led by Robert Mugabe. There was a huge conflict which led to Smith establishing a government, but it failed. In 1979 all of the parties came together to end the war of independence, as it was called, under a forum by Lord Carrington, who was the British foreign affairs minister at the time. They met at Lancaster House in London. It was a 14-week meeting which ended in a peace agreement. It was a cease-fire to end Smith's government, and a British transitional government was installed until there could be a free and fair election held. There are those words again: a `free and fair' election, which was precisely the Commonwealth's concern some 20 years later. An election was held for the independence of the country and there were 80 African seats. Mugabe's ZANU-PF, which was essentially a Shona based party, won 57 seats. ZAPU, which was the Ndebele party, won 20. There were three for the United Africa Party and Ian Smith's Rhodesian Front won all of the 20 seats reserved for whites. In April 1980 Zimbabwe became independent and Robert Mugabe was installed as Prime Minister and Reverend Banana was President. 
In the 1990s, of course, the economy started going into decline. There were strikes for improved conditions and President Mugabe, as he then became, turned to land reform to bolster votes. This led to a great deal of unrest among the people and a new political party, the Movement for Democratic Change, was formed in September 1999. In February 2000, President Mugabe's ZANU-PF wanted the people to vote to change the 1979 Lancaster House constitution. The ZANU-PF assumed a win but were shocked when the proposed change was defeated by a vote of 54.7 per cent of the population to 45.3 per cent, on a 20 per cent turn-out. The government accused the opposition party of a white conspiracy and a lot of violence was unleashed. The courts ruled that the farm occupations by the so-called war of independence veterans were illegal. President Mugabe ignored this and dismissed parliament in April; therefore, fresh elections had to be held within four months. On 2 May, a meeting of the ministerial action group of Commonwealth ministers, including Australia, condemned the violence that had occurred, the loss of life and the fact that there was no rule of law. They insisted there be a free and fair election and called for Commonwealth observers to be sent in as soon as possible.

"Jull, David, MP",LP,2000-10-30,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present the committee's report entitled Australian government loan to Papua New Guinea, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—The report that I have just tabled is important for two reasons. Firstly, it represents parliamentary involvement in the scrutiny of this loan. This is significant and something that the committee supports. Secondly, the legislation that prompted this report and the timing of the tabling of the document about the loan have both caused some concern to the committee. I propose to talk about the loan itself and the issues that arose during our consideration of this matter. I understand that my colleague the honourable member for the Northern Territory will address issues relating to parliamentary scrutiny of loans by the government. This loan of $A133.2 million was granted to PNG under the provisions of the International Monetary Agreement Act 1947, as amended in 1998. This enables the government to lend money to other countries, provided at least one government or organisation intends to provide, or has provided, money to the proposed recipient. Further, when loans are made under this act, it prescribes that a national interest statement setting out the nature and terms of the loan is to be tabled in the parliament. The national interest statement is also to set out the reasons why the loan is in Australia's national interest, having regard in particular to foreign policy, trade and economic interests. In this case, both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are working with PNG and lending it money to assist its reform agenda.
There can be no doubt that making this loan to PNG is in Australia's national interest, and it is supported by the committee. The historical and geographic ties between the two nations are such that it would be unthinkable not to assist the government of Sir Mekere Morauta to continue its reform work. The terms of this loan are strictly commercial. PNG's record of repaying other loans is such that the committee is confident this loan will be repaid in full and on time. The NIS also refers to an additional $30 million that will be loaned to PNG. The committee understands that negotiations for this loan are under way at present. It is likely that the three payments making up this additional loan will be dealt with in the same way as the larger loan that is the subject of this report.
Although the time to consider this matter was short, the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee of the joint committee carried out a standard inquiry process. A total of seven submissions were received from five organisations and individuals. A short public hearing was held on 12 September, at which very useful evidence was taken from a range of witnesses, notably from the Treasury, the DFAT portfolio and a panel from the ANU. These witnesses all supported the loan and the efforts of the Morauta government to implement a program of reform in PNG. I believe that my colleagues would agree that the witnesses from the ANU were surprisingly optimistic about PNG's prospects under the Morauta government. I am sure that all those with an interest in our closest northern neighbour hope that recent events in PNG will not lead to a weakening of its government's resolve to continue its reform program.
In supporting this loan, the committee has also recommended that the legislation be amended to ensure that parliamentary consideration of any future loans is included earlier in the approval process. There is little purpose in the committee scrutinising a loan that has already been granted. Unfortunately, this situation is likely to recur when the additional loan of $30 million to PNG is referred to us. I commend the report to the House.

"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2000-10-30,"—It gives me great pleasure to support my colleague the honourable member for Fadden in connection with the report entitled Australian government loan to Papua New Guinea of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade he has just tabled. I would like to talk about two issues that were of concern to the committee, and which he alluded to. At the outset, I should stress that no-one on the committee had any difficulty about the granting of the loan to the PNG government. The first point with which I will deal is in relation to the timing of the referral of a loan such as this to the joint committee for inquiry and report. Loans made under the International Monetary Agreements Act 1947, as amended, stand automatically referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, for inquiry and report within two months. Such a time frame does not encourage a long or detailed inquiry. Further, the legislation does not specify when in the approval process loans should be referred to the committee. Thus, the national interest statement was tabled some time after the loan was approved—that is, while the loan was granted on 21 June 2000, the NIS was not tabled in the parliament until 28 August 2000.
Committee members had some difficulty in understanding why the joint committee was included in the process at all. Parliamentary scrutiny is a good and desirable thing but, to be effective in the consideration of loans such as this, it must occur earlier in the approval process than it does under this legislation. It is possible to include such scrutiny and approval processes without causing delays. For example, the approvals of government projects over a specified cost have to include time for consideration by the Public Works Committee. This has been so since the early years of the Federation. Since 1996, all treaties proposed for ratification must be examined by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. Only 15 sitting days are allowed for its processes. This period is often as short as five or six weeks—rather shorter than the two months specified in the legislation for these loans.
As the report states, what we see in this case is a concession of parliamentary scrutiny in theory but a denial of it in practice. We have recommended that the legislation be further amended to ensure that parliamentary scrutiny occurs before loans are executed under its provisions. We believe time can and should be made for scrutiny of these loans. Surely it is a waste of effort on all sides if there is no opportunity to make this scrutiny both timely and effective. The NIS states that an additional loan of $A30 million will be made to PNG shortly. It is unlikely that, if our recommendation is accepted, the legislation will have been amended to avoid a repetition of the situation set out in this report.
The second point relates to some of the material given to us by departments involved in this process. The act is quite specific about the matters to be covered in the national interest statement: the terms and conditions of the loan and, broadly, Australia's national interest. The section in the national interest statement on the terms and conditions of the loan was not very helpful. It simply stated that the loan agreement `contains standard commercial terms and conditions, including an indemnity clause designed to protect the Commonwealth's interests.' 
Australia's national interest was not given much more consideration than the loan itself in the national interest statement. It was brief and, as far as it went, satisfactory. Unfortunately, neither the statement nor the evidence at the public hearing gave any indication of how Australia's national interest is defined or what factors are taken into account during that process. DFAT's additional material provided little additional light on either issue, repeating, with slight variations, what had already been put forward. I would hope, and I know that the committee shares this view, that the quality of the information provided by these organisations could improve if further loans are made under the provisions of this legislation. 
I commend the report to the House.

"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2000-10-30,"—The Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Amendment Bill 2000 is a bill for an act to amend the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992. The intent of this bill is to amend the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 to require all employers to remit the superannuation guarantee payments on a quarterly, rather than yearly, basis. This is, of course, a minimum and employers that currently pay monthly shall be entitled to continue doing so. The bill also makes provision for employers to remit advice to the Australian Taxation Office on a quarterly basis if they have a shortfall in their superannuation guarantee liability. This is to ensure that not only are the moneys paid on a quarterly basis but also that the tax office keeps a quarterly, not yearly, watch on companies' superannuation guarantee liability.
Quarterly superannuation guarantee is an idea whose time has come. Labor originally proposed quarterly superannuation payments in 1992 when we introduced the superannuation guarantee. We agreed to annual payments to give employers time to settle in. Most employers are now compliant and pay more frequently than annually. Many pay quarterly or even monthly. They should not be at a competitive disadvantage compared with the small number of employers who do not pay their workers' super so conscientiously. The government admits that the amount of outstanding superannuation guarantee payments is $76 million. The Australian Taxation Office received some 8,000 complaints regarding superannuation guarantee compliance last year and 800 employers last year paid no superannuation at all. So we do believe this is a significant problem.
I now draw to the attention of the House some specific examples of that problem. First, let me pay tribute to the workers from QC Bricks who have driven all the way from Bundaberg over the weekend to be in the chamber today to highlight the issue of superannuation guarantee non-compliance and to support this bill. I also acknowledge the energy and enthusiasm of their AWU organiser, Damien Green, which has led to their visit. These workers are former employees of the Wide Bay Brickworks in Bundaberg. The Wide Bay Brickworks workers did not have their superannuation payments paid from 1997.
The workers' union—the AWU—contacted the tax office in September 1997 about the insufficient superannuation contributions. This was a full two years before the brickworks went into receivership. The outstanding contributions total $415,000. That was those workers' retirement incomes. The tax office apparently did precious little over that two-year period to chase down that money for the workers. Whenever anyone asked what they had done, the tax office would tell them that secrecy provisions prevented them providing anything other than the most basic details. So when the company went into receivership, the workers lost over two years superannuation. They are scandalised that the former owners are still walking around Bundaberg, with no prosecution action taken, apparently getting off scot-free. What message does this send to employers generally?
In my electorate of Wills the workers at the Coburg Dyeworks had a similar situation happen to them. The administrator sacked the 61 workers at the Coburg factory in March this year and the workers stood to lose over $650,000 in superannuation and other entitlements. The administrator then applied to the employee entitlements scheme for reimbursement of the workers' lost benefits. They found that one of the many constraints of this scheme is that it does not cover superannuation. So no matter how much money you have lost, the government's scheme for guaranteeing workers' entitlements does nothing to cover these entitlements. The only company where superannuation got paid after the company went bust was National Textiles, one of whose directors was the brother of the Prime Minister. So if you are the brother of John Howard or the son of Peter Reith you can get special help from this government in an emergency, but otherwise you are on your own. 
I now refer to the case of Ms Lara Sharp. Ms Sharp commenced work with Baywaves Family Haircare in September 1994 and soon realised that her employer was not paying her superannuation. She lodged the appropriate notification forms with the tax office. On 30 June this year, the day before the introduction of the new tax system, the business was evicted from its premises. Upon contacting the tax office, Ms Sharp was informed that there was nothing that could be done in relation to her superannuation for 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000. Lara Sharp is understandably angry about this situation. She had been in contact with the tax office since 1997 about non-payment of superannuation. She believes that ample warning was given to the tax office and that proper compliance work should have been undertaken.
I turn to the case of Ms Jamie Brighton of Bells Beach, Victoria. She started her apprenticeship at Alfio's Bistro in Torquay and was there for two years. On her departure she asked Alfio, the owner, to give her details of her superannuation so that she could put it into the new fund at her new place of employment. Her parents also asked many times and they asked their accountant to follow it up. She then filled out a complaint form from the Australian Taxation Office in November. She asks:
Is it the practice of the Australian Taxation Office to let people like this off scot-free and leave hard working junior people to suffer the consequences?
She says:
Alfio Pizzeria & Bistro is running in Torquay doing a lucrative business so there is no doubt that the owners can be located. I am a young hard working person who is extremely frustrated that I can get no answers; surely it is against the law and taxation offices responsibility to follow these things up.
Indeed, surely it is. Ms Brighton also advised that she had written to her local representative, Mr Stewart McArthur MP. She said she had received unsatisfactory replies from all, including the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Rod Kemp. She then went to the Commonwealth Taxation Ombudsman. The reply in all correspondence was:
The ATO is unable to disclose specific information about the progress of the actions taken due to the secrecy provision of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992.
She says:
It's all very well to have secrecy provisions but as far as I can see it's an excuse to do nothing and have something to hide behind. The reply from the Commonwealth Taxation Ombudsman was in fact that the Taxation Office had done absolutely nothing on this issue and they would follow it up and here we are in December and nothing has been done.
The December referred to was a year later.
I turn now to Chaucer's Reception Centre. Chaucer's Reception Centre in Melbourne, associated with J.B. & T.M. Catering, went into liquidation leaving superannuation guarantee entitlements unpaid. For example, Ms Mia Fenner-Bailey was owed over $2,500 in superannuation, representing 76 weeks of work. I am advised that J.B. & T.M. Catering have not paid superannuation guarantee since 1993 and that a number of their employees have contacted the tax office concerning this but the tax office has failed to recover any of their money. Ms Fenner-Bailey has told me that her pay cheques claimed that superannuation was being paid to National Mutual, which has since been taken over by AXA. AXA advises that it has no superannuation policy for Mia.
I turn to Mr Paul Durrant. Mr Durrant, also in Melbourne, worked for Phantom Property Maintenance. He says that he was underpaid $4,450 in superannuation entitlements when Phantom Property Maintenance closed, only to see those associated with that company reopen as Borg Property Maintenance. Both Mr Durrant's attempts and my attempts to ascertain from the tax office what action it was taking to recover his superannuation money were met with the response that it was bound by secrecy provisions regarding the supply of information concerning the tax affairs of the company. Surely these provisions should not prevent someone who has a superannuation guarantee entitlement being able to ascertain what action the tax office is taking to enforce their entitlement. 
I turn to the case of Mr Michael, a resident of Bulleen, whose employer had not been paying his superannuation guarantee as required under the law. He contacted the Australian Taxation Office, seeking its assistance in getting his superannuation contributions. Instead of the rather more efficient service that you receive from the tax office when you owe it money, Mr Michael was told that he should contact the department of workplace relations because the tax office only collects figures on noncompliance for statistical purposes. The same thing happened to Rebecca Pattison, of Boronia Heights, who made a complaint in 1998. She received a letter from the tax office in September 1998, thanking her for providing all the necessary information. A year later, she said in a letter to her local member:
I then contacted the ATO, for them to look into it. It has now been a year, and I still haven't heard anything about it. 
The reason that Ms Pattison had not heard anything was that the ATO simply entered her information onto a database. Ms Pattison found out herself, with one phone call, that her superannuation was not being paid, whereas the tax office had not done anything in the course of 12 months.
In addition to addressing those sorts of problems, quarterly superannuation is an idea whose time has come due to the introduction of pay-as-you-go taxation. The introduction of the pay-as-you-go, or PAYG, tax collection system will mean that employers will remit GST and other taxes every quarter. They already have to calculate SG liabilities every quarter, so it is entirely reasonable that at the same time you take care of your tax obligations you take care of your superannuation obligations. I have been consulting widely concerning this bill and I am delighted to have received an overwhelmingly positive response. The Queensland Treasurer, David Hamill, said: 
... the Queensland Government supports the general principle contained within your Private Member's bill. 
Similarly, the Victorian Treasurer, John Brumby, said:
... the Victorian Government is supportive of the general thrust of the proposed bill and we see no unintended consequences arising from its passage.
Helen Martin, Vice President of the Institute of Actuaries of Australia, said:
The IAA supports the policy intent of the proposed Bill to require payment of SG contributions at least quarterly.
Philippa Smith, the Chief Executive Officer of ASFA, the largest superannuation body, said:
As you are aware, this has been an issue of great concern to ASFA for a considerable period of time. 
Similarly, the Institute of Chartered Accountants Australia said:
The proposal to require employers to remit Superannuation contributions quarterly is consistent with the previous ICAA submission to Parliament and therefore supported by the ICAA. 
The editor of the Bundaberg News Mail, wrote:
Moving to quarterly payments, quickly letting workers know of any shortfall and immediately following up with the employer would offer great protection.
Sandy Grant, the Managing Director of Industry Fund Services, said:
We fully support your proposed bill - it is long overdue.
The General Secretary of the National Union of Workers, Greg Sword, said:
Our view is that the proposed amendment would be welcome ... our view is that those employers who may be affected by the amendment are those who should be affected.  
That is absolutely right. It is also worth noting that Deputy Commissioner of Taxation Mr Leo Bator told the Senate as recently as 17 October:
... if you are dealing with an annual amount that has not been paid, in the cases where that is large it is perhaps harder for the employers to come up with the money to pay it. Smaller debts paid more frequently are probably going to be beneficial to both employer and the employee. 
He also said:
... in our view, legislation that crystallised a liability at an earlier time should enable the ATO to deal with shortfalls in a more timely manner. 
It is also noteworthy that three government senators supported quarterly superannuation contributions in a Senate committee report tabled in March 2000. Quarterly payment of superannuation is not a cure-all for the compliance problem; there are also issues to do with the secrecy provisions, the tax office's lack of resources and excessive focus on the GST, and the problems of workers not having legal standing to pursue their entitlements. But it is a significant and necessary step forward. Workers should not miss out on their earned superannuation entitlements. It is not fair to them, and it simply puts the onus of funding their retirement back onto taxpayers. I know these private members' bills normally do not go anywhere, but this one really should, and I urge the government to take the action to progress this bill through the parliament or, if they cannot bring themselves to do that, introduce their own bill for quarterly contributions in the certain knowledge that they have our unqualified support.

"Kernot, Cheryl, MP",ALP,2000-10-30,"—I present the Job Network Monitoring Authority Bill 2000 and seek leave to present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. 
Leave granted.
—I am presenting today a new private member's bill which has as its aim the establishment of the Job Network Monitoring Authority. When the Job Network was created by this government in 1996, this was done outside of parliament, thereby bypassing parliamentary debate and opportunities for amendment—that is, the normal levels of scrutiny, accountability and transparency that large changes of this nature should and normally have. In Labor's view, the government's refusal to allow the parliament as distinct from its department to examine the Job Network and the radical $3 billion experiment that it represents needs to be remedied.
The secretiveness that surrounded the Job Network's establishment has also continued in its operation. Using the same organisation that established the Job Network—that is, the department—to monitor its effectiveness is just not acceptable in an age of greater accountability of the executive and its actions. The problem of having the same organisation establish, monitor and create policy for, as well as let $3 billion contracts for, it is not a new one. In fact, economists have been studying `capture theory', as they call it, for some time. We have only to look at the public sector information technology outsourcing debacle, which has cost taxpayers millions of dollars, to see the government's failure to monitor its large outsourcing initiatives in any meaningful way. This government has let its ideology of `private is nearly always good and public is nearly always bad' cloud its responsibilities to ensure that when contracts are handed out en masse there is still a careful and ongoing independent analysis and monitoring of the process. Labor believes this is vital to secure for the taxpayer value for money and minimum quality standards. It is also vital to ensure the public has confidence that there is no cover-up. It should be noted that it took the Auditor-General to uncover the massive losses. Details of the loss of taxpayers' money of this magnitude should have been open to public scrutiny well before the Auditor-General's report. 
We also know, through feedback from job seekers and Job Network providers as well as analysis from labour market researchers, that there are structural flaws in the way that the system of contracts and associated payments is administered. These structural flaws are making it difficult for even the most community spirited Job Network providers, of which there are a large number, to do their job effectively. Let us not forget that this Job Network is a radical experiment on the unemployed of Australia—and an ideological one in making this experiment a purely market driven one. The Auditor-General has pointed out that this market is one that is artificial. It has been created from scratch, and the rules are created and enforced purely by the department, DEWRSB. In an artificial market like this one, you would least expect a blind obsession with doing everything on a purely tendered basis to work. This purely tendered basis is, however, the methodology that is currently applied to the Job Network. The current Minister for Employment Services admitted as much when he recently flagged the idea of not tendering the entirety of the Job Network in the next round. The structural flaws in the design also include the fact that every extra dollar that is kept as a profit by a provider means that one less dollar is spent on training the unemployed. These are flaws that can best be exposed through an independent monitoring authority as proposed in this bill.
When Labor began case management of the long-term unemployed, it recognised that it was important for a separate body to monitor and evaluate the system to be established. To this end, the Employment Services Regulatory Authority was established. It was at arm's length from government and had wide-ranging powers to oversee the tendering out of the long-term unemployed to case managers. Whilst this legislation has some similarities to that which established ESRA, it is not the same—and it cannot be: all of the powers once held by ESRA have now been absorbed by DEWRSB. This bill does not seek to transfer them all back to the Job Network Monitoring Authority. Instead, it seeks effectively to monitor DEWRSB in its role as the administrator of $3 billion of Job Network contracts. The monitoring authority will have no direct role in the tender process.
I would now like to take the House through some of the Job Network problems that we know about and how the proposed monitoring authority would be able to address these. The first one is the problem of `parking' or `creaming', as it is called. Wherever you have a system operating purely on a limited capacity in terms of the number of unemployed that you can have on your books for assistance at any one time, there is an incentive built into the system to deal with the easiest cases first. This can also lead to helping the easier cases at the expense of the harder cases. It is possible to help these easier cases first, so as to get a payment, and to leave the harder cases until later or in fact not help them at all. Providers can do this because they know that, because they are not allocated money to assist every single unemployed job seeker, they can pick and choose who they help. They know that another job seeker will be walking through their door pretty well straight away and that this person may be much easier to help than some of their existing clients. I hear time and time again that, especially if you are a mature age job seeker and if you are someone who requires a little bit of money to be spent on you in training or retraining, there is a very significant chance that you will be `parked'. In other words, your details will be accepted and filed, and your resume will be shredded after three months; no follow-up phone call, no provision of training—nothing. Labor would argue that the design of the system encourages this to the detriment of many other genuine but harder to help job seekers. One of the first tasks of the Job Network Monitoring Authority will be to conduct an urgent and independent review of the payment system.
Perhaps the most important flaw in the current structure is the lack of guaranteed training. It is true that Job Network providers are allocated a portion of their money under their contracts for training purposes. Allocating this money, however, is absolutely no guarantee that any of it will actually be spent on training the unemployed. Given the large feedback that I receive from unemployed people about the lack of training that many of them receive and from concerned staff working for the Job Network providers, it is really clear that this aspect of the process is not being monitored at all. In fact, this was confirmed by answers from the Minister for Employment Services to questions on notice put by me that state, in response to a query about the amount of training time: 
Job Network members are not required to account for expenditure on various forms of assistance to clients. The department cannot, therefore, report on expenditure on accredited training within Job Network.
Perhaps they should be. How else will it be known whether Job Network providers are in fact providing the training that they are paid to undertake? Why shouldn't they be required to demonstrate this, as they are taking $3 billion worth of taxpayers' money?
As can be imagined, my office has a lot of contact from people who are dissatisfied with their treatment under the Job Network. This is not to say that some people are not perfectly satisfied, and I have acknowledged on previous occasions some of the strengths of this new system. But that does not mean that we should simply ignore areas where improvement can be made. A lot of people have recently told me that they are extremely dissatisfied because they have been unfairly breached while registered with Job Network members. What appears to be happening is that unemployed people are being breached for very minor misdemeanours—unable to turn up for an interview, for example—with no checking to ensure that there is not a legitimate excuse. The misdemeanour is passed on to Centrelink, who implement the breach, again without a checking process, and the first thing the individual knows is that their payment does not arrive. What is just as bad is that, when the unemployed individual goes to appeal against their breach and offers a legitimate excuse, they are confronted with the fact that DEWRSB, the department that monitors the Job Network, asks, as a part of their business agreement with Centrelink, that `at least 60 per cent of all possible breach notifications actioned are applied and at least 75 per cent of these are maintained'. In other words, there is a quota of breaches to be filled.
We have a right to know more about the incidence of breaching by providers. Mission Australia claimed last week that these breaches and the increase of breaches are contributing to the upturn in homelessness and pleas for assistance from many disadvantaged Australians. So the role here of the Job Network Monitoring Authority will be to investigate Job Network providers who are applying high levels of breaches and to take action to ensure that the particular Job Network provider is only making breach recommendations when there is no reasonable explanation.
Another important role of the Job Network Monitoring Authority will be its ability to provide some measure of how well the Job Network is performing. To date all we have had are what can only be described as—and I still describe them as this—dodgy assertions by the Minister for Employment Services, because he seems to be desperate to prove that his system is better than any other previous system. It is different and it deserves to be scrutinised. It is not all bad but nevertheless he should be required to give us the proof of how his system is operating. I note that there has not yet been published a net impact analysis of the Job Network programs. This is the best way to analyse their level of effectiveness. I call upon the minister to undertake and publish these studies immediately.
I would also like to note that the first independent and thorough analysis of the Job Network will come not from the government and not from the department but from the OECD, one of those international bodies that Mr Howard is always quite suspicious of. While I am sure that the OECD will come up with some interesting findings, it is in fact a once-off occurrence and what is needed is ongoing monitoring of the department's administration of the Job Network. Problems need to be identified, publicly discussed and solutions worked out not just once by an international organisation which only has access to what the department shows it but by a more formal domestic authority that has access to its own store of knowledge and expertise concerning the Job Network. This monitoring authority will provide job seekers, Job Network providers and the general public with an objective analysis of how things are really faring. It will also provide the basis for constructive reform. 
I call upon the government to pass this bill to establish the Job Network Monitoring Authority. If the Job Network is running as smoothly, as fairly and as transparently as the government claims it is, then I am sure the Minister for Employment Services will have no hesitation in offering his support for this bill. This authority should have been set up at the same time as the Job Network, back in 1996. We are entitled through parliament to have accurate and independent information and analysis of how the Job Network is achieving its goals. They are very important goals. They are about the dignity of work for all Australians. Four years later, it is time to remedy that deficiency.
Bill read a first time.

"O'Byrne, Michelle, MP",ALP,2000-10-30,"—Like most members in regional seats, I am most concerned at the decision of the ABC board to reduce the budget for news and current affairs by $3.7 million. When cuts are made to any organisation, those cuts inevitably occur at the edges. In the case of ABC news and current affairs, the edges are in rural and regional Australia. Regional people have a right to expect locally produced and locally focused news, not news from Sydney or Melbourne. Any reduction in the quality or scope of locally produced programming would increase the information gap between those in large capital cities and those in regional areas.
This concern is also clearly shared by the more than 60 Tasmanian ABC staff who attended a stop-work meeting last Friday. That these dedicated staff are concerned enough to take industrial action should ring very loud alarm bells for all members. Their future and the future of regional programming are at risk. The ABC, and particularly ABC news and current affairs, needs support to overcome the impact of the government's cuts to the budget, cuts which were the genesis of the current difficulties. It is essential that the ABC strive for continued improvement, but this cannot happen when local services are under threat. It is essential that the ABC's local and rural and regional news and current affairs programming is not only preserved but strengthened for the benefit of rural and regional listeners. The only way this can occur is through a commitment by the government to properly resource quality public broadcasting. This has been an issue that the National Party members have taken up over the last week or so. I am pleased to see that they have seen the error of their ways in previously supporting the reduction in the ABC's budget, and I can only hope that the Prime Minister pays more attention to them now than he has in the past.",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>Australian Broadcasting Corporation: Funding Cuts</title>,Statements by Members,4,1
"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,2000-10-30,"—by leave—I move:
That this House censures the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business for:
(1)	attempting to cover up an unambiguous breach of his entitlement relating to Telecard use, until the matter was exposed in the media;
(2)	once exposed, attempting to evade disclosure of all the relevant facts through an ever-changing story consisting of deceptive, misleading and contradictory statements about the matter; and
(3)	benefiting from more lenient treatment for himself over his breach of entitlement than he is willing to afford his fellow Australian citizens.
This is the first opportunity that we have had—since a series of detailed questions have been capable of being placed before the parliament due to the circumstances in which the minister found himself, through no fault of his own, at the conclusion of the last parliamentary sitting—to expose in this place the inconsistencies and self-serving character of every thing, every piece of testimony, that this minister has given in defence of himself on this matter. It has been a sorry tale of prevarication, deception, slip-sliding and blame-shifting; whatever you care to characterise it as in the spectrum of evasion, the minister has found himself located along every position in that spectrum in the course of the last three or four weeks. 
Today in question time we found out about another meeting, which took place in September. Of course, that leads to another line of questioning. One would have thought, in circumstances where the minister wanted to put this matter behind him and to reveal everything to the public in a forthright manner, which he has so far failed to do, that, when he paid that $47,000, he would have laid on the table every element of discussion that had passed between him and his ministerial colleagues on that matter and given a full account of the character of those conversations. The minister has not done so, and so it is that in this parliament we must, like extracting teeth from a hen, day after day after day go through the minister's various prevarications, various perambulations around the point, various excuses and various justifications, to try to arrive at the key truths of this matter. 
The editorial writers of the nation want this minister to go and believe that he should have been stood aside while these investigations proceeded. By a massive margin, the people of Australia do not believe this minister—only some seven per cent give credence to the point of view that he has put across—and they believe that he should go. We discover from a reputable poll of the people of Flinders that they believe that this minister should go. We know, from backbenchers moaning at the bar when confronted by friends or acquaintances in the media, that the bulk of the backbench think that he should go. The Prime Minister thinks that perhaps he should and perhaps he should not—
—Who?
—Member for Parramatta!
—The Prime Minister thinks—
—Member for Parramatta!
—The Prime Minister thinks that perhaps Mr Reith ought to go—
—The member for Parramatta is not in his seat and is warned!
—and, indeed, when the Prime Minister first became acquainted of these facts, he vouchsafed to the people of Australia and the media generally that he had thought seriously—indeed, had given it very detailed consideration—that the minister should go. But, when he subsequently sat down and thought about his own position in the Liberal Party and the removal of that essential sandbag between the retiring Prime Minister with one foot off the bus on the way to the golf course—a position of great vulnerability which is going to get more and more vulnerable as the year to the next election proceeds—he would rather have that defensive position in place than not. But, in the meantime, what the Prime Minister has found himself in a position of effectively supporting is this: a pair of ministers who danced around this issue for months and months. One of these ministers should have had access to a proposition from his department that this was a matter that they thought ought to be referred to the police—as it ultimately was. Both of these ministers perambulated around this issue for months and months, misleading or failing to inform the Prime Minister despite the fact that they understood completely that one of the reasons why Minister Jull's services were dispensed with in the course of the last scandal involving the question of entitlements was a failure to inform, in a timely fashion, the Prime Minister as to what had transpired.
 So there is little left of the ministerial code. You would have to say, after watching the performance of the Prime Minister subsequently defending his ministers—ministers found to be in a situation of potential conflict of interest, ministers found to be in a situation of repeated breaches of guidelines—that perhaps the one guideline that would remain, that would be relatively sacrosanct as far as this Prime Minister is concerned, would be: `Whatever you do to the public, whatever you do to defend your interests in relation to your own portfolio—be it a conflict of interest or not—whatever you do with the rest of the standards that I ostensibly operate by, there is one that you can't afford to breach: that is, not informing me.' That was the last standard left of the Prime Minister's code of conduct—that is, that he has a right to be informed of the difficulties of his ministers—and it has gone. This minister has put the Prime Minister in a situation whereby retaining him in office means a final breach of his last standard. This is what the government's code of conduct says about the behaviour of all ministers: 
Ministers are provided with facilities at public expense in order that public business may be conducted effectively ... ministers should ensure that their actions are calculated to give the public value for its money and never abuse the privileges which, undoubtedly, are attached to ministerial office.
Where exactly does that standard sit now in relation to the month by month conduct of this minister? This minister will attempt to get on his scrapers and explain to the House and the Australian people what a big fellow he is for having paid back that $47,000, how it was not required of him by any civil liability that he confronted and that, as far as he is concerned, this is an action of unprecedented generosity to the Australian taxpayer and ought to be regarded as full exculpation for every situation that he has found himself in. I might add that this is a minister whose actions, despite all of that, are still under investigation by the Australian Federal Police.
—The Prime Minister. Mr Reith said, `Who said that the Australian Federal Police are still looking at that?' If you have news for us that that investigation has concluded, Mr Reith, perhaps you might tell us in your reply, because that will be a further piece of news to add to that about the new meeting you have referred to. As I said, the minister will try to defend himself, to justify himself, on the basis of the fact that he paid back the money. That would be convincing to some degree if that payment had occurred on or about 30 August 1999. That would have been a fig leaf on the vital parts of this minister as far as the exposure of these matters was concerned. 
Unfortunately, it is worth nothing at all months and months on. As every Australian knows, when you have placed yourself in breach of any of your entitlements—of all the benefits you go through, I think the maximum that you are permitted in terms of a period of grace is about six weeks on one or two of the social security entitlements—within weeks you are obliged to pay up. So, if you take the most generous of the provisions that are extended to ordinary Australians, I guess we could have said that that $50,000 would be appropriate exculpation on or about 10 October 1998, but not a minute after that. 
This minister, in placing himself in manifest breach, has not left himself there on his own. This minister has spent a considerable amount of time either pretending to knowledge that he did not have or having knowledge that he chose not to reveal. That is the only way you can interpret the various perambulations of this minister around his public explanations about what he has been up to. It is very interesting to go back over one or two of the questions we have asked here in question time. The minister said:
I have had the benefit of some of the evidence that the police have obtained as to how this whole thing happened. 
He also said:
DOFA gave me an analysis of the 11,000 phone calls and I have discussed that matter with them in great detail, and similarly with the police. We have gone over the details of the telephone numbers called and whom they may have been from and to and the like.
Details of whom they may have been from and to. It goes through a list of all the people who could conceivably have been involved. Then, a few days earlier from that point and a few days later from the first of the quotes that I used in my question, he said:
I have not been privy to the police investigations or what has been given to the independent Solicitor-General, or what has been given to the independent Director of Public Prosecutions.
Then we come to this chap's performance when it came to dealing with the question of who might have had access to the PIN:
... the details on the card and the PIN have come into the possession of people unknown to me.
Then, six days later:
Well, I knew about Ms X.
In trying to have us believe in parliament today that knowing about Ms X occurred the day before 16 October, because you will remember that this is when he became convinced that perhaps this person had been involved, he said: 
I knew about Ms X. 
I would think that anyone actually taking a look at that particular proposition would assume that the speaker was not operating on the basis of 24 hours worth of knowledge of Ms X. He said:
It was pretty obvious to me all along that this person had taken those details and effectively defrauded the Commonwealth.
He was saying that it was pretty obvious that the person who had taken those details had gone off and effectively defrauded the Commonwealth. This Ms X is a person of whom he had been denying all knowledge a bit earlier on. Now, of course, he knew about her all along. Now, of course, she is the person who has been defrauding the Commonwealth, according to him. I might say that a reading of the Solicitor-General's propositions and the DPP's propositions does not automatically lead you to that conclusion, though it has been suggested by the minister that it ought to lead you to that particular conclusion. Of course, in the rather hasty rush to conclusions on those matters—and these are studies which now have to be redone by the DPP and by the police—no doubt there has been a concern to place the word of both the minister and his immediate family above that of any other Australian. As far as that is concerned, we will see what inquiries produce. But I tell you this, Mr Speaker: none of us would have known about Ms X, none of us would known about the $50,000—
—What about Mr Y?
—none of us would have known about Mr Y and none of us would have known about the passage of the PIN number of the minister to members of his family—none of us would have had the first idea of any of that—had it not been for the fact that it was exposed in the media by the Canberra Times. We would have hadno knowledge whatsoever. And think of how long it took for that exposure to actually take place—months and months. The minister had that period of grace to consider these matters—months and months. He did try again in one of these performances before the media to suggest, `Look, this sort of thing would have come out publicly anyway, and that is why I chose ultimately to act on it and refer it to the police.' It would have come out publicly if the minister, the ministers directly responsible for the administration of our allowances, the Prime Minister or the Federal Police chose to reveal the fact that one way or another they had knowledge of it or they had it under investigation. Of course, none of them did any of these things. So this gentleman had the leisure to sit down and work out who he was going to blame and how he was going to get out of it, for months and months.
There might be a degree of sympathy extended to circumstances where other people in the ministry might find themselves in this awful situation. There might be a degree of understanding and sympathy extended to other members of the general public who might find themselves in that situation. I would find myself enormously sympathetic to the position of a person whose PIN number accidentally did fall into the hands of unauthorised parties. Were such a person to approach me as a constituent, though I have full knowledge of what Telstra's policy is in this regard, no doubt I would take that matter up diligently with Telstra to see whether I could not find a bit of time for that person to pay it back or indeed find some other way in which they might find that burden relieved.
One can find areas in which in these circumstances you might find some sympathy for the parties. You can find none in the case of this minister. This minister has made an art form of lecturing ordinary Australian workers—most of whom earn on an annual basis nothing like the amount of which the Commonwealth has been defrauded here—on their work habits, on alleged rorts associated with their workplaces, lecturing them on their choice to engage in collective bargaining as opposed to taking out individual contracts, which is what he wants them to do, putting them under incredible pressure by stripping away one protection after another from their awards, stripping away the protection that collective bargaining gives them and stripping away obligations on those to bargain in good faith. That is an expression you will hear a lot of in industrial relations debates in the months to come—`good faith' on the part of employers and employees. This is a bloke who has shown absolutely no good faith as far as this entire issue is concerned. 
This issue does not conclude with this question time and this censure debate. Quite clearly, from the answers we have had today, there is another set of questions that we have to ask. Quite clearly, we are having to extract from this minister—painfully, day by day—more of the truth of this affair. I still find it impossible to believe that, at no point in the months and months that this was in the hands of this minister and his ministerial colleagues in DOFA, nothing was reported to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet or to the Prime Minister's office about these matters. I have been inside a government and I know how these things operate. These things are not withheld from the Prime Minister's department and are not withheld from the Prime Minister's office for months and months. It may take weeks to percolate but not months and months.
Prime Ministers want to know; Prime Ministers sack people when they do not know. That makes me highly suspicious of the view, despite the assurances that we have had from time to time from this minister, from other ministers and from the Prime Minister himself, that absolutely nothing went into that office. Of course, if we discover over the next few days that something did go in, the Prime Minister will find himself in the gravest position a Prime Minister or any minister can be in—that is, he will have misled parliament because his denials on these matters have been comprehensive. If we find, for example, as we found today, that there was a meeting or a discussion in February—if we find, `Oh, we have just overlooked another discussion a bit earlier on'—this Prime Minister will be highly vulnerable to the progress of this particular matter.
They have tried every smokescreen in the book to conceal the problems of this minister. They have tried every bogus comparison with situations in which other backbenchers might find themselves. That will work with the wet head, but it will not work with those who have any forensic skill at all in their analysis of politics. We know exactly where the problem lies for this government as far as this minister is concerned and we will continue to pursue it.

—The opposition has raised nothing new today by way of questions during question time. Rather than there being, as is claimed in item No. 1 of the censure motion, an attempt to cover up, in fact today the information I provided about a phone conversation with Senator Ellison was volunteered by me because I was asked a question about whether or not I had had a particular conversation with Senator Ellison on a particular question which was part of the question. The reason I answered that question as completely as I did is that, from my perspective, it is just another element along the way which demonstrates the fact that I have attempted to ensure that this matter was properly investigated at all times.
The claim was that the investigation had taken a lengthy period of time. I had not given much consideration to the thing when it was first raised, other than to say that I thought it ought to go off for a full departmental investigation. I was told that that was what was going to happen. After Christmas—in fact in February—I had not heard anything and I made it my business to ring up the minister and ask him to advise me that the thing was being properly investigated. That is what he said. We did not have a meeting about it. I rang him—I can remember I was in Sydney at the time and he was in Western Australia—and we had the conversation. He advised me that he had a high level departmental committee to investigate matters of this sort, that the thing was properly being dealt with in accordance with a process that had been established, and I said, `You're the minister running it,' and obviously I would rely on his assurances about it. 
I did not hear any more about the matter until April when arrangements were made for me to have a discussion with the Department of Finance and Administration. That discussion was on 13 April, and I have recounted that conversation. After that conversation, the department replied to me by letter dated 2 May. They replied by providing answers to various questions that arose during our discussion. I was on leave on 2 May. I returned from leave on Sunday, 7 May. I then, for the first time, saw their letter. I drafted a response. It was typed the next morning, on 8 May, and I advised the Prime Minister accordingly on that date.
In response to the first question which is raised in the censure motion—`attempting to cover up an unambiguous breach of his entitlement relating to Telecard use, until the matter was exposed in the media'—the facts of this matter demonstrate that at all times I have sought to have the matter properly investigated by the proper authorities. Senator Minchin, when he was the minister, did establish a process for when any questions arose about entitlements. That process was employed when the matter came to notice on 30 August 1999. The censure motion is correct to the extent that there was a breach of my entitlement relating to telecard use. That is true. I have admitted that. I am sorry that happened. It happened back in 1994. I was then a member of the opposition. I was not a member of the executive. As the facts, I believe, completely demonstrate, there was no advice to me about this matter whatsoever from any person until the matter was raised, when a departmental official asked a member of my staff whether or not I was using the telecard. That transpired on 30 August 1999.
I was asked today during question time whether I knew of earlier minutes or some contact between Telstra and DOFA at some earlier point in time. The fact of the matter is that I did not know. I never knew. I am sorry that nobody advised me. It would have been better obviously if somebody had advised me. I have said on the public record that, if somebody had advised me, I would have told them at an earlier period what I told them on 30 August, which is that I have not used the thing for years. Sure, I made a mistake; I gave my son the card details. He was going off to Western Australia. He is the eldest son. I would have to say, looking back on it, that I do not know why we were so worried about him. Anyway, he was going on a trip and I was concerned that he could get in contact with me. That was a mistake. I believe that I paid a very high price for that mistake—a very high price indeed. I did provide a cheque this morning to the relevant minister's office. It was for the sum of $47,707, minus $950 which I had already paid. The department tells me that that is the amount paid by the taxpayer, taking into account whatever arrangements the department has with Telstra. On that basis I paid for every last phone call from 18 January 1994—very nearly 11,000, except for the son's calls—which I never knew about, made by people whom I did not know to hundreds of places around the world and from hundreds of places around the world back to Australia.
The Leader of the Opposition says, `Oh, well, on 30 August 1999 you knew the extent of what had happened.' He said, `I will give you some grace. I will give until 10 October 1998 to pay.' You are a bit confused. It was the year later—but let us pardon such trivialities. The fact is that on 30 August I did not know it was 50 grand. The department did not ring me up and say, `There has been 50 grand worth of calls going back five years.' The department gave me an email which demonstrated $9,000 worth of calls over the previous nine months. That is what they gave me. They did not tell me about $50,000. I know now, because I have seen it in the newspaper, that there was a minute prepared by the department in the following few weeks in September—a couple of minutes apparently, or some paperwork anyway. I have never seen that paperwork. They never told me that. I just did not know. 
As I said, I am prepared to accept, own up to and admit my mistakes. But, even if I had known, quite frankly would anybody with any commonsense turn around to the department and say, `Oh, 50 grand; I'll write a cheque'? Then you really would have a claim of cover-up, if you ask me. I did not know what happened on 30 August. Obviously something had happened, because I had not been using the thing. My PA wrote, `It looks like a fraud.' I said to her, `I suppose that is right, but then again maybe somebody has got my number. It has been reallocated because I have not used it for years. Maybe the wrong account has gone to the wrong place.' We just did not know. All you can do in a situation where you do not know is to say that the thing should be properly investigated.
I made a mistake, fair enough. I appreciate particularly for my colleagues, but I would have to say for everybody in the parliament, that that does not reflect well on politicians. The fact is that most people in this parliament do the right thing most of the time, and everybody knows that in this place. I did the wrong thing and I am sorry it has reflections on others. As an aside, I want to say to all of my colleagues how much I have appreciated the moral support that they have provided me with at this time.
That is a basic statement of the facts. Obviously the matter then came to the police. I sat down with the police. I have gone back over what I said in the parliament when I was asked about it, and the answers that I provided to the parliament when I was asked about it when we last sat were an absolutely fair statement of the circumstances. Sure, I knew that my son had somebody staying in the house that he was living in, which was our house. I knew that, but I did not make allegations about what had happened because the pursuit of the facts was a matter for the police. I had some information—of course I had some information; it was my house. It was our phone that was used. So obviously I had some information. DOFA provided me with some information on 13 April and I sat down and discussed it with the police. There is no inconsistency there whatsoever. I provided the House with a fair statement of what had happened. The police were the ones to investigate and to try and balance what had happened. It was then a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Solicitor-General. It is no good making accusations to me when the responsibility for assessing what happened had been with other people. Those other people have looked at it. 
Obviously, the DPP recommended that there be no charges laid, particularly in respect of my son, and I do not mind saying that that was a matter of some relief. I do not mind saying, too, that when I said that the matter should go to the police I meant, obviously, that the police should investigate each and every aspect of it. Clearly my son's actions would be subject to very close scrutiny. I did not go with him when he saw the police, and we did not organise lawyers to go down and object to questions or anything else. I said to him, and he fully agreed, `If the police want to talk to you about this matter, as they do, we should make arrangements. You should just go down there and you answer every question they ask you and give them as full a statement as any reasonable citizen would do.' And that is what he did. There have been claims of, `He declined to speak with the police again.' They are completely, totally and absolutely false.
Opposition member interjecting—
—Not by you, no. But these claims were made. I denied them because I had spoken to my son and he had said that that was not true. Then I saw in one of the papers yesterday that they are repeating this. This is a complete lie. Why is it repeated? Because people think that it is good—if they blacken my son's name they blacken me, and if they blacken me then that is a good going at the government as well.
Opposition member interjecting—
—The interjection is: `Sounds like wharfies.' I must say that you could have knocked me over with a feather when I thought I heard the Leader of the Opposition say that he was sympathetic to somebody in these circumstances. But, of course, he could not extend any sympathy to me because he disagreed with our policy on workplace relations. In fact, he has been going around the country saying, `The reason we're really after this bloke— 
—This is what you have said. You have said it in the House today. You have said it publicly—
—Pure hypocrisy.
—and that is—don't worry about the facts—`We disagree with this bloke on good faith bargaining or collective bargaining or something else, so he's entitled, therefore, to take any unsubstantiated claim that we can throw at him, his son or anybody else.'
—The fact of the matter is that that was the statement made. In terms of an ever-changing story consisting of deceptive, misleading and contradictory statements, I believe the public are entitled to know what happened. I have been prepared to explain myself. I have been prepared to go on radio to answer questions about it, and I have attempted to do so. I read the article in the Australian that formed the basis of your questions today, and the fact is that there is an answer to absolutely every one of the allegations made. Lastly, the censurer is benefiting from more lenient treatment for himself over his breach of entitlement than he is willing to afford his fellow Australians.
Opposition members interjecting—
—The Solicitor-General did actually have a reply to that claim, and that is—not that you can duplicate what happens within government with what happens elsewhere—that basically, in an analogous situation, the person would not be paying $50,000. That is what he said, if you read his report. He also said that I had absolutely no civil liability. He went through four or five headings where the question was raised whether or not there was any civil liability. The fact of the matter is that I do not have any civil liability, but I accept the fact that I have a political responsibility. I am prepared to stand up and own up to my mistakes and to accept my political responsibilities, and I have done so by paying that cheque. I think that most people, if they were able to be apprised of all the facts of the matter, would think that that was fair treatment once the matter was revealed to me and once proper investigations and proper assessments were made by independent legal people.

"Tanner, Lindsay, MP",ALP,2000-10-30,"—The last time that the House sat the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business outlined his breach of the Remuneration Tribunal guidelines with respect to his telecard, how he gave the telecard number and the PIN number to his son, how it subsequently went astray to persons who he said at that stage were unknown and how he was prepared to pay back the $950 that his son had incurred at the time and when certain events had happened. Since that time, the minister has been dragged kicking and screaming to pay the full amount that the Commonwealth has incurred as a result of his breach of the guidelines. He has been forced, along with other members of the government, to provide a significantly greater amount of detail about the whole affair, which has gradually spilled out into the public arena, in spite of his best efforts and in spite of the best efforts of the government to try to ensure that the minimum amount of information was available.
We now know, as a result of information that has become available in the public arena, that the picture he painted in this place three weeks ago is a tissue of deceit and distortion. It was all designed to ensure that he could be shielded from the full responsibility of his actions and, more importantly, that his son could be shielded from full responsibility for his actions. What he has endeavoured to do from 10 October, when the matter first became public, up until now is to maximise the protection that he and his son enjoy, to minimise the extent to which they cop the responsibility for these actions and for the consequences that have flowed from them, to ensure that other people—people who may or may not be innocent—carry the blame for those actions and to cover up the cover-up, the attempts that occurred last year to prevent this issue from ever becoming public, from ever being exposed to the full light of day as to what had occurred. The minister has endeavoured all along to try to minimise the extent to which the public is aware of precisely what occurred between him, the Special Minister of State, the Minister for Finance and Administration and the Prime Minister. 
Today we have seen a new strategy. You may recall that, a few weeks ago when this matter first came up, I talked about the multiple personalities of the minister—he moved from `Snarling Pete' to `Penitent Pete' in the blinking of an eye. Today we have a new one: we have `Whispering Pete'. It appears that the minister's approach today is that the lower the volume the less the culpability. We are clearly going to need improvements to the House's PA because he seems to believe that the way to deal with this matter is to soften his voice, go sotto voce and that that will mean the issue is less significant. The lower his voice the less serious the issue.
I am afraid it will not work, Minister, because the issues that are at stake here today go to the very core of questions about standards in public life. This is not a trivial matter. It is of enormous interest to ordinary citizens, ordinary taxpayers, because they do have to pay up. They do have to account for their transgressions. Whether it is dealing with the tax office, Centrelink or minor traffic violations, ordinary citizens do have to render account. Yet this minister has sought, at every turn, to evade his responsibilities, to cover up the actions that he has been involved in, to shift blame, and to prevent scrutiny of his actions. 
Since the last sitting, almost every day has seen another contradiction exposed in the minister's story. He told us on the very first day, on 10 October, that he had stopped using his telecard in 1994. Yet on the Today program on 13 October he said that some of the staff calls that had been made post-1994 could well have been made by him, using the card at his staff member's home. He told us in the House on 10 October, `the details on the card and the PIN have come into the possession of people unknown to me.' Yet on 16 October—the morning after the existence of Ms X was revealed by the Solicitor-General—he said on AM, `I knew about Ms X. It was pretty obvious to me all along that this person had taken those details and effectively defrauded the Commonwealth.' He was not able to tell us about Ms X on 10 October; he was not able to say, `I know where it has gone,' he was not able to point out what had happened; but on 16 October, once it had come out into the public arena, he said, `Oh, yes, I knew about that all along.'
On 15 October, again with respect to Ms X, he said, `I think I met her, but I would not know her if I saw her again.' Yet, on the very same day, he said, `My son and I were both staying in the same place. From my point of view, all along it has been just as equally likely that she may have taken the details from me.' In other words, she used to hang around with him so much that she could have been there, at his shoulder, while he was making a phone call. She could have been there trying to hear the numbers, but he did not know who she was. That is a very interesting proposition, Minister.
On 10 October on 2GB and on the 7.30 Report, he said that the card could well have been taken by hotel receptionists. Hotel receptionists the length and breadth of the country were waiting to try to take Peter Reith's PIN number and telecard. Yet, in the same quote that I referred to before, he admitted that he knew from the outset that that was rubbish; the card had gone to Ms X, and the problems had arisen from the fact that his son had given the card to Ms X. Yet he was prepared to blacken the names of hotel receptionists in a desperate attempt to shift blame, to create a smokescreen, and to suggest that there were other causes for his own misdemeanours and for his own abuse. 
On 16 October, on AM, he said that his son, Paul Reith, `didn't really know Ms X.' That was on 18 October. This woman apparently lived in the same house as his son for five months, but he did not know her. Not only that, but he offered her a flight on his father's private jet. It is a very strange proposition that you can offer somebody a flight on a private jet when you do not actually know them. I suppose merchant bankers do strange things from time to time, but I am afraid that is very hard to understand. I think the Federal Police are going to have to organise a line-up so that Mr Reith and his son can come along and ask, `Will the real Ms X please stand up?  
On 3AW on 18 October, the minister said, `I have not been privy to the police investigations, to what the police have given to the independent Solicitor-General, or to what has been given to the independent Director of Public Prosecutions.' Yet, on 12 October—six days before—on 2BL, Mr Reith said, `I have had the full benefit of some of the evidence that the police have obtained as to how this whole thing happened. In a doorstop on 23 October he said:
The Department of Finance and Administration were able to give me details of 11,000 phone calls from essentially the beginning of `94 and they gave me an analysis of each and every one of those ... and I have discussed that matter with them in great detail and similarly with the police we have gone over the details of the telephone numbers called and who they may have been from and to and the like. 
On 18 October, in the 2AW statement, he contradicted that statement. He did not know anything about the police investigation at one point but, both before it and after it, he knew all about it. 
On 15 October, in a doorstop, he said, `I was the one who suggested to the Prime Minister, in May, that there should be a police investigation.' Yet the Department of Finance and Administration minute to the Special Minister of State on 8 September 1999 makes it abundantly clear that it was the department of finance that suggested there should be a police investigation. It said, `It is proposed that the AFP will be provided with this information when it has been gathered, with a view to ascertaining whether it will investigate the matter. Indications from Internal Audit are that the AFP would wish to investigate.' More broadly, the government as a whole has been engaging in the same sort of cover-up and deception that the minister has. We may well recall Mr Reith saying that he stopped using his card in 1994, and yet the Prime Minister told 3AW on 20 October that when Telstra alerted the government to the misuse in July 1998, the department checked and it found that the minister was in the area where the calls that were dodgy had been made and therefore it was okay. But hang on—he told us he was no longer using the card and had not been using it for four years. The Prime Minister's defence as to why this early contact from Telstra was not revealed was, `We checked it and we found that the minister had been using the card.' Four years had gone by; that apparently is no inconsistency in the mind of the Prime Minister.
Time precludes me from going through all of the contradictions in the minister's story; for example, how is it that he knew the bit in the rule book that said, `You will be provided with a detailed account of your phone bill,' but he did not know the bit that said, `You are not supposed to give the card or the PIN number to anybody else.' There are a few little contradictions like that, and these are things that we will have to leave for another day. How is it that he could claim that the repayment of the $950 with respect to his son's bills would be tabled in parliament at some stage and therefore he is not engaged in a cover-up, yet he is unable to specify precisely how that would have been tabled in parliament had the matter not been revealed in the Canberra Times on 10 October?
The endless contradictions inherent in the minister's story from day one are only one part of the reason we desperately need a proper, independent judicial inquiry into this matter. Consider some of the other questions that are still unanswered. What contacts occurred between Telstra and the government prior to August 1999? Why did it take eight or nine months to involve the Australian Federal Police when DOFA advised that this should occur in September of 1999? Why do we not know who else—apart from Ms X, Mr Y, the minister, his staff and his son—used the card and whether those people were known to the minister? When was the Prime Minister's office first told? When was his department first told? Can we possibly believe that they were not made aware of this situation for a whole eight or nine months, while the minister is investigating and it is suggested that the Federal Police are involved? Can we possibly believe that the Prime Minister was not told and that his office was not told?
Why did the minister ring the Telstra whistleblower, Tom Healey, on 13 October to thank him for having spotted the problem—14 months after he spotted it? Fourteen months later the minister thought, `Gee, I'd better ring this bloke up in Telstra and thank him for sorting this out for me.' What else transpired in that conversation? Why has Telstra gagged Mr Healey? Why is Mr Healey no longer allowed to talk? These are some other issues. When did the department first advise the minister to pay the money back? Why didn't he act on that advice at that time? Why did the department minute say that $55,000 was involved? The minister said it was $50,000 and now we find it is $46,000. There may be a number of reasons for that, but one of the things we have not had explained is how many calls were made by the minister over that period and to what extent that differential is explained by the calls. 
—He just explained it to you.
—No, he did not, Minister. Why did the Solicitor-General accept Paul Reith's statement, corroborated by his father saying, `Yes, he did tell me that,' but, when it came to interviewing Ms X, not check with her father and mother, who could have corroborated her statements? Then he reached the conclusion that she was less credible than Paul Reith. Why won't the Prime Minister release the Director of Public Prosecutions' reasons, as were released in the case of the MRI scan scam? Why did the Minister for Finance and Administration, when asked about the May 1998 contact from Telstra with the government about the customer, not mention that there was a minute that showed that there was contact in July 1998? Why did the Prime Minister, who had previously been asked to identify all previous contacts, before August 1999, that Telstra had had with the government about the situation—and he knew about it straight after question time and he promised to come back and give the information to the parliament—not reveal that he knew straight after question time that he was aware that Telstra had contacted the government about this problem in August 1998? Why have all these facts been kept from the public and from the parliament for so long? Why did the government not go public at the initial stage and say, `We have a problem; here's what is being done about it'?
In conclusion, this issue is ultimately not just about the credibility of one minister; it is about the credibility of this government and, more broadly, about the credibility of this institution. It is about the credibility of parliament, of politicians and the political system—and we ignore the white-hot rage in the community about this issue at great peril. Once again we have a fundamental problem in our system exposed. While we have government investigating itself and while we have politicians investigating politicians, in these situations they will always fall prey to the temptation to dissemble, to cover up, to duckshove and to try to avoid coming to grips with the facts. We have managed in our society to move beyond the situation where we had police investigating police, so that when people have complaints against the police there is some means of independent investigation of those complaints. 
The only conclusion we can reach in this situation is that we need an independent umpire, if for no other reason than so the community can have full confidence that, when members of parliament and ministers have entitlements that accrue as a result of their jobs, those entitlements will be administered properly and people will not abuse or misuse them, and when there are any complaints being made or there is any question mark arising from any scrutiny of a person's conduct, there is an independent umpire—somebody who is perhaps situated within the Auditor-General's Office and has an official responsibility on a statutory basis for auditing the behaviour of members of parliament and ministers with respect to their entitlements. We need to ensure that community confidence in the democratic system and the parliamentary system, which is leaching away as a result of the behaviour of people such as the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, is restored. That can only be restored by two things in this case. In the specific it can be restored by a full, independent judicial inquiry into the minister's conduct—how the card went astray, what actions the government took, who knew—and it can be restored by establishing an independent auditor into the abuse of parliamentary entitlements.

"Downer, Alexander, MP",LP,2000-10-30,"—It is with great pleasure that I join with my colleagues in opposing this motion of censure. It is my view, and I think it is increasingly the view of people in the community, that the Labor Party is essentially running a vendetta against the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business. Of course, some on the other side may scoff and say, `What would you expect the Liberal Party or the National Party to say in defence of their minister?' But I think only one interesting thing emerged today through question time—in the 10 questions to the minister; a completely unsuccessful attack on him—and that was a comment that was made by the Leader of the Opposition. I think the parliament and the community should reflect on this. The Leader of the Opposition in his speech said that for anyone else in this situation he would have sympathy for them but not for the minister for employment and workplace relations.
—That's not what he said at all.
—That is exactly what he said. The foghorn over there might like to have a look tomorrow at Hansard and see what his own leader said. You want to reject that because you think if he said that that would have been wrong—and you are right. He did say it and it exposed what the Labor Party is basically about in this whole debate. It is a personal vendetta against an Australian who is doing a wonderful job for this country and who has a lot of strength and courage—a great deal more strength and courage than you see displayed from most people on the other side of this parliament, let me say. Here we see, exposed by the Leader of the Opposition's own words, nothing more than a personal vendetta. The Labor Party does not agree with the minister's industrial relations reforms because the Labor Party is the party of the ACTU and the trade union movement. Everyone knows that. So the Labor Party has decided, because it opposes the minister's industrial relations reforms, because it opposes Australian workplace agreements and because it opposes reform on the waterfront, that it will run a vendetta against the minister. By the way, real wages under this minister have increased. This is the minister who the workers say stands up for the workers. But trade union leaders and trade union bosses oppose him because they see him as getting in their way—getting in the way of their special privileges.
—Talking of rorts, what about the rorts on the waterfront by mates of the Labor Party and members of the Labor Party—some of them in senior executive positions, no doubt, in the Australian Labor Party—perpetuating and promoting these sorts of special privileges for trade union bosses!
—What about the rorts in the South Australian Liberal Party!
—What about the South Australian Labor Party!
—The member for Port Adelaide and the minister!
—We would like to comment on the South Australian Labor Party, but we will not because tonight we will be watching Four Corners on the Queensland Labor Party. But I digress; I do not want to get into that. I think the fact is that the Labor Party are exposed. The Labor Party are exposed by their own leader attacking a minister personally and saying that he would extend sympathy to anyone else in the same situation. 
The facts are quite simple, and no attempt by the Australian Labor Party to try to show that the minister has been in some way misleading—and they had 10 questions to do that today—has been remotely successful. The minister did let his son have the card, and the minister has admitted that was a mistake. The card was subsequently abused, and the minister has said that he will pay the full amount of money that the taxpayers otherwise would have had to pay. I would have thought that was perfectly clear. The public may have been understandably exercised about this, but in the end the minister has paid the money. He said that he sent a cheque today. The minister has paid the money. I would have thought that the Labor Party would understand that that was the end of the matter. They have been backgrounding the media and building it all up to today. They then put 10 weak questions in a row and brought on a pitiful censure. They ask why we do not shout during the censure. It is very hard to get excited about the propositions being put today by the Australian Labor Party. It is hard to be emotional and excited about them. The simple fact is that the minister has repaid the money. The minister has not personally benefited from this in any way at all. He did not make those 11,000 phone calls, many of which—I have forgotten the number now—were made overseas. The minister was not making the calls. He was not encouraging the calls to be made. What are the Labor Party saying here? Are they saying that somehow the minister personally benefited from all of this? This is an absurd proposition. I think it is about time the Labor Party—which have been, along with some people in the media, appallingly opportunistic—tried to get a grip on this issue and got things into a bit of perspective. I will say one other thing. Having been a member of this august chamber myself for nearly 16 years—some would say too long I know, but I enjoy it— 
Government members interjecting—
—You say 16 more! Having been a member here for nearly 16 years and having had a family involved in politics for quite some while, you learn a few things as you go on. One of the things I have learned is that whenever Labor gets into one of these frenzies—you know, they start asking questions of minute detail, trying to compare a 2GB interview with a 2UE interview, or a 6PR or a 5AN interview or whatever it is—the public start to turn off. The great danger for the Labor Party here is that the Labor Party will be itself exposed in a number of different ways. First of all, for all the energy the Labor Party is putting into this issue, what isn't it doing? It is not talking about issues of concern to the general public. It is not developing its policies. It is not encouraging a sense of inspiration that an opposition has to do if ever it is to become the government. 
I speak from a bit of experience here. As a child I can remember the Labor Party used to love this sort of game in opposition. I can remember Evatt and Calwell as leaders of the opposition used to run these sorts of lines, and Bill Hayden did too when he was the Leader of the Opposition. The thing about the Labor Party is that you never, ever did anything else. So the public did not vote for you, and you kept wondering why you kept losing elections. You kept losing elections because you harp on and on about something like this when the minister has fully repaid the money and explained the circumstances of the situation and when the minister has been completely transparent in his approach to this, because you think there may be some political advantage and because you want to attack the minister personally because you hate him for reforming the industrial relations system. That, of course, is the leitmotiv of the Leader of the Opposition's speech.
Mr Speaker, I think the Labor Party is making a very big mistake. Of course, you run the risk of being exposed for hypocrisy. We have seen a little of that over the weekend. You obviously run that risk. But you run a deeper risk with the Australian public in that you are not talking about things that are important to them. You have nothing to say about tax anymore. You devoted every single question—that is an exaggeration; nearly every single question—at question time to the GST, up until the last month or two. You were obsessed with the GST.
—I just remind the minister of his need to address remarks through the chair. I have been accused as the chair of a great number of things in the last 30 seconds.
—You have never been accused of being a member of the Labor Party.
—But I was accused of hating the minister, which I thought was just a little over the top. So I would invite the minister to address his remarks through the chair.
—Sorry, Mr Speaker. I genuinely offer my apologies to you because I know that the people of Wakefield would not thank me for making the sort of allegation I could have been interpreted as making. 
—The minister will come to the motion before the chair.
—The simple point here is that the public wonder why you ran such a scare campaign on the GST like you have never run on any other issue before and suddenly you do not talk about it anymore. Suddenly you are running a sort of monumental diversion on the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business. We had roll-back. This was what you were pounding—not you, Mr Speaker, the Labor Party. The Labor Party were pounding roll-back. We have got the GST, but Labor will roll it back.
The Labor Party does not have time to talk about roll-back any more because it is focusing on every minute angle it can possibly find on this issue relating to the minister. All I can say is that unless the Labor Party tries to inspire the public with a bit of hard policy and some creative and interesting ideas, unless it gets away from this mud throwing that it is so obsessed with under its current and very weak leader, it will remain in opposition. I do not mind—I would like to see the Labor Party remain in opposition until the end of time: that would suit me—but the Labor Party is doomed to remain in opposition for as long as it has nothing inspirational and constructive to say. The Labor Party has spent the last three weeks just slinging mud. Believe me, slinging mud does not win the Labor Party votes. I have explained that there are significant political dangers for the Labor Party.
The last thing I would say in this debate is that I think the minister, as a minister of the Crown in Australia, has done an outstanding job for this country. I do not think people should overlook the fact that he has done an outstanding job. This country needed to reform industrial relations and, yes, it needed to reform the waterfront where levels of productivity were at appallingly low levels. The minister has had the courage to do that. He has had to be protected for long periods by the Australian Federal Police. I admit that the minister is a friend of mine. When I have been in Melbourne and have gone out to have a cup of coffee with the minister—a caffe latte, a cappuccino or, in my case, a strong, long black coffee—he has had to have with him a Federal Police officer or two. The minister has had to be accompanied by Federal Police because he has been threatened in an outrageous way by people, obviously associated with the waterfront, whom the Labor Party stands up for. Some are involved in the Labor Party. I am not sure that the ones who threatened him are involved in the Labor Party, but the unions certainly are. The minister has shown enormous courage in those circumstances.
I will tell you something else. It has not been tough through that period just for the minister—but then the minister is tough—it has also been tough for his wife and his children. The Labor Party needs to understand that this sort of game can be played by anybody in public life. Two sides can play this sort of politics. The Labor Party has been pursuing these people, such as Paul Reith, and saying, `Is Paul Reith's story right, is Ms X's story right or is Mr Y's story right?' All I can say about that is that the public are right to be interested in the minister and what the minister has done, but the Labor Party attacking Paul Reith and not Ms X because Paul Reith is Peter Reith's son and hitting him over and over again is not alright. There are many people in this country who are a good deal more decent than people in the Labor Party—and that is most people in this country—and they will, in the end, condemn the Labor Party for what the Leader of the Opposition has conceded today is nothing short of a vendetta against this minister. The Leader of the Opposition's words will haunt him because he made it clear that he would have sympathy for anyone in this situation except the minister. That exposes the Labor Party for all it is not worth.",REPS,"<title>MINISTER FOR EMPLOYMENT, WORKPLACE RELATIONS AND SMALL BUSINESS</title>",<title>Motion of Censure</title>,Censure Motion,7,1
"Andren, Peter, MP",IND,2000-10-30,"—I want to contribute briefly to this debate. When we look around us at the empty press gallery and most of the public galleries it underlines what lack of interest there is in a repetition of the sort of debate we seem to have every 18 months. I am sure it has happened in parliaments past, judging by some of the comments I have heard from previous speakers. Prior to 1997 I imagine the high rate of interest would have made it attractive for that extra travel allowance or two to be claimed to help pay off apartments in this town. 
The member for Melbourne spoke of the credibility of this institution. While I have great respect for the credibility of it, I think out there in voter land we are absolutely losing credibility. This was noted in 1995. We have in our possession a code of conduct for parliamentarians and it has been revisited on three occasions since 1995. But at that point, under the auspices of the previous government, the major findings of a working group which produced a draft code of conduct were that such a code for Commonwealth parliamentarians should be adopted, including a parliamentary commissioner for conduct appointed jointly by both houses, and a recommendation that the commissioner should not be established under separate legislation—but be a creature of the standing orders.
That was the beginning of a reform process that has been completely ignored. After 1998 there were immediate allegations which I, amongst others, raised about the conduct of members in opposing parties and ministers. The allegations covered a range of issues, from conflicts of interest to misusing parliamentary entitlements, as well as the use by staff of travel allowances during an election campaign when those members of parliament were not up for re-election—a clear breach of at least the spirit, if not the actuality, of any sorts of guidelines that should be in place. Whether it be use of a phonecard or use of a car—a privately plated DAS vehicle—the guidelines are obviously not being adhered to in many cases. There but for the grace of God go probably nearly everyone in this House, given the pressures of this job and perhaps the temptation, innocent or otherwise, to allow the use of a car to someone who has not been authorised for that purpose just to duck down the street to pick up something. These sorts of things can happen. They can only be controlled by a code of conduct that is overseen by an independent commissioner, and the sooner we move to that the sooner the public will begin to believe that this parliament is serious about any of this sort of stuff.
It is time to act. There is concern in the opposition at this point, with this censure motion; and no doubt there has been concern in oppositions of the past, whether they be on the conservative or Labor side of the House. But the fact remains that the feeling out there in the electorate is very angry, not about Mr Reith's particular point but about the fact that this sort of thing underlines the fact that we have no code in place that means a crumpet. 
I turn to the selective use of the ministerial code. I will not support this motion, because of the inherent hypocrisy of it. However, I think there has been selective use of the ministerial code in Mr Reith's case. Back in 1997, the code was used with some force by the Prime Minister until he found that it was getting somewhat out of control. Now we have a selective use of the code, and it renders that code absolutely useless. I want to quote further from the report of 1995 on the code of conduct for parliamentarians—`code' with a big question mark, and unless we do something that question mark will certainly stick around for some time. Back in 1995, before the travel rorts—they were still two years down the track—the report said:
Public attitudes to the behaviour of parliamentarians are reflected in a recent Roy Morgan poll which revealed that only seven per cent of Australians believe that Members of both State and Federal Parliament are of high or very high standards of honesty and ethics.
I certainly do not enjoy being sought out and being referred to every 18 months for a comment on this. I would like to think that my colleagues and friends in this place are people I can deal with every day. If I am asked a question, I will answer it as honestly as I can. I will also look after my entitlements as honestly as I can, and I am sure 98 per cent of members in this House do exactly that. The review of travel allowances after 1998 found that only three to four per cent of discrepancies in the KPMG review of travel allowances were open to question. But it is that three to four per cent that is causing enormous damage to this institution, and that is what has to be attended to. 
I notice the call for an independent auditor. I have spoken with the Auditor-General over the last couple of days. The fact remains that there are not the resources in the Auditor-General's department to do the sort of forensic reactive reform—we should be talking about proactive reform—of all members' entitlements. Auditors are not expected to count each paperclip or review every transaction. They undertake tests to provide reasonable assurance that financial statements are free of material misstatement. The auditor gives a professional opinion. Five per cent or less of the relevant base amount is deemed immaterial, and therein lies the secret of our whole problem. We do not have the resources to dig beneath that five per cent or to make them accountable. There are some excellent ideas around as to how to improve the situation, and this document on the code of conduct is one way to go. An excellent private member's bill has been introduced into the Senate by Senator Murray, which I commend to all members. It suggests, among other things, a commissioner for ministerial and parliamentary ethics and also a joint committee on a code of conduct. We have it in our own hands to come up with something that has teeth. We have reneged on it; we have turned our back on it. I am certainly not prepared to turn my back on it irrespective of the sick feeling I get in the gut at every call I get on the phone to appear somewhere.
I do not need the publicity out there in Calare. The people know that I am trying to stand up for standards that mean something in this country. I am not trying to sit on a high horse anywhere. In fact, I have been so sickened at times that I felt like throwing the whole thing in. But people say, `Stick in there. See if you can bring those people on side who do believe in proper standards and then get something done about it.' I have a motion that I would offer to anyone in this House to second. I am having trouble finding a seconder to put it on the Notice Paper. How pathetic is that. The motion would read:
... that this House: 
Whilst acknowledging the vast majority of members of parliament are hardworking and honest:
1.	notes the damage done to the public standing of all politicians ... 
2.	recognises it is in the best interests of all members that the system by which they are remunerated is open and accountable; 
3.	requests that full details of members' entitlements and allowances, including staff travel and overtime, be tabled in the House every six months ... 
The Auditor-General says he needs more resources. Let us give them to him. My proposed motion would ask that the House:
4.	requests the Auditor-General be given all necessary extra resources ... 
5.	instructs the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Privileges to inquire and report on the desirability of parliament adopting an enforceable and independently administered Code of Conduct setting out clear standards of acceptable parliamentary behaviour.
I will not be supporting this motion. I think Mr Reith is a man of integrity. I disagree vehemently with a lot of his policies—I think they are unfair—but I think he is a man of integrity. He is a man who has been put in the spotlight—the same sort of spotlight any of us could have been in. I will support proper reform. I will not support this motion.

"Pyne, Chris, MP",LP,2000-10-30,"—I move:
That the House:
(1)	recognises that easing restrictions on parallel importing will result in cheaper prices for Australian consumers;
(2)	acknowledges that easing restrictions on parallel importing will allow Australian consumers to enjoy a greater range of products; and
(3)	confirms that easing restrictions on parallel importing improves product innovation and development.
In Australia we are now doing business in a global economy where economic borders are becoming more porous and diffuse. Conducting our business with the handicap of a prohibition on parallel importing is an unsustainable situation. The prohibition on parallel importing is effectively a non-tariff barrier to trade that creates a marketplace with monopolistic characteristics. As a consequence, consumers are the losers through inflated prices and a restricted range of product. In 1998 the coalition government successfully argued to dismantle the restrictions on the parallel importation of compact discs and some other branded goods. It was an initiative that was met with great resistance by members on the opposite side of the House. In arguing the case for the multinational sound recording industry, Labor forecasted that the government's consumer-friendly reforms would decimate Australia's local music industry. All of Labor's prophecies have proven groundless. The Australian music industry has not collapsed and, if last week's ARIA awards are any indication, the industry is thriving from emerging talents such as Killing Heidi, Powderfinger and South Australia's Kasey Chambers.
In 1998 Labor, sounding almost triumphant, predicted that 50,000 jobs would be lost due to the government's decision to make CDs cheaper. Labor were almost triumphant in their announcement of those potential 50,000 job losses. Instead, the retail sector for compact discs is in fact growing strongly. Indeed, in my electorate of Sturt a CD retailer commenced operation not more than a kilometre from my electorate office only a month ago. Labor's warning that the market would be flooded with pirated products has also proven to be baseless. Instead, Australians are enjoying appreciative savings on CDs and a greater range of products to choose from. Dismantling the prohibition on parallel importing of CDs has been an unqualified success.
—Who says that the prices of CDs have gone down?
—The member for Grayndler obviously has not been purchasing CDs lately, which surprises me. I would have thought that, as he is a newly married man, he and his wife would be enjoying the lower prices of compact discs and purchasing CDs together to listen to at home. It is against this backdrop— 
—Maybe old CDs are cheaper—maybe the daggy things that you listen to!
—I do not listen to daggy CDs, Member for Grayndler. In fact, you would be surprised at my eclectic range of tastes with respect to music, as I am sure the Minister for Veterans' Affairs will attest. It is against this backdrop that the coalition government needs to move to extend the principle of allowing parallel importing of books and computer software products. In 1992 a report by the Prices Surveillance Authority found that the differential between Australian and United States software prices was 49 per cent. Subsequent independent analysis indicates that the differential has narrowed over the last decade. The Australian Consumers Association estimates that at present Australians are paying 25 per cent too much for software. A report to the government by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission showed that over the past 10 years Australian small businesses have had to pay an average of 27 per cent more for packaged business software than their United States counterparts. But this could soon change for the worse—
—Bring them in, close us down!
—Far from trying to close you down, Member for Braddon, the government is proposing that small businesses pay less for their software, which has to be good for small business. Far from closing small business down, that bane of the cheat, the ACCC, has proposed that we help small business by reducing the cost to them of computer software—but, of course, I would not expect you to understand that. This could soon change for the worse. The Sydney Morning Herald reported last week that Microsoft Australia has announced a 10 to 18 per cent increase in the retail price of its software products, effective from December. Microsoft cites exchange rates as the reason behind the price hike, but there is little doubt that the price rises are largely due to a lack of competition in the software market. This impacts on all facets of the Australian economy. The Yellow Pages Small Business Index of February 2000 showed that 84 per cent of Australian small businesses and 100 per cent of medium sized businesses use a computer and therefore require computer software. The current monopolistic arrangement of allowing only one importer to source software product does not serve the long-term interests of consumers. Lifting the prohibition on the parallel importing of computer software and allowing people to compete in the alternative sourcing of products will help push down the price of software and promote product innovation and development. 
The primary benefit of dismantling the prohibition on parallel importing is an increase in product choice and lower prices for consumers. But there are other, peripheral arguments that support the removal of this barrier to trade. Labor's policy of preserving restrictions on parallel importing fails to recognise that globalisation—and, in particular, the Internet—has made domestic distribution monopolies redundant and obsolete. It is estimated that online spending in 1999 by Australians was worth about $920 million. Some industry sources say that by 2001 e-commerce in Australia will be worth as much as $1.3 billion. There are real concerns as to how much of this billion dollar industry is being captured by Australian e-retailers. Figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics show 1.3 million purchases were conducted online during the year to August 1998—two-thirds were through offshore web sites. This is revenue that the Australian e-commerce industry lost. Some industry figures—including Software Engineering Australia chief executive, Phil Scanlon—believe that removing import restrictions will give Australian e-commerce vendors a boost. Mr Scanlon reasons that Australian e-commerce vendors are presently at a disadvantage compared to United States vendors, as they are barred from approaching foreign goods wholesalers directly. Mr Scanlon argues that the import restrictions also deter global corporations from locating their operations in Australia. 
Restrictions on parallel importing have prevented Australian retailers from purchasing products from the same source, and at the same price, as overseas e-commerce retailers. As a result, Australian online retail prices are not as competitive as their overseas counterparts. This is a situation that the member for Braddon and the member for Grayndler would happily keep in place.
—They are troglodytes.
—They are troglodytes. Sadly for young people, they are troglodytes. The member for Boothby is quite right. Geographically, Australia is in a strong position to compete for online business against the United States in the lucrative and expanding Asian market, but that means being able to purchase the products at the cheapest possible price, which is what the coalition would like to be able to do for them.
In the last two parliaments, Labor have repeatedly demonstrated a reluctance to embrace new ideas, whether it be tax reform or private health insurance initiatives. Labor are giving Australian consumers every indication that, despite being proved wrong on the deregulation of the CD market, they are prepared to trundle out the same tired old arguments in the current parallel import debate.
—Just because Wham CDs are cheaper.
—As a 1980s child, I am a great fan of Wham. They have moved, and now we are a fan of more modern music, especially some of our own home-grown South Australian music.
—Name them.
—I already have. I named them earlier in my speech. People like Kasey Chambers, Killing Heidi and Powderfinger.
—Never heard of them.
—You would never have heard of them. Of course you wouldn't. You are the troglodytes on the Labor side of the House. Mr Deputy Speaker, I must get on with my address—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The member opposite is not only insulting members with personal remarks but also misleading the House, because Killing Heidi are in fact from Victoria.
 (Mr Jenkins)—The honourable member will resume his seat. Honourable members will cease interjecting.
—It is proving very difficult to give a speech on a quite important subject. By standing up for the vested interests of multinationals, Labor are again attempting to hoodwink Australians into believing that the domestic market will be flooded with pirated products. This is a disingenuous argument. By making imported products cheaper, the government is actually eliminating one of the main reasons why consumers buy pirated goods: inflated prices. Piracy is best dealt with by efficiently allocating resources for Customs and increasing penalties for infringers. There is no evidence that preventing import competition will address piracy concerns. 
Labor's plan to wind back the government's initiatives that have lifted import restrictions on CDs will not work. Their 30- and 90-day `use it or lose it' rule will not result in cheaper prices for imported goods that are in demand. Instead, Labor's policy entrenches the monopolistic advantage that many multinationals currently enjoy in Australia. By removing the restrictions on parallel importing, there is potential for price falls of around 30 per cent in the cost of books, computer games and various software applications. Surely this kind of initiative that makes educational material cheaper for all Australians would be an important plank in Labor's yet to be released knowledge nation policy. Instead, Labor is supporting cosy monopolistic protection for multinational cartels irrespective of the interests of consumers. (Time expired)

"Gibbons, Steve, MP",ALP,2000-10-30,"—I rise to respond to this motion on parallel importing. It is typical of the Sir Humphrey Appleby modus operandi of members opposite. They put out these wonderful private member's motions supporting the government's initiative when they know full well that exactly the opposite occurs from what they have said in this motion. For example, the first part of the motion says that the House recognises that easing restrictions on parallel importing will result in cheaper prices for Australian consumers. We all know that is just not true. In 1998 the federal government allowed parallel importing of sound recordings, and the promise of lower prices to consumers has largely not materialised. However, Australian record companies are now threatened by often pirated imports and Australian musicians have been subjected to reduced royalties, making it even harder for them to succeed in what is a very competitive world. My colleague the member for Braddon, who will follow me, himself a very fine musician, knows this only too well.  
The motion also acknowledges that easing restrictions on parallel importing will allow Australian consumers to enjoy a greater range of products. The move will result in an increase in pirated video games and computer software flowing into Australia, substantially undercutting the Australian industry, and will allow surplus foreign books to be dumped on our shores. The printing and publishing industry—which the member for Sturt did not even mention once during his 10 minutes—and authors will face similar pressures when the government remove parallel importation prohibitions from books. I will have a lot more to say about that shortly.
The motion also asserts that easing restrictions on parallel importing improves product information and development. What a lot of rubbish. I spent some considerable time researching for this debate and, going through all the newspaper cuttings, I failed to find one industry group that actually supported this move. For example, in the Australian on 18 July there was an article headed `Online game over, industry fears'. It read:
Open door video import rules would kill off local players. Leading computer game industry executives have lashed out at the Government's decision to relax parallel importation rules on computer and video game software. Sony Computer Entertainment chief executive Michael Ephraim says that the government has made a big mistake which will cost jobs and badly damage Australia's game development industry. Ephraim says the Government just does not have a clue about the industry, which he says has the potential to earn millions of dollars of export revenue. 
That was just one of industries. I next quote from the Australian of Tuesday, 4 July headed `Import changes favour pirates'. It reads:
AIIA—
which is the Australian Internet Industry Association—
has attacked the government for lifting software import restrictions ahead of the final report on the issue. The AIIA has attacked the decision because there was no concrete evidence for the government's assertion that parallel imports of software have any impact on software prices and that there was an import monopoly on software, or that companies deliberately delayed the release of software in Australia. 
I now quote from the Financial Review, which said:
Senior government sources yesterday confirmed that the GST will drive up consumer prices across a range of software products and was a big factor in the government bringing forward this plan. 
So obviously the GST has impacted on it and the government has brought in these measures to try and lessen the impact of the GST, that tax that nobody wants. Another article in the Australian says `Disastrous cultural consequences await'. This is from Wednesday, 12 July. It says:
The move would mean that the independent Australian publishers, who paradoxically tend to lead the game quantitatively at the moment, would lose the value of their continuing list. The potential damage to Australian publishing in the longer term could be alarming. There seems to be remarkable unanimity—
—You can't read your own writing.
—I did not write it. I am quoting—it is a bad photocopy. It continues:
... in Australian publishing that, if this decision is put into effect, it will put the independent publishers at risk.
As the member for Sturt failed to mention, this move will impact most severely on the printing industry. I have a keen interest in the printing industry because the biggest industry in Maryborough in my electorate is the printing industry. Some 700 jobs are involved there with some $22 million worth of wages being injected into that very small community. Maryborough has a population of around 8,000 people. So the printing industry employs 12½ to 14 per cent of its total work force, in my calculation. Obviously, the industry there is very concerned about the potential consequences of the decision. In the Age on 1 July, Mary Dalmau, the Group Manager of Readers Feast bookstores and former President of the Australian Booksellers Association, said that she did not expect prices to fall: 
On the calculations and investigations we did last year, we should not anticipate that there would be significant price decreases at all because the changes that have been put in place since 1991 have really ensured that the publishers have given us the best possible access to books.
Luke Stolley, the Chief Executive Officer of the Printing Industries Association of Australia, says that the ramifications could be quite horrendous. He estimated that, on a conservative basis, the industry would lose some $30 million in book production and a further $11 million in the supplying of paper and that the result could be the loss of more than 400 jobs. That figure is very conservative indeed. Phil Andersen, the National Director of the Printing Association, said that, with the opening of the market in Australia, Australia would also be opening itself to dumping, unlike any other sector. Anti-dumping legislation does not apply to books. The criteria does not apply to books because they are all the same and there is no protection whatsoever against dumping. Mr George Gatehouse, Divisional General Manager of McPherson's printing group, which has a big plant in Maryborough, said that a quarter of the families in Maryborough, where his company, the Australian Printing Group, prints books, were dependent on the industry. He said that the move to scrap import restrictions would have a bad impact on the whole sector, trickling down to paper suppliers, binding houses and typesetters. The two book printers there employ 700 people between them and associated industries would represent another 300 employees. So you can see that not one sector of the industry has applauded this decision. 
Labor is committed to making Australia a knowledge nation. As a knowledge nation, Australia would take its place in the world as a creator of new ideas and unique cultural content. Labor's parallel importation policy will ensure that Australian consumers have access to locally produced culture and content and to the latest products from overseas. Labor's policy gives consumers access to goods at internationally competitive prices. Further, under Labor's policy, Australian printing, publishing, computer software, video games and music industries will continue to provide employment and contribute to Australia's economic and culture growth. Labor will preserve the modified `use it or lose it' parallel importation regime which did exist for the book industry. This regime will be extended to apply to the video games, computer software and music industries. Under Labor, the importation of goods for which there is a local copyright will be permitted only if (1) the copyright owner does not release the material on the local market within 30 days after publication or international release or (2) the material, although released locally, is unavailable for purchases within Australia or is unavailable within Australia at an internationally competitive price within 90 days of that good being requested. The regime is commonly known as the `use it or lose it' regime.
 Australian publishers, computer software and video game distributors and record companies will have an exclusive copyright in a good or material as long as they exercise that right in a way which benefits Australian consumers. The use it or lose it regime will ensure that Australian consumers of books, video games, computer software and music will continue to have access to Australian goods which would not be developed without the competitive advantage which parallel import restrictions give to the Australian industry and will have access to the latest international releases at a competitive price. Labor's policy will result in consistency across these industries and will ensure that there is a proper balance between supporting Australia's cultural industries and promoting consumers' interests. Labor's policy will ensure the development of Australian content within the creative industries. It will foster Australian culture and Australian jobs. The use it or lose it regime will give protection to copyright owners against the importation of cheap, pirated goods and dumping of underpriced overseas residual products.

"Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP",LP,2000-10-30,"—I am very happy to support this motion. It is a good motion which should deliver benefits to consumers. Most of the same arguments we heard about removing the parallel import restrictions on CDs have been echoed today. In a nutshell, the situation is that multinational publishers do divide up markets and decide which products to release to different markets. At present, if you are affluent enough to travel frequently, then you have the ability to go to some of the large book emporiums like Borders and Barnes and Noble in the United States or Waterstones in the UK and you are able to see all the books that are not available in the Australian market. If individuals travel there, it is possible for them to purchase books and return with them to Australia. I think we should allow the same range that is available overseas in different markets to be available in Australia and let the market decide whether people want those books. The dividing up of markets by publishers is most strikingly shown by an example I remember from when I was a student. Cheap medical textbooks, special South-East Asian editions, were available in Singapore. They were exactly the same edition that we used in Australia but were often half or one-third of the price. Recently, a biography on Henry Kissinger, China Wakes by Kristof and Wudunn, was not available in Australia but available in the United States or available via Amazon.com.
In April this year the Intellectual Property and Competition Review Committee released its report into parallel importing and recommended removing the restrictions on parallel imports. Specifically, it recommended that the restrictions should be retained only if they advanced the goals of copyright and the intellectual property system more generally in ways that could only be cost effectively secured by these restrictions. Consumers are now able to buy music, videos, books and computer software direct from the Internet. What this does is erode a domestic distribution monopoly. In Europe, parallel import restrictions are banned. The committee went on to conclude that doing this would not damage the Australian economy. Lifting the restrictions would reduce the price of books and software. Computer games are currently 33 per cent more expensive in Australia than in the United States. Paperback books were 50 per cent higher in price than in the United States and 12 per cent over the UK price. There are some business software programs and popular personal computer games which are also higher. In 1998 Australia lifted the restrictions on the parallel imports of CDs and the price did fall from $A31 to $A24. The advantages of removing the restriction are cheaper products and no wait for books and software to become available. When New Zealand did this, the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research found that the prices of CDs and books were as cheap as anywhere in the world.
The government will also maintain antipiracy measures. There is no evidence in New Zealand that removing the parallel import restrictions has increased piracy. The same arguments that were raised about CDs have been raised about books and video games. Piracy is occurring now and piracy is independent of parallel importing. For example, the Napster web site allows people to download music from the Internet. In July 2000, Software Engineering Australia supported the government's initiative, saying it would help e-commerce and maximise innovation and creativity. The restrictions have prevented Australian retailers getting the same price as overseas e-commerce retailers. Therefore they have to charge more online. This has been an impediment for Australian based e-commerce retailers. In short, Australians should be able to have books, software, printed music and magazines as soon as they are available anywhere in the world. I encourage the Attorney-General to release his legislation to amend the Copyright Act as soon as possible.

"Sidebottom, Sid, MP",ALP,2000-10-30,"—The member for Sturt wants this House to recognise that easing restrictions on parallel importing will result in cheaper prices for Australian consumers. The government has scrapped parallel import provisions on music and CDs—and have prices dropped? No. He wants us to acknowledge that easing restrictions on parallel importing will allow Australian consumers to enjoy a greater range of products. Can the members for Sturt and Boothby really be believed on this issue? What benefits will there be for Australian industry, for small business and for jobs? None. The member for Sturt would also have us believe that easing restrictions on parallel importing improves product innovation and development. So does it encourage and enhance investment and create business opportunities for Australian companies? No. Indeed, a big question mark hangs over the government's interest in parallel importation.
I suspect this is nothing more than another instalment of the coalition's economic rationalist policies so blindly followed by the member for Sturt. What is his motivation for this? All the evidence so far, certainly where I come from, does not support his grandstanding on this issue. Remember that supporters of the legislation to allow parallel imports of music CDs told us it would drive down the cost of CDs. There is no substantive evidence to suggest it has. In fact, the free-falling Aussie dollar has actually resulted in increased prices for imported music. As I was told at the weekend by an employee of a music store in my electorate, all it has done is put the squeeze on small independent retailers even further because they do not have the buying power of the major chains. Is that good for small business?
I note comments from the Australian Music Retailers Association in its submission to a Senate committee report regarding parallel imports of sound recordings under the Copyright Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997, which said:
Small business retailers have been deserted by the Coalition government, in spite of its recognition that small business is the `engine room' of the economy. Government policy in this matter actively works to destroy a section of that `engine room'.
It goes on that it:
... will have a disastrous effect on small music businesses while offering little or no ultimate benefit to Australian consumers.
That is quite prophetic, it would seem. Is it good for the Australian music industry which, because of this government's dismissive attitude toward copyright entitlements, now faces the threat of cheap, often pirated imports? As my musical colleague the member for Bendigo asked, are these anticopyright policies promoted by the coalition's obsession with parallel importing good for Australian musicians, who are getting less in royalties for their work? I think not.
I refer again to the Senate report and comments from the manager of Savage Garden, Mr John Woodruff. He said:
If you own the rights to something and you pay for them and you develop them and you promote them, you should be able to protect them ... If any of you owned or controlled exclusive Australian rights to any property, be it Nike or McDonalds, and a licensee from an international territory was allowed to export into this country over the top of you, then you would never invest again. I find this argument astoundingly simple and cannot understand which part of this the Coalition does not comprehend.
Groups like Savage Garden—I would suggest they would be a very Savage Garden after this—are paying the price for this type of legislation. As usual, this government is raising more questions than it has answers to. Two years after allowing parallel imports of CDs, the government now plans to do the same for books and computer software. Again, the promise of cheaper prices for software is questionable. But to do the same for books has quite rightly raised the ire of our paper manufacturing and book printing industries. I know of the concerns in my electorate and the likely consequences for paper making mills at Wesley Vale and Burnie. It would have a significant impact on their businesses. I am advised that losses in paper production nationally would amount to some $11 million a year. It would also cost jobs in the paper making industry. Where I come from we cannot afford to lose one job. 
Unlike the coalition's approach, under Labor's policy Australia's music industry, paper manufacturers, publishers, and computer software and video game distributors will maintain exclusive copyright of their goods, but only as long as they exercise that right to the benefit of Australian consumers—that is, a use it or lose it policy. That means that local copyright holders are bound to market their goods 30 days after international release or they lose their exclusive right of import. The same applies to goods being made available for purchase under the 90-day rule. That is responsible parallel importation policy as distinct from the economic-rationalism-gone-mad policies of this government. (Time expired)

"Gibbons, Steve, MP",ALP,2000-10-30,"—In this grievance debate I want to talk about the shoddy treatment Australians receive from the major banks. Supposedly in the quest for efficiencies and cost savings, but in reality in the push for bigger and bigger profits, the major banks turn their backs on the very customers whose loyalty has helped to build the strong banking sector we see today. We see in the media almost daily that Australian banks have announced further branch closures while recording gigantic profits. In the financial year ending June 1999 the ANZ Banking Group declared a profit of $1.48 billion, the Commonwealth Bank $1.42 billion, Westpac $1.46 billion and the National Australia Bank $2.821 billion. That is a combined total profit of $7.2 billion. These figures prove that the banking sector is secure and is able to show enormous profits even in what it claims are difficult times.
What is not secure is the loyalty and commitment of the banks to the people of Australia. In spite of these fabulous profit levels, the major banks are turning their backs on their customers—and in particular rural communities—by closing branches and walking away, in some cases leaving a trail of devastation. There is one thing that small country towns can always bank on—the threat of being turned into a town with no bank, and a town with no bank is often a town with no future. Many smaller communities that lose their bank branches wither and die because people from surrounding districts have to go elsewhere for banking services and almost always undertake their household shopping purchases in the same larger areas that still have bank branches. So all the other small businesses contract and the general community suffers a major reduction in living standards, all because the major banks decide to turn their backs on people who live in country and remote areas. Australia's bigger banks do not understand the term `good corporate citizens' and would rate at the bottom of the list.
In June 1993 there were 7,064 bank branches operating throughout Australia. In June 1999 there were 5,358. That is a reduction of 1,706 branches. This means that one in four bank branches throughout Australia have closed during that period. That is, 284 banks closed per year—on average, one for every working day of every week of every year. More than one-third of these branches were in small country towns—that is, one country bank branch closed every three days. Some country towns saw as many as four or five bank branches disappear completely. The job losses in banking have been just as phenomenal. Some 40,000 jobs have been shed in the 10 years since 1990, according to Bankwatch.
Bank branch closures cause severe hardship to customers irrespective of whether they reside in our capital cities or in regional or rural communities. The decision to close bank branches impacts particularly on our elderly and those who are disadvantaged by being disabled, unemployed or part of the ever increasing number of working poor. Some farmers and small business owners can also be described as `working poor'. They struggle to survive whilst living in poverty. It is these groups that are most disadvantaged by bank closures. Bank closures are part of the assault by economic rationalism and coalition governments on country Australia. They have gone hand in hand with the closure of country schools, hospitals, railway lines and vital state and federal public services. Each closure has pulled out vital services, jobs and pay packets and slashed at the viability of our small country towns. The assault continues with the coalition's plan to sell off the remainder of Telstra.
There is one bank that is addressing this problem, and every effectively. Which bank?—I hear somebody ask. The Bendigo Bank, of course. Bendigo Bank is Australia's only regionally based bank. Formed in 1858 as a building society, it converted to bank status in 1995, at which time it was Australia's oldest and Victoria's largest building society. Bendigo has declared a profit in each year of operation, even during the depressions of the 1890s and the 1930s. Bendigo Bank is a publicly listed company on the Australian Stock Exchange and is owned by more than 22,000 predominantly individual shareholders. It has total assets of more than $4.5 billion—total funds under management exceed $5 billion—and market capitalisation of more than $400 million. The company operates more than 100 branches and employs more than 1,000 staff. 
Bendigo is a supplier of diverse financial and allied products with a strong customer service focus. Bank and subsidiary services include retail banking, commercial banking and finance, funds management, insurance, superannuation, trustee services and foreign exchange. The focus is on consumer markets and small to medium sized businesses. The group's operations are focused on Victoria. It operates branches and public agencies throughout Victoria and southern New South Wales, with outlets in each of Australia's mainland state capital cities. Business is also sourced through mobile banks and a network of referral agencies.
In January 1999, Bendigo Bank and Elders Australia began a joint venture company to deliver banking services to primary producers throughout rural Australia. The company marries Bendigo's banking expertise with Elders's distribution outlet of some 280 branches Australia-wide. In March 1999, the bank announced a joint venture with IOOF—Bendigo Investment Services—to deliver funds management and advisory services through the bank's branch network. As part of these alliances, both Elders and IOOF acquired substantial shareholdings in Bendigo Bank. Both companies now hold around six per cent of the bank's stock. In April 2000, the bank announced an alliance with Tasmanian Trustees to form a joint venture company to provide retail banking services throughout Tasmania.
In the same month, the bank announced an alliance with the Pharmacy Guild of Australia with a long-term aim to provide retail banking at pharmacies in communities not served by bank branches. In May 2000, the bank launched Australia's first ethical bank deposit fund with Ethical Investment Trust. This fund will benefit the work of Community Aid Abroad. In 1998, the bank devised and launched the innovative and exciting concept called Community Bank. This sees the Bendigo Bank partner local communities which operate franchised Bendigo Bank branches. Twenty-eight are currently open. A further 11 have been approved and are shortly to begin trading. The bank has received about 1,000 inquiries and expects between 50 and 60 Community Bank franchises to be in operation by the end of 2001. Local investors raise the start-up capital and become shareholders in their own banking venture. Bendigo Bank provides the banking infrastructure and coverage of its banking licence, and the community and the bank share the revenues. Shared responsibilities mean shared rewards. Profits made by the local company would be retained with the twin objectives of paying shareholders a reasonable return and reinvesting into local enterprise or community projects.
The first Bendigo Community Bank was established in the small Victorian communities of Rupanyup and Minyip. Mr Deputy Speaker Hawker, you would be well aware of those small towns. I want to quote from a paper by Bendigo Bank managing director Rob Hunt, which illustrates perfectly the difficulties that small towns are forced into when the big banks pull out and the advantages of community banking to these small communities. Mr Hunt said:
The last bank branches in Rupanyup and Minyip closed on the same February day in 1997, ending a century of branch banking in these neighbouring towns on the Victorian Wimmera's wheat plains. Rupanyup residents suddenly faced a 100km round-trip from `Rup' to Horsham to bank; Minyip's residents could head in the opposite direction for Warracknabeal, a mere 80m round-trip.
You can imagine the inconvenience this caused most of the local residents, not to mention small businesses. Mr Hunt continued:  
Across Australia the stories were the same—people powerless to stem the outflow of government, local government and business services essential to modern living.
A 1996 study of NSW and Queensland towns which had lost bank branches brought the problem into stark focus. It affirmed that locals did indeed take their shopping with them when they banked—to the tune of around $4000 per head per annum. It also discovered unpredicted side-effects: credit was harder to obtain for locals and they were less likely to want to borrow, bad debts to local professionals increased and personal savings dropped dramatically. There was clearly a need for a banking solution which delivered both basic banking services and a commitment to local prosperity.
There are 1100 people in the `Rup/Minyip' catchment. Counting children as part of their parents' shareholding, no fewer than 750 have a direct stake in the success of their branch. Not surprisingly, given this level of participation in the venture, the business boomed. It reached its 12-month predicted business volumes in just seven months. 
By the time its first anniversary rolled around, more than three-quarters of the local people were banking at `their bank branch', which had begun returning monthly operating surpluses. Five new jobs were created, business takings in the towns began to increase again (to the point where the Rupanyup supermarket expanded) and the community has a `can-do' attitude and is much better placed to produce better outcomes.
We believe successful communities create and attract successful enterprise and Rupanyup and Minyip have certainly improved their prospects of doing so.
The Bendigo Bank's community bank is breathing new life into small communities where the service has been established. Most of these are turning a profit—sometimes of around $10,000 per month—in just 12 to 18 months. Other small businesses in these depressed areas are starting to grow again as a direct result of the presence of a local Bendigo Bank franchise in the community. It is also good business for the Bendigo Bank. Equally important is the sense of pride in these communities that is generated by owning and profitably operating their own bank, whose profits are returned directly to those communities. If the Howard government demonstrated even a tenth of the innovation, commitment and understanding of rural and regional Australia shown by the Bendigo Bank and the communities who are benefiting by the Bendigo franchises, regional Australia would not be in the difficulties we are in today.
The Bendigo Bank is also involved in a number of innovative products and services like the Bendigo Stock Exchange, a regional development fund, Bendigo telco, and a range of other services, all of which are aimed at enhancing the business sector in regional Australia. I will have more to say on these ventures at another time. If honourable members would like more information on the Bendigo community banking concept, they should contact the Bendigo Bank's Community Bank Development Team on 1300 361 911 or visit the bank's web site at www.bendigobank.com.au.

"Anthony, Larry, MP",NP,2000-10-30,"—in reply—As I have said previously in speaking on the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2000, I am proud of the government's recent achievements in reforming the Child Support Scheme. I want to build on these achievements. The measures contained in this bill should not be looked at in isolation. Last year we introduced a range of administrative and legislative reforms to the Child Support Scheme—reforms that were over half a decade in the making. We implemented measures to ensure that parents are treated equitably under the child support formula. Some may argue that the reforms do not go far enough. To a degree there was some unfinished business, and that is why I am here today.
Parents should be responsible for providing for their children. Bringing children into the world is one of the most serious decisions parents take. Bringing a life into the world should not be taken lightly. Parents should not be able to shirk their responsibilities. If a parent has the financial resources to provide for their children, then they should not be allowed to avoid that responsibility. They should not expect the rest of the community to pick up the tab and they should not expect the community or the government to turn a blind eye. Children depend on their parents for many things. They depend on their parents for guidance. They depend on their parents for nurturing and emotional support. They depend on their parents for stability and financial stability. Most of all, they depend on both of their parents for these things. We all want what is best for our children. We all want to ensure that our children have the best opportunities to develop, to succeed and to excel in whatever vocation they may take up. 
Over the last two weeks I have had some time to reflect on the speeches made by members on both sides of this House. I would have to say that members on both sides of this place share the same sentiments that I have expressed. In particular, I commend the member for Macquarie for his comments. To quote him, it is true that the amendments allow nonresident parents `a fairer go, while still protecting the needs of the children'. I compliment the Deputy Speaker, the member for Gilmore, for her words on the bill. The member for Gilmore takes a strong interest in child support matters and is a strong advocate for responsible and balanced reform of the Child Support Scheme. The member for Gilmore has had a close association with the issue of child support over the last four years. This started with her work with me on the Prime Minister's special task force on child support. Similarly, I thank the members for Makin and Petrie for their contributions to the debate and their support of the bill. In fact, I thank all members for their support of the bill. It was good to see that the member for Lilley did not use this debate to try to score cheap political points, and I commend him for that. 
I can understand some of the scepticism shown by some members to aspects of the bill. But, as I said earlier, the bill needs to be considered as a package that builds on the government's recent reforms—reforms to taxation and the social security system, reforms where families have clearly been shown to be the major winners. There needs to be careful consideration of recent Australian research into the costs of children and the contact behaviour of nonresident parents. In putting this package together the government took into account opinions and concerns expressed by both resident and nonresident parents over a long period of time. We considered all of the recent Australian research into the costs of children and the contact behaviour of parents. The measures were not put together on a whim. I acknowledge that the member for Lilley has raised some concerns about the contact measures and the measures relating to the reduction of the cap. I note that he has proposed some alternatives. On the face of it, the alternatives put forward by the opposition appear to be flawed and unnecessarily complex. However, as I have said, I am willing to examine the member for Lilley's proposals more closely.  
Child support is a very emotional issue. It is often portrayed as a gender war. These measures propose to ease the tension between parents, not to escalate it. No government can ever legislate to prevent marriage or relationship breakdown, but governments can and should intervene to try to promote positive outcomes for children. Positive outcomes for children and for parents are strongest where parents maintain a positive, ongoing relationship following separation and where the nonresident parent continues to play an effective parenting role. Australian and overseas research supports the measures contained in this bill. Studies into the children of separated parents overall indicate that contact with nonresident parents is of benefit to the development of children. Furthermore, research shows that the amount and quality of contact between fathers and children are significant predictors of the child's wellbeing and life chances following parent separation. 
I call on members on both sides of the House to support all the changes in this bill in the interests of a more equitable child support scheme. The changes are fair. They are fair because a parent who has ongoing and regular contact with their children will not pay the same amount of child support as someone who has no contact. The changes are fair because the amount of child support that a parent pays will not be more than the total cost of their children. They are fair because, if a parent takes on overtime or a second job for the sole purpose of improving the circumstances of the children living with them, these children will benefit from the additional income. The changes are fair because eligibility for family tax benefit and child-care benefit will be assessed on the actual income available to the family. The changes are fair for nonresident parents and resident parents and, most of all, they are fair for the children of the separated parents. I commend the bill to the House.

"Wooldridge, Dr Michael, MP",LP,2000-10-30,"—The Senate has returned this bill with two amendments. The government is prepared to accept the first amendment. We are not prepared to accept the second amendment, and we are prepared to have this legislation go down as a result of it. When the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Amendment Bill 2000 went to the Senate, it was simply designed to repeal section 18(2), thus removing the remaining provisions that allow tobacco advertising at sporting events in Australia. While there are now only a few events that receive this exemption, which is available through this section, we have proposed to remove this option altogether. The first of the amendments that have come from the Senate consists of changes to subsections 9(1A) and 9(1B) of the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992. In principle, the government accepts the change to section 9(1A); it assists to clarify the scope of the exception relating to political discourse under legislation. I remind the House that section 9(1) was added to the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act in 1995 to make the act constitutionally valid. 
—You got it wrong! You are going to agree to it.
 (Mrs Gash)—Order! The minister has the call.
—Madam Deputy Speaker, there are two amendments here. I was accepting the two parts of the Labor amendments as one and two. I would like to indicate to the House that the government proposes that amendment No. 2 be agreed to, and that amendment No. 1 be disagreed to. I suggest, therefore, that it may suit the convenience of the House first to consider amendment No. 2, and when that amendment has been disposed of to consider amendment No. 1. 
—Is that the wish of the House?
—I move:
That amendment (2) be agreed to.
I will come to the opposition in a minute—to the gross hypocrisy on the other side. There is plenty of time to wait for that. We have no difficulty, as a government, with amendment No. 2. The reports to parliament are sensible and we are happy to agree to the amendment.

"Wooldridge, Dr Michael, MP",LP,2000-10-30,"—I move:
That amendment (1) be disagreed to.
This piece of legislation is something that has not been exceeded by any other western country. The Labor Party's action tonight means that this legislation is going to be voted down. The Labor Party can take responsibility for defeating the gold standard for tobacco prohibition anywhere in the western world. This is the worst sort of political hypocrisy and the worst sort of metooism one could ever expect to see in politics. The Labor Party's record on tobacco control was pathetic. The Labor Party accepted more money from tobacco firms than any other political party in this country. The Labor Party refused to change tobacco from a per weight basis to a per stick basis. They refused to phase out all tobacco advertising. They sat on a tobacco control program that went nowhere, that meant Australia was static at around 24 per cent of the Australian adult population who were smoking.
The government has changed all these things. The government is prepared to move this substantial step, but it is not prepared to have a political party that, in government, did not have the guts to address the major public health issues and kowtowed in a cowardly way to the tobacco industry, tag along and pretend it is doing something when in opposition. The fact is that these pathetic metoo amendments are, on our legal advice, unconstitutional. I am not going to let this legislation go through with something that is subject to legal challenge. I am not going to give the tobacco industry an opportunity to defeat this in the High Court. I am prepared to let the whole legislation go down. I will say here in the House that it will not be reintroduced while I am minister for health. This will be a tragedy to public health in Australia. The Labor Party can take the responsibility for this as it tries to catch up after its own pathetic record of 13 years in government.
We do not accept, cannot accept and will not accept the proposed changes to subsection 9(1B). The amendment as passed by the Senate refers to the use by a manufacturer or a group of manufacturers of its own name or their own names in an advertisement or publication. This is unclear and confusing. In particular, we have to assume the reference is intended to mean the manufacturer's tobacco products but, on its face, the provision goes much wider. Even more significantly, with this amendment the opposition has created a situation whereby the constitutional validity of the act can be challenged. Legal advice received from the Australian Government Solicitor indicates the law could effectively burden the freedom of communication about government or political matters. Further, the Australian Government Solicitor's advice is that, as legitimate political discourse is prevented by the amendment as passed by the Senate, the High Court might find this unconstitutional.
The Labor Party have not tabled their advice. They have not tabled from whom their advice comes. The Labor Party are welcome to move this amendment if they ever get back into government. But if they insist on this, the legislation will go down, and everyone interested in tobacco control in Australia will know it is the result of the unbridled political opportunism of a party trying to catch up because of its pathetic record in government.",REPS,<title>TOBACCO ADVERTISING PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,14,1
"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,2000-10-30,"—It is unfortunate that the Minister for Health and Aged Care has decided to spit the dummy on this issue, but I guess we should be used to that. I wonder whether the minister has noticed that the title of the act that we are amending is the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992. I wonder who must have been in government in 1992 to move those changes to the legislation. Of course it was the Labor Party—not the coalition, as he would have everybody believe from his petulant little outburst here tonight. The minister would also know that the Herron report was received in 1995, recommending the changes that we are now debating in October 2000, recommending that there be a phase-out of tobacco advertising for these sporting events. It has taken this government all the time it has been in office to get to this stage. 
We should also be aware that this bill was finally introduced in May this year and it is now the end of October. The minister came into the chamber in an absolute state saying that if it is not dealt with tonight he will reject the bill and it will be the end of civilisation as we know it. If the minister wanted to show that he is concerned to close this loophole, it would have been far more productive to give us all the advice that he has received. We indicated that we would be able to provide our advice to him. We asked that the bill be delayed for further debate until tomorrow. He refused and insisted that the debate be brought on urgently tonight. Goodness knows what the final urgency is, given that it took him four years to get the bill into the parliament and since May to get it to this stage. I do not know what the final urgency is. If the minister were serious about dealing with this loophole, if he really wanted to get rid of political sponsorship by tobacco companies, he would be willing to sit down with the opposition and sort out what he says are constitutional difficulties.
Regarding our first amendment, last Wednesday we were provided with the government's last piece of legal advice from the Crown Solicitor. In our amendment we were attempting to close this loophole on sponsorship of political events by tobacco companies. That advice was provided and we changed our amendment to try and deal with the legal problems that the Crown Solicitor put forward. We put the amendments to the Senate today. We now find that the government has further legal advice saying that we cannot proceed with this amendment because there may be a High Court challenge. There are two issues. If the government were serious, I would say to the minister, `Provide us with the latest piece of advice. Let's sit down and try and work out an amendment that actually does get rid of political sponsorships by tobacco companies.' That is the first thing. The second is that I would draw the minister's attention to the severability clause in the act, which means that if there were ever a challenge only this section would be invalid; it would not invalidate the whole act.
Another point I would like to make in relation to the whole legal question is that any challenge would be subject to the test of reasonableness, and we have gone to some effort to make sure that tobacco companies continue to have the right to free speech in their own name. We are not interested in seeing the Liberal Party continue to receive sponsorships for Liberal Party dinners, as this minister knows oh so much about. We are not interested in seeing that continue. We would have thought that, if this minister was serious about getting rid of tobacco company sponsorships of Liberal Party dinners, he would agree to this amendment. If there is still a legal problem, why doesn't he provide us with the latest legal advice? Why doesn't he sit down and work with the opposition to get rid of this problem that is a loophole in the legislation that is still allowing political sponsorship of these events by tobacco companies? We see that this minister wants to continue this loophole. If anyone is not serious about tobacco, it is certainly him.

"Wooldridge, Dr Michael, MP",LP,2000-10-30,"—I am happy to put this government's record on tobacco control against anything the Labor Party has ever done. The reason I am not prepared to sit down is that I am not prepared to be part of a political stunt. The Labor Party has put out a pathetic press release tonight talking in self-congratulatory terms, welcoming the passage of Labor amendments that, quite frankly, do absolutely nothing other than threaten the legislation. The press release says: 
In future tobacco company advertisements will only be permitted in their own name ... 
It also says:
The closure of the loophole allowing political sponsorships will bring to an end the era of tobacco sponsorship in Australia 
Well, it will not; it will only permit bringing to an end the discussing of them, and that very discussion itself is what we were advised is subject to legal challenge. The Labor Party made several comments that I will reply to. Yes, this legislation came in in 1992, with exemptions. The Herron report came in in 1995. What did the Labor Party do about it? Nothing. What was in the Labor Party's election policy in 1996? Nothing. What was in the Labor Party's election policy in 1998? Nothing. We proposed this in 1998.
—It's taken you four years.
—We proposed this in 1998. It has not taken us four years; it has taken us substantially less. If you had been around a little bit longer, you might know a little bit about history rather than shooting your mouth off and showing how ignorant you are. The simple fact is that this does not apply to 2002 anyway, so at what point of the political cycle it is brought in does not matter. This is a political stunt. The Labor Party will stand condemned. This legislation will go down and the Labor Party will be responsible for bringing down what is the gold standard tobacco legislation in Australia.",REPS,<title>TOBACCO ADVERTISING PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,14,1
"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,2000-10-30,"—It is really unfortunate that the minister continues to behave in this way. We are trying to close a loophole that remains. It is a significant loophole. It is unfortunate that the minister is taking this attitude, because there is a loophole still in this bill. We are trying to close that loophole, and I say again to the minister that, if he is prepared to sit down and work with the opposition to get rid of this loophole so that we can end the tobacco sponsorship of political events such as Liberal Party dinners, we are very happy to do so. I would have thought that, as a health minister who does understand—and I know he does understand—the very serious dangers that tobacco smoking poses to all of our health, he would sit down and work out this loophole in a cooperative way. I am very disappointed that he is not taking this opportunity to strengthen the bill, which is what we are attempting to do, and I look forward to the time when we will be able to reintroduce this amendment and get it through as a result of a Labor government.

But I make it clear that we will not be satisfied unless the bill is substantially amended before it passes the Senate. I have to express my concern in those terms because we are not yet aware of how or how far the government intends to amend this bill in the House, which I have to say is a disgrace. We hope that those amendments will be substantial and will address the concerns which I will air during these remarks, in which case the bill should have after that a relatively easy passage through the House and the Senate. But I am concerned that it does not appear at this stage that the reasonable concerns of people in the arts industry are going to be met by this legislation and that therefore it will need to be the subject of substantial amendment before it can be passed and accepted by both houses of the parliament.
I am very pleased that my colleague the member for Denison is in the chamber with me because in June 1994 when I was the minister for the arts and he was the Minister for Justice he and I jointly released a discussion paper entitled Proposed moral rights legislation for copyright creators. At that point we were proposing a process that we expected would lead rapidly to fill the gap in the legislative framework of intellectual property support for and recognition of the rights of creators in our society and that, long before this, adequate legislation would have been passed. In fact, draft moral rights amendments were prepared and circulated in February 1996. So, as the opposition shadow minister for the arts, I am pleased to see the government has finally seen fit to start to proceed seriously down this path towards moral rights amendments to the Copyright Act even if at this stage the amendments are only half the job. They are ill considered and they are not yet adequate, even after all this time.
The examination of moral rights was a commitment made by the Keating government at the 1993 election. That then led to the discussion I referred to, the discussion paper which followed from it and the draft moral rights amendments as circulated in February 1996. However, shortly after that, in March 1996, there was a change of government, leading to this current government taking out a less than satisfactory approach to moral rights. In June 1997 we had a copyright amendment bill introduced and referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, which reported in October 1997.
Serious concerns were raised at that time by different sectors of the arts community and the arts industry. The government could not come to terms with these concerns. It could not see its way through the complexity of this matter. I acknowledge that it is complex, but it is no more complex now than it was in 1993 or 1996. It is not as if this is an issue that others have not addressed; other countries have had regimes of varying natures over the years. While I know that some producers and art owners are concerned about the consequences of moral rights, we must remember that in Australia we tend to think that we cannot do what others can do. Others in the world have been able to operate vibrant artistic sectors and economically and culturally successful arts industries within the framework of strong moral rights legislation.
The government could not come to terms with these problems, and it withdrew the moral rights provisions of the Copyright Amendment Bill 1997. So we had a bit of a dead end. Senator Alston, as Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, gave a commitment in June 1998 that he would reintroduce moral rights amendments by the end of 1998, after further consultation with interested parties on particular areas of contention. We waited and we waited and we waited, because the six months from June 1998 to the end of 1998 turned into 18 months, as the government got around to introducing this bill, the Copyright Amendment (Moral Rights) Bill 1999, in December 1999. It was a very disappointing performance by the government, to take so long and yet achieve so little. It took 18 months to introduce this current version of moral rights legislation—it has been a sad saga. Yet, after all this time, we do not have a bill before us that is satisfactory.
As I have already stated, the Labor Party support the introduction of moral rights legislation. We have long argued for it. We have committed ourselves to it, and we remain committed to it. Moral rights seek to complement existing economic rights. They seek to deal not with the economic aspect of the creator's rights but with reputation and standing. The four basic types of moral rights that are discussed when people and countries around the world look at issues like this are: the right of attribution—that is, the right to be identified as the creator of material; the right of integrity—that is, the right to object to derogatory acts perpetrated on material, acts that are prejudicial to the creator's honour and reputation such as distortion, mutilation or unauthorised modification of material; the right of disclosure—that is, the right to determine if and when the material is made public; and the right of withdrawal—that is, the right to withdraw material from the public. It is not always the case that all four elements are present at one time, but that is the broad nature of what is referred to as `moral rights'.
So it is appropriate that we proceed in this direction with a basis of principle, of philosophical commitment. But it is also the case that the 1971 Paris revision of the 1928 Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works not only gives the constitutional power if we needed anything for it to proceed in that direction but virtually binds us to proceed. What the government is presenting seeks to meet those international obligations in relation to, at least, the rights of attribution and integrity. I have always supported the move in the direction of moral rights, and my party has supported it consistently. This is because recognition that a work is part of an author's character and personality and that they are entitled to control its utilisation, and the right of individuals to protect the integrity of their work and to ensure that their work is attributed to them, are at the core of moral rights. The right to be able to protect the work from derogatory treatment is self-evidently something that Australian artists should have. It remains for us to think about why, in that fairly straightforward context, it has taken so long and why artists are still waiting—I want to come back to that issue later. 
Before I do that, I want to divert slightly to a closely related issue about moral rights: the fundamental importance of moral rights for indigenous artists. While these rights are important to any artist, any creator, there are extra elements in the nature of the relationship between indigenous artists and their work. For many indigenous Australians, particularly those in traditional communities, art is an expression of all aspects of life and identity and it is a major way of passing on culture to future indigenous generations. What has become fascinating recently is the way in which art has become a means of communicating indigenous culture to the rest of Australia and to the rest of the world. Recent exhibitions here in Australia and around the world have captured international attention and focused it on this great contemporary art movement. Australians know that it is gloriously traditional, but it has been so recently discovered by the international community that it is seen as a great contemporary art movement. So it is that, as well as being a glorious tradition. 
So this communication of culture, of belief, of a way of life adds an extra element to the moral rights issue as it relates to indigenous artists. I am particularly talking here about the visual artists. Many indigenous artworks reflect culturally important content such as creation stories and ceremonies. Certain images, techniques and styles have developed over time originating from and identifying particular indigenous groups, and often indigenous law and custom control the use of these images. This adds an extra element of significance to the general and in any event important moral rights framework, because it is very important that these images are accurately reproduced. Their meaning is in their physical representation, and inaccurate reproduction of an artwork can cause deep offence to those familiar with the dreaming, almost analogous to religious offence. It is a depiction that can go deep to the heart of the meaning of the origin of life and the meaning of cultural continuity for an individual and a community. So the introduction of moral rights will be significant for indigenous artists. 
There are complex issues in relation to extending moral rights protection in areas where traditional ritual knowledge is collectively owned. This has not been addressed in the current legislation and, while I am critical of some parts of the legislation, I am not critical of that. That is an issue that will take a long time to work through and it needs further investigation. That is something we should revert to subsequently. I will come to some of my concerns about the legislation soon. While it is something important which is not in my view adequately covered in this legislation, I think that will take a while. We will not get to that quickly. Insofar as that relates to the concerns of indigenous artists, subject to the general concerns about some of the issues relating to visual artists to which I will refer subsequently, this bill is a step forward.
What is the government proposing we should do in regard to this important and challenging area of cultural protection? To start to analyse it, we have to remember that the government was forced to withdraw the previous moral rights legislation, the 1997 version, because of its contentious inclusion of a waiver provision. I remember attending events and finding particularly the Writers Guild, covering screenwriters, out there demonstrating to all the passing traffic their concern about the waiver provision and its implications for their circumstance within the film and television industry. I want to compliment the Writers Guild for the strong and continuing work they have done in this area. The nature of that waiver provision would have enabled authors to give up all of their moral rights before a work was commenced. At that time screenwriters claimed that an up-front waiver rendered moral rights useless. Conversely, producers believed that it was a practical necessity because of the impact on investment. In every other area of the arts outside the film industry, an up-front waiver was opposed. 
It is one of those areas where the superficially plausible, which is why shouldn't people be able to agree in advance to a waiver, fails to recognise the different negotiating strengths of the parties to a negotiation. It is not reasonable to believe that in those circumstances a writer has equal bargaining power with a producer or that a sculptor has equal bargaining power with a city council which might be contracting to buy a work and setting the terms and conditions under which it might be bought and then subsequently displayed. So we needed to look at how we coped with that imbalance in the bargaining situation that was not addressed by the 1997 legislation. The government promised that the bill which they withdrew in 1997 would be reintroduced before the end of 1998 after there had been what they called stakeholder consultation to resolve differences on waiver. I have to say that they have not got there, but with a bit of further work they might get there. That is why I said right at the beginning that I hope we will find some amendments from the government here in the House or, if they cannot bring themselves to do that, in the Senate that will start to deal with some of the problems that the government have ignored. Otherwise, the opposition will be moving amendments in the Senate to seek to ensure that that takes place. 
This bill was introduced into this House on 8 December. What it is seeking to do, as I have said, is to provide protection for the moral rights of authors, composers, playwrights, artists, film writers, directors and producers. It is different from the 1997 bill. It has replaced the previous waiver clause with what I think we can call a de facto waiver, which is in clause 195AW. Screenwriters have—this is welcome—been included as authors of what the bill calls cinematograph films. Provision has been made for co-authorship agreements whereby screenwriters, directors and producers may jointly exercise their rights of integrity.
In some ways, that sounds quite okay. I will refer in a moment to the process which led to some of those changes within the film industry, but beyond the film industry the government does not seem to be able to get the point that what is acceptable in that sector as a result of a negotiated outcome is not appropriate and of general application. The opposition has many problems with the proposed legislation as it stands. The main concern is that the government has taken an agreement that was reached on moral rights in the film and television industry and is attempting to apply it inappropriately to all arts sectors. I welcome the fact that ultimately we have an agreed film and television moral rights proposal. It was agreed by a pretty broadly representative group: Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Australian Film Commission, Australian Film Finance Corporation, Australian Guild of Screen Composers, Australian Screen Directors Association, Australian Screen Editors, Australian Subscription Television and Radio Association, Australian Writers Guild, Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations, Fox Australia, Screen Producers Association, and SBS. That is a pretty representative group. I welcome the fact that eventually they were able to come to an agreement. I know it was not easy. The proposal on which they agreed clearly states in the first paragraph:
This is a proposal by the representatives of producers, writers, directors, composers, distributors, editors, production designers and broadcasters (collectively the Industry) for the introduction of moral rights legislation, particularly as they relate to a cinematograph film (Film).
That is an accurate description of the agreement, but the problem is that the government has adopted the proposals that are agreed as specific and appropriate to the film industry and it is attempting to apply them to all arts sectors. Can it be that, even after all this time, the government does not really understand why moral rights are important and what the effect will be of introducing them in the way it is proposing, in particular for visual artists? I continue to use the example of visual artists—it is the starkest example but not the only example. I understand the arguments put forward by the film and television industry as to why they should be treated differently from the rest of the arts sector in relation to moral rights. I respect their position. I welcome the fact that they came to an agreement and I believe that agreement should be accommodated in the legislation.
I can also understand that the film industry did not suggest for one moment that it would be appropriate to apply their agreement and their recommendations to the entire arts sector. Certainly, the other arts sectors have not and do not agree that that should be so. The whole rationale for the further discussion with the film and television sector was based on the realisation that it had a special case in relation to some aspects of moral rights, not that it was the standard against which everything else should be judged. How could the government choose to ignore other Australian artists, such as authors, composers and sculptors? Why have these arguments fallen on deaf ears? Because the Attorney-General, the member for Gippsland and Minister for the Arts and the Centenary of Federation, and Senator Alston should recall receiving submissions from the Arts Law Centre of Australia on 9 February, 18 February and 7 July this year, all bringing this blunder to their attention. Perhaps they remember the submission of 18 February, which was a joint submission setting out the position of the film and television industry and other arts industries. The letter states: 
The organisations representing the arts and not party to the film and television industry negotiations and agreement wish to state up front that their second overriding concern—
this is in the context of a letter about other matters—
is that the proposed legislation fails to take into account the interests outside the film and television industry. The 1999 Bill appears to have wholeheartedly adopted principles contained in the film and television moral rights agreement. The negotiations in the film and television sector were always understood to apply to that sector alone.
Yet they have had no response. More recently, on 7 July the Arts Law Centre of Australia, concerned about the lack of response from the government, wrote restating the unified position of the arts sector that the film and television agreement should apply only to film and television. But there has been no response from the government. What is the specific consequence of that failure? The major problem is in relation to section 195AW, `Authors consent to an act or omission'. In its current form, the government has done nothing but reintroduce a de facto waiver. What is being introduced is the recommendation from the film and television agreement that is specific to film and television. Unless changed, the consent provisions render this legislation virtually useless. They will work against the interests of all those artists who are not involved in film and television. They are virtually useless because they put artists in a position where they could be forced to sign a consent and in effect waive all their moral rights.
In my view, there should be no difficulty in amending the current legislation to allow for employees in film and television to consent to forgoing their moral rights while maintaining a regime for other artists that ensure that each act or omission is consented to in writing and is specific to a particular work. For some reason, the government seems unable to deal with a set of moral rights that provides room for a particular set of circumstances that apply in particular to the film and television industry and at the same time to address the concerns of the wider arts community. It is a simple thing to do and the legislation should be amended to achieve this end.
Of course, the difficulty in this debate is that the government might actually have seen reason in relation to making this sensible amendment, but they have not discussed it with the arts industry and they have not advised the opposition, so I am not in a position to know whether that is the case or not. I can assume that, if they were going to do what the industry wanted, they would have told them. But I do not know and the House does not know. I can say to the government that the outcome of my discussions with the arts industry is that they are not pleased with the current consent provision and that both the film and the television sectors and the rest of the arts industry believe that the legislation should be amended to accommodate a more comprehensive position.
We are also concerned with 195AZM, which refers to the application of the moral rights outlined in the bill. It also implements the film and television agreement without any consideration for the rest of the arts industry. The way the current bill stands, integrity of authorship is limited to works that are made on or after the commencement of the legislation. It would be very simple for this section to be amended to enable right of integrity to subsist in relation to works made before or after the commencement of the legislation, except in relation to film. Again, this is a position which should take into consideration the comprehensive view of the arts industry, but the government do not seem to be concerned or aware and there is no sign that they are proposing these amendments. 
There is also a concern with 195AN, which outlines that, in respect of the death of the author of a work, the exercise of moral rights may be by his or her legal personal representative or, in the event of bankruptcy, may be by the person exercising his or her affairs. There is a unified view in the arts industry that moral rights in respect of a work cannot be given to another person except in the circumstances outlined above. But proposed section 4, about which I am also concerned, refers to co-authorship agreements where two or more authors may agree not to exercise their rights of integrity of authorship in respect of a work except jointly. As I have said, there is a unified view in the arts industry that these co-authorship agreements should be limited to the film and television sectors. It would be a simple matter to amend the current proposal by limiting these particular coauthorship agreements to the film and television sector. Proposed section 195AT is, in my view, also deficient as it allows for the destruction, change or restoration of artistic work without proper notification of the artist. 
In conclusion, it must be remembered that the government is 12 months late in coming back to the parliament with these amendments. Instead of the end of 1998, we got this bill in December 1999 and we are now proceeding to try to put it through the House at the end of October 2000. This is an indication of the importance that this government places on the issue of moral rights. The reason for removing the moral rights provision from the Copyright Amendment Bill 1997 was to allow for further consultation on contentious parts of the proposed legislation, mainly around the issue of a waiver. For some reason the government is unable to jointly address the specific and legitimate concerns of the film and television industry while recognising the concerns of the rest of the arts community. If the government will not act on this, we will. We will move amendments in the Senate to achieve this. I hope the government will take a more bipartisan and inclusive approach to the necessary introduction of comprehensive moral rights legislation for all Australian artists. But, if the government will not act on these concerns which I have outlined, we will.",REPS,<title>COPYRIGHT AMENDMENT (MORAL RIGHTS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Bishop, Julie, MP",LP,2000-10-30,"—The member for Fraser conveniently overlooks the fact that it was 12 years ago that the Copyright Law Review Committee had cause to examine the efficacy of a moral rights system. He conveniently overlooks the fact that their majority decision went against the creation of such a system. By 1993 the then federal government, seeking to bolster its political and financial support in the arts sector, undertook to hold another review. Yet, despite the appearance of a related discussion paper in 1994, it was not until February 1996 that an exposure draft for a moral rights bill was publicly released. So I think it would have been a gracious act for the member for Fraser to concede that indeed his party, when in government, took some considerable time to even get this issue off the drawing board. In fact, it got to a point whereby the Australian Copyright Council in a publication asked somewhat plaintively: is Australia on the road to formally recognising moral rights or is this one international obligation that will never be formally implemented?
After the change in government in 1996, consultation on the exposure draft led to moral rights provisions being included in the Copyright Amendment Bill 1997. After referral to a Senate committee and much public comment, those provisions were removed from that bill in order for them to be better crafted to address the concerns that had been raised. This is called consultation. This is what governments should do—consult with and respond to community concerns. Since that time the Copyright Law Review Committee has also had cause to consider the moral rights issue, publishing a report in February last year, and there has been ongoing consultation with industry groups.
By way of overview, I should say that laws of contract and laws of property rights are the very bedrock of our society—not simply the commercial and economic framework upon which is hung our prosperity and our material wellbeing but the very essence of what it is to be a free person and to be a creator. By taking into our hands the right to exercise control over that which we produce, we achieve a freedom that was denied throughout most of history. We therefore seek to ensure through the law that the material we create cannot be appropriated by others and that the benefits accorded to that which we create flow only to those to whom it is appropriate that they flow. This is the basis of our copyright laws—laws that protect the economic rights of artists and other creators. Before the House this evening we will consider, through the Copyright Amendment (Moral Rights) Bill 1999, legislation that will amend those laws to ensure that not merely the economic rights of authors are protected. 
There has been a long history, particularly in Europe, of authors' rights extending beyond the economic value of their work to the artistic value of that work. These rights are personal rather than economic, such as the right to attribution—that is, the right to be identified as the author—the right to preservation of the integrity of the work and the right to disclose and to withdraw work. These artistic rights are known as moral rights. They are not about morals or morality per se; rather this is a legal concept that acknowledges a creator's work.  
These rights have also been expressed in international law, most notably in article 6 of the 1971 Paris revision of the 1928 Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, a convention to which Australia is a party. Yet Australian law has not, until now, accorded artists that same degree of protection afforded by other jurisdictions as there has been no explicit recognition of moral rights. The opposition achieved little, if anything, in this regard in its 13 long years in government. 
There has been a degree of uncertainty about the extent to which a copyright owner can exploit their published work. The right to attribution is pretty non-controversial, but the right of integrity has been more so. While the Copyright Act does provide a limited right to attribution—that is, the right to be identified as the creator of a work—Australian artists seeking to enforce moral rights have in the past been required to utilise less effective areas of the law for dealing with these situations: for example, the Trade Practices Act, where there is the possibility of using section 52 to protect against false attribution, or perhaps section 53, or there is the common law of torts. But this is an unsatisfactory situation, with the combination of common law and legislation still not meeting the standard of protection of moral rights as set out in the Berne convention.
Interestingly, in the US there has been strong resistance to moral rights legislation by the very powerful lobby of Hollywood film producers. There has long been a strain between authors and directors, who want to maintain what they call `creative control', and producers, who want to be able to keep a film's commercial appeal, thus altering the script or the film, with the end result sometimes being virtually unrecognisable once the producers have taken hold of the script. It is also worth noting that it is apparent that the new technologies as they apply to the entertainment industry will exacerbate the concerns of copyright owners and creators. The new technologies can change forever how business operates, particularly given the proliferation of the means of distribution. The film industry, of course, has always been subject to change. Ever since moving pictures were invented a century ago, new ways of distributing entertainment have emerged probably about once every generation. Each such innovation has changed the industry irreversibly and each such change is usually accompanied by a period of trepidation and then excitement—films to television, cable television and video and now the arrival of digital technology, which can translate music, pictures and text into the zeroes and ones of computer language. It is obviously one of those exhilarating yet uncertain periods. So any certainty that can be proffered to creators of copyright work is obviously welcomed in this environment.
The call for an effective moral rights system for Australia has had a long history, but perhaps that is not surprising. The bill before us today reintroduces the provisions from the exposure draft of 1997, with a number of changes—namely, the previous provision for moral rights to be waived has been disregarded. Writers of screenplays have joined producers and directors as the joint authors of films and a new provision for co-authorship agreements has been included. Furthermore, the bill meets the commitment given by the coalition at the 1996 and 1998 elections to the introduction of comprehensive moral rights. I can foreshadow that amendments will be proposed by the government as a result of further recent consultation with industry groups, and that is a positive step. That is the government responding to stakeholder concerns. I understand that the concerns of the Arts Law Centre have also been taken into account. 
As it stands, the bill introduces a moral rights system that applies to literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works and films but not to sound recordings. It includes the right to attribution, the right against false attribution and the right to object to derogatory treatment of a work that would in turn affect the integrity of the author or creator. Exceptions to these rights are allowed for under the terms of the bill where `reasonable', with the onus being on the defendant to demonstrate how the infringement of moral rights is reasonable. Therefore, the bill provides the courts with a list of factors to be weighed up when determining reasonableness in this regard. Where an author does not wish to exercise the moral rights they have been accorded, they may give written consent for certain acts or omissions that would otherwise be considered an infringement. This system of written consent is superior to the previously proposed waiver system, which was claimed by some authors to be open to abuse. Where an infringement of moral rights has occurred, remedies may include injunctions, the granting of damages, declarations, orders for public apologies and orders for the reversal or removal of infringements. The courts will, however, give their priority to the resolution of disputes through negotiation or mediation.
Perhaps it should be noted that, while the passage of these moral rights protections will be to the benefit of authors and artists, users of copyright materials, such as broadcasters, advertisers, film-makers and publishers, should not be impeded. Rights may still be satisfied without the need for clearance from a work's creator as part of industry practice and in an environment in which negotiation and consent is, where necessary, encouraged. The protection of moral rights, originally proposed to be for the duration of copyright protection—that is, 50 years after death or film publication—under this bill as it stands was to cease upon the death of the author, although I understand there will be amendments drafted that will effectively reinstate the original position. This legislation does acknowledge the significance of the integrity of creative endeavour in this country. It supports the talents of our authors, artists, film-makers and other creators of copyright works. It marks yet another important reform of copyright law in Australia by this government, joining the reforms implemented under the Copyright Amendment (Computer Programs) Act 1999 and the Copyright Amendment (Digital Agenda) Act 2000. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>COPYRIGHT AMENDMENT (MORAL RIGHTS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,2000-10-30,"—I note that the former speaker, the member for Curtin, made a sound contribution and indicated that the government was itself intending to propose some amendments to the Copyright Amendment (Moral Rights) Bill 1999. I must say that it would have been good to have seen those amendments before this debate. It is perhaps regrettable that the same consultation that occurred in respect of those acts mentioned by the former speaker, in particular the Copyright Amendment (Digital Agenda) Act, was not followed here. I am sure that sitting down to discuss these alternatives would come up with workable solutions.
The concept of moral rights is important. The term `moral' is perhaps a misnomer; it does not have much to do with morality, although I suppose one would say that it is moral to recognise that those who create artistic works are entitled to have their authorship recognised and to have others respect the integrity of their work. As the previous speaker mentioned, there is an argument that our existing laws are sufficient to protect those rights, and indeed a 1988 report suggested that legislation was not necessary because of those laws which we have. As the previous speaker also mentioned, various aspects of the common law touch on this issue, such as laws about passing off or representing an artistic work to be other than the creator's and laws of defamation with respect to misrepresenting someone's work. 
There has been an argument that provisions of the Trade Practices Act, such as section 52 in respect of misleading conduct, would also be relevant to those passing-off situations. Also, there is an argument that these moral rights of authorship may be recognised in section 35(5) of the Copyright Act, which provides that altering a work in any fashion other than that stated in an agreement is an offence. With respect to integrity, section 55(2) provides that it is a breach of copyright if the copyright owner debases an adaptation of a musical work. However, there is a whole range of areas where the law has been shown to be inadequate, and I will give some examples so that people can apply it to everyday examples. A sculpture on display at an institution was spray-painted and had additions made to it so that it was more stable, allowing children to climb on it. That may be a good thing for children but it was not the intention of the sculptor who created the work. A painting in three panels was to be exhibited with all panels together as a complete work; however, in its initial display the work was presented with the panels separated, which distorted the effect of the work. Another example: the buyer of a painting added spots all over it to match his sofa. That would perhaps suit the décor of the room but it could be offensive to the work of art. A Sydney corporation commissioned a sculpture, but when it was found that the work did not fit into the foyer of the building, the top third of the work was simply lopped off. Those are practical examples of why legislation of this nature is needed. 
We in the opposition certainly accept that the protection of these moral or non-economic rights of artists, producers and authors is important. I suppose the concept of moral rights could be broken down into several different parcels, if you like. One parcel is the right of attribution; that is, the author's right to be known to the public as the creator of the work. There is also the right of integrity, which is the right to object to distortions or mutilations of a work which would prejudicially affect the author's honour or reputation—such as the spots to match the sofa. The right of disclosure is the author's right to determine if and when a work is to be divulged to the public. That is an important right. The right of withdrawal is the right to withdraw a work from the public if the author wishes.
These categories of rights are based on the Berne convention, as the previous speaker mentioned. This is another example to those who condemn the international treaty system. Treaties have played an important part in developing an important aspect of commerce. When the copyright treaties were first negotiated, late last century, the importance of intellectual property could not possibly have been contemplated, particularly in the electronic environment. These conventions have provided structure and, in dealing recently with the issue of moral rights, the Berne convention is relevant. Clause 6 provides:
Independently of the author's economic rights, and even after the transfer of the said rights, the author shall have the right to claim authorship of the work and to object to any distortion, mutilation or other modification of, or other derogatory action in relation to, the said work, which would be prejudicial to his honour or reputation.
Those are sound principles, and this legislation is an attempt to implement the provisions of that treaty, as the Attorney-General indicated in his second reading speech. However, we do have concerns that, because of some provisions, the bill does not achieve that outcome.
Going back to the history of this legislation in order to establish that the Labor Party regards this legislation as important, in June 1994 the Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department issued a discussion paper which proposed moral rights legislation; and, in February 1996, the Labor government issued an exposure draft of a bill to amend the Copyright Act which included these moral rights. We note that the government introduced the Copyright Amendment Bill 1997, which included moral rights protections; however, that was withdrawn as a result of dissent within certain industries and professional and artistic bodies. Again, the controversial issue of waiver was the primary reason why the bill was withdrawn. In February 1999, the Copyright Law Review Committee completed its report, Simplification of the Copyright Act—which is a very important report, I must say, for anyone interested in this area. That committee recommended that this issue of moral rights be revisited, and here we have—one year after the government said it intended to introduce this legislation—the matter before the House. 
Our primary concern with this legislation is that it implements what we understand to be an agreement that has been struck with the various players in the film and television industry. We in the Labor Party regard that industry as being vitally important. In terms of their priorities, I think all Labor governments have done an extreme amount to foster and develop Australia's film industry, and we are finally seeing the rewards of that effort. Sure, we have not been the only players in that field. I think Prime Minister Gorton also achieved a lot in developing the embryonic television industry. The development of the film and television industry remains a priority for Labor. Indeed, the industry not only is a source of foreign exchange and talented Australians but also is vitally important to the development of our culture and the portrayal of that culture to the international community. 
We acknowledge that there are special concerns that need to be addressed for the film and television industry, but that does not mean that, in addressing those problems, they apply across the board to writers, authors of books or creators of artistic works. They just do not logically apply. In the film and television industry there is by its nature a number of creators of works in any particular product—for example, there may be directors shooting various scenes; there may be a compilation of various clips of movies; there may be a combination of the works of choreographers, musical directors and stage creators. A whole box and dice of creative works tends to go into television and film productions. Having a capacity for all those creators to consent to their works being modified is sensible. It may involve simply a modification of some lengthy movie so that it is capable of being broadcast on television, or the removal of scenes that do not meet the censor's expectations so that a product actually becomes marketable. All these practical considerations apply in the television industry, but they are not the same issues that apply with respect to the other areas of artistic works, including sculptures and paintings. I note, for instance, that both the United States and Canada—particularly the United States Visual Artists Rights Act 1990—certainly give different attention to the protection of artistic works by sculptors and painters as opposed to a more liberal approach to the film and television industry. There seems to be nothing inconsistent or illogical in that. Indeed, there is good reason for that difference to apply. 
As I indicated, we do have concerns with particular aspects of the bill—firstly, in terms of the application of moral rights. Section 195AZM refers to the application of moral rights outlined in the bill applying only after the date of the bill's enactment, other than with respect to the acknowledgment of authorship, which is appropriate. We say that that is not sensible. There is just as much offence in cutting the top third of a sculpture that was created before the bill as chopping a third off a sculpture that was created after the bill is enacted. Again, we feel the government has been overly influenced by its desire to accommodate the film and television industry agreement. But it would be very easy to structure that particular section to which I have referred so that the converse applied; that is, it would apply to artistic works created before or after the enactment of this legislation, with an exception for the film and television industry. One would think that drafting would be easy to achieve.
The other section that we have concerns with is section 195AN. This section deals with the application of moral rights or the loss of moral rights after the death of the author. In particular, there is a concern—as the shadow minister for the arts indicated—regarding section 195(4) which deals with co-authorship. It provides that the authors may enter into a written co-authorship agreement where each agrees not to exercise his or her right of integrity of authorship in respect of a work except jointly with the other author or authors. Again, that arrangement, particularly where there are so many who collaborate in the production of film and television works, may be appropriate but it is certainly not appropriate with respect to written works or the creation of other works of arts. 
Our main concern, however, is with respect to the ability to obtain consent from the creator of an artistic work for the abandonment of their moral rights. Again, it is a fact of life, I suppose, that for those who participate in the film and television industry there needs to be that flexibility. Just to demonstrate the point, I will read a few of the provisions of the bill. Subsection (1) of proposed section 195AW of the bill provides that:
It is not an infringement of a moral right of an author in respect of a work to do, or omit to do, something if the act or omission is within the scope of a written consent given by the author.
That is very broadly expressed. Subsection (4) provides that:
A consent may be unconditional ...
Subsection (5) includes the provision that the waiver will extend to his or her licensees and successors of the owner of the work; that is, it will follow on in perpetuity as the work is passed in possession in title. Subsection (6) provides that subsections (2) to (5) do not limit the operation of that very broad subsection (1).
So it is an extremely broadly drafted facility to waive consent. Again, we have concerns that the reality will be that, if the creator of these works wants a contract, the person commissioning the artist will simply say, `Sign this or on your bike; we will get someone else.' So the mere facility to obtain that consent will, in our apprehension, cause a situation where undue pressure can be brought to bear. The Arts Law Centre of Australia—and I note that some talented lawyers have made very sensible and sound submissions to the government—have suggested that that amendment is appropriate. We hope the government will take that on board. 
There are also other issues where this bill has not perhaps been as thorough as it might have been. For instance, with respect to the Internet, there still remain significant questions regarding the liability of Internet service providers under this legislation. I think it is fair to say that an Internet service provider will be regarded as broadcasting or transmitting this material and that an Internet service provider will be copying or duplicating this material. For instance, if an Internet service provider provides access to someone of a photo of a famous work of art that has been distorted by, say, substituting the Prime Minister's head for the Mona Lisa's, that Internet service provider could be liable under this legislation for the act of transmission, unless they are able to activate some defence provisions. But those provisions in themselves leave quite some uncertainty. So I think that, just as those matters were addressed in the digital agenda area, the issue in respect of this rapidly increasing use of the Internet also needs to be more thoroughly addressed in this moral rights area. 
In summary, I have traversed a number of the concerns of the Australian Labor Party. Fundamentally, however, moral rights are rights which justify legislative protection and we would welcome the opportunity to sit down with the government to properly address our concerns which have been similarly addressed by very experienced, sensible and balanced people who practice in this area.",REPS,<title>COPYRIGHT AMENDMENT (MORAL RIGHTS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Cadman, Alan, MP",LP,2000-10-30,"—The government has given a lot of attention over the last couple of years to the whole area of copyright. The government recognises that, in linking intellectual property with the law, it is important that Australia has confidence in the future of intellectual property and that creators of intellectual property have a sense of security and certainty in their production so that there is no economic or other loss to them as the creators. The Copyright Amendment (Moral Rights) Bill 1999 is no exception to that process. In creating moral rights, the bill breaks new ground to some extent, but it is very much in the mould of the Copyright Act—that is, protecting something that is new and different, assigning to the creator certain capacities to have their ability and creation recognised as uniquely theirs. 
The government has expanded on areas of copyright contained in the Copyright Amendment Bill 1997 through theCopyright Amendment (Computer Programs) Bill 1999 and, more recently, the Copyright Amendment (Digital Agenda) Bill 2000. A number of functions in these copyright areas have been put to the House of Representatives Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee. That committee spent a lot of time taking evidence and presented a very fine advisory report to the House of Representatives on the Copyright Amendment (Digital Agenda) Bill 2000. That advice was mostly picked up by the government. I believe that some of the concepts contained in the committee's report could very well apply to the issue of moral rights of authors and creators. I refer in particular to the concept of new media, the concept of first digitisation, where something is for the first time turned into an electronic form for transmission—for example, advertising an artistic exhibition or the existence of galleries. 
Recently I received catalogues of proposed exhibitions to be held in the National Gallery over the coming months. They are of great quality. Within those catalogues there are representations of the artistic pieces that will be on display. That type of material can now be reproduced digitally and transmitted across vast distances—in fact, to the other side of the earth. What are the author's rights if, with one stroke of a key, myriad reproductions can go to all ends of the earth with the author being unaware of that process? The concept put forward by the House of Representatives committee in this instance was that digitisation was the process that should draw the copyright accreditation and payment and remuneration, if necessary, to the author or creator.
Having said that, the moral rights aspect of copyright goes one step further and deals with what has been described as a bundle of rights and a closer definition, an analysis, of what proprietary advantage the creator should have over the works that are uniquely theirs. Do they have a right that goes beyond what can be described as an economic right? Does a person who is a creator have a right for the retention of their work irrespective of whether it is considered obnoxious or impractical or whether it can be vastly improved by some minor changes? In the film and television industry there is a merging of technologies and the processes of digitisation cut across into the production of film and television, whether it be cinematography or a reproduction of a stage play, and there may well be some creative works of graphics or creativity in the electronic medium itself.
I guess what I am saying is that there is such an interweaving of all of these forms of media and creativity that, when one looks at the electronic reproduction, one has to be very careful that the original author, screenwriter or artist is not misrepresented as that interweaving takes place—that there is not a loss of integrity or intention in the process. Hence the development of the moral rights concept. It is a new concept—one that is founded, I understand, in the Berne convention. In particular, the rights are referred to in article 6 bis under the Berne convention. These rights were only conferred on an individual because the individual is the creator. It is no good a company, a partnership or some other conglomeration of individuals saying, `We have a corporate right.' That is not the concept of moral rights. It is to identify the individual who is the creator and to confer on them the rights of this legislation.
Let us look at some of the moral rights contained in the bill. This makes fascinating reading for a layperson because it gives a layperson a better understanding of the way in which the creativity and intellectual property of individuals are becoming more significant in our society. Therefore, these creative efforts need just as much protection as if we were dealing with a motor car, patent rights or all the other protections that are well-known. This is a protection of ideas and creativity. The moral rights are conferred on individuals, as I have indicated, and they are conferred on the director, producer and screenwriter of cinematograph film. The moral rights, as far as film is concerned, are only conferred on the principal director—none of the assistants—the principal producer and the principal screenwriter. These are the people who are the creative geniuses that produce a particular film. Moral rights are additional to other rights, including economic rights. They are a separate and significant right. 
Concerning the right of authorship, the author has a right of attribution of their authorship. The author's right is to be identified as the author. For example, in relation to a film, the director, the producer and the screenwriter should be identified wherever the film is copied, exhibited in public or transmitted. The same thing applies to the person who has done the writing of any material, whether it be literary, dramatic or musical, artistic works or in film. All of these instances require that a process of attribution take place to the author. The way in which the author is identified is spelled out clearly in the legislation. It is no good somebody saying, `I am not aware that so and so created that particular film or that so and so was an author of a particular writing.' There is no way in which the responsibilities for displaying the correct identification of the author can be avoided. There is a need for reasonably prominent identification and there is guidance within the legislation of what is considered a reasonably prominent identification.
There is also a right that the author should not have a work falsely attributed, so there is the concept contained in the act that somebody who has a reputation that is high cannot have that reputation destroyed by somebody falsely attributing a work to them, whether that be, as I said earlier, a work of literary, dramatic or musical character, whether it be an artistic work or a work of film.
—So integrity is maintained. 
—Integrity must be maintained. There is the identification and then the denial of false attribution. The bill provides that it is an act of false attribution in relation to a literary, dramatic or musical work to insert or affix a person's name in or on a work or in or on a reproduction of the work in a way that implies falsely that the person is an author of the work or that that work is an adaptation of the work of the person. That is illegal. A person cannot imply that they are the creator of an original work if that is not the case. 
There is also the false attribution, and this would cover the situation where a person's name is placed near, in addition to or on the work in such a way as to falsely imply that the person is the author of the work. The same thing applies for film as for an artistic work. Also there is a provision to prevent the false attribution of authorship of altered literary, dramatic or musical artistic work. If something has been changed, to claim that that person was the inventor of the total work or was the creator of the total work is again an offence before the act. This is a significant change to the current situation. The author has a right of integrity of authorship. Derogatory treatment of literary, dramatic or musical work is also considered to be derogatory towards the author or the creator. 
There is a provision that allows for the duration and exercise of these moral rights. Previous speakers have spoken about these provisions. In the case of an author, it is 50 years beyond the death of the author, in the case of a film 50 years from the end of the year of the completion of that film. There is a protection of an ongoing character. 
This is landmark legislation. I know that the Labor Party is not completely content with all of it. There is this waiver concept that I think is a difficult concept. How can you deny your rights? How can you assign away the fact that you have been the creator? That is known as the waiver clause. If we had realised the difficulties in concepts that we have come across, it might have been better for this legislation to go off to a parliamentary committee for further investigation, as did the Copyright Amendment (Digital Agenda) Bill. That produced legislation that the House was generally happy with and the government was fairly happy with. I go no further than that; the government was only fairly happy with it, but it picked up a number of amendments, and those amendments have been put into legislation. 
I wish to compliment the Attorney-General for his willingness to move ahead in these significant areas. If there is going to be any real value in an international sense in Australia's brains, our intellect, we have to protect that intellect. It does not matter whether we are talking about software writers or screenwriters. We need to be able to protect that creative genius. There is no doubt that worldwide the capacity of Australians to think their way through difficult problems has attracted a lot of attention. We talk of the brain drain, and it is a real fact that the capacity of Australian intellect is being sought worldwide. We need to protect that creative element. It does not matter whether it is in the electronic form of the Internet or somewhere else. Electronic intellect is becoming more in demand and there are very significant businesses being established around the capacity for someone to create web sites, to create visions on the Internet. There is nothing less creative about that approach than there is about a pure work of art, whether it be on canvas, by a sculptor, a musical play, a screenplay or an artistic endeavour of another type. All of these things have a significant input of creativity, and that creativity should remain the property of the person who has that creative capacity.
The value of property, of businesses and of entertainment in the future, is going to depend on our capacity to protect that creative right. If we do not do it as a nation, the fact is that people are going to either knock off or take out of the country our creative geniuses and we will lose them altogether. We will lose the economic benefit. Australia will not be known as a nation that encourages creativity. We will not be known as a nation that has the capacity to develop an intellectual strength.  
Mr Speaker, I am sure you agree with me that the Attorney-General is breaking new ground in the protection of copyright and creativity by the protection of intellectual property. This is a good step forward. I know there are changes needed, and there will be changes made by the government, but they are minor. They are changes that will be beneficial to the creative people of Australia, but that does not take away from the fact that this is a great piece of work for the Australian people.

"Wilkie, Kim, MP",ALP,2000-10-30,"—I would like to take this opportunity to speak on a matter which is of great importance not only to the people of Swan but to all Australians. I speak of the ridiculously high price of fuel and the impact it is having on all Australians. As a result of the concern being expressed to my office regarding this issue, I decided to seek support from the community to call for a Senate inquiry into fuel prices. I circulated a petition within my electorate and I can report to the House that it received overwhelming support. Over 4,800 people have so far signed the document which reads as follows:
TO THE HONOURABLE THE SPEAKER AND THE MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ASSEMBLED IN PARLIAMENT
The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the extremely high price of petrol and other fuels and the increase in the amount of tax on fuel due to:
·	The Government's failure to keep its promise that the price of petrol and other fuels would not rise as a result of the new tax system, by reducing the excise by the full amount of the GST;
·	The fuel indexation increases on 1 August 2000 and 1 February 2001, which will be significantly higher than usual because of the inflationary impact of the GST;and 
·	The charging of the GST on the fuel excise, making it a tax-on-a-tax.
Your petitioners therefore request the House to:
·	Hold the Government to its promise that its policies would not increase the price of petrol and other fuel;
·	Support a full Senate inquiry into the taxation and pricing of fuel;
·	Consider the best way to return the fuel tax windfall to Australian motorists.
My electorate contains a very high percentage of seniors. Most of them are on a pension and are already suffering from the government's broken promise regarding the aged persons bonus. The cost of fuel to those who can actually afford a vehicle is having a crippling effect on their ability to lead normal lives. What do they forgo: the ability to put a decent meal on the table every night, or the need to fill the car with fuel to do the weekly shopping? They receive no sympathy from this government. In response to their pleas for help, this government tries to convince them that they have never had it so good. This group is typical of those most affected by high fuel prices. It is time the government woke up to a few facts. Fuel is too expensive, and an inquiry is urgently required to help find solutions to the problem. `What can be done?' the government cries. Let us look at just a few of the issues for the inquiry so far.
The government failed to reduce the excise rate by the same amount as the incoming GST, and motorists have paid more for fuel with the GST despite the PM's promise that the price would not increase. Further, this has created an inflationary spike which in February will cause a further increase in price above and beyond that which would be normal. But the government is happy for this to occur, as it will just raise more taxes. Why is there an excise difference between the price of leaded and unleaded fuel? Remember that the excise was different to encourage people to get out of their old polluting vehicles into unleaded vehicles. But with the introduction of lead replacement fuel the emissions are similar to unleaded fuel. It has been suggested that because it costs more to produce lead replacement fuel the excise should remain higher. But you do not have to be Einstein to know that if a product costs more to produce and you are therefore charged more at the pump you will pay more tax through a higher GST bill, and a higher excise rate only increases the burden. The price of diesel has reached a ridiculous figure and many owner-drivers are going broke. Even if they are receiving the government rebate they cannot cope. Why is diesel so expensive? It is strange that this happened about the same time as the rebate was introduced. Who is making the increased profits? Why do franchisees have to purchase all their fuel from the parent fuel company? Surely legislation such as that introduced by the member for Hunter needs to be supported by the coalition. This legislation would allow franchisees to shop around for fuel to get the best possible price and has the support of the Motor Traders Association of Australia, the National Farmers Federation, the ACCC, the Australian Democrats, various state consumer affairs ministers and the Western Australian government's own fuel inquiry. At a time when the use of LPG should be encouraged for environmental reasons, the government has placed a GST on this fuel that previously had no excise, which has dramatically increased the cost.
Action needs to taken urgently. The establishment of this inquiry would begin a much needed process of review which can only benefit the Australian motorist. I therefore call on the government to act and heed the call of the petitioners.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Petrol Prices</title>,Adjournment,16,1
