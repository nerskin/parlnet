Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (09:31):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Banking Executive Accountability and Related Measures) Bill 2018. This bill imposes a new layer of regulation and supervision on the banking sector, overseen by APRA. Its purpose, as stated by the Treasurer in his second reading speech, is to ensure that where community expectations of accountability and integrity of banking directors and executives are not met, appropriate consequences will follow. As a Liberal Democrat I am opposed to this. It is not a legitimate exercise of government to seek to ensure particular businesses meet community expectations. This is a matter for the market. The bill makes no provision for discovering or addressing community expectations. The only expectations to be met are those held by APRA. The bill will not prevent a repeat of the problems in the banking sector examined during the Senate Economics Legislation Committee's five-week inquiry. The bill will have no impact on the manner in which banks serve their customers. APRA will become a de facto additional board of directors with a supervisory role in the appointment of senior executives, their responsibilities and their remuneration. 


Of particular concern are section 37C and section 37CA, which require banks and accountable persons to take reasonable steps to prevent matters from arising that would adversely affect the ADI's prudential standing or prudential reputation. APRA will have complete discretion, with no reference to community or any other external standards, to determine whether a bank is complying with this. The only consideration will be its own view of prudential standing and reputation. APRA will have the authority to disqualify a person from acting as an accountable person, depriving them of their ability to remain employed. While an affected person will be able to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, this amounts to a reversal of the onus of proof. 


The bill requires banks to defer the remuneration of accountable persons for a period of up to four years, with policies that allow for a reduction in remuneration for failure to meet BEAR obligations. The bill also gives APRA the power to direct a bank with respect to the allocation of management responsibilities. These are extraordinary intrusions into the management of a private sector business by public servants. The merits of deferred remuneration are contested in management theory, and entrenching the policy in law amounts to significant overreach by the government. It also amounts to serious conceit to believe that APRA has the expertise to direct a bank as to how to allocate its responsibilities. The cost of complying with the legislation is likely to drive small ADIs from the market and reduce competition. This is likely to adversely affect consumer choice. The bill will increase executive risk, potentially making it more difficult and expensive for banks operating in Australia to recruit talented personnel. This has the potential to adversely affect the international competitiveness of the Australian banking sector.


Finally, the intended date on which the bill is to take effect, 1 July, is absurd given the far-reaching implications for the banks and even the time APRA will need to figure out what it thinks are community standards. If there are failures in the banking sector that are not being addressed by current regulations or market factors, this bill will do nothing to address them. The Liberal Democrats are committed to the principles of a free market unshackled from government intrusion. This BEAR is nothing but a bill with a sore head. It cannot be amended to make it useful, and I will therefore be opposing it entirely.

Senator KETTER
 (Queensland—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (09:36):  I rise today to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Banking Executive Accountability and Related Measures) Bill 2018. Labor isn't against this bill and won't stand in its way. In fact, the bill is a welcome move, an acknowledgement from the other side that the market can't sort everything out and that there is a proper role for government in making sure that the financial sector serves the interests of everyday Australians. There's a need for our banking executives to take responsibility for the scandals and the rip-offs that have occurred. However, I am concerned that this bill doesn't go far enough; it's light on policy and heavy on politics.


This measure was announced on budget night last year and was used by the likes of the Treasurer and the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services to hold off calls for a banking royal commission—and we know how that worked out. We saw the world's biggest backflip last year. At ten minutes to midnight the Prime Minister and Treasurer were finally brought kicking and screaming to accepting a royal commission. But even then it was only after the big banks twisted their arms. The long-awaited acknowledgement that we need a royal commission is a strong indication that this bill doesn't go nearly far enough to changing the culture in the big banks. In fact, the policy process of this bill and the royal commission seem to show that the government is still running its protection racket for the big banks. More has to be done with changing the culture, and I welcome the royal commission, particularly on behalf of those everyday consumers and small businesses who endured rip-off after rip-off while the banks rode roughshod over all and sundry.


Of course, I note that the royal commission has commenced communications with the banks. I won't pre-empt its next steps, but I must point out that consumers are ready and willing to give evidence, and the sooner the process through which that can happen is made public the better the level of public confidence and the sooner we can begin to put to bed some of the recent banking scandals. In the meantime, I note that the ACTU and Choice are gathering submissions via their websites to submit to the royal commission. Consumers who have a story to tell may like to visit www.actu.org.au or https://campaigns.choice.com.au/royalcommissionbanks.


In terms of the bill itself, the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, of which I'm the deputy chair, conducted the inquiry into this legislation, and you can believe me when I say that this bill is no substitute for a banking royal commission. As Choice said in its submission to the inquiry, what we've got is a bit of a teddy bear, when what Australia really needs, in the way of banking reform, is a grizzly bear. This is what Labor told the government for 601 days, and finally they got the message. But they haven't got the message about the flaws in the BEAR legislation, and I will outline some of the key concerns now.


The first thing to mention about this bill is that it seems that the Treasurer has hand-picked another element of the UK system without the supporting structure. I want to make it known to senators that the UK reviewed their own regulatory arrangements after the global financial crisis, and that resulted in the Senior Manager and Certification Regime, or SMCR. A number of stakeholders to the inquiry praised the UK approach, in which they took a holistic view and took their time to properly consult and develop their accountability regime. In contrast, the BEAR is not holistic; nor was the proper time given to consult—far from it. The UK harmonised their regulatory framework, making sure that the prudential regulator and the conduct authority were able to competently handle both prudential and non-prudential matters. The UK reforms ensured that there were no regulatory gaps and that regulatory responsibility was clear. As Choice succinctly put it:


Our take generally is that the UK system has been really constructive—that it has involved both regulators working together to define the limits of powers for each one and make sure that there aren't gaps. Because this was developed in tandem it just means that you don't end up with those awkward gaps between regimes that can happen when you split regulatory powers between a prudential and a consumer regulator.


Yet here we have a bill that talks only about APRA and says nothing about ASIC's powers. The Treasurer has again botched the policy process. He tried to copy the UK's approach, and he couldn't get it right. He is clearly out of his depth.


There's much more I can say on this matter, but it's clear that Australia should follow the UK's approach and conduct a holistic review of the banking and financial services sector. The government's royal commission could have gone closer to doing this very thing if the opposition had been properly consulted. That way we could have had a bipartisan set of recommendations that complemented and enhanced each other. It's my view that taking that teamwork approach would have given the public the highest level of confidence that the real problems in the industry would be properly dealt with. But of course we know that the Prime Minister is not big on teamwork. The very way in which he was dragged kicking and screaming to the royal commission is evidence of this fact, with the Nationals having to finally break ranks to get him over the line. And we saw a bizarre situation of a divided coalition and a divided government, with the likes of the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance, both Liberals, resisting calls for an inquiry—quite unsuccessfully, as we now know—whilst the Nationals members finally found their voice and a desire to hold the banks to account.


As welcome as it was to see the Nationals coming to their senses, let us not forget that it was very late in the day. I don't think that should be forgotten when we look back on this debate, because the Nationals sat back for almost 600 days and let the very farmers they purport to represent get ripped off by the banks. I've lost count of the number of stories I've heard about farmers losing everything when the banks moved in. And, while the Nationals sat back in Queensland, where was 'Team Queensland'? Labor was leading the charge, standing up for farmers in rural and regional Queensland who had been mistreated by the banks. And while Senator O'Sullivan finally found his voice to stand up for Queenslanders on financial reform—and I commend him for that—where, might I ask, was the federal member for Maranoa?


We've read a lot in the media about Mr Littleproud since he replaced Mr Chester in the ministry. We know that he has a background in banking and that he prides himself on the number of farmers' kitchen tables he has sat around. Surely then, he's heard some stories about banking misconduct and the impact on our farmers. But we weren't reading in the media then about any calls for a royal commission from the member for Maranoa. No, like most of his colleagues he remained silent, not wanting to rock the Prime Minister's boat, no matter how many banking scandals came to light. No, the National Party is no real friend of the bush.


On the issue of scandals, the explanatory memorandum cites six scandals set out in the Coleman report to justify this bill. I quote from the EM:


The Coleman Report referred to a number of instances where participants in the financial sector have been treated inappropriately by banks and other related financial institutions:


• the provision of poor financial advice at NAB;


• the mishandling of life insurance claims at CommInsure;


• NAB’s failure to pay 62,000 wealth management customers the amount that they were owed;


• the poor administration of hardship support at CBA;


• ANZ’s OnePath improperly collecting millions of dollars in fees from hundreds of thousands of customers; and


• ANZ improperly collecting fees from 390,000 accounts that had not been properly disclosed.


Yet with the very simple question of: 'Would this bill have prevented this scandal or would it have triggered the BEAR's penalties?', both APRA and Treasury were unable to give a definitive yes. APRA said, 'In the course of our inquiry we cannot definitely say what the outcome would be.' And Treasury said, 'I don't think Treasury is in a position to do an analysis and to look back as to whether a law would have applied in particular circumstances.'


It seems very strange that the government seeks to use these scandals to justify the passage of this bill when it's far from clear that this bill would have made a meaningful difference. Much of this legislation's reform success also hinges on how APRA will define prudential. This bill limits APRA's remit to prudential standing and prudential reputation, and there are many concerns that the scandals I mentioned previously would not have triggered anything in the BEAR, as the scandals which ripped off ordinary customers were not at a level to threaten the prudential standing of the bank. The Consumer Action Law Centre said:


We've one clear ask of the committee, and that is to give this BEAR real teeth. Treasury has restricted the application of the proposed BEAR so that it will apply to poor conduct or behaviour that is of a systemic and prudential nature. This misses the crucial element of the United Kingdom model that ties accountability measures to poor consumer outcomes, not just prudential matters.


In fairness to the public servants, I understand the difficulty in advising on the impacts of legislation had it been in place during the time that the events occurred. However, when you consider that both Treasury and APRA can give no promises that the BEAR legislation would have made a difference and that the government clearly decided to limit the BEAR's remit to prudential matters, no-one can be blamed for just being a tad cynical about the approach of this government and whether this bill will actually match its tough talk.


I want to talk a little about the fact that the consultation process on this bill was extremely rushed. This is something that stakeholders have picked up on during the course of our inquiry. We did have quite a diverse group of stakeholders. Firstly, you had the Bankers' Association saying:


The seven day consultation period announced by the Federal Government on new banking executive accountability laws is grossly inadequate and playing fast and loose with a critical sector of the economy.


You would expect the ABA to make those comments. You had the Governance Institute of Australia in its Treasury submission putting it in much more polite terms:


Due to the comprehensive nature of the proposed legislative regime and the timeframe given to provide a submission, we have not responded to each of the detailed questions set out in the consultation paper but have confined our comments to the following issues.


The obvious question here is: what did they and others have to leave out? During the inquiry, Dr Wardrop and Dr Wishart said that, in fact, their views about it changed depending on the time they had to look at it. Also, their comments about some words used imply, without stating directly, they might be the result of the swift development process of the bill.


But, if you don't want to take their word for it, just see what the Prime Minister's own department said. The Office of Best Practice Regulation made it quite clear. The OBPR considered that to only provide one week for affected stakeholders to consider and comment on draft legislation was a significant departure from best practice. So we have a Treasurer out of his depth, playing fast and loose with policy development. The Finance Sector Union has also raised concerns about the bill and about the disjoint in the accountability regimes. We now face the situation of having the BEAR in place, a possible ASIC senior managers ban and the Australian Bankers' Association's conduct background check for frontline workers. There are three schemes and there seems to be no acknowledgement from the government that this is an issue and that we need to consider the overlap or gaps that might exist. For example, the FSU made it clear that these arrangements are inequitable, particularly the fact that executives would have an appeals process under the BEAR while frontline workers would have no appeal mechanism under the ABA conduct background check.


As a starting point, the ABA should introduce an appeals mechanism. Further, what really needs to be considered, in my opinion, is an accountability scheme that doesn't create a cultural divide between frontline workers and executives. Again, this is just typical of the piecemeal approach the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have brought to reform in the financial services sector for so long when what we really need is a holistic approach—something that a proper royal commission can bring.


Coming back to consultation, the explanatory memorandum mentions that the major banks met with the government in February last year, before the announcement in May, discussing the accountability gaps. We have media reports that Mr Gonski was instrumental in gaining an appeal mechanism in the BEAR as a concession. However, the small and medium ADIs were not afforded similar early access to policy discussion or concessions. The Customer Owned Banking Association raised concerns about the additional regulatory work that needs to be done alongside other reforms underway, often implemented by the same small teams in the banks. The Treasurer talks big talk about standing up for the smaller banks, but the reality is that he is still standing up for the major banks. The royal commission is the icing on the cake. It says everything about the Prime Minister and his Treasurer that he only agreed to Labor's royal commission when the banks told him they had to.


The government has always been on the side of the banks. I'm still a bit cynical and a bit concerned that the government's protection racket for the banks isn't over yet. But there has been some good news for the small and medium ADIs. Labor has lobbied hard for an amendment to this bill: to delay the start date by 12 months to ease the burden on small and medium ADIs and to give them appropriate time to prepare. I understand that the Treasurer has finally followed Labor's lead on this and Labor's amendment has passed the House of Representatives. I also note the Treasurer chose to support Labor over the chair of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee to make this happen. That was one of the recommendations in the Labor senators' additional comments report. I congratulate Mr Morrison on recognising when Labor has policy right and admitting, through that amendment, that the Liberals got it wrong. I'm proud that Labor is once again supporting small businesses—small banks in this case—and making their lives a little bit easier.


I note from the inquiry that the Customer Owned Banking Association made it very clear to us that the regulatory compliance burden is a critical factor. They made it clear that, in fact, regulatory compliance is a competitive advantage that the major banks have because they have vastly greater resources and capacity than smaller competitors to cope with the new regulatory obligations. So I want to make it very clear that we support that change to help out small businesses.


I will conclude my speech where I started and indicate that Labor will not stand in the way of this bill, but it is, as I said, disappointing to see that, once again, we have a Treasurer releasing substandard legislation. This bill was more of a political fix for the Treasurer, but, day by day, week by week, we saw the fix unravel. This bill couldn't stop the government calling a banking royal commission. Labor knew this bill was a political fix. Government senators in the inquiry saw the problems and shortcomings with the bill, and comments from other government backbenchers made it clear that the bill was no substitute for a royal commission. We've heard this legislation described as a 'teddy bear'—and who doesn't like a teddy bear? So I will support the bill, but, importantly, Labor fully recognises that the consultation process was inadequate and that the transition time will disadvantage smaller operators. So we have sought an amendment to delay the start date to help small and medium ADIs. I hope that the Prime Minister and Treasurer continue to follow Labor's lead in making this improvement. This bill is a baby step and I conclude by reiterating: it is the royal commission that will really deliver the much-needed change in this sector.


Finally, while I have the floor, I hope that the government is taking note of the calls in the media this week that action is urgently needed for improved consumer protection laws around payday lending. These laws, which the government has been dragging its feet on, are needed to prevent another financial crisis affecting Australian families. The Turnbull government has a lot to answer for because it's a government that's, for far too long, stuck its head in the sand on financial reform.

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2018-02-07,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (09:56):  The system we live under and work under is rigged, and the banks are a big part of the problem. The economy works for the rich and this bill does nothing to change that. Big bank CEOs are the flag-bearers of this rigged system. These CEOs fail to protect their customers, they fail to properly manage financial risks and they fail to report changes and where they've gone against the law. Time and time again, these CEOs are letting the public down. They fleece the public with excessive fees and other charges, all to boost their profits. That's what's going on here. While there are complexities in the system, on one level it's very simple: it's about boosting profits.


The annual pay packets of the CEOs of the banks illustrate that so effectively. I will put on record what they are to illustrate how out of control the system is and the depth of failure of the bill currently before us, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Banking Executive Accountability and Related Measures) Bill 2018. CBA CEO Ian Narev received a $12.3 million salary package in 2016, off a base salary of $2.65 million—an absolute shame. NAB's Andrew Thorburn received a $6.7 million salary package, off a base salary of $2.4 million. ANZ's Shayne Elliott received $5.07 million, off a base salary of $2.1 million. Westpac's Brian Hartzer received $6.7 million, off a base salary of $2.8 million. Macquarie's Nicholas Moore received $18.7 million, off a base salary of $818,000. The system is deeply broken. I said it's rigged—it's just rotten to the core. Why is the essence of this whole system about profits? It is because that is how the CEOs make their money. It's not about how they treat customers or if they're helping to make housing more affordable, ensuring young people can get a start in life or assisting people to get loans for their small businesses. That's not how they're judged. It's all about the massive profits they're making, and that's what flows through to these obscene wages—and that's what should be dealt with here today.


And these profits are obscene. In 2015, Australian banks made the highest profits anywhere in the world as a share of GDP. The privilege the banks have in this country because of the way the government runs the system should be what we're dealing with here, because the way the banks are run—the extreme salaries that these CEOs take home—is driving the inequality in this country. It's getting much larger, and I will come back to it. This issue of wages and salaries is right in the news at the moment because wages for the majority of people in this country have stalled. In the meantime we have an opportunity with this legislation here to do something about the super-rich, and nothing is being delivered.


As I said, the key issue the government should deal with is excessive bank CEO salaries. CEOs should be judged to be doing a good job and should be paid more if shareholders are gaining more returns because of banks' high profits. That's the basis of the very sick system we're living in at the moment and we need to change how banking executives are paid. The bill barely covers that key aspect—why? It doesn't cover that key aspect because the Liberals and the Nationals are mates. This is actually a class system here: the Nationals and the Liberals are looking after their class. They're looking after the very rich. They're out to protect them. That's why they're just nibbling around the edges.


This legislation has come before us because the government does at least note that there is outrage amongst the public about what is going on and about how out of touch so many banks are with their needs. The salaries are excessive, but they won't actually deal with them. Why don't they deal with them? Because they're mates—they'll probably have to get a job with them one day. It is a really sick system when you have a government that is there to advance privilege and not use the power and the responsibility it has to make our society more equal and more fair. So, as I said, it's not surprising that the bill before us barely touches on the issue of salary.


If this legislation goes through in its current form, CEOs can continue to pay themselves these huge amounts of money because their salaries are linked to the profit basis of their banks. It also illustrates the closeness of the major parties to the banks. Why the major parties are soft on the banks is the issue of political donations. I will come to the fact that recently—and, again, because they were getting such a bad name for themselves—some of the banks did come out with a position: 'We're not going to take donations anymore.' You need to look at the 'anymore' closely.


But, firstly, let's look at the culture that has been around for many years. In 2013-14 and 2014-15, the four big banks gave $1.3 million in political donations to the Liberals, the Nationals and Labor over those two financial years, with the bulk of it going to the Liberals and the Nationals. That again is a very unhealthy culture. It's said, 'We just want to be able to talk to people,' or 'We want to help the democratic process.' That's what some of the big CEOs have said. But, again, it is part of the corrupting culture that is really turning people off how politics works in this country.


Now, I do acknowledge that the National Australia Bank, in 2016, announced it would stop giving money to political parties. That decision is a remarkable turnaround and it's a good turnaround—I certainly acknowledge that. It is an important turnaround and a reminder why the Turnbull government should get its act together and bring in some electoral funding law that limits, bans or puts strict caps on all corporate donations.


I will put on the record what the National Australia Bank had been doing just before it changed its position. It had given more than $500,000 to the major parties over three years, and it also sponsored a major fundraiser for Liberal frontbencher Kelly O'Dwyer in her re-election campaign for the seat of Higgins. It's interesting that the bank was right there, in a very generous way, up to the point it made its decision. But its decision isn't watertight. The NAB's manifesto actually still allows for there to be exceptions to what appears to be a strict policy. Political donations can still be made, but they need to be cleared by the board of directors.


But, at any rate, I still congratulate NAB. They've taken that position, and other banks are also moving in that direction. But I go back to the position that for a long time there's been this culture of closeness, of attending the big, fancy, expensive fundraisers and giving generously, particularly to the Liberals and Nationals. That creates an unhealthy culture. It's a culture that's been identified in a High Court case about political donations that I've spoken about many times in the House, and I will continue to do so, because it identified that with political donations it's not just about quid pro quo—giving money and expecting something in return. It's about the damaging influence this money has on how the legislators, the politicians in this place, operate. They start to, maybe subconsciously—who knows; I'm not one of them—adjust their culture to deliver for the big donors. So, if there's legislation, maybe we should think about how that works for that sector that we spend a lot of time with.


The corrupting influence of political donations is well on the record, and I believe it's part of what's going on here—that there is a closeness between the major parties and in this case the big banks, the big donors, so that they don't really do the job properly. A proper job would be taking on the CEOs and limiting their salary. It infuriates people. These salaries are now publicly known. People are insulted when they hear about how much money these CEOs effectively award to themselves—millions and millions of dollars—and it is a driver of inequality. Inequality is bad for the economy, it's bad for our society and it's so serious for individuals who are just trying to scrape things together.


There really is no reason that bank CEOs should have an income that's more than 10 times the average national wage. And I want to congratulate my colleague Senator Peter Whish-Wilson. He's done extensive work in this area. He spoke very clearly about this bill before us, and his amendments are to be supported. We should support these amendments, which are in fact very mild. They're not going to stop these CEOs being millionaires, but they're responsible amendments that would show that this place, our Senate, has got some backbone, is looking out for all Australians and isn't just playing Mickey Mouse games with legislation so the government can go out to the media with their headline, 'Senator Cormann is very effective,' making out that they're doing something when they're not. The Liberal-Nationals are not. They're protecting their own people, their own mates. And that's why I very warmly congratulate Senator Peter Whish-Wilson on these amendments and draw the Senate's attention to how important they are and that they should be supported. I really regard them as absolutely essential amendments.


Again, I want to emphasise, when we move into committee to consider this debate, let's keep at the front of our minds one of the big debates this week, and that is about the wages of the majority of Australians. So many people see their wages going backwards because the cost of living is going up so fast and their wages are not keeping up with it. Again, if you're sincere about doing something about that—and surely that should be the bread and butter of all of us in this place, ensuring that people aren't worse off—you would actually bring the excessive CEO salaries into line. It's time that bank CEOs are paid a fair wage, not an indecent and obscene wage—well, they don't even call it a wage; they call it 'salary remuneration' or whatever words they come up with. But it's indecent. It's obscene. It's really, really ugly, and something needs to change.


This bill needs teeth, and that's what the Greens amendments provide. They put some oomph, some guts, into this bill which is so urgently needed. We know that the majority of Australians want this—absolutely. The reason I'm saying that so emphatically is because of some very impressive research. I congratulate the Australia Institute. They have done some excellent research in really showing how out of control the banking system is in this country, particularly with regard to the four banks. One of their very extensive research projects polled over 1,400 Australians in 2016, at the time when there was a push for a royal commission. It found that 76 per cent of these people agreed that the big four banks should put customers ahead of shareholders. That is the essence of what I'm talking about and what Senator Peter Whish-Wilson's amendments go to. They go to what Australians want to see. All they're after is a fair system. How many times do you hear the politicians on the conservative side talk about fairness? It's just words to them. Well, this is an opportunity to do the right thing. I very much congratulate Senator Peter Whish-Wilson, and I look forward to the debate in the committee stage.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2018-02-07,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister for Finance, Special Minister of State and Vice-President of the Executive Council) (10:10):  Firstly, I would like to thank those senators who have contributed to this debate. The Banking Executive Accountability Regime, which this government is implementing, represents part of the most significant reform to our financial sector in a generation. The Treasury Laws Amendment (Banking Executive Accountability and Related Measures) Bill 2018 will increase the accountability of banks, as authorised deposit-taking institutions, and their most senior executives and directors, helping to restore the community's trust and confidence in the institutions that play such a central role in our financial system and the wellbeing of all Australians.


Schedule 1 to the bill introduces the Banking Executive Accountability Regime, which imposes new heightened accountability obligations for authorised deposit-taking institutions and their accountable persons. These obligations are focused on matters such as conducting business with honesty, integrity, due skill, care and diligence, being open and cooperative in dealings with the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and preventing matters arising that would adversely affect the authorised deposit-taking institution's prudential, reputation or standing. These accountability obligations go to the heart of the ensuring that the community can have trust in authorised deposit-taking institutions and the way they conduct their business. Authorised deposit-taking institutions will be required to register their accountable persons with the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority prior to appointment, ensuring that the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority has greater visibility over the individuals taking up the roles that shape the conduct of authorised deposit-taking institutions. Those authorised deposit-taking institutions will also be required to provide accountability statements and accountability maps to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, ensuring there's a clear allocation of responsibility for authorised deposit-taking institutions' functions to individual accountable persons.


The bill also increases the consequences for authorised deposit-taking institutions and accountable persons that fail to meet the new heightened accountability obligations. These increased consequences will ensure that authorised deposit-taking institutions and their accountable persons have strong incentives to ensure they meet their obligations. Accountable persons will have a minimum amount of their variable remuneration deferred for at least four years, with the amount to be deferred based on the size of the authorised deposit-taking institution. Authorised deposit-taking institutions will also be required to include, in their remuneration policies, provisions for the nonpayment of deferred variable remuneration where an accountable person fails to comply with their accountability obligations. Ensuring there are financial consequences for accountable persons who do not meet their obligations will increase their focus on the long-term outcomes of their decisions.


The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority will also be provided with stronger disqualification powers by being able to disqualify an accountable person directly rather than applying to the Federal Court. The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority disqualification decisions will be subject to merits and judicial review; however, the more streamlined powers will ensure that the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority can more readily respond where an accountable person does not comply with their accountability obligations.


The bill also introduces substantial new civil penalties for authorised deposit-taking institutions which breach any requirements of the Banking Executive Accountability Regime which relate to prudential matters. These penalties will range from up to $10.5 million for small authorised deposit-taking institutions to up to $210 million for large authorised deposit-taking institutions. These civil penalties will put in place strong financial incentives for authorised deposit-taking institutions to ensure they meet their obligations under the Banking Executive Accountability Regime.


Finally, schedule 2 to the bill introduces a number of powers to allow the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority to examine witnesses. These powers will apply in relation to the entire Banking Act, and will particularly support the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority's enforcement of the Banking Executive Accountability Regime. They broadly replicate powers that the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority already has in relation to other institutions, including the superannuation sector.


Australia's financial system is strong and resilient. However, the series of scandals in recent years has demonstrated that it is not immune from problems. Banks have not acted with the highest levels of integrity and accountability at all times which the community expects of them, and this has eroded trust in these institutions. That is why it is important that the Banking Executive Accountability Regime commence as soon as possible, to ensure that accountability gaps in the banking sector are addressed promptly. For this reason, the Banking Executive Accountability Regime will commence on 1 July 2018. That said, the government has provided for transition arrangements for elements which will require longer to implement, such as the remuneration requirements and accountability documentation.


Following meetings with the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, the government has been developing additional transitional arrangements which would have provided APRA with the flexibility it needs to allow staged implementation for small authorised deposit-taking institutions and provide additional time, until at least 1 January 2019, for these entities to comply with the Banking Executive Accountability Regime. This would allow the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority to focus on implementing the Banking Executive Accountability Regime for large authorised deposit-taking institutions—our key priority, because of how many Australian customers are touched by these institutions.


The opposition has informed the government that they're proposing to delay the commencement of the BEAR for small and medium authorised deposit-taking institutions until 1 July 2019. In order to facilitate the expeditious passage of these critical reforms, the government has agreed to this. It is vital that Australians see these reforms implemented and these rules legislated as soon as possible. These Turnbull government reforms are too important to play politics with.


Whilst we're reluctant to see unnecessary delay to the Banking Executive Accountability Regime, our first priority is protecting Australian banking customers and enshrining appropriate protections in legislation. This bill will ensure that the banks, as the heart of the financial sector, meet the community's expectations by clarifying accountability obligations, clarifying the responsibilities of senior executives and imposing more significant consequences where these obligations are not met. The Banking Executive Accountability Regime will ensure the banks shift their focus from profit at all costs to outcomes for all Australians. I commend this bill to the Senate.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2018-02-07,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (10:19):  The Greens have two sets of amendments to move this morning to the Treasury Laws Amendment (Banking Executive Accountability and Related Measures) Bill 2018. The first set I will move immediately. I seek leave to move Greens amendment (1) and (2) on sheet 8342 revised together:


Leave granted.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  I move


(1)Schedule 1, item 1, page 20 (lines 8 to 25), omit section 37G, substitute: 




37G Pecuniary penalty for non-compliance with this Part



(1) An ADI is liable to a pecuniary penalty if:


(a) an ADI contravenes its obligations under this Part (other than this Division); and


(b) the contravention relates to prudential matters.


(2) The maximum amount of pecuniary penalty is an amount at the rate of 10 penalty units for every $1,000,000 in assets, of the ADI within the control (however described) of the part of the ADI's banking business that is carried out in Australia.


(3) In determining the pecuniary penalty, the Federal Court of Australia must have regard to the impact that the penalty would have on the viability of the ADI.


(4) Subsection (3) does not limit subclause 1(3) of Schedule 2.


(5) This section is a civil penalty provision.


(2)Schedule 1, item 10, page 29 (lines 5 to 18), omit the item, substitute: 




10 Subsection 5(1)



Insert:



large ADI means an ADI which has assets greater than $100 billion on a 3 year average, within the control (however described) of the ADI's banking business carried out in Australia.



medium ADI means an ADI which has assets less than or equal to $100 billion on a 3 year average, within the control (however described) of the ADI's banking business carried out in Australia.



non ADI holding company, of another body corporate, means a body corporate (other than an ADI) of which the other body corporate is a subsidiary.



remuneration, of an accountable person, includes the meaning given by subsection 37E(3).



small ADI means an ADI which has assets less than or equal to $10 billion on a 3 year average, within the control (however described) of the ADI's banking business carried out in Australia.



variable remuneration has the meaning given by section 37EA.


This amendment in a nutshell directly relates any penalties or punitive measures to accountable persons or executives to their size under this scheme. We believe that an ADI, an authorised deposit-taking institution, which is liable for pecuniary penalties, should receive a penalty in line with their company size or their value. So the bigger the bank the bigger the fine. It's pretty simple and it's outlined in the amendment. We believe that the maximum amount of pecuniary penalties is an amount at the rate 10 penalty units for every million dollars in assets for those ADIs that are captured by this legislation. There are some more detail in there, and I presume, of course, all the senators have read it. We think it's pretty straightforward and self-explanatory. I'm not sure why you wouldn't support it. 


Just before we put that to the vote, I do need to clarify one thing you said, Senator Cormann, in relation to deferred remuneration. In your second reading speech you talked about deferring the variable component of captured persons under this legislation and you said it was for at least four years. My understanding is that it was up to four years in the legislation. Could you clarify that, please?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister for Finance, Special Minister of State and Vice-President of the Executive Council) (10:23):  I'm now speaking to the amendments moved by Senator Whish-Wilson. The government will be opposing this amendment. The government considers the civil penalties are set up at an appropriate level to provide a strong deterrent for poor behaviour by banks. These penalties equate to maximums of $10.5 million for small authorised deposit-taking institutions, $52.5 million for medium-sized authorised deposit-taking institutions and $210 million for large authorised deposit-taking institutions. These are tough penalties and substantially higher than the penalties generally available under the Commonwealth legislation. They provide a clear incentive for banks to ensure they comply with the requirements of the Banking Executive Accountability Regime. In contrast, the penalties proposed in this amendment would, in many cases, grossly exceed the maximum penalties currently provided for under the Banking Executive Accountability Regime. For example, for large authorised deposit-taking institutions, the maximum penalty would increase from $210 million to over $1 billion. The maximum penalties for some small and medium authorised deposit-taking institutions would also increase under the proposed amendment. The Banking Executive Accountability Regime has been carefully calibrated to operate proportionately across banks of different sizes. This amendment would adjust that calibration to the detriment of the small and medium authorised deposit-taking institutions. The civil penalties proposed by the government strike the right balance between providing a strong deterrent to poor behaviour by banks and ensuring they are proportionate to the size of authorised deposit-taking institutions.


I also reiterate that these are maximum penalties. In imposing a civil penalty, a court is required to take into account the nature of the breach of the Banking Executive Accountability Regime, the extent of loss suffered and the impact of the penalty on the viability of the bank, amongst other factors.

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2018-02-07,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (10:25):  Labor will not be supporting this amendment. This amendment seeks to replace the current tiered penalty regime under the BEAR with a sliding scale of penalties. We note that submissions to the Senate inquiry into this bill stated that the maximum penalties under the government's bill are a greater proportion of the size of small and medium ADIs compared to the large banks. However, this amendment ties the penalties to what seems an uncertain definition of what the banks' assets are. This would lead to uncertainty over applicable penalties for individual ADIs. While we note the intent to have penalties set at a more proportionate level, an effect of the formula in this amendment will be to significantly increase penalties for many small and medium ADIs. This could have an impact on the ability of these small and medium ADIs to compete.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (10:26):  Before I get to another question to Senator Cormann, I have to respond to Senator O'Neill. I've been hearing about grizzly bears and teddy bears in this place for two days now from the Labor Party. They wanted a regime that's going to be like a grizzly bear—a bear that's got teeth and claws and rips into the banks and makes sure we get some solid action here—and here they're knocking back a simple amendment that, yes, would significantly increase potential pecuniary fines on the banks for bad behaviour. That's why we've done it. I would have thought that was pretty straightforward and exactly what you were seeking, having listened to all your second reading speeches. So I am disappointed that Labor will not support this.


I do take on board your views about total assets, but that is actually quite clearly defined. In any banking analyst's report, you'll get a definition of how the assets or net assets are calculated for the bank. So I don't personally think that's an issue, but, if the Labor Party had a problem with that, they could have talked to us about it and we could have clarified that or included it in the amendment. The amendments have been circulated for some days now, so I do see it as probably a bit of an excuse to just not support a good Greens amendment.


Minister, you mentioned that there's a gradation in the fines or pecuniary penalties for different sized banks and that the top-tier banks' penalties are set at a maximum of $210 million. Is the minister aware that the size of those tier-1 banks is very variable? For example, the market capitalisation of the Commonwealth Bank is about $140 billion as we speak, whereas National Australia Bank is half that at just over $70 billion. How is it fair that the Commonwealth Bank, which is a much larger bank, gets to pay the same penalty as a bank half its size?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister for Finance, Special Minister of State and Vice-President of the Executive Council) (10:28):  Yes, I'm aware that different businesses in Australia are of a different size. I'm aware that different banks are of a different size. I know that, among the big banks, some are bigger than others. But it's not appropriate for parliament, the government or legislators to tailor-make penalty arrangements for individual businesses. It's not unusual for certain tiers to be determined and for certain categories to be established and, as I indicated in my primary response to the Greens amendment, the government believe that we've got the balance right and that we've got the categorisation of small, medium and larger banks right.

"Patrick, Sen Rex",NXT,2018-02-07,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (10:29):  I'd like to take this opportunity to put on the record the Nick Xenophon Team's support for this bill. A new accountability framework for the banks and for senior bank employees is long overdue. The Nick Xenophon Team welcomes the delayed implementation for small and medium banks, credit unions and building societies. While the bill may not be perfect, it should not be opposed. The royal commission into misconduct in the banking superannuation and financial services industry is finally underway, and I sincerely hope this will lead to a change in the culture that has adversely affected the lives of so many consumers.


The royal commission will also examine the need for a last-resort compensation scheme for victims of bad financial advice and misconduct. A number of senators in this chamber would be aware of the strong advocacy by former Senator Nick Xenophon on the issue of a last-resort compensation scheme. A last-resort compensation scheme is the only way to ensure that customers who suffer loss from misconduct are compensated. It is a missing piece of a financial services regulatory framework. The Nick Xenophon Team looks forward to seeing the recommendations of the royal commission in relation to last-resort compensation schemes.


I will also take this opportunity to indicate the Nick Xenophon Team's position on the amendments circulated by Senator Whish-Wilson. We do not support the amendment on sheet 8342 relating to executive caps. Whilst we agree that the pay packets of many CEOs in the financial services industry are far from perfect and ought to be reformed, it is the shareholders who ultimately bear the cost of paying the CEO. The direct intervention approach as proposed by the Greens is not an approach that is supported by the Nick Xenophon Team, but we do believe that the issue of executive pay is a debate worth having.


I can indicate that we will be supporting the amendment on sheet 8343, as the penalty regime does not adequately reflect the difference in size between big banks and the smaller regional and customer owned banks. The entire profit of the customer owned banking sector in 2016-17 was $487 million. In contrast, the Commonwealth Bank announced today a $4.8 billion half-year profit. We believe that this amendment will prevent any disproportionate impact on smaller banks and assist in discouraging activity within banks that gives rise to prudential risk. In closing, I'd like to acknowledge the work of the Economics Committee and thank those who made submissions to the inquiry into this bill.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (10:32):  Before I get to my next question to Senator Cormann, I might say, for Senator Patrick's benefit—and I did cover this in my second reading contribution yesterday—that the Israeli parliament looked at this issue of executive caps, starting with their own version of a parliamentary inquiry in 2010. At the time it was very progressive legislation around executive caps, and it took the approach that you mentioned, whereby they said that they wanted to give shareholders, especially, more transparency and more say in setting executive caps for the banking sector. That legislation was passed in 2012, but they found that it led to no change at all in the executive salary caps. Then in 2016, four years later, they passed the first legislation internationally capping executive salaries at very similar levels to what we're proposing. Any banker who earns more than that gets a massive amount of tax, and basically it's not worth it. They came to the conclusion that, left to their own devices—many of the big institutional shareholders that control the banks are part of the market system and part of the same ethos, the profit ethos, that drives the banks and a lot of the bad behaviour. But their decision wasn't just about bringing the banking sector into line and holding it to account. It was also fundamentally a question of equity and a moral argument about inequality in their own country. If a banker earns $1½ million, that's still a hell of a lot more than most people will ever earn. It's still 100 times your average weekly earnings. They felt that was sufficient.


Interestingly enough, the bankers association in Israel challenged it in the Supreme Court, as you'd expect they would, and failed. So, they were the first country in the world to do it. And I don't often get up in this place and speak about Israel, but in this case I think they've led the way and there's absolutely no reason we can't do the same thing. So, I will just say that, which I did cover during the second reading debate yesterday.


Senator Cormann, my last question to you, you'll be pleased to know, on this amendment is on the differences in the sizes of the tier 1 banks. As you just agreed, those banks are very different sizes. The Commonwealth Bank is nearly twice the size of the National Australia Bank. Isn't that fundamentally also accepting that those different banks will have different advantages and disadvantages in funding a penalty, if it's capped at $210 million? Essentially, by saying that, given the funds available to CommBank, it'll be twice as easy for them to pay a fine of $210 million based on their market capitalisation. I think that we actually need to differentiate all banks on the size of their assets.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister for Finance, Special Minister of State and Vice-President of the Executive Council) (10:35):  I've answered that question. The answer to the initial question is no, and the government believe that we've appropriately calibrated the penalties according to the various tiers, as I indicated in my initial response. We believe we've struck the right balance, and there's not really anything further I can add.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2018-02-07,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (10:35):  Market caps are a pretty blunt instrument to go on because there are all sorts of other types of financing banks go into apart from equity, but it is a value of the bank based on the issue holder's equity and, listed on a stock market, it changes all the time. However, it's a fundamental principle that, for a bank half the size, it's going to be twice as difficult to pay the same fine as a bigger bank. I will leave it at that and let the Senate decide.


I'll just finish by saying that I can't get this vision of a teddy bear out of my mind, Senator O'Neill. Something warm and cosy that helps you sleep at night; that's what this is. We're putting the offer to the Senate to put a brown, black or grizzly bear in bed with these bank CEOs when they go to bed at night-time, and I would urge the Senate to think about that and support the Greens amendments.

(b) apart from this subitem, the application of Division 3A of that Part in relation to the remuneration or variable remuneration would result in an acquisition of property (within the meaning of paragraph 51(xxxi) of the Constitution) from a person otherwise than on just terms (within the meaning of that paragraph);


that Division does not apply in relation to the remuneration or variable remuneration to the extent that it would result in such an acquisition.




Note: Because this subitem prevents Division 3A of Part IIAA of the

 from giving rise to such an acquisition of property in relation to remuneration or variable remuneration payable under such a contract, compensation will not be payable under section 69E of that Act.



We've already talked about this this morning, and I certainly did in my second reading speech. The Nick Xenophon Party have indicated they won't be supporting the amendments before the Senate today to cap executive salaries. I am glad that One Nation is going to support the amendments to cap executive salaries. No-one can justify the salaries that are paid by shareholders to the bank CEOs in this country. Our banks are some of the most profitable in the world and our CEOs are some of the most highly paid CEOs in the banking sector on the planet. These amendments before us today, amendments (1), (2) and (3), will put a cap on both variable and fixed remuneration.


Fixed salaries are 10 times average weekly earnings, which roughly works out at about $850,000, double what our Prime Minister makes, so bank CEOs still make a lot of money. The variable component's half that, so it still takes them to well over a million dollars. As I mentioned earlier, this is in line with what the Israeli government capped their bankers' salaries at. They took some firm action. When that vote went to their parliament, it was 56-zero—56 MPs voted for it and zero voted against it. They got to the point where they all agreed that their banking CEOs were paid too much. There was no need for it, it was counterproductive and it only added to inequality in their country. They saw capping the salaries of bankers not just as an economic argument but as a moral argument. I argued in this place in my second reading speech that we have the right to do that as a government because bankers are an unusual breed and they have a privilege to operate in this country that is given to them by the Australian taxpayer. They have a licence given to them by the taxpayer, the voters and the government that allows them to operate and then they're insured against failure through the too-big-to-fail guarantees. They work in a very privileged environment and they literally are given a licence by the Australian people to print money.


I want to make this very clear: the Treasurer talked in his second reading speech in the other place about bringing bank executives more in line with community expectations. I have no doubt at all that, if you go outside these walls and speak to Australians, the expectation of nearly every Australian you speak to is that these salaries cannot be justified. They are excessive, totally unnecessary, inequitable and unfair, and they add to inequality in this country. If government can play an active role in setting minimum wages in Australia, why can't we also play a role in setting maximum wages, especially in an industry that's regulated by the government? It's part of our constitution. The Banking Act very clearly talks about governments issuing a licence to bankers and playing an active role in regulating this industry. As we know, if the financial system collapses, there's corruption or there's instability then it affects every single one of us.


Lastly, I have no doubt about the rotten culture, which everyone has acknowledged—even Senator Cormann tacitly acknowledged it in his speech in the second reading debate today—and the need for this legislation. Believe me, that is a big turnaround from four years ago, when we were having the FOFA debate in this place and Senator Cormann clearly said it was just a few bad apples in the banking industry. I'm glad he's come to the view now that there are some systemic issues and that this legislation is here today because of those systemic issues. I accept that it's more about prudential issues than it is about bad behaviour and adverse consumer outcomes, but nevertheless at least it is something.


We accept there's a rotten culture, and there has been in the banking sector. There have been numerous scandals. We've talked about them ad nauseam in this debate. The only way that you can fix that profit-before-people culture, that profit-at-all-costs culture, is to cap CEO salaries. It's the simplest and easiest way to do that, because the culture of an organisation starts at the top. If CEOs know they're not going to earn $10 million or $20 million this year based on massive returns, there'll be a lot less pressure throughout the organisation to constantly make profits and do all the kinds of things that we've uncovered in our Senate inquiries, like sell to people products they don't want, charge excessive fees and charges to their customers, rip off customers or carry out unconscionable conduct. That's our view. I won't talk about that anymore. I will simply ask Senator Cormann to at least address this when he responds to this amendment. Senator Cormann, do you believe that bankers' salaries are excessive and do you believe the government has a role in limiting them?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister for Finance, Special Minister of State and Vice-President of the Executive Council) (10:50):  I don't believe the government has a role in setting remuneration for employees of any business, including the banking business. The government does not support a cap on the remuneration for accountable persons under the Banking Executive Accountability Regime. Setting of salaries and remuneration arrangements more generally of any private sector business is, ultimately, a matter for shareholders and boards to make decisions on. It is not the role of government to set the size of remuneration payable to accountable persons; these are commercial decisions for an authorised deposit-taking institution to make in line with its policies. 


However, the government does have a role in ensuring such policies do not result in perverse outcomes for consumers. This is why the bill includes provisions requiring the deferral of a minimum percentage of an accountable person's variable remuneration for at least four years. This will ensure that accountable persons have clear incentives to make decisions which account for longer term effects on the bank and its customers. Simply capping the remuneration of accountable persons would not provide the incentives that the referral of variable remuneration can, when behaviour of a person is clearly linked to remuneration outcomes.

 (Tasmania) (10:51):  In terms of incentives, if a variable remuneration is deferred for four years—and let's say the variable remuneration, the bonus, is $5 million—what kind of opportunity costs are going to be carried by that particular CEO or executive, Senator Cormann? What is the real penalty of having your remuneration deferred for four years? You still get it four years later. We're not talking about very significant costs. It's hardly an incentive.

There is a penalty, which we are confident will focus the relevant people's minds.

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (10:53):  One Nation will support this amendment put up by Senator Whish-Wilson of the Greens. We are going to support this because I think what the banking executives get in their remuneration package—between $10 million and $20 million—does not pass the pub test as far as Australians are concerned. The minister states that it is not the government's responsibility to get into private business, but this is not the government getting into private business. As I see it, the banking sector is a necessity that Australians have to use. It is a service that is important to their everyday needs and requirements in running their businesses and their lives. It is something Australians have to use. 


The fact is that the Australian taxpayer guarantees the banking sector, so we do have a very important decision to make here, because if ever the banking sector were to fail then the taxpayers would be picking up the bills. So the taxpayers do have a right to have an input and a say into the remuneration that is paid—which is out of the realms of common sense. It is important that we have this discussion and the Australian taxpayers have a right to know the government's stance on this and why the government are not prepared to rein it in, when there is another country in the world that has done the same with their banking sector.

The fact that this amendment has been raised so late—in fact it only emerged this week and really wasn't raised until this week—suggests that this amendment is more about grandstanding than considered policy to address this issue with banks, of which Labor is very, very aware. The ultimate sign that it is a stunt is that we have One Nation and the Greens voting together. This amendment would not fix issues with the banks that have come to light over recent years. Evidence has not been provided to suggest it would have the impact of addressing cultural issues and poor practices in banks. Labor has consistently argued that the most crucial thing needed to address cultural issues, misconduct and poor practices in the banks is a royal commission. Banker wages need scrutiny, but this must be done in a considered and careful way, and only a royal commission can properly attend to this matter, amongst many others.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (10:58):  This will be the last contribution from me. My colleagues and I want to move on to the next pieces of legislation. I can't let Senator O'Neill's brief contribution go unanswered. Senator O'Neill said that Labor believes the best way to tackle culture in the banks is through a banking royal commission. While I agree that it's certainly an important part of this debate, may I remind Senator O'Neill—through you, Chair—that, when I raised a motion in this place over three years ago, to have a banking royal commission for exactly this reason, Labor didn't just oppose it;  Senator Dastyari made a public statement that it was a 'Greens' stunt'. I remember seeing some people on social media saying, 'If it's a Greens' stunt, Sam, it's a good one. Support it.' Anyway, we don't need a history lesson. But Labor did fall behind our push for a royal commission and, I will say, Senator Williams's and other people's push for a royal commission. I think it's ironic that I'm being told this is a stunt today when it is exactly what I was told when I was pushing for a royal commission into the banks to try to help fix the cultural problems that we have in our financial services sector.


I accept that this is going to be revolutionary and radical to some, but it's not going to go away. Other countries are looking at this. This debate about excessive executive remuneration in financial services is happening right around the world. Nothing else is working. You can't leave this to shareholders. If we want to look at the larger debate of inequality in this country then we actually have to look at not only how we raise minimum wages, which we desperately need to do in this country, but also how we cap ridiculous maximum wages at the top end of the spectrum. We need to do both if we're going to fix inequality and close the gap.

 (Queensland) (11:00):  I also need to respond to Labor's comments with regard to this. To say that it was a stunt between One Nation and the Greens is absolutely ridiculous. There's no basis to that comment whatsoever. No talks or negotiations have actually happened between our offices. We actually came to the decision this morning after reading the legislation and reading the amendment. It was common sense for One Nation to actually support the Greens' amendment to this.


To hear Labor say this is rushed through and this is political—I've seen them rush through so many things in this chamber when it suits them. The whole fact is that One Nation along with the Greens have been pushing for a royal commission, and I'm very pleased to see it happen as well. To hear Labor many a time grandstand about the workers and what they're paid in this country, bleating from the bleeding heart, and then say that they're going to support uncapped executive salaries is looking after their mates as far as I'm concerned. They don't really care about the workers in this nation who are struggling; they look after their mates. So it's all bleating as far as I'm concerned when they support the government or they don't support the amendments put up. The Australian people will in their own minds think, 'Why would anyone be entitled to receive $10 million to $20 million a year in remuneration?' It's just way out of the ballpark, and Labor can never justify that.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (09:31):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Banking Executive Accountability and Related Measures) Bill 2018. This bill imposes a new layer of regulation and supervision on the banking sector, overseen by APRA. Its purpose, as stated by the Treasurer in his second reading speech, is to ensure that where community expectations of accountability and integrity of banking directors and executives are not met, appropriate consequences will follow. As a Liberal Democrat I am opposed to this. It is not a legitimate exercise of government to seek to ensure particular businesses meet community expectations. This is a matter for the market. The bill makes no provision for discovering or addressing community expectations. The only expectations to be met are those held by APRA. The bill will not prevent a repeat of the problems in the banking sector examined during the Senate Economics Legislation Committee's five-week inquiry. The bill will have no impact on the manner in which banks serve their customers. APRA will become a de facto additional board of directors with a supervisory role in the appointment of senior executives, their responsibilities and their remuneration. 


Of particular concern are section 37C and section 37CA, which require banks and accountable persons to take reasonable steps to prevent matters from arising that would adversely affect the ADI's prudential standing or prudential reputation. APRA will have complete discretion, with no reference to community or any other external standards, to determine whether a bank is complying with this. The only consideration will be its own view of prudential standing and reputation. APRA will have the authority to disqualify a person from acting as an accountable person, depriving them of their ability to remain employed. While an affected person will be able to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, this amounts to a reversal of the onus of proof. 


The bill requires banks to defer the remuneration of accountable persons for a period of up to four years, with policies that allow for a reduction in remuneration for failure to meet BEAR obligations. The bill also gives APRA the power to direct a bank with respect to the allocation of management responsibilities. These are extraordinary intrusions into the management of a private sector business by public servants. The merits of deferred remuneration are contested in management theory, and entrenching the policy in law amounts to significant overreach by the government. It also amounts to serious conceit to believe that APRA has the expertise to direct a bank as to how to allocate its responsibilities. The cost of complying with the legislation is likely to drive small ADIs from the market and reduce competition. This is likely to adversely affect consumer choice. The bill will increase executive risk, potentially making it more difficult and expensive for banks operating in Australia to recruit talented personnel. This has the potential to adversely affect the international competitiveness of the Australian banking sector.


Finally, the intended date on which the bill is to take effect, 1 July, is absurd given the far-reaching implications for the banks and even the time APRA will need to figure out what it thinks are community standards. If there are failures in the banking sector that are not being addressed by current regulations or market factors, this bill will do nothing to address them. The Liberal Democrats are committed to the principles of a free market unshackled from government intrusion. This BEAR is nothing but a bill with a sore head. It cannot be amended to make it useful, and I will therefore be opposing it entirely.

Senator KETTER
 (Queensland—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (09:36):  I rise today to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Banking Executive Accountability and Related Measures) Bill 2018. Labor isn't against this bill and won't stand in its way. In fact, the bill is a welcome move, an acknowledgement from the other side that the market can't sort everything out and that there is a proper role for government in making sure that the financial sector serves the interests of everyday Australians. There's a need for our banking executives to take responsibility for the scandals and the rip-offs that have occurred. However, I am concerned that this bill doesn't go far enough; it's light on policy and heavy on politics.


This measure was announced on budget night last year and was used by the likes of the Treasurer and the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services to hold off calls for a banking royal commission—and we know how that worked out. We saw the world's biggest backflip last year. At ten minutes to midnight the Prime Minister and Treasurer were finally brought kicking and screaming to accepting a royal commission. But even then it was only after the big banks twisted their arms. The long-awaited acknowledgement that we need a royal commission is a strong indication that this bill doesn't go nearly far enough to changing the culture in the big banks. In fact, the policy process of this bill and the royal commission seem to show that the government is still running its protection racket for the big banks. More has to be done with changing the culture, and I welcome the royal commission, particularly on behalf of those everyday consumers and small businesses who endured rip-off after rip-off while the banks rode roughshod over all and sundry.


Of course, I note that the royal commission has commenced communications with the banks. I won't pre-empt its next steps, but I must point out that consumers are ready and willing to give evidence, and the sooner the process through which that can happen is made public the better the level of public confidence and the sooner we can begin to put to bed some of the recent banking scandals. In the meantime, I note that the ACTU and Choice are gathering submissions via their websites to submit to the royal commission. Consumers who have a story to tell may like to visit www.actu.org.au or https://campaigns.choice.com.au/royalcommissionbanks.


In terms of the bill itself, the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, of which I'm the deputy chair, conducted the inquiry into this legislation, and you can believe me when I say that this bill is no substitute for a banking royal commission. As Choice said in its submission to the inquiry, what we've got is a bit of a teddy bear, when what Australia really needs, in the way of banking reform, is a grizzly bear. This is what Labor told the government for 601 days, and finally they got the message. But they haven't got the message about the flaws in the BEAR legislation, and I will outline some of the key concerns now.


The first thing to mention about this bill is that it seems that the Treasurer has hand-picked another element of the UK system without the supporting structure. I want to make it known to senators that the UK reviewed their own regulatory arrangements after the global financial crisis, and that resulted in the Senior Manager and Certification Regime, or SMCR. A number of stakeholders to the inquiry praised the UK approach, in which they took a holistic view and took their time to properly consult and develop their accountability regime. In contrast, the BEAR is not holistic; nor was the proper time given to consult—far from it. The UK harmonised their regulatory framework, making sure that the prudential regulator and the conduct authority were able to competently handle both prudential and non-prudential matters. The UK reforms ensured that there were no regulatory gaps and that regulatory responsibility was clear. As Choice succinctly put it:


Our take generally is that the UK system has been really constructive—that it has involved both regulators working together to define the limits of powers for each one and make sure that there aren't gaps. Because this was developed in tandem it just means that you don't end up with those awkward gaps between regimes that can happen when you split regulatory powers between a prudential and a consumer regulator.


Yet here we have a bill that talks only about APRA and says nothing about ASIC's powers. The Treasurer has again botched the policy process. He tried to copy the UK's approach, and he couldn't get it right. He is clearly out of his depth.


There's much more I can say on this matter, but it's clear that Australia should follow the UK's approach and conduct a holistic review of the banking and financial services sector. The government's royal commission could have gone closer to doing this very thing if the opposition had been properly consulted. That way we could have had a bipartisan set of recommendations that complemented and enhanced each other. It's my view that taking that teamwork approach would have given the public the highest level of confidence that the real problems in the industry would be properly dealt with. But of course we know that the Prime Minister is not big on teamwork. The very way in which he was dragged kicking and screaming to the royal commission is evidence of this fact, with the Nationals having to finally break ranks to get him over the line. And we saw a bizarre situation of a divided coalition and a divided government, with the likes of the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance, both Liberals, resisting calls for an inquiry—quite unsuccessfully, as we now know—whilst the Nationals members finally found their voice and a desire to hold the banks to account.


As welcome as it was to see the Nationals coming to their senses, let us not forget that it was very late in the day. I don't think that should be forgotten when we look back on this debate, because the Nationals sat back for almost 600 days and let the very farmers they purport to represent get ripped off by the banks. I've lost count of the number of stories I've heard about farmers losing everything when the banks moved in. And, while the Nationals sat back in Queensland, where was 'Team Queensland'? Labor was leading the charge, standing up for farmers in rural and regional Queensland who had been mistreated by the banks. And while Senator O'Sullivan finally found his voice to stand up for Queenslanders on financial reform—and I commend him for that—where, might I ask, was the federal member for Maranoa?


We've read a lot in the media about Mr Littleproud since he replaced Mr Chester in the ministry. We know that he has a background in banking and that he prides himself on the number of farmers' kitchen tables he has sat around. Surely then, he's heard some stories about banking misconduct and the impact on our farmers. But we weren't reading in the media then about any calls for a royal commission from the member for Maranoa. No, like most of his colleagues he remained silent, not wanting to rock the Prime Minister's boat, no matter how many banking scandals came to light. No, the National Party is no real friend of the bush.


On the issue of scandals, the explanatory memorandum cites six scandals set out in the Coleman report to justify this bill. I quote from the EM:


The Coleman Report referred to a number of instances where participants in the financial sector have been treated inappropriately by banks and other related financial institutions:


• the provision of poor financial advice at NAB;


• the mishandling of life insurance claims at CommInsure;


• NAB’s failure to pay 62,000 wealth management customers the amount that they were owed;


• the poor administration of hardship support at CBA;


• ANZ’s OnePath improperly collecting millions of dollars in fees from hundreds of thousands of customers; and


• ANZ improperly collecting fees from 390,000 accounts that had not been properly disclosed.


Yet with the very simple question of: 'Would this bill have prevented this scandal or would it have triggered the BEAR's penalties?', both APRA and Treasury were unable to give a definitive yes. APRA said, 'In the course of our inquiry we cannot definitely say what the outcome would be.' And Treasury said, 'I don't think Treasury is in a position to do an analysis and to look back as to whether a law would have applied in particular circumstances.'


It seems very strange that the government seeks to use these scandals to justify the passage of this bill when it's far from clear that this bill would have made a meaningful difference. Much of this legislation's reform success also hinges on how APRA will define prudential. This bill limits APRA's remit to prudential standing and prudential reputation, and there are many concerns that the scandals I mentioned previously would not have triggered anything in the BEAR, as the scandals which ripped off ordinary customers were not at a level to threaten the prudential standing of the bank. The Consumer Action Law Centre said:


We've one clear ask of the committee, and that is to give this BEAR real teeth. Treasury has restricted the application of the proposed BEAR so that it will apply to poor conduct or behaviour that is of a systemic and prudential nature. This misses the crucial element of the United Kingdom model that ties accountability measures to poor consumer outcomes, not just prudential matters.


In fairness to the public servants, I understand the difficulty in advising on the impacts of legislation had it been in place during the time that the events occurred. However, when you consider that both Treasury and APRA can give no promises that the BEAR legislation would have made a difference and that the government clearly decided to limit the BEAR's remit to prudential matters, no-one can be blamed for just being a tad cynical about the approach of this government and whether this bill will actually match its tough talk.


I want to talk a little about the fact that the consultation process on this bill was extremely rushed. This is something that stakeholders have picked up on during the course of our inquiry. We did have quite a diverse group of stakeholders. Firstly, you had the Bankers' Association saying:


The seven day consultation period announced by the Federal Government on new banking executive accountability laws is grossly inadequate and playing fast and loose with a critical sector of the economy.


You would expect the ABA to make those comments. You had the Governance Institute of Australia in its Treasury submission putting it in much more polite terms:


Due to the comprehensive nature of the proposed legislative regime and the timeframe given to provide a submission, we have not responded to each of the detailed questions set out in the consultation paper but have confined our comments to the following issues.


The obvious question here is: what did they and others have to leave out? During the inquiry, Dr Wardrop and Dr Wishart said that, in fact, their views about it changed depending on the time they had to look at it. Also, their comments about some words used imply, without stating directly, they might be the result of the swift development process of the bill.


But, if you don't want to take their word for it, just see what the Prime Minister's own department said. The Office of Best Practice Regulation made it quite clear. The OBPR considered that to only provide one week for affected stakeholders to consider and comment on draft legislation was a significant departure from best practice. So we have a Treasurer out of his depth, playing fast and loose with policy development. The Finance Sector Union has also raised concerns about the bill and about the disjoint in the accountability regimes. We now face the situation of having the BEAR in place, a possible ASIC senior managers ban and the Australian Bankers' Association's conduct background check for frontline workers. There are three schemes and there seems to be no acknowledgement from the government that this is an issue and that we need to consider the overlap or gaps that might exist. For example, the FSU made it clear that these arrangements are inequitable, particularly the fact that executives would have an appeals process under the BEAR while frontline workers would have no appeal mechanism under the ABA conduct background check.


As a starting point, the ABA should introduce an appeals mechanism. Further, what really needs to be considered, in my opinion, is an accountability scheme that doesn't create a cultural divide between frontline workers and executives. Again, this is just typical of the piecemeal approach the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have brought to reform in the financial services sector for so long when what we really need is a holistic approach—something that a proper royal commission can bring.


Coming back to consultation, the explanatory memorandum mentions that the major banks met with the government in February last year, before the announcement in May, discussing the accountability gaps. We have media reports that Mr Gonski was instrumental in gaining an appeal mechanism in the BEAR as a concession. However, the small and medium ADIs were not afforded similar early access to policy discussion or concessions. The Customer Owned Banking Association raised concerns about the additional regulatory work that needs to be done alongside other reforms underway, often implemented by the same small teams in the banks. The Treasurer talks big talk about standing up for the smaller banks, but the reality is that he is still standing up for the major banks. The royal commission is the icing on the cake. It says everything about the Prime Minister and his Treasurer that he only agreed to Labor's royal commission when the banks told him they had to.


The government has always been on the side of the banks. I'm still a bit cynical and a bit concerned that the government's protection racket for the banks isn't over yet. But there has been some good news for the small and medium ADIs. Labor has lobbied hard for an amendment to this bill: to delay the start date by 12 months to ease the burden on small and medium ADIs and to give them appropriate time to prepare. I understand that the Treasurer has finally followed Labor's lead on this and Labor's amendment has passed the House of Representatives. I also note the Treasurer chose to support Labor over the chair of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee to make this happen. That was one of the recommendations in the Labor senators' additional comments report. I congratulate Mr Morrison on recognising when Labor has policy right and admitting, through that amendment, that the Liberals got it wrong. I'm proud that Labor is once again supporting small businesses—small banks in this case—and making their lives a little bit easier.


I note from the inquiry that the Customer Owned Banking Association made it very clear to us that the regulatory compliance burden is a critical factor. They made it clear that, in fact, regulatory compliance is a competitive advantage that the major banks have because they have vastly greater resources and capacity than smaller competitors to cope with the new regulatory obligations. So I want to make it very clear that we support that change to help out small businesses.


I will conclude my speech where I started and indicate that Labor will not stand in the way of this bill, but it is, as I said, disappointing to see that, once again, we have a Treasurer releasing substandard legislation. This bill was more of a political fix for the Treasurer, but, day by day, week by week, we saw the fix unravel. This bill couldn't stop the government calling a banking royal commission. Labor knew this bill was a political fix. Government senators in the inquiry saw the problems and shortcomings with the bill, and comments from other government backbenchers made it clear that the bill was no substitute for a royal commission. We've heard this legislation described as a 'teddy bear'—and who doesn't like a teddy bear? So I will support the bill, but, importantly, Labor fully recognises that the consultation process was inadequate and that the transition time will disadvantage smaller operators. So we have sought an amendment to delay the start date to help small and medium ADIs. I hope that the Prime Minister and Treasurer continue to follow Labor's lead in making this improvement. This bill is a baby step and I conclude by reiterating: it is the royal commission that will really deliver the much-needed change in this sector.


Finally, while I have the floor, I hope that the government is taking note of the calls in the media this week that action is urgently needed for improved consumer protection laws around payday lending. These laws, which the government has been dragging its feet on, are needed to prevent another financial crisis affecting Australian families. The Turnbull government has a lot to answer for because it's a government that's, for far too long, stuck its head in the sand on financial reform.

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2018-02-07,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (09:56):  The system we live under and work under is rigged, and the banks are a big part of the problem. The economy works for the rich and this bill does nothing to change that. Big bank CEOs are the flag-bearers of this rigged system. These CEOs fail to protect their customers, they fail to properly manage financial risks and they fail to report changes and where they've gone against the law. Time and time again, these CEOs are letting the public down. They fleece the public with excessive fees and other charges, all to boost their profits. That's what's going on here. While there are complexities in the system, on one level it's very simple: it's about boosting profits.


The annual pay packets of the CEOs of the banks illustrate that so effectively. I will put on record what they are to illustrate how out of control the system is and the depth of failure of the bill currently before us, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Banking Executive Accountability and Related Measures) Bill 2018. CBA CEO Ian Narev received a $12.3 million salary package in 2016, off a base salary of $2.65 million—an absolute shame. NAB's Andrew Thorburn received a $6.7 million salary package, off a base salary of $2.4 million. ANZ's Shayne Elliott received $5.07 million, off a base salary of $2.1 million. Westpac's Brian Hartzer received $6.7 million, off a base salary of $2.8 million. Macquarie's Nicholas Moore received $18.7 million, off a base salary of $818,000. The system is deeply broken. I said it's rigged—it's just rotten to the core. Why is the essence of this whole system about profits? It is because that is how the CEOs make their money. It's not about how they treat customers or if they're helping to make housing more affordable, ensuring young people can get a start in life or assisting people to get loans for their small businesses. That's not how they're judged. It's all about the massive profits they're making, and that's what flows through to these obscene wages—and that's what should be dealt with here today.


And these profits are obscene. In 2015, Australian banks made the highest profits anywhere in the world as a share of GDP. The privilege the banks have in this country because of the way the government runs the system should be what we're dealing with here, because the way the banks are run—the extreme salaries that these CEOs take home—is driving the inequality in this country. It's getting much larger, and I will come back to it. This issue of wages and salaries is right in the news at the moment because wages for the majority of people in this country have stalled. In the meantime we have an opportunity with this legislation here to do something about the super-rich, and nothing is being delivered.


As I said, the key issue the government should deal with is excessive bank CEO salaries. CEOs should be judged to be doing a good job and should be paid more if shareholders are gaining more returns because of banks' high profits. That's the basis of the very sick system we're living in at the moment and we need to change how banking executives are paid. The bill barely covers that key aspect—why? It doesn't cover that key aspect because the Liberals and the Nationals are mates. This is actually a class system here: the Nationals and the Liberals are looking after their class. They're looking after the very rich. They're out to protect them. That's why they're just nibbling around the edges.


This legislation has come before us because the government does at least note that there is outrage amongst the public about what is going on and about how out of touch so many banks are with their needs. The salaries are excessive, but they won't actually deal with them. Why don't they deal with them? Because they're mates—they'll probably have to get a job with them one day. It is a really sick system when you have a government that is there to advance privilege and not use the power and the responsibility it has to make our society more equal and more fair. So, as I said, it's not surprising that the bill before us barely touches on the issue of salary.


If this legislation goes through in its current form, CEOs can continue to pay themselves these huge amounts of money because their salaries are linked to the profit basis of their banks. It also illustrates the closeness of the major parties to the banks. Why the major parties are soft on the banks is the issue of political donations. I will come to the fact that recently—and, again, because they were getting such a bad name for themselves—some of the banks did come out with a position: 'We're not going to take donations anymore.' You need to look at the 'anymore' closely.


But, firstly, let's look at the culture that has been around for many years. In 2013-14 and 2014-15, the four big banks gave $1.3 million in political donations to the Liberals, the Nationals and Labor over those two financial years, with the bulk of it going to the Liberals and the Nationals. That again is a very unhealthy culture. It's said, 'We just want to be able to talk to people,' or 'We want to help the democratic process.' That's what some of the big CEOs have said. But, again, it is part of the corrupting culture that is really turning people off how politics works in this country.


Now, I do acknowledge that the National Australia Bank, in 2016, announced it would stop giving money to political parties. That decision is a remarkable turnaround and it's a good turnaround—I certainly acknowledge that. It is an important turnaround and a reminder why the Turnbull government should get its act together and bring in some electoral funding law that limits, bans or puts strict caps on all corporate donations.


I will put on the record what the National Australia Bank had been doing just before it changed its position. It had given more than $500,000 to the major parties over three years, and it also sponsored a major fundraiser for Liberal frontbencher Kelly O'Dwyer in her re-election campaign for the seat of Higgins. It's interesting that the bank was right there, in a very generous way, up to the point it made its decision. But its decision isn't watertight. The NAB's manifesto actually still allows for there to be exceptions to what appears to be a strict policy. Political donations can still be made, but they need to be cleared by the board of directors.


But, at any rate, I still congratulate NAB. They've taken that position, and other banks are also moving in that direction. But I go back to the position that for a long time there's been this culture of closeness, of attending the big, fancy, expensive fundraisers and giving generously, particularly to the Liberals and Nationals. That creates an unhealthy culture. It's a culture that's been identified in a High Court case about political donations that I've spoken about many times in the House, and I will continue to do so, because it identified that with political donations it's not just about quid pro quo—giving money and expecting something in return. It's about the damaging influence this money has on how the legislators, the politicians in this place, operate. They start to, maybe subconsciously—who knows; I'm not one of them—adjust their culture to deliver for the big donors. So, if there's legislation, maybe we should think about how that works for that sector that we spend a lot of time with.


The corrupting influence of political donations is well on the record, and I believe it's part of what's going on here—that there is a closeness between the major parties and in this case the big banks, the big donors, so that they don't really do the job properly. A proper job would be taking on the CEOs and limiting their salary. It infuriates people. These salaries are now publicly known. People are insulted when they hear about how much money these CEOs effectively award to themselves—millions and millions of dollars—and it is a driver of inequality. Inequality is bad for the economy, it's bad for our society and it's so serious for individuals who are just trying to scrape things together.


There really is no reason that bank CEOs should have an income that's more than 10 times the average national wage. And I want to congratulate my colleague Senator Peter Whish-Wilson. He's done extensive work in this area. He spoke very clearly about this bill before us, and his amendments are to be supported. We should support these amendments, which are in fact very mild. They're not going to stop these CEOs being millionaires, but they're responsible amendments that would show that this place, our Senate, has got some backbone, is looking out for all Australians and isn't just playing Mickey Mouse games with legislation so the government can go out to the media with their headline, 'Senator Cormann is very effective,' making out that they're doing something when they're not. The Liberal-Nationals are not. They're protecting their own people, their own mates. And that's why I very warmly congratulate Senator Peter Whish-Wilson on these amendments and draw the Senate's attention to how important they are and that they should be supported. I really regard them as absolutely essential amendments.


Again, I want to emphasise, when we move into committee to consider this debate, let's keep at the front of our minds one of the big debates this week, and that is about the wages of the majority of Australians. So many people see their wages going backwards because the cost of living is going up so fast and their wages are not keeping up with it. Again, if you're sincere about doing something about that—and surely that should be the bread and butter of all of us in this place, ensuring that people aren't worse off—you would actually bring the excessive CEO salaries into line. It's time that bank CEOs are paid a fair wage, not an indecent and obscene wage—well, they don't even call it a wage; they call it 'salary remuneration' or whatever words they come up with. But it's indecent. It's obscene. It's really, really ugly, and something needs to change.


This bill needs teeth, and that's what the Greens amendments provide. They put some oomph, some guts, into this bill which is so urgently needed. We know that the majority of Australians want this—absolutely. The reason I'm saying that so emphatically is because of some very impressive research. I congratulate the Australia Institute. They have done some excellent research in really showing how out of control the banking system is in this country, particularly with regard to the four banks. One of their very extensive research projects polled over 1,400 Australians in 2016, at the time when there was a push for a royal commission. It found that 76 per cent of these people agreed that the big four banks should put customers ahead of shareholders. That is the essence of what I'm talking about and what Senator Peter Whish-Wilson's amendments go to. They go to what Australians want to see. All they're after is a fair system. How many times do you hear the politicians on the conservative side talk about fairness? It's just words to them. Well, this is an opportunity to do the right thing. I very much congratulate Senator Peter Whish-Wilson, and I look forward to the debate in the committee stage.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2018-02-07,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister for Finance, Special Minister of State and Vice-President of the Executive Council) (10:10):  Firstly, I would like to thank those senators who have contributed to this debate. The Banking Executive Accountability Regime, which this government is implementing, represents part of the most significant reform to our financial sector in a generation. The Treasury Laws Amendment (Banking Executive Accountability and Related Measures) Bill 2018 will increase the accountability of banks, as authorised deposit-taking institutions, and their most senior executives and directors, helping to restore the community's trust and confidence in the institutions that play such a central role in our financial system and the wellbeing of all Australians.


Schedule 1 to the bill introduces the Banking Executive Accountability Regime, which imposes new heightened accountability obligations for authorised deposit-taking institutions and their accountable persons. These obligations are focused on matters such as conducting business with honesty, integrity, due skill, care and diligence, being open and cooperative in dealings with the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and preventing matters arising that would adversely affect the authorised deposit-taking institution's prudential, reputation or standing. These accountability obligations go to the heart of the ensuring that the community can have trust in authorised deposit-taking institutions and the way they conduct their business. Authorised deposit-taking institutions will be required to register their accountable persons with the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority prior to appointment, ensuring that the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority has greater visibility over the individuals taking up the roles that shape the conduct of authorised deposit-taking institutions. Those authorised deposit-taking institutions will also be required to provide accountability statements and accountability maps to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, ensuring there's a clear allocation of responsibility for authorised deposit-taking institutions' functions to individual accountable persons.


The bill also increases the consequences for authorised deposit-taking institutions and accountable persons that fail to meet the new heightened accountability obligations. These increased consequences will ensure that authorised deposit-taking institutions and their accountable persons have strong incentives to ensure they meet their obligations. Accountable persons will have a minimum amount of their variable remuneration deferred for at least four years, with the amount to be deferred based on the size of the authorised deposit-taking institution. Authorised deposit-taking institutions will also be required to include, in their remuneration policies, provisions for the nonpayment of deferred variable remuneration where an accountable person fails to comply with their accountability obligations. Ensuring there are financial consequences for accountable persons who do not meet their obligations will increase their focus on the long-term outcomes of their decisions.


The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority will also be provided with stronger disqualification powers by being able to disqualify an accountable person directly rather than applying to the Federal Court. The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority disqualification decisions will be subject to merits and judicial review; however, the more streamlined powers will ensure that the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority can more readily respond where an accountable person does not comply with their accountability obligations.


The bill also introduces substantial new civil penalties for authorised deposit-taking institutions which breach any requirements of the Banking Executive Accountability Regime which relate to prudential matters. These penalties will range from up to $10.5 million for small authorised deposit-taking institutions to up to $210 million for large authorised deposit-taking institutions. These civil penalties will put in place strong financial incentives for authorised deposit-taking institutions to ensure they meet their obligations under the Banking Executive Accountability Regime.


Finally, schedule 2 to the bill introduces a number of powers to allow the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority to examine witnesses. These powers will apply in relation to the entire Banking Act, and will particularly support the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority's enforcement of the Banking Executive Accountability Regime. They broadly replicate powers that the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority already has in relation to other institutions, including the superannuation sector.


Australia's financial system is strong and resilient. However, the series of scandals in recent years has demonstrated that it is not immune from problems. Banks have not acted with the highest levels of integrity and accountability at all times which the community expects of them, and this has eroded trust in these institutions. That is why it is important that the Banking Executive Accountability Regime commence as soon as possible, to ensure that accountability gaps in the banking sector are addressed promptly. For this reason, the Banking Executive Accountability Regime will commence on 1 July 2018. That said, the government has provided for transition arrangements for elements which will require longer to implement, such as the remuneration requirements and accountability documentation.


Following meetings with the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, the government has been developing additional transitional arrangements which would have provided APRA with the flexibility it needs to allow staged implementation for small authorised deposit-taking institutions and provide additional time, until at least 1 January 2019, for these entities to comply with the Banking Executive Accountability Regime. This would allow the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority to focus on implementing the Banking Executive Accountability Regime for large authorised deposit-taking institutions—our key priority, because of how many Australian customers are touched by these institutions.


The opposition has informed the government that they're proposing to delay the commencement of the BEAR for small and medium authorised deposit-taking institutions until 1 July 2019. In order to facilitate the expeditious passage of these critical reforms, the government has agreed to this. It is vital that Australians see these reforms implemented and these rules legislated as soon as possible. These Turnbull government reforms are too important to play politics with.


Whilst we're reluctant to see unnecessary delay to the Banking Executive Accountability Regime, our first priority is protecting Australian banking customers and enshrining appropriate protections in legislation. This bill will ensure that the banks, as the heart of the financial sector, meet the community's expectations by clarifying accountability obligations, clarifying the responsibilities of senior executives and imposing more significant consequences where these obligations are not met. The Banking Executive Accountability Regime will ensure the banks shift their focus from profit at all costs to outcomes for all Australians. I commend this bill to the Senate.

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (11:19):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



This bill provides the underpinning legislative authority to enable the expansion of the cashless debit card into new regions.


The government is committed to addressing the serious harm which is caused by alcohol, gambling and drug abuse paid for by welfare payments.


I thank the Joint Parliamentary Committee for Human Rights and the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills for their comments in relation to this bill. In light of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee's recommendation that the explanatory material be updated, the government will table an addendum to the explanatory memorandum. 


The addendum provides further background around the use of delegated legislation to support the operation of the cashless debit card and includes the results from the final evaluation of the cashless debit card trial. 


I also thank the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee for its report on the bill and its recommendation that the bill be passed. 


I note the dissenting reports from the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Greens which recommended that the Senate not pass the bill. However, the government considers that amendments introduced by this bill are essential to sustaining positive impacts in the existing cashless debit card communities and expanding these results to new regions.


Welfare payments are provided to people in need to help with essential living costs, in particular food, clothing, shelter, and transportation. The community expectation is these payments will not be spent on harmful goods such as alcohol, gambling and drugs. 


Alcohol is a contributing factor to an estimated 65 per cent of all domestic violence incidents and 47 per cent of child abuse cases in some jurisdictions. Alcohol related harm and illicit drug use costs the Australian economy over $22 billion each year.


The cashless debit card aims to reduce the devastating effects of alcohol, drug and gambling abuse. The card operates like an ordinary debit card, with the primary difference being that it does not work at liquor stores or gambling houses and cash cannot be withdrawn from it. Consequently, illicit products cannot be purchased with it. 


The card has been in operation for almost two years in Ceduna, South Australia and Kununurra and Wyndham in the East Kimberley, Western Australia. In each of these communities, 80 per cent of an individual's welfare payments are placed into a separate account which is only accessible using their cashless debit card. The remaining 20 per cent is placed into their ordinary savings account. 


Consultations with community leaders led to independent community panels being implemented, as a tool to encourage people to uphold social norms. The panels were established as a mechanism that allows individuals to apply to have access to a higher portion of unrestricted funds.


The community-wide impacts of the use of harmful goods mean that the CDC program is most effective when most people in a community who receive a welfare payment participate in the program. Where CDC participation would not be appropriate, it is not applied. For instance, people do not participate in the program if they have payment nominees, they are a student outside trial areas, they receive the age pension or a veteran's payment, or CDC participation would seriously risk their mental, physical or emotional wellbeing. 


To complement the roll out of the cashless debit card, the government committed an additional $1 million in Ceduna and $1.6 million in the East Kimberley in new funding for support services in the first 12 months to ensure vulnerable people were supported. The government has since committed to match the first-year funding envelope for additional support services in a second-year package. 


Support packages were designed in consultation with communities and aim to complement and enhance existing services and provide a comprehensive response to address addiction, help people reduce their dependence on alcohol or drugs and have better financial management practices. 


The results of the trials are encouraging. There is less public drunkenness, less gambling, fewer alcohol related hospital admissions, and people are engaging with the support services and working to improve their lives.


While the card is not a 'silver bullet' to overcome all community issues, it has led to improvements in the lives of individuals, families and children in the two communities of Ceduna and the East Kimberley.


Since this bill was introduced, the government released the independent final cashless debit card trial evaluation report that assessed the impact of the introduction of the cashless debit card in Ceduna and East Kimberley. 


I am pleased to report the independent evaluation found that the cashless debit card has been effective in reducing alcohol consumption and gambling in both trial sites and is also suggestive of a reduction in the use of illegal drugs.


Across the two trial sites, 41 per cent of participants surveyed who drank before the trial started reported they drank less frequently.


Additionally, 37 per cent of participants who reported engaging in binge drinking before the trial, said they were doing this less frequently.


In the East Kimberley specifically, of participants reporting that they drank alcohol before the trial commenced, 43 per cent reported drinking less at wave 2. 


Across the two sites, 48 per cent of people reported gambling less often. From April 2016 to March 2017, poker machine revenue in the Ceduna area was 12 per cent lower than in the same 12-month period before the trial started in March 2016.


This is the equivalent of almost $550,000 less spent on poker machines in the 12-month trial. 


The government is heartened by the initial positive findings. The extension of the card in these communities will focus on sustaining these positive outcomes in the longer term. 


Building on these research findings, the government has announced two new expansion sites, the Goldfields region in Western Australia and the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay Region in Queensland in September 2017. Expansion to these communities will help test the card and the technology that supports it in more diverse communities and settings.


Roll out into these communities will also include $1 million in funding for wrap-around support services in each site to complement the operation of the cashless debit card and ensure vulnerable people are adequately supported. 


The evaluation also found that there are areas that we can improve on—and as we roll out the CDC in the Goldfields and Bundaberg and Hervey bay region we will take these learnings into account.


The bill itself amends the existing legislation to enable the cashless debit card to operate in further locations. It removes section 124PF of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999, which limits the number of locations, participants and end date of the cashless debit card trial.


Removing this section will support the extension of arrangements in current sites, and enable the expansion of the cashless debit card.


Under the legislation, the locations, cohorts covered and timing of the operation of the cashless debit card will still be determined by a disallowable instrument. These instruments can also specify other parameters, including sunset dates and participant criteria. 


What this means is that the government can work with individual communities to co-design the particular parameters, and tailor the program to suit that particular community's needs. It also ensures that the parliament itself retains the right to consider each proposed new cashless debit card site on a case-by-case basis.


It is important to point out that the cashless debit card will only be implemented in communities that support it. Support for the CDC is measured through extensive consultation with interested communities. So far consultation has covered all relevant stakeholder groups, including potential program participants.


Consultation is conducted on an ongoing basis in both Ceduna and East Kimberley, and extensive consultation was undertaken prior to announcing the expansion sites. Consultation is ongoing in both expansion sites in preparation for implementation. 


The cashless debit card is a world first in how it operates. The trials have been completed, an evaluation has been conducted, and it has been shown to work and now there is an opportunity to expand the cashless debit card to new locations. This bill will allow this to occur.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,4,1
"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2018-02-07,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (11:19):  The matter of the cashless debit card is a complex one. Labor has consulted many communities and many stakeholders from around the country. We have received a wide diversity of opinions from both communities and individuals within those communities. We've heard from some communities and individuals who strongly oppose the cashless debit card and we've also heard from some communities and some individuals who support it. Labor understands that there are areas where there is a community that wishes to try something new to address drug and alcohol abuse, disadvantage and social dysfunction, but we also understand that not all communities want this.


Labor supports genuine community-driven initiatives to tackle drug and alcohol abuse. To be very clear, Labor does not support a national rollout of the cashless debit card. We know that the vast majority of income support recipients are more than capable of managing their own finances. Labor has consistently said that we will talk to individual communities and make decisions on a location-by-location basis. They are the principles that have guided Labor in determining our position on this issue.


The government announced in the 2017 budget that it will it establish trials of cashless debit cards in two further locations from 1 September 2017. This bill enables this by repealing one section of the Social Security (Administration) Act. The section repealed by this bill—section 124PF—contains the existing limitations on the cashless debit card trial, which require that: the trial ends on 30 June 2018; the limitation for trials to occur in up to three discreet trial areas; and that the trial areas include no more than 10,000 participants in total. These limitations mean that currently only one further trial site could be established and that all trials would need to end by 30 June 2018. The bill provides the frameworks for additional trials to be implemented but does not enable any specific trials. Specific trial sites need to be established by a legislative instrument.


Last year the government announced that it wants to establish trials in the Goldfields in Western Australia and Bundaberg-Hervey Bay in Queensland. Labor referred this bill to a Senate inquiry to allow for proper scrutiny of the changes and to allow for further consultation with the communities in existing and newly announced trial sites. From continued consultation with communities in the Bundaberg and Goldfields regions and the evidence presented to the Senate inquiry, it has become clear that there has been insufficient consultation with these communities and that there is no clear framework to establish whether they consent to trials being established in their areas. Labor believes that there is insufficient evidence at this stage to justify an expansion of the cashless debit cards to further sites.


The Senate inquiry heard that the ORIMA evaluations of the trial are unreliable and that no empirical judgements can be made on the basis of the information collected. Janet Hunt, Deputy Director of the Centre for Aboriginal Economic Policy Research at the Australian National University, said:


… the evaluation showed that the government's cashless card trials had not actually improved safety and violence despite that being one of the trial's objectives.


Hunt's research paper on the evaluation is critical of the methodology used in the ORIMA evaluation. She points out:


People interviewed for the evaluation reported that they drank less than before the trial began. However, such recall over a year is not likely to be very reliable.


Hunt also makes the valid point that given that people had to give their identification to the interviewer, they may have said exactly what they thought the interviewer wanted to hear and certainly would not have incriminated themselves. This is particularly true of the Aboriginal population, who, for historical reasons, are likely to view authority figures with suspicion.


The previous Minister for Human Services, Alan Tudge, described the cashless debit card trials as 'a huge success', and the Prime Minister himself has said the card has led to:


… a massive reduction in alcohol abuse, in drug abuse, in domestic violence, in violence generally.


But Janet Hunt made clear that this wasn't the case, stating clearly:


Someone needs to tell them that the report does not say that.


The ORIMA report shows that, when participants were asked about the impact of the trial on their children's lives, only 17 per cent reported feeling their lives were better as a result. In fact, a bigger group of parents, around 24 per cent, felt their children's lives were actually worse. 


So Labor does not believe that the government can justify the further rollout of this card on what is clearly a flawed evaluation. In addition to the poor quality of the evaluation, we believe that more time is needed before you could draw solid conclusions about the success of the existing trials in Ceduna and the East Kimberley. The evaluation and our own consultations with the communities have showed mixed results, with some groups in Ceduna and the East Kimberley maintaining support for the trials while others are critical of their impacts. 


Labor's Jenny Macklin and Linda Burney visited the East Kimberley in April last year to conduct three days of consultations with locals and, in September last year, Jenny Macklin also spent a number of days talking with people on the ground in Ceduna and the surrounding communities. As I said, the feedback we received was mixed. Some people were supportive of the card. They said that the situation was so dire that they were willing to try anything they thought might make a difference. Many of these people supported the cashless card not out of hope but out of despair. Other people made clear that they thought the cashless card was disempowering and that it didn't address the underlying cause of disadvantage and social dysfunction. 


St John Ambulance in Kununurra said that the call-outs for alcohol related violence had gone down since the card was introduced; however, at the women's refuge in Kununurra they did not have a positive view of the card. They told Ms Burney and Ms Macklin that life had gotten harder with the card, that there was more violence and more crime as cash became scarce. Other people indicated that if people really wanted to abuse alcohol or drugs they could find a way around the cashless card, typically through the sly-grog trade. Others expressed serious concern that there was no pathway for people to get off the cashless card even if they demonstrated that they could manage their money wisely. 


In Ceduna, the local mayor, Allan Suter, is a strong supporter of the card, as is Corey McLennan from the Koonibba Aboriginal corporation. However, Ceduna Koonibba Aboriginal Health Service Aboriginal Corporation is opposed to the cashless card. Others expressed disappointment that the cashless card hadn't helped local Aboriginal people get into work. So the feedback on the ground in these communities was mixed. 


The government is now proposing to roll out the cashless debit card in the Goldfields region of Western Australia, which includes Kalgoorlie-Boulder, Laverton, Leonora and Coolgardie. It has become clear to Labor that there was insufficient consultation with the communities in the Goldfields region of Western Australia. Witnesses at the Kalgoorlie Senate hearing, in particular, expressed serious dissatisfaction with the consultation process that was undertaken prior to the announcement of the Goldfields trial site, describing it as very lacklustre. The participants in the process often felt disempowered by the discussions. A local councillor, Linden Brownley, said:


I was involved in the initial discussion. However, I felt as though my presence at that meeting was irrelevant due to the fact that I work full time and run my own business. My comment was to actually engage the people of our community, not just Aboriginal but our community as a whole, to inform them of their intentions and what the cashless card is all about.


The other site where the government wants to roll out the cashless debit card is Bundaberg and Hervey Bay and would also include Howard and Childers. Unlike the other three sites, the government is proposing that this rollout of the card will be targeted at the specific age cohort of people aged 35 years and under who receive Newstart, youth allowance, parenting payment or parenting payment partnered. It does not include disability support pensioners.


Under the government's proposal about 6,700 people in total would receive the card in Bundaberg and Hervey Bay. We don't think there is sufficient community support for the rollout of the card in this area. Fraser Coast Deputy Mayor George Seymour has indicated that he does not support the rollout of the card in Bundaberg and Hervey Bay. He indicated that what people need is jobs, not policies that humiliate and divide people in the community. In their submission to the Senate inquiry, the Say No to the Cashless Welfare Card Australia Hinkler group stated:


The human aspect of what will happen to people when they have their individual choices removed, their self control over their lives and how they manage their incomes and their bills. Rather than building a cohesive inclusive society, this card will being using exclusion …


Key groups from the Bundaberg region also felt ignored by the government's consultation process. Representatives from the Gidarjil Development Corporation explained:


Gidarjil is probably considered the largest Indigenous organisation in Bundaberg, and there hasn't been any approach from the federal minister in regard to this or in fact anything.


What an indictment of this government.


The cost of the rollout of the cashless debit card is also an important consideration in this debate. Given the significant cost of the trials—an accrued cost of around $25.5 million, or around $12,000 per participant—we must be sure that the cashless card can deliver its stated objectives. The government gave around $1.6 million to ORIMA Research to provide a frankly substandard evaluation. It is quite extraordinary that we are debating this bill today without any indication from the government about how much it will cost taxpayers to roll out the card at the two new proposed sites in the Goldfields and Bundaberg-Hervey Bay. There has been no indication about how much this will cost taxpayers. It really is quite extraordinary. The minister still won't reveal how much it will cost taxpayers to expand the rollout of the card to the Goldfields and Bundaberg-Hervey Bay. It's just not good enough.


Labor believes that there still exists sufficient community support for a continuation of the trials in Ceduna and the East Kimberley. We supported the original trials at these locations in 2015; we therefore support the continuation of the trial in Ceduna and the East Kimberley. As it currently stands, the legislated end date for the trials is 30 June 2018. Labor will move to amend the bill to extend the end date for trials to 30 June 2019 so that a proper evaluation can take place. Labor knows that entrenched social issues cannot and will not be solved by income management alone. That's why we continue to insist that the government provide additional community supports for participating communities. We are calling on the government to support our amendment that these critical wraparound services be specified to make clear what was agreed as part of the trials and to ensure that these services are delivered. We also want to make sure that existing trial participants understand the rules around how they can have their proportion of income support payments on the card altered or can exit the trial. Labor will move amendments to ensure these rules are specified.


Labor will also move an amendment to ensure that no new trial sites can be introduced, by changing the allowance of three discrete trial sites to the existing two. In the future, Labor will only consider the introduction of a new trial site if the government can show that they have an agreed formal consultation process with the community as well as an agreed definition of consent and where there is sufficient evidence on a proposed model to warrant expansion.


I want to sum up by saying this: I believe that the government proposes the cashless debit card not because it genuinely is interested in improving the lives of our most vulnerable citizens, but because it seeks to spread a narrative that many people who rely on our social security system can't be trusted—that our most vulnerable Australians cannot be trusted with their own spending needs. It's the old conservative narrative about the undeserving poor.


I urge the government and the members of the crossbench, in particular, to give serious consideration to the amendments that Labor proposes for this bill. We aren't saying that there doesn't need to be government action in a very meaningful way in many of these communities. We are not for a moment saying there aren't chronic social problems in these communities. But we believe there should be genuine community-driven initiatives to tackle chronic alcohol abuse. We know that employment is important to changing the life choices and chances for many people who are currently welfare dependent. But the notion that a cashless debit card is some sort of silver bullet that is going to fix all these social ills is completely false. Labor has thought about this issue very deeply. We have consulted and discussed on this issue widely. It's not a position that we have come to quickly. I believe we have come to a position that is reasoned and balanced.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-02-07,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (11:36):  I rise today to speak on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017. The Australian Greens oppose this bill, which will remove the current limitations for the scheme of three trial sites and 10,000 participants as well as allow the scheme to continue past 30 June 2018. It does this by removing section 124PF of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999. The Greens have opposed the cashless welfare card from the start, the same as we have opposed income management now for 10½ years. I can guarantee this place that we will continue to oppose income management. We will continue to campaign on this until income management is not used as a policy mechanism in this country. While I very strongly welcome the ALP's opposition to elements of this particular bill and I also welcome the NXT's opposition to this bill, I do have deep concerns that you think it's okay to allow the cashless welfare card to continue in the existing trial sites. In the separate debate that will happen this afternoon, I urge you to support my disallowance to end this farce of a policy.


If this bill passes, all that will be required for a future trial site to be established—and 'trial' is a misnomer—is the drafting and registering of a legislative instrument. There will be no need for it to be debated by the parliament prior to enactment. The government will be able to roll out the cashless debit card—I frequently call it the welfare card, so I'll use that too—far and wide, and this bill enables them to do it if they want to. This is particularly the case given the bill before us does not contain safeguards on how long trials can run for, how many participants they can include or any requirement to consult with the communities of future trial sites. There is also no way in which people can transition off the card now or in the future. The Greens have opposed this cashless welfare card since its inception. It's a continuation of compulsory income management, no matter how the government wants to disguise it and play with words.


We submitted a dissenting report to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Debit Card Trial) Bill 2015 expressing deep concerns regarding compulsory income management and recommending that that bill not be passed. The evaluations of the two existing trial sites, in the East Kimberley and Ceduna, have reinforced these concerns. The ORIMA reports, both the interim and final, are not reliable sources of evidence. These so-called independent evaluations have been widely criticised by numerous social scientists and academics for not adhering to academic standards, having major flaws in methodology and the way in which it was reported and relying on piecemeal and anecdotal evidence.


There are submissions and evidence to the bill's inquiry from social scientists and academics who outline the major flaws with the evaluation methodology and reporting, noting myriad concerns with the data presented and researched. The key concerns with regard to the way the research was conducted were the unreliability of self-reporting on behaviours, social desirability and recall bias problems, not to mention the fact that people were paid to be involved. The East Kimberley and Ceduna data weighting finding was not proportionate to the populations of income support recipients in the trial areas, meaning improvements were overstated at the very best. There was a lack of adequate baseline data on alcohol, drug use and gambling in trial areas prior to trial commencement to compare to so-called improvements. There was a lack of differentiation between large numbers of people who reported not drinking at all. The evaluation reports did not make clear that additional services were provided to help people deal with the addictive behaviours or when those were up and running, but it seems that what there were came late in the trial period and, as I said, there was payment for involvement in the assessment process.


Dr Elise Klein, who has just completed a 13-month research project on the cashless debit card in the East Kimberley, expressed to the inquiry deep concern with regard to the reports which are being used to justify these trials as a success. To the inquiry she said:


My concern as a researcher is how that has been allowed to be evidence and used as a proof of concept.


…   …   …


All these other important issues around community disempowerment, around violence, around at what cost—it reports all these positive things that happen, but completely underplays the really large numbers of people reporting issues and hardships with the card too. It gives a very distorted idea of what the card is or is not doing. I do believe there needs to be a review of how that has been allowed into the public sphere and to be labelled by politicians as proof of concept. As a researcher and as an academic, I think it's a real problem the way that evidence has been used in this process to continue pushing the trial forward when there are some severe issues around what that research did or did not do.


In her very recent working paper with the former principal solicitor for the Kimberley Community Legal Services, 'The cashless debit card trial in the East Kimberley', the result of 13 months of research, the abstract says:


We find not only that the trial was chaotic, but that its logic is deeply flawed, and disconnected from the relational poverty experienced by people receiving state benefits. We also find that the card has become a symbol of government control and regulation in the study site.


Compulsory income management is a failed measure. It's been proven to be an ineffective policy that disempowers and harms those that need help the most. One of the most extensive evaluations of income management is Evaluation of new income management in the Northern Territory, commissioned by the Department of Social Services. The report was issued by experts from the Social Policy Research Centre at the University of New South Wales, the Australian National University and the Australian Institute of Family Studies over several years. One of the key findings of the final report was:


The evaluation could not find any substantive evidence of the program having significant changes relative to its key policy objectives, including changing people's behaviours … The evaluation data does not provide evidence of income management having improved the outcomes that it was intending to have an impact upon. Indeed, rather than promoting independence and the building of skills and capabilities, New Income Management in the Northern Territory appears to have encouraged increasing dependence upon the welfare system, and the tools which were envisaged as providing them with the skills to manage have rather become instruments which relieve them of the burden of management.


It failed, and here is the government trying to increase the expansion of income management when the tool does not work.


Compulsory income management impacts negatively on individuals and the community and imposes significant costs on government. Evidence provided through submissions and at the hearing of the inquiry on this bill show the fundamental and deep flaws in this approach. In its submission to the inquiry the Australian Council of Social Service said:


CDC costs approximately $10,000 per person covered by the trial over a 12-month period. The actual cost of the program over the forward estimates is unknown as this information is commercial-in-confidence.


To put this expenditure into perspective, the individual cost of CDC is almost as much as the single rate of Newstart Allowance, which is $14,000 per annum.


How farcical! How farcical that the government is subjecting people to this card and it costs almost as much as their Newstart allowance in the first place, which is inadequate and which we know is below the poverty line.


Legitimate questions have been raised about the opportunity cost of the CDC, particularly when the trial sites have serious problems such as poverty, lack of employment opportunities, unaffordable housing and poor access to health services. The expenditure on the CDC might have far greater impact if it were directed to services and programs developed and led by the communities.


There are also clear flaws in how the government consulted with communities before, during and after they imposed this card. The inquiry into this bill, as well as the inquiry into the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Debit Card Trial) Bill 2015, highlighted significant gaps in the consultation process. It is also clear that the government have focused their consultation on some Aboriginal peak organisations and some individual members of Aboriginal communities but have not consulted broadly with community members, particularly those who are actually on income support and who will be directly affected by this legislation. This shows a fundamental lack of respect for people receiving income support.


Nor have the government consulted on this current bill. The Law Council of Australia told the inquiry that where consultation is also undertaken with local government and those responsible for law enforcement, that is inadequate. The Australian Human Rights Commission was of the view that it is not free, prior and informed consent if people affected are not consulted. Ms Hatfield, from Catholic Social Services, who spent time in both Ceduna and the East Kimberley, told the inquiry:


Many of the people that I spoke to felt that the government had consulted with a number of key leaders but hadn't consulted more broadly with the community, and that those key leaders didn't represent them and couldn't speak for them. So they felt this card had been imposed on them. It was suggested that if the consultation had been more inclusive and took into account people that were directly affected by the changes, it could have been done better and there would have been more a sense that the card was not imposed on people. Most of the people that I spoke to said that the card had just made their lives more difficult, and they were very frustrated that they didn't have an opportunity to be involved in the consultation beforehand.


The community consultation process across both trial sites and the intended trial sites has been opaque, fractured and secretive and is not a reliable indicator of community sentiment.


We are still concerned about the operation of the cashless debit card and its impact on participants. In fact, during the Senate inquiry, when I asked the Mayor of Ceduna if, after the trial had started, they had gone back to ask participants what they thought about it, I was told no, they hadn't—in fact, we had some cross words with each other about it.


During the bill's inquiry there have been many issues raised by people on the card, service providers in the community and business owners. Many people in the current trial sites face barriers in using the card to purchase necessities and to pay their bills. The following is a list of some of the scenarios raised during the inquiry that people subjected to the card have experienced: they are unable to buy second-hand goods; the card doesn't work at the supermarket, chemist or post office—and I have subsequently heard there are so many times when the card gets rejected, and that's from speaking directly to people who have to live on the white card—there are no joint accounts; there are difficulties for people with disability, carers and couples; and there are no direct debits.


Something that is very interesting on the card is that you can't use the card for BPAY—in other words, you can't use it to control your own finances. You have to use it as a credit card. You have to supply your credit card number. That means the people wanting to take your money are the people that are in charge of your bank account—in other words, it lessens your ability to manage your funds. There's no privacy and there is the feeling of being stigmatised, resulting in poor mental health outcomes.


I've heard directly from participants who, where their card hadn't worked, were asked to stand aside in a supermarket because the person running the till had to serve other customers, which, again, is stigmatising them. You might as well put a card on their head that says: 'I'm on the Indue card; I'm on the white card'. This flies in the face of what one of the architects of this whole debacle, Mr Forrest, said, when he said in the previous inquiry, 'There'll be no difference with this card; it will be just like any other credit card or bank card.' Well, I'm sorry; I said at the time that that wasn't true, and it simply is not true. Everybody in these communities knows what the white card is and who's on it as soon as you pull it out.


People on the card have also experienced restrictions from many dining venues and been unable to purchase from mixed merchants. This is particularly so, for example, if you go out to a restaurant. Again, I heard direct evidence from participants of their not being able to use their card when they go out for dinner—if the place doesn't have separate EFTPOS facilities, which many don't—and that they have not been able to pay their bill and have had to borrow funds. It's simply outrageous. They also experience isolation from their communities because they can't participate in activities where cash is required or at venues where alcohol is served. Landlords in some communities only accept cash as payment for rent. There are difficulties for individuals to visit country without access to cash. The card is making money management harder. If you have one of the early cards that doesn't have EFTPOS written on it, you can't use EFTPOS; if you have a later card with EFTPOS on it, you can. Have the government reissued the card so that everybody can have a card with EFTPOS? No, they haven't. They haven't even told those people that they can get one with EFTPOS on it, which is, again, making life hard for people.


During the inquiry the committee also heard evidence of how people are circumventing the system to get the cash they need—and I've talked about that before. There's also increased 'humbugging'. There were many reports from stakeholders that people have left communities to try and get away from the card. A number of us heard about the outrageous situation where women were reported to be selling their bodies for sex in order to get cash; reports of significant increase in family violence because of the increase in poverty and pressure on the household; deliberate overcharging for services in order to get cash back; people gambling to be able to afford alcohol sold on the black market; paying for other people's shopping with the card and receiving cash in exchange. Again, I've heard that directly from people who have been doing that. 


We are also deeply concerned that this bill limits human rights, as outlined in many submissions to the inquiry. The circumstances and trial sites are not so extreme or exceptional as to warrant an approach that infringes on the human rights of income support recipients. In the Australian Human Rights Commission's submission to the inquiry, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner said:


The Commission considers that the measures are not proportionate to the benefits sought by the Bill because their purpose could be achieved through other, less restrictive means …


…   …   …


… the Commission does not agree with the assessment that the Bill or existing cashless debit card measures are compatible with human rights standards.


The parliament's own Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, in Human rights scrutiny report: report 9 of 2017, made some comments about it as well:


In assessing whether a measure is proportionate, relevant factors to consider include whether the measure provides sufficient flexibility to treat different cases differently or whether it imposes a blanket policy without regard to the circumstances of individual cases.


As the cashless debit card trial applies to anyone residing in locations where the trial operates who is receiving a social security payment specified under the scheme, there are serious doubts as to whether the measures are the least rights restrictive way to achieve the stated objectives.


…   …   …


The compulsory nature of the cashless debit card trial also raises questions as to the proportionality of the measures.


A number of submissions to the inquiry noted the trial sites' disproportionate impact on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, and, in the Human Rights Commission's submission, the social justice commissioner noted:


As at September 2016, 75% of trial participants in Ceduna and 82% of trial participants in the East Kimberley were Indigenous.


The Kimberley Land Council told the inquiry:


While we acknowledge the widespread negative impacts of alcohol and drugs in the Australian community, it is evident that it is Aboriginal people and communities who are most often penalised by punitive, experimental and top-down policies regarding an issue that impacts the whole of society.


The government has taken what the KLC would characterise as a ‘sledgehammer’ approach, which does little to address the root cause of the issues faced by Aboriginal people, particularly those in the East Kimberley.


The KLC is further concerned that for those people who need assistance to overcome alcohol and drug dependence, the CDC has very little proven ability to improve lives or create meaningful change.


That came through even in the flawed ORIMA evaluation.


The Australian Greens oppose compulsory income management. It is not the way to address these fundamental issues. It undermines people's ability to manage their money, it underlies Aboriginal disadvantage and it furthers Aboriginal disadvantage. The approach the government is taking to address Aboriginal disadvantage and issues around addiction is flawed. We need a health-based approach to the addiction matters that the government claims this card is there to address. This is a flawed policy. Compulsory income management is a flawed policy. I urge this chamber to vote no on this legislation.

"Brockman, Sen Slade",LP,2018-02-07,"



Senator BROCKMAN
 (Western Australia) (11:56):  I rise to speak on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017. I'm going to begin today with Kalgoorlie, one of the proposed trial sites in my home state of Western Australia, and talk a little bit about the reason Kalgoorlie was selected and the origins of Kalgoorlie and the Goldfields coming up as a place where the cashless debit card may be something that the community would like. I am going to quote my good friend the member for O'Connor, Rick Wilson, in his speech on this bill in the House of Representatives. I think it gives a real insight into where it came from. The member for O'Connor said:


Today, I stand here to give voice to my community and the leaders who have so bravely stood up and fought for the introduction of this card. They are people like Leonora Indigenous leader Nana Gaye Harris, who started the ball rolling when she first sought me out in Leonora in late 2015; people like Laverton Indigenous elders Bruce Smith and Janice Scott, who moved an entire room to tears with their powerful account of children living on the streets of Laverton, abandoned by parents on the grog; and people like Coolgardie community leader Betty Logan and her niece, Amanda Bennell, who in the presence of the Prime Minister challenged naysayers to look into the eyes of a child suffering the effects of fetal alcohol syndrome and not feel compassion. I give voice to people like Leonora police officer in charge Isaac Rinaudo, who has described children as young as five years of age breaking into houses just to steal food. And I give voices to civic leaders like Laverton's Patrick Hill; Leonora's Jim Epis and Peter Craig; Jill Dwyer and Ian Tucker from the Shire of Menzies; Mal Cullen and Betty Logan from the Coolgardie shire; and Mayor John Bowler of the City of Kalgoorlie-Boulder. They are fighting for what's best for the communities …


This is a community led endeavour. The people of the Goldfields widely want to see this trial go ahead. This is not something that the member for O'Connor, Rick Wilson, or the government plucked out of the air. This was something that was originally brought to Rick Wilson's attention by an Indigenous leader as something that was worth a try. This is a trial. Yes, there are currently two trial sites underway. This is two more trial sites, one in the Goldfields and one in Queensland in Hervey Bay-Bundaberg. We must remember that this is a trial.


The idea that there has not been consultation in this community is quite frankly a nonsense. The former minister has visited Kalgoorlie on at least four occasions. The member for O'Connor, Rick Wilson, has done literally hundreds of community consultations—direct meetings, face-to-faces with individuals, community groups, Indigenous leaders, Indigenous community groups, people on disability support pensions. This has been extraordinarily widely canvassed. I know this from my direct experience in Kalgoorlie. I've been lucky enough to have been to Kalgoorlie three times in the last four months since I've been a senator, and every time I was there every single person I spoke to, be they Indigenous, from the business community or the non-Indigenous community, said, 'It's worth a try—it's worth a try to do something different to try and break the cycle of welfare dependency, drug use and alcohol abuse that exists up there.' 


I want to say from the start that the trial in Kalgoorlie is not targeted at Indigenous people. The welfare recipients in the Goldfields region are about 50-50, Indigenous to non-Indigenous. Obviously, part of the thinking behind the trial site in Queensland in the Bundaberg-Hervey Bay region is that it is a largely non-Indigenous cohort of people who will be under the trial.


This is a government that wants to try something new in a space that has been for an extraordinarily long period of time a wasteland of good policy. It's very difficult to see what gains we have made in this area over the last 30 years. It is time to try something different, and those communities are crying out for a new approach, a new way of thinking. Again, this is not a nationwide rollout; this is a trial currently in two areas, looking to expand into another two areas and it's a trial that the government is committed to. It's committed to it because we're trying to reduce the social harm caused by welfare-fuelled alcohol abuse, drug abuse and problem gambling in areas where there are high levels of welfare dependency.


This bill provides the underpinning legislative authority to enable the expansion of the cashless debit card into these new regions like the Goldfields. The bill will allow the legislative authority to enable the Goldfields region to be the third and, to date, the largest site for the cashless debit card. Welfare payments are provided to people in need to help with essential living costs such as food, clothing, shelter, transportation. From this, and in the longer term, we want to see communities that are safer. We want to see people using welfare to look after themselves, look after their families and get into a position where they can actually get off welfare, which is obviously much harder if you have a gambling, drug or alcohol problem. Welfare should be a safety net for those who need it, not a means of facilitating serious damage to health and serious damage to those communities. 


Alcohol is a contributing factor to an estimated 65 per cent of all domestic violence incidents and 47 per cent of child abuse cases in some areas. Alcohol related harm and illicit drug use costs the Australian economy $22 billion a year. There was an independent report into the trial site—and, obviously, that has been criticised by some parties and we have heard a significant number of those criticisms from Senator Siewert. But this evaluation and all evaluations have to be read in the context of what they are. It found that 48 per cent of drug takers were using fewer drugs—and, yes, this is self-reporting and there are problems with that, but I'm quite sure if I looked back over the Hansard transcripts, I would find people all around this chamber quoting self-reported statistics. It found that 41 per cent of drinkers were drinking less; and 48 per cent of gamblers were gambling less. Nobody thinks that this is a silver bullet, but it may be a move in the right direction and it is certainly something that is worth trying. 


As I said, I've been to Kalgoorlie three times in the last few months. This issue was raised with me by a number of people off their own bat but, obviously, in my role as Chair of the Community Affairs Legislation Committee, I raised it with pretty much everyone I met. As I've said, the reaction was overwhelmingly positive. Rick Wilson, the member for O'Connor, has done extensive consultations in his community to gauge success and has been running a petition as part of that process. Over 1,200 people in the Goldfields have signed the petition in support of the cashless debit card. There is an online petition that is still collecting signatures, so that number is growing all the time.


There has been a postal survey to 18,000 Goldfields households. They are still coming back. There have been hundreds of responses—currently running at 85 per cent in favour. The idea that the Goldfields community in particular does not support this trial is not borne out by the facts.


We need to deliver hope to the people in these communities. We need a chance; we need something to break the cycle of antisocial behaviour. We've got to remember that these funds are provided by the taxpayers of Australia—welfare recipients receive their money from the taxpayers of Australia—and the taxpayers of Australia deserve to know that we are trying something to try to break the cycle of abuse, of welfare dependency, of alcohol abuse, of drug abuse, of gambling addiction and, as I said, of welfare dependency.


As Chair of the Community Affairs Legislation Committee, I did hear, and we have heard, from a number of community leaders who did stand up and voice their support for the introduction of this card. I read submissions and heard witness accounts from community members and I think that we need to recognise that we do have large numbers of people who do strongly support the trial. From the Community Affairs Committee hearing on 12 October last year, for example, the mayor of Kalgoorlie-Boulder, John Bowler, said:


Locals who live here complain to me about what's happening. They want a solution. I've been almost pulling my hair out—the little bit of hair I've got—asking: what is a solution? Then I heard about the cashless debit card, took an interest in it and thought this may be a way forward. A former friend of mine went through Ceduna last year and talked to the deputy mayor there, who was telling him how good it was and how Ceduna was so much better. So he got his number, and I rang the deputy mayor up—this was probably going back earlier this year or late last year—and spoke to the deputy mayor. He told me that court appearances had gone down by 38 per cent—you've seen the figures—hospital admissions were down by something similar, and that, generally, people in Ceduna thought life there had improved dramatically since the introduction of the trial.


He went on:


I then drove to Ceduna to experience it firsthand and make my own observations. I spoke to people. I was hoping to speak to the mayor this time—I heard him on ABC South Australian radio about the card—but he was out of town. So, once again, I spoke to the deputy mayor, I spoke to retailers in the town and townspeople and got the same picture: they were glad that it had been introduced. They said there were some complaints, but even some who initially had been opposed to the card had really come around to say that life generally was better, particularly for those living on the streets.


The mayor went on to say:


So I say this: the introduction of this card is a possible step in the right direction for not just my townspeople but these visitors and the lives they lead.


We also heard from Mr Patrick Hill, President of the Shire of Laverton. He said:


Everyone in town—the police, the hospital, the school, the Laverton Crisis Centre, the ambulance, the fire brigade, the resident group, the shire—has done everything possible to try and stem this abuse and the effects that alcohol, drugs and gambling have on our towns and the availability of cash. Council has formally adopted and supports the cashless welfare card because we see this as an opportunity to try and do something. We have had up to 50 agencies come into Laverton to try and address these social issues, and we do have our Laverton inter-agency group meetings to come up with solutions to try and stem this violence.


Again, Mr Hill went on talk about why the cashless debit card provided hope for their community, hope for their town and hope for an opportunity for those who are suffering under this cycle of welfare dependency, drug abuse and gambling abuse.


Mr Hill went on:


This will at least give us breathing space to do something and sit back and analyse where things can be done better and what we can do better as a community. We see it every single day. We have done everything we can as a community to try and solve some of these issues that we've got.


I invite any of you to come to Laverton over Christmas or when we have funerals so you can see it for yourself and understand the complex issues we have here. We know that the cashless card is not going to fix everything, but at least it will give us a chance to fix and address some of these really major issues we have in our communities, which a lot of people do not understand and don't see on a day-to-day basis as we do.


I'll just go on, again from that same hearing at the community affairs committee. Mr Taylor, who appeared before the committee in a private capacity, gave a very powerful testimony.


He said:


I'm here today to, hopefully, give you some insight from a father who lost his child, a young adult—my son…My son came into contact with social services as a teenager. His life was marred by bouts of alcohol and other drug abuse, through his teenage years into his young manhood. He was 27 when he took his life. This card might have helped …


And Mrs Holman, a business owner in Kalgoorlie, revealed the desperation in the community and the hopes for the CDC—the cashless debit card. She said:


I think they are and, without a lie, every customer that has come into my shop or person I've spoken to, which is quite a lot of people in the community, are welcoming the cashless card. You've got to remember that we are desperate. The cashless card offers us a little bit of light, a little bit of hope, that things might improve. We just want something that helps and stops the alcoholism. Everyone's been celebrating—'We can't wait for it. I hope things get better.' We don't know if it's going to work. No-one does, and everyone who says it's not doesn't know either. We just want to give it a go. We want something—we need something …


This was my experience in Kalgoorlie, from Indigenous to non-Indigenous people I interacted with personally while on the ground, outside the public forum of the committee. Everyone was supportive—from taxi drivers to workers in shops to people I was chatting to in the pub. Obviously, in the committee hearings there were alternative views. In particular, I remember vividly the evidence from the Kalgoorlie Aboriginal Residents Group, who said that, within their organisation, there was a diversity of views: there were those who support it and those who oppose. And that's completely understandable when you have a significant change to the welfare system such as this. It is significant but it is a trial. It is trying something new in a space where we have an extraordinary amount of failure.


Again, if this card can be a tool to help reduce the amount of alcohol- and drug-related domestic and other violence, if it helps channel welfare dollars to where they're best spent, if it makes sure that kids have a meal in their bag when they head to school or if it makes sure the bills are paid on time then that is a way of breaking a cycle of welfare dependency and helping these communities for whom there is a level of desperation. We do have two trials going like this in different regions. Let's keep trying to solve some of these intractable problems. Let's not give up.


In the couple of minutes remaining to me, I want to quickly address something Senator Siewert brought up—the $10,000-per-person cost. The previous minister, in a speech, indicated that that cost reflected some initial set-up costs. That is falling. It's estimated that the per-person cost in Kalgoorlie would be something more like $1,000 and, as the trials expand, that cost will continue to come down. This is an example of the card. We're not supposed to use props in here, but it looks identical to a credit card. It's not white; it's a grey colour.


The government appreciates the support from the Labor Party in continuing Ceduna and East Kimberley, but we would like them to reconsider their position on the other trial sites. It is important that we keep rolling this program out into different communities, because communities are different. Communities have different balances of certain groups, different needs and different employment drivers. There's a wonderful opportunity in the Goldfields at the moment because there are jobs in the community. The mining industry has picked up again. I was there as recently as 10 days ago and was told by a range of community leaders that there are currently a thousand unfilled jobs in Kalgoorlie. There is an opportunity at the moment to really try and break this cycle of welfare dependency, to get people spending their money more wisely and get people out of a cycle of drug and welfare dependency. This is a really good opportunity to expand this, to keep looking and trying to find things that work, things that will change people's lives on the ground. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",AC,2018-02-07,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (12:14):  This bill, the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017, is a good bill which seeks to remove the restriction to three sites for where the government can implement the cashless debit card. Australian Conservatives support the cashless debit card. I note the comments made by a very philanthropic Australian, Mr Andrew Forrest—he's been right to advocate its broad introduction. I also note the comments made by Mr Andrew Forrest when he called the Greens 'the party for paedophiles' for opposing this reform. I'm only quoting what has been attributed to him, but the rhetoric he used seeks to point out the terrible cost of the dogged clutching to ideology that we see with the Greens and others on topics like these.


The Greens and others refuse to accept that business as usual for Indigenous communities simply cannot continue. There are terrible human costs and terrible economic costs to too many families and to the Australian community. Reforms like these are working. They are delivering benefits to Australian families—Indigenous or otherwise. They are ensuring that welfare money isn't spent on grog, on smokes, on dope—on all things that the Greens seem to love—but are instead spent on food, on nappies and on the things that not only a family needs but a mother knows a family needs.


The Greens, the purported champions of women, the ones who parade around with their white ribbons, are on this occasion refusing to back Indigenous mothers who want to put food on the table and protect their kids. Instead they're backing the abusive husbands who seize the money, drink it away and commit all manner of crimes. We cannot allow this to continue; we have to break this cycle. We have to stop business as usual, and this bill goes some way to doing it. Let's not forget, this regime allows 20 per cent of the welfare payment to be spent how the recipient likes. Eighty per cent is on the card, and they can do as they want with the rest. It's a rough and ready principle, the 80-20 rule.


I will focus my comments today on the implications in South Australia, not just because it's my home state and not just because Ceduna, on our state's far west coast, has been a successful trial site and is a place I have visited many times but because, if the media reports are to be believed, the so-called SA-BEST party, as the Nick Xenophon Team will soon be, are going to kill this reform today. It's not just the Greens who are obstructive in this space; there's a far more cunning and slippery character: former senator Nick Xenophon. He's the aspirant for the South Australian state seat of Hartley. He's the grand inquisitor, who's launched enough inquiries to make Senate clerks weep. He's flip-flopped and, as the Leader of the Government in the Senate has said on a number of occasions, has wibble-wobbled like jelly on a plate on policy that he knows works, because he doesn't want to offend the left-wing base that he courts. I don't buy, and many Australian people don't buy, the Xenophon sensible centre nonsense. His voting record during his time here is absolutely clear. He voted in divisions more often with the Greens than with any other party. Premier Weatherill, the South Australian Labor Premier, might try to claim Mr Xenophon is a Liberal but that's nonsense. His voting record shows that he is of the left through and through, and you cannot hide from those facts. Mr Weatherill's rubbery figures are designed to paint SA-BEST as a conservative party. I'm not easily offended, but Mr Weatherill has certainly struck at the heart of offence in suggesting that Mr Xenophon is a conservative or that his party is a conservative party. I haven't found that the SA-BEST team have actually put their name to a single conservative initiative. In fact, everything that Labor have stood for has pretty much been backed, to an even greater degree, by the Xenophon team, and I suspect that Mr Weatherill is only worried that Mr Xenophon is chomping at Labor's base.


Notwithstanding that he's no longer here, everyone understands that Mr Xenophon is pulling the strings of the group called the Nick Xenophon Team, even though he's given up his part-time job with fellow Senator Griff that was designed to get him through the financial hardship of running for his third house of parliament. I note that Mr Xenophon has lodged a name change with the AEC to change the name of the Nick Xenophon Team to SA-BEST.


Yet again, I would say that the Australian Conservatives are leading the way. We recognise the cult of personality does not work for the interest of the body politic and it doesn't work for the interest of the Australian people, and yet that's precisely what we have seen with the Nick Xenophon Team. The Australian people want principled parties now; they're looking for people who are going to stand by their convictions rather than just jump on any populist wind or weather vane change to get themselves some more attention.


But, of course, I would argue that the South Australian media will chair Mr Xenophon around the state, promoting him—unquestioningly almost—and painting him as a Playford reborn in the interests of South Australia. Of course he's nothing of the sort, and here on the cashless debit card we see precisely the type of ambulance-chasing, get-the-headlines behaviour of the Nick Xenophon Team writ large. Let's remember that the leader of the Nick Xenophon Team/SA-BEST, zipped over at taxpayers' expense over to Ceduna, in my home state, where this cashless debit card trial was announced. The local mayor, Allan Suter, a good man, was—rightly so—a very strong supporter of this regime.


And it's worked. I know it's worked because I've been there and I've looked at it myself. Alcohol abuse in that community has slumped. There are better outcomes for everyone in the community as a result of this, and yet too many left-wing ideologues from the sterile comfort of this place expressed opposition to the schemes. But out on the ground, where people have to live with the reality of social breakdown that occurs as a result of abuse, not only of substances but of welfare payments—and, quite frankly, even worse abuses of the most human tragic kind at the coalface—people are crying out for these reforms.


I will go back: Mr Xenophon flew to Ceduna because he wanted to look concerned for the cameras. He's quite fond of quoting that character from The Comedy Company, for those old enough to remember, Con the Fruiterer. He's always, 'Looking, looking, looking.' He created division in the community; he stirred it up, saying, 'There was division and we needed to keep looking and looking to find a better solution.' Braver souls, I'm happy to say, stared him down and said, 'No, it's actually time to get on with it.'


I also know that Mr Xenophon's protege, the member for Mayo, in the other place, told The Guardian today that they want there to be a 'social licence' for a rollout in other areas. A social licence. That's also known as an 'opinion poll'. And that's the precise SA-BEST/Nick Xenophon Team model: opinion polls. In South Australia, we've always been able to predict where the Nick Xenophon Team would land on a particular issue, because we just have to look at the polling on that issue. It's blatant populism. It's worked a charm for him, because he and his team have been untrammelled about the principles behind the decisions they're making. But I would say that following polls slavishly isn't leadership, it isn't moral fortitude and it isn't significant rigour for making decisions in this place. It's not doing the right thing; it's choosing the path of least resistance. And, frankly, it's gutless.


The Xenophon approach is to be the rooster on the roof of every house, the weather vane, blowing whichever way the hot air of opinion polls is blowing. The member for Mayo, whom I might add is almost like a protected species for her fellow left-wing travellers, she's not going off to the High Court. Somehow that shop has closed around her to keep her safe from the High Court. I find that quite extraordinary—once again, a lack of accountability by those who squeal the most about delivering outcomes and evidence based policy.


Yet some of the strongest attacks against Mr Xenophon come from the Australian Labor Party and their useful sock puppet, the union movement. They loathe Mr Xenophon because he's prosecuting the left-wing political case better than they are. He is quite literally crushing the Greens in South Australia, cruelling the high ambitions of Senator Hanson-Young, who may be enjoying her last years in this place. In fact, Mr Xenophon is not so much siding with the Greens as slowly taking them on and taking them over as well. Some would say he's a Justin Trudeau in a cheap suit.


But I come back to the point of this bill. Here we have it. We have the Nick Xenophon Team stopping reform that can save lives in regional and poorer communities. They are stopping reform that reinforces that welfare payments are not a right but a privilege to help you step up from poverty, not to leave you in it. And this reform, if the media reports are correct, will fail today because the left-wing parties—the Greens, the Labor Party, the Nick Xenophon Team, and others who profess to know best—will join ideologically as one on this reform. This reform opposes the leftist narrative that people in this place will cling to even as it leaves people languishing in poverty and despair and has proven to be a broken model. 


Today I have focused on the Nick Xenophon Team because, of those of us on the crossbench, they are the reason that this initiative is going to fail today. That disappoints me because I think Australians deserve better accountability from their politicians. I think Australian communities deserve better from their politicians. I think those who are most troubled by substance abuse in the communities—the families that are welfare dependent and are missing out because of the actions of some in their households—will rue the day that this important reform was blocked by the Nick Xenophon Team and others.


So I make no apologies that the Australian Conservatives wholeheartedly support this bill. I think it needs to be rolled out much more widely in the welfare space. I think we need to ensure that this is not just targeted at Indigenous communities and that it is applied liberally across all welfare recipients but with a particular focus on those areas most in need. We're considering moving amendments to apply this regime to all welfare recipients under the age of 21. It would seem like a moot point given the circumstance in the reporting today that this important reform is going to fail.


I commend the government for their pursuit of this reform. I think it's important. I want to commend Mr Andrew Forrest, whom I have seen in this place many times walking around trying to lobby very, very hard for this important reform. And it's encouraging to see a successful businessman not give up the ghost and leave it to other people but actually get in here, into the trenches, and try and convince some people here who have their minds closed to the fact that something else needs to be done if we're going to have a meaningful impact in reform. I congratulate him for it. I only wish that he'd been more successful in his efforts. I make no blame for him, because it is not him. It is not his efforts. It is the intransigence of others opposite who refuse to open their eyes to the fact that there is a better way in dealing with welfare in this country.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2018-02-07,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (12:28):  It's a pleasure to take part in this debate following Senator Bernardi, who has a wonderful turn of phrase. His perspicuity in his comments about the Nick Xenophon Team and the Greens are worth recording for posterity. I congratulate Senator Bernardi for his understanding and shouting out of two political parties who are really a waste of time and a waste of space—one might say oxygen thieves—when it comes to serious policy debate in in chamber.


The cashless debit card, as many senators have said, was first introduced on a trial basis in March of 2016 at Ceduna in South Australia, and this was followed by further trials at Kununurra and Wyndham in the Kimberley. These trials, by anyone's assessment, have been an unmitigated success. Alcohol consumption in these communities has fallen, gambling and illicit substance abuse has been curtailed and alcohol related violence has been reduced. It's also been reported that 30 per cent of people impacted by the reform have reported being better able to care for their families and save money. Some cynics might say, 'It's only 30 per cent; it's not 100 per cent,' but in this area of social policy having 30 per cent of a selected group better off is well worth the effort of undertaking the exercise. 


The measures in the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017 will remove some limitations on the rollout of the cashless welfare card and allow the program to be introduced into my state of Queensland, and that's really why I am contributing to this debate. I know that in the last budget the government announced that the cashless welfare card would be expanded to two new locations. One of them is in my home state of Queensland in the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay region—in the Maryborough area of Central Queensland. It is one of the parts of Queensland that perhaps has the lowest socioeconomic profile, and it's one where there are real concerns with family violence, with alcohol and drug abuse and with various other forms of addiction that have impacted on so many families. 


The rollout is good news for my state of Queensland and certainly good news for the people of Bundaberg. I know that the local federal member for Hinkler, Mr Pitt, consulted widely, as did the department, in relation to the introduction in the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay area. All sensible and mature community leaders support the extension of the trial into that region. 


I'm very hopeful that a similar initiative will be taken in the Townsville region—where I have my office and where I live, south of Townsville, in a place called Ayr—because Townsville, regrettably, has been hit by very high unemployment and all of the social problems that follow unemployment and despair. Small business has been struggling. The unemployment is too high, but there are some bright lights on the horizon. For example, 800 families have been employed in Queensland by the Adani company as part of their railway line construction for the coalfields in the Galilee Basin. 


I cannot understand why Labor politicians, particularly those like the Labor member for Herbert, Ms Cathy O'Toole, are lukewarm—that is the most positive way I can say it—in their support for this construction initiative which would mean so much for the Townsville district. I and my party support the Adani project because of the jobs it would create. Already, I repeat, 800 families have jobs in Queensland thanks to Adani. The Labor mayor of Townsville, Councillor Jenny Hill, is a very courageous person. Councillor Hill is fully committed to the Adani project. Why? Because it means jobs for Townsville people and a real boost for small business in Townsville. 


I've asked Councillor Hill to join with me in seeking a clarification from the Labor opposition leader, Mr Shorten, on the comments he made as part of his campaign to maintain the seat of Batman and stem an onslaught from the Greens political party. Unfortunately, it seems that the opposition leader is trying to match the Greens promises in any way that needs to be done to retain that seat. Quite frankly, I don't care what happens in Batman but I do care about the impact of the promises Mr Shorten is making in Batman on the workers of North and Central Queensland. 


Similarly, I cannot understand why the CFMEU—the 'M' being for 'mining'—are not wholeheartedly supporting the Adani project for the jobs it would create in railway construction, mine construction and eventually in an export-oriented mine in Central Queensland. The construction workers and mining workers would be members of the CFMEU. I know the CFMEU has a huge influence in the operations and policy of the ALP. It simply beggars my belief why the CFMEU would just be following the old Labor line of anti-everything, because it's their members who would benefit from Adani. But I digress slightly. 


This cashless welfare card helps many jobseekers establish the security and stability they need in their lives to effectively re-enter the employment market. The card has been proven to work. It has been proven to reduce domestic violence and it has been proven to have better outcomes for those who do use some of their welfare money for alcohol and drugs. It's clear that not everyone does that, but there is a significant proportion of the community on welfare who do use the money for alcohol, for drugs, for gambling, which means their family and their children do without. 


There are reported cases of alcohol-fuelled violence and violence because families don't have enough to eat. They don't have enough to send the kids to school properly, and that causes family problems. Here is a solution, which has proved to have worked in Ceduna and in the Kimberley. It's has proved to have worked and it does bring benefits. That's why I support this rollout to the Bundaberg-Maryborough-Hervey Bay area of my state of Queensland. That's why the community leaders in those communities also support this. And I look forward to the day when community leaders in Townsville will petition for the cashless welfare card to be introduced in the their region. 


Again, I cannot understand why the Labor member for Herbert, Ms Cathy O'Toole, opposes this. She knows better than I do the impact of alcohol-related family violence, the problems of children not having the right money for school or food, because the welfare recipient has used the money for gambling or drugs or, more often in my region, on alcohol. Again, I acknowledge this is not 100 per cent of the people; I'm not putting everyone in that same basket. But this proposal will not affect those who already manage their welfare cheques well one iota. 


Why Ms O'Toole would be supporting the Greens in their opposition to this real initiative to stop child abuse, lack of food for children, lack of proper schooling—I simply cannot believe it. 




Senator Siewert:
  It's not true.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I hear Senator Siewert screaming something from the crossbench about this not being true. I'm sorry, but I will take my advice from people who know—that is, the department that is interested, that does the surveys and that follows these things. It is not part of a political party that simply wants to compete with Labor in the rush to the left in the hope that it might win the seat of Batman.


These are proven results. Although it won't affect 100 per cent of the people, even if you can see a noticeable difference in those impacted, of 30 per cent, then that's got to be a good thing. I repeat: the evidence shows that those who are doing the right thing with their welfare won't be impacted at all. They already spend their money not on alcohol or on drugs or on gambling, but on buying food for their families and children and making sure their children have sufficient resources to attend school as part of the school community in the normal way. Those people are already doing it, so giving them the cashless debit card is not going to make one iota of difference. I cannot understand people like Ms O'Toole who claim some interest in this area, or some expertise in this area in a past life. She would know better than I the impacts on families of drug and alcohol abuse and of gambling abuse. This cashless debit card is a great way to go and assist those families.


The government that doesn't try to break that cycle of loss of self-esteem is being irresponsible in the extreme. The social impacts on affected communities, as everyone who involves themselves in this area will know, are disastrous. Add to that the psychological impact on people who are receiving benefits and who abuse substances. This is a recipe for entering a never-ending cycle of self-harming behaviours that include gambling, alcohol abuse and illicit substance abuse. We as a government feel we have a responsibility to try to help those families who, for whatever reason, are not able to help themselves. I repeat: this won't make any difference to those who can help themselves, because those families already spend the money on the right things. This will only impact upon those who do abuse alcohol and gambling, and it will try to put those families in a situation where—




Senator Pratt:
  Are you saying everybody on welfare abuses alcohol?




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I will take the interjection, Senator Pratt. If you'd been listening to me, you would have heard me say twice already that I am not saying that 100 per cent of people on welfare abuse alcohol and drugs. But 30 per cent of affected families have been proven to be better off. Isn't even 30 per cent worth it? I cannot believe that people who are supposedly compassionate, who abhor domestic violence and who allegedly abhor substance and gambling abuse cannot see that this is a good step in the right direction—it's not the panacea, but it's a step in the right direction. It is helping some families get proper food for their kids and properly equipping them to attend school. It gives those people in those families the self-esteem to try and move forward to get one of these jobs in the Townsville and Bundaberg regions when they come from initiatives being taken by the federal government, and, I repeat, from the employment that will be created when Adani gets into full swing.


I support this project very, very strongly. As a Queenslander, I hope it can be introduced into the Hinkler region, as the department proposes, very quickly and as soon as practically we can do it. I hope the Townsville community will embrace this, to lead to a better life for their citizens.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (12:45):  During the so-called Christmas break that parliamentarians allegedly have, when we take a couple of months off on holidays, as many of the public believe is the case, I and I know a lot of other senators and members of the other house use those couple of months to get around, to talk to our constituents and to become better acquainted with some of the issues in our electorates. My electorate is the state of Queensland. It's a pretty big electorate to try and cover but, in the period between the sittings of parliament, I took it upon myself to visit different parts of the state, particularly to speak with local authorities, local government. 


I used to be a member of a local council before I came into this parliament and I was once, back in the glory days, the minister for local government, so I've always had a close affiliation with local government. I find, as you move around a big decentralised state like Queensland, that you can't visit everyone and speak to everyone in various communities to find out what's happening and what they need, so I've always made a practice of calling on the local council, because the local council is made up of community people who've been elected by their peers and who understand exactly what's happening in every community and what those communities' aspirations are. 


In this break, I called on the Central Highlands Regional Council in the wonderful town of Emerald in the centre of Central Queensland. Emerald is a wonderful city. It's a great example of what good agriculture can do to a region. I do lament that some of the mining towns in Queensland are doing it a bit tough, but that is always going to be the case because mines come and go. But Emerald is a classic example of a city with great export-oriented agriculture and with a very proactive council. Why is there good agriculture there? There's good soil—well, there's good soil in a lot of places—but there was a dam there, the Fairbairn Dam, built by a Liberal-Country Party government back in the day when, I think, Mr Fairbairn was the Minister for National Development. That's going back in history. But, because of that dam, there is practically unlimited water in this inland Central Queensland area, which enables that community to grow cotton, grain and other crops. Practically anything that has a market can be grown there. 


I just want to mention, in passing, that in Emerald at the moment there is an outfit called 2PH, run by the Pressler family, who, would you believe, exports mandarins around the world—to Taiwan, Japan, China and all countries in South America. They are in the throes of establishing new markets in the Middle East. When I was down there and called to see them, I noted to my amazement that the huge area that they had under mandarins had almost doubled. It's an incredible story. They were on the bones of their bums, one might say, some years ago when citrus canker destroyed their industry. The government eventually provided some compensation to all the citrus growers in that area, and, as a result of that, the Presslers built this wonderful business with the sorts and types of varieties of mandarins that people around the world want to buy. It's a huge success story. They employ, I think, 40 local people and 60 of the Pacific Islands workers program, which is great for Australia because it's part of our foreign aid to those countries. It's a real success story.


While I was there I spoke with the mayor, Councillor Kerry Hayes; the deputy mayor, Councillor Gail Godwin-Smith; and Councillor Paul Bell, an old mate of mine from a long time ago, who used to be the LGAQ and ALGA president; and other councillors there. It was good to catch up with them and hear of their successes and aspirations.


I then moved on to the North Burnett council, which is centred in the town of Gayndah, although there are several smaller communities in that North Burnett region as part of the new, enlarged shire. I had a very interesting conversation with the mayor, Councillor Rachel Chambers. She obviously has a very intellectual, assiduous, astute understanding of the importance of smaller regional towns. She said to me—I want to repeat this—that the Queensland and Australian governments have got to make a decision on whether they want small country towns to exist in Australia or whether they want everyone to move to the capital cities on the coast. She had a great perspective on the world, and I was delighted to listen to and learn from Councillor Chambers on some of those issues.


I later met with the mayor of the Carpentaria shire, Councillor Jack Bawden. He has a number of initiatives going in that gulf area of Queensland—that north-western part of Queensland. Councillor Bawden knows of the success of the government's Building Better Regions program. We put a fibre-optic cable between Burketown and Doomadgee. That's not in his shire—it's in the Burke shire—but he is next door and he knows of that, so he has an application in for fibre optics between Karumba and Normanton. That project certainly has my support. I wish him well in his application to the National Stronger Regions program for that. I might say that Councillor Bawden has learnt well, because he has about five or six different applications in to the federal government's proposals, which are all aimed at making regions stronger.


I also visited the Cook shire and met with the mayor, Councillor Peter Scott. We were talking about that great shire, which is really everything north of Mossman and the Port Douglas area—the whole of the cape. There are some Indigenous councils in that area, but the rest of the area of the cape is looked after by the Shire of Cook. I was able to discuss many things with Councillor Scott, but the one thing that particularly interested me was his reminder that 2020 is the 250th anniversary of the beaching of Captain Cook's ship the Endeavour, on a river that is now called the Endeavour River, for repairs to the boat. I might say the celebrations will highlight this aspect: this was the first act of reconciliation between Europeans and Indigenous people, as the two communities got on very well together after one initial misunderstanding. They got on very well together in the 48 days that Captain Cook and his crew were there.


I also spoke to the mayor of the Wujal Wujal Aboriginal shire, Desmond Tayley. He is a very committed guy, interested in promoting his communities. I'm helping him and other Indigenous councillors with a new grouping they have to get together to do better buying for Indigenous councils in the cape and in the north.


Finally, I met with the Douglas Shire mayor, Councillor Julia Leu. That is a shire that centres on Port Douglas and Mossman. It was originally, under a Labor government initiative, joined with Cairns, which was totally inappropriate. Fortunately, there were the two years of the Newman government in which they put the Douglas shire back to where it belonged. Councillor Leu is very environmentally aware. She and I differ slightly on the need to establish in a better way the road between the Daintree and Cooktown, which other mayors in the area support and which I think would be a good idea. Councillor Leu is not quite certain about it and thinks there could be a problem. It was good to catch up with these people.


So it's been an interesting time to meet with these very differing communities and to find out problems they might have, but, more importantly, to discuss with them their aspirations and to see where we as a federal government can help these communities in achieving the futures that they wish.

The PRESIDENT
 (14:00):  Before we move to question time, I'd like to make a short statement following issues that arose yesterday. As senators well know, standing order 193 prohibits the use of offensive words, imputations of improper motives and personal reflections against a member of either chamber. Any such breach is highly disorderly, and an offending senator will be required to withdraw. However, debate in this chamber rests on more than simple rules and standing orders; it is also dependent upon the tone and context of language used by senators. When a senator finds a term offensive, there has often been a request and consent to withdraw a term, although not always and not necessarily with a formal ruling from the chair about it being disorderly. This approach has usually ensured vigorous debate that is at the same time respectful. I would urge all senators to be mindful of all these rules, customs and practices when debating issues in this chamber. 


I particularly urge senators to give serious thought to the use of epithets or labels or to ascribing views to other senators when precision of language might more appropriately focus on specific actions or events that are the subject of debate. This is particularly important when dealing with contentious issues and will assist in avoiding crossing the line into disorderly reflections on individuals or imputation of improper motives, including accidentally.

 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:02):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Finance (Senator Cormann) to a question without notice asked by Senator Farrell today relating to the distribution of GST revenue.


Twice this week this Leader of the Government in the Senate has been unwilling to rule out any changes to the GST distribution to Tasmania and to South Australia. I'll come back to that fact, because he's been given two opportunities over this week and he has failed to do so, but I want to go back to the beginning. I want to go back to the summer holidays, a time for beaches, barbecues—and, do you know what else? Burying, until after the elections in South Australia and Tasmania, the government's plans to slash hundreds of millions of dollars from state budgets. When did the government decide that the Productivity Commission magically needed more time to finalise its report on GST funding? On 3 January! And how much longer does the PC need to finalise this report? Until after the South Australian and Tasmanian elections! Oh, my goodness me! Knock me over with a feather! What a surprise! What a coincidence! 


What is the backdrop to this? People might have forgotten that the backdrop to this was Prime Minister Turnbull talking about re-casting the GST, I think, in the context of the WA election—that's right—and positive comments made by Treasurer Morrison about changes to the GST. This isn't some esoteric argument because, earlier this week, we put to the government what the cuts, a change to the GST would mean to Tasmanians and to South Australians. It isn't an esoteric budget formula discussion; it's a discussion about nurses and teachers and police officers and infrastructure. It is a discussion about what happens to services and to real people. Let's remember: these cuts would be equivalent to South Australia cutting 5,340 teachers, over 4,000 frontline police, nearly 5,000 nurses, nearly 38,000 radiotherapy treatments, or 86 train carriages, just to name a few. These are real services to South Australians. A number of Labor Tasmanian senators have also asked questions about the cuts to Tasmania.


In the context of that, what have we had from the government? Twice this week, as I've said, Senator Cormann has refused to rule out changes to the GST. He keeps using weasel words: there's no proposal, there's no plan. Twice he's been asked to rule out any changes to the GST distribution to South Australia and Tasmania, and he refuses to. Meanwhile, Senator Birmingham says in the paper he'll fight any plan to change the GST. So which is it? Is it that there's no plan, or is there a plan Senator Birmingham's fighting? Maybe this is some weird Liberal example of shadow-boxing—you know: you fight a plan that doesn't really exist.


I can say this: there is only one party that will stand up for South Australia and Tasmania on the GST, and that's the Labor Party. Can I tell you why in South Australia the South Australian electorate can never trust Steven Marshall when it comes to standing up to Canberra? It is because he's Pyne's patsy. He's Christopher Pyne's patsy, and everyone in South Australia knows it. He owes his job to the very impressive number crunching Mr Pyne has engaged in and the influence of Mr Pyne in the South Australian Liberal Party, and so you never hear Steve say boo. He's Pyne's patsy. He'll be Pyne's patsy when it comes to the GST and he'll be Pyne's patsy on everything else, and that's why South Australians haven't flocked to him. That's the reason he's seen as a weak Liberal leader: he is controlled up here by Christopher Pyne, and everyone in South Australia knows it.


The reality is it takes more than a couple of headlines to show that the South Australian Liberal Party are actually prepared to stand up to their Western Australian and federal colleagues. We know a history of them rolling over, of them going quiet, of them not doing the right thing. It wasn't the South Australian Liberal Party who got the submarines back; let's remember that. It was the campaign run by the Labor Party and the Labor government in South Australia. The Liberals like to be lions in Adelaide, but they're cowards in Canberra. That's the reality, and I think every South Australian knows it.


I don't know who's following me after this. I hope it's Senator Birmingham, and I invite him to rule out the GST changes. I invite him to do what his leader wouldn't and rule out any changes to the GST for South Australia. If you don't, everyone will you know you're a coward. (Time expired)

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2018-02-07,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training and Manager of Government Business in the Senate) (15:07):  You know Jay Weatherill is in trouble in South Australia when Senator Penny Wong comes in here and the best she's got is to throw around abuse and lies in her argument. That's the best South Australian Labor has to offer after 16 long years of driving the proud state of South Australia into the dust.


Frankly, South Australians rightly are fed up with a state Labor government that has overseen the slow and steady decline of the state. They're fed up with the many long months the state has suffered having the highest unemployment in the country. They're fed up with the circumstances of being in the state that has seen the lowest rate of employment growth across the country. They're fed up with the jokes that come from interstate because the state can't manage to keep the lights on. They're fed up with the fact that investment into the state dries up because people lack confidence after 16 years of Labor. They're fed up, of course, with the scandals that have beset Jay Weatherill's Labor government.


Jay Weatherill is a good factional ally of Senator Wong. No wonder she's here passionately standing up for him. But, of course, he's the Premier who has overseen the disgraceful circumstance of abuse of people in the care of the state—children in the care of the state, elderly citizens in the care of the state—and who has seen a train wreck of a disaster across the TAFE system in South Australia. It has been one disaster after another.


What I find incredible is that Senator Wong wants to come in here and talk about South Australia's GST funding. Jay Weatherill and his state government have been rolling in enormous revenue growth under the GST. It's up to some $6.3 billion flowing into South Australia. It's grown enormously—far ahead of all of their budget projections—and yet what has happened in that time? According to the Productivity Commission's assessment of state spending, investment in South Australian schools has gone backwards.


During that time, what else has happened? The state government has cut services out of South Australia's hospitals. We know that all of this GST largess that the Weatherill government has been receiving hasn't been spent on South Australian schools because funding's been cut. It hasn't been spent on South Australian hospitals because services have been cut. So where the hell has the money gone, Premier Weatherill? You've had 16 years of record revenues, and all we've seen is an endless decline in services. And what, of course, is the answer that we get from Senator Wong and the Labor Party? All we get is abuse of the member for Sturt, abuse of Mr Marshall, abuse of me and abuse of anybody that Senator Wong can think of because she has no defence of Jay. Senator Wong can't come in here and defend his school funding cuts or cuts to hospital services. She can't come in here and defend the disgrace that is the Oakden scandal—



Senator Wong interjecting—




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Oh, here we go—bring it on, Senator Wong!



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Birmingham, resume your seat. Senator Wong.




Senator Wong:
  I know he's getting very emotional, but I'd like to point out that I actually said that Christopher Pyne—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Is this a point of order?




Senator WONG:
  was 'a very impressive numbers manager'. That's why you have Xenophon—because Marshall is his patsy!



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Wong, that's not a point of order. Resume your comments, please, Senator Birmingham.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  There you see again the desperation of Senator Wong as I'm highlighting the litany of failures that have beset South Australia under her mate's government—Jay Weatherill's government—like the Oakden aged-care scandal. Of course, there have been multiple child abuse scandals. As I've said before, there has been the TAFE training scandal lately. We've seen all of these problems bank up one after another after another after another. South Australian voters aren't going to be fooled by a few Labor Party questions during question time in the Senate or by a five-minute rant from Senator Wong into thinking, 'Actually, Jay Weatherill is doing okay,' because there was no defence of Jay in anything that Senator Wong actually said.


If Senator Wong wants to engage in a discussion about the South Australian election, let's have a discussion about the South Australian election. Let's do it on state terms. Let's talk about the state government's performance, because that's what voters are judging. Voters will be judging the performance of the state government and the alternative that's on offer. The alternative that's on offer is offering clear policies to reduce costs for South Australian households through a reduction in the emergency services levy, to encourage investment in South Australia through a cut to the payroll tax and to deliver policies to get the state moving again after 16 long years of Labor failure.

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (15:13):  It's obvious that Senator Birmingham has been caught out because what a performance! He is certainly never going to be a match for Senator Wong—not at all. If you want to talk about the real impacts of this government, you have had ample opportunity. Senator Wong challenged you, Senator Birmingham, to rule out any change to the GST, to rule out any cut to Tasmania or South Australia—but, no. Once again, along with Senator Cormann, you have failed to do it.


You did raise a very important issue: the Oakden scandal. It's very opportune for you to raise that, Senator Birmingham. You want to look at your own Department of Health and Ageing before you go pointing the finger at anyone else. You certainly should look at the accreditation agency and its failure to support and protect those most vulnerable South Australians, so be careful. Senator Duniam will come up and talk about the facts. The fact is, Senator Birmingham, that it was your government's department, your agency, that failed in Oakden.


Let's not be distracted from the real issues that are going to be affected by any cut of the GST to Tasmania and South Australia. We have a health system and a hospital system in my home state of Tasmania in crisis. It doesn't matter how many times that the Liberal senators come into this place and talk about previous Labor governments. It is this minister—the state Minister for Health, the Liberal minister, the Liberal government—and the Liberal Premier, who Senator Duniam used to work for, who were on the government benches when older Tasmanians were left on the floor in accident and emergency. Older Tasmanians have been left to wait for more than 48 hours for emergency surgery. One particular man was bleeding. It was a real emergency.


Senators come here from Tasmania and say: 'Well, you know, we haven't said there's going to be a cut. The Productivity Commission report, gee, golly, gosh,' as Senator Wong said, on 3 January—all of a sudden they need more time. Well, they have already highlighted that $168 million will be cut from Tasmania. Senator Duniam and the Liberal team: you need to say more than what you've been saying in Tasmania. You actually have to prove it. You have to actually stand up for Tasmanians. You have to actually put pressure on your government not to cut any funding. Why aren't you getting your colleagues, your ministerial colleagues, to actually rule out any cut to the GST? It is very simple. You keep saying that we're running a scare campaign. The reality is you can end any campaign by getting your Prime Minister, your Treasurer or your Minister for Finance to say there will be no cut.


Tasmanians don't believe you because they know that this Prime Minister has walked away from Tasmania. The Prime Minister has visited Tasmania fewer than five times since the last federal election. The reality is that all this huff and puff and talking about facts is all about trying to save a very weak Premier of Tasmania, a Premier who is only ever known as the 'good news Premier'. The reality is that, when it comes to health, hospitals and education and the lack of funding for home care packages for older Tasmanians, you have failed. The Tasmanian community understands that very well.


Health is a major issue at this coming state election. Minister Ferguson has a big red 'F' for 'failure'. If you're not prepared to rule out the GST once and for all—no cuts to South Australia or Tasmania—then the people of Tasmania will vote accordingly. They know that when it comes to health, education and looking after the welfare of all Tasmanians the only party that has a policy, a solution and a vision to restore the good health of Tasmanians and the health system is the Labor Party. So I am waiting with bated breath to hear once again those facts that Senator Duniam will roll out and roll out and roll out. The reality is we can't trust this government. (Time expired)

"Duniam, Sen Jonathon",LP,2018-02-07,"



Senator DUNIAM
 (Tasmania) (15:18):  It is always a pleasure to follow my good friend and colleague Senator Polley, who fills the air with more mistruths than I can count, honestly. I give her points for trying.


What this is reminiscent of is something from 2016. You know what it was? 'Mediscare'—the ridiculous lie that was told to Australian voters right across Australia, particularly in Tasmania. Three members of the Labor Party—now in the federal caucus here—won their seats on a lie. They were trying to tell people we were going to privatise Medicare. This is the kind of form of this group of people, the Australian Labor Party, the Labor Senate team, this dynamic group of people from Tasmania that they send up here every year; that's what they do. They run these scare campaigns and try and fool poor vulnerable Tasmanians into believing their rubbish. 


Senator Polley has been asking me to reel off facts. Here's a fact: Senator Polley couldn't defend Ms White, the opposition leader in Tasmania, once. She didn't talk up her credentials once. She stood there talking about the Premier of Tasmania, Will Hodgman—an excellent Premier, I might add. I will come to those facts that Senator Polley is going to miss out on again as she leaves the chamber again, runs from this debate, to talk about the frontline services that we have restored in Tasmania. 



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  A point of order, Senator Wong?




Senator Wong:
  I realise Senator Duniam is in his first term. As a matter of courtesy, we recognise that senators on both sides often have other engagements and so we ought not to make comment about people leaving the chamber in a debate.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you. Senator Duniam, please continue.




Senator DUNIAM:
  Thank you very much, Madam Deputy President. Hopefully, Senator Polley will take note of the things that I have to say.


It is just like the case was with South Australia: 16 long years of Labor, where services have been cut and people on the ground are noticing how they're waiting longer to get into hospitals and how school standards are slipping, just like they were in Tasmania up to the year 2014. In Tasmania since 2014—in the last four years—we have restored the number of nurses.


Bec White, the opposition leader in Tasmania, says she wants to restore funding: $500 million. I don't know where it's coming from; she hasn't told Tasmanians where that money's coming from but it's what she cut. Her government, a government that she was part of, sat around the cabinet table between the years 2010 to 2014 and presided over a decision to cut health funding in Tasmania by $500 million. They cut over 250 nurses. Those numbers have been restored in Tasmania. We have an extra 120 hospital beds on offer in Tasmania. We have an extra 350 hospital staff on offer in Tasmania. We are seeing a massive increase in the number of elective surgeries, up from 15,000 per annum to 19,000 per annum. This is proof that we are addressing the things that Senator Polley, and Senator Wong, in her contribution, highlighted—that these things translate into frontline services.


But one point that Senator Cormann touched on in his answers is the salient point about unanimous consent by all the states, territories and the Commonwealth with regard to any of the changes that are being talked about around here in this scare campaign that's being run by Labor senators back in Tasmania, and, I gather, also in South Australia. There is this inconvenient fact that everyone has to agree to whatever happens down the track. I suspect that there are some concerns on the part of Labor in South Australia that Mr Weatherill will agree to something that's bad for South Australia. Hence, all the concern on the part of federal representatives from that state.


But it's clear: Senator Polley said in her question that we need to have people in the states standing up to Canberra. Well, as I said before, Ms White has proven that she can't stand up for our state. She presided over these massive cuts to frontline services. She's responsible for the suffering of many people, because she sat around that cabinet table in Tasmania and she agreed to these cuts, to the hundreds and hundreds of frontline service jobs that went and that have been restored under the Liberal government. This is the same individual in Tasmania who couldn't conduct a simple interview with radio show host Brian Carlton in Launceston without text messages from her staff. As a result, that radio show host has banned telephones from the studio. How can Tasmanians trust an individual like that, who can't run an interview, who presided over these massive cuts and who definitely won't be standing up for the best interests of the state that I represent proudly? The choice is clear: Will Hodgman has it; Bec White doesn't.

"McAllister, Sen Jenny",ALP,2018-02-07,"



Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:23):  Today we've been having a discussion about the carve-up of the GST and how this government plans to approach that. There are some things that are agreed. The first thing agreed is that this is an issue referred by the Treasurer, Mr Morrison, to the Productivity Commission. The second thing that isn't disputed by anyone in this chamber is that when the Productivity Commission tabled its interim report, one of its recommendations was a change to the way we deal with this question, which would see in just one year South Australia lose $557 million and Tasmania lose $168 million relative to their current positions. That can't be disputed, because that's in black and white and it's in the report.


But what is under dispute now, of course, is what that means and what the government intends to do about it. And, waking up in the new year and realising that the Liberal Party had to fight elections in South Australia and Tasmania, its leadership has decided to try and make this go away, to kick this off into the long grass and to assert that there's nothing going on here. In today's paper we saw Mr Pyne dismissing it as just a government report:


""The Productivity Commission writes reports, the Government makes policy. There is no policy to change the GST mix,"" Mr Pyne said.


Senator Birmingham:


… right now there's no proposal for change and nothing for people to fight over.


That's actually not what the Treasurer said. It's very different to what Mr Morrison said. What Mr Morrison said was:


… the Commission's draft report—


this is the one that recommends a $557 million cut from the South Australian budget—


… demonstrated the system is broken and needs a real fix.


Those are the words of the Treasurer. Those are the words of the person responsible for the economic policies of this government.


So who's telling the truth? Is it Mr Pyne or Senator Birmingham, cowering as they face the voters of South Australia? Or is it the person responsible for delivering the coalition's economic policy? As someone who's enthusiastic about the wellbeing of the citizens of South Australia and Tasmania, I'd like to think that it's Mr Pyne. After all, he has only recently crowed that he is part of the winners circle. Mr Pyne is very confident that he's in the driving seat. But I actually fear that the person who's right on this question is Mr Morrison, and I have to say, judging from the reaction of other Liberal MPs, from other people in the coalition party room, they seem inclined to believe that in these circumstances it's Mr Morrison who's telling the truth. What did Mr Marshall, the South Australian opposition leader, say? He said they would:


… oppose any change to the GST carve-up which would leave SA worse off.


What does Ms Flint, the member for Boothby, say? She's out there saying:


… she would make sure there was a ""fair deal for SA"".


""As a proud South Australian I will be fighting to protect the state's interests.""


She seems to think there's some sort of problem, something to fight about. What does Tony Pasin say? He says that he would expect:


Any attempt to undermine this principle will be met with a fierce fight from me and … every other South Australian in Federal Parliament.


It sounds like he thinks there's a fight on. It sounds like he thinks there's a problem. These are all members of the coalition party room who seem to think there is a big issue. In this chamber, newly arrived in the Liberal Party room, Senator Gichuhi says:


She said if such a change was pursued there would need to be measures to ""cushion"" SA against a possible impact.


She's worried about it. Mr Ramsey, the member for Grey, is worried about it. Senator Fawcett's worried about it. They're all quoted in The Advertiser, deeply worried about the proposal by the Treasurer to change the arrangements and leave South Australians worse off.


The shameful thing is that they are not strong enough to bring on this fight, to resolve this fight prior to South Australians' going to the polls. This is a weak party in South Australia. Indeed, I will add in passing that it's the very weakness of the South Australian Liberal Party—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Fawcett on a point of order.




Senator Fawcett:
  A point of order: there's been a misrepresentation in that I was not quoted on that. I was quoted as saying—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  That's a debating point.




Senator Fawcett:
  that South Australia has mismanaged the GST funds that it has.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Fawcett, please resume your seat. That's a debating point.




Senator McALLISTER:
  This is a very weak party in South Australia, and there's no greater example of the weakness of the Liberals in South Australia than the success of the Nick Xenophon Team. His success is a direct result of the South Australian Liberals' failure to provide any effective opposition to what I will say is a very, very good Labor government. They are incapable of resolving this before the election. The best they can do is kick it off into the long grass. (Time expired)

Leave granted.





The speech read as follows—




The Australian Citizenship Legislation Amendment (Strengthening the Requirements for Australian Citizenship and Other Measures) Bill 2017 passed through the Lower House on the 14th of August 2017 and was introduced into the Senate the following day. 


Amendments to this Bill were proposed by me and by Senators Bernardi, Gichuhi and Leyonhjelm, but on the 18th of October 2017 the Bill was removed from the Notice Paper, a consequence of a little used manoeuvre initiated by the Greens and supported by Labor.


These two parties wanted to deny a Senate debate on the rules which govern access Australian citizenship but the issue is too important in these unsettled times. 


I want a debate on this Bill and consequently have amended the original Bill and re-introduced it as a Private Senator's bill.


Australians want a conversation about the interrelated issues of immigration rate, population size and citizenship. They are deeply concerned about social cohesion, because for many years we have been home to the highest per capita immigration program in the world, taking more than 200,000 migrants annually from over 250 countries.


I have been talking about the impact of immigration on social cohesion since I gave my maiden speech in 1996 and said ""we are in danger of being swamped by Asians"". 


This statement has often been used as evidence of hostility towards Asians and Asian immigration but this has never been my view. Rather it was an assessment that the level of immigration was too high and that we needed to take migrants from a wider range of countries. 


I did no more than mirror the views in surveys like the one done by the AGB McNair poll done on the 19th of June 1996.


In 2016 I was elected as a Queensland Senator and said ""we are in danger of being swamped by Muslims who bear a culture and ideology that is incompatible with our own"". 


These are the facts. This is not stereotyping. It is not racism.


Half the people in Australia are worried about immigration from Islamic countries. We know that from recent surveys done by independent research firms.


The Essential Research survey done between 27 July and 1 August 2016 asked ""what is the main reason you support a ban on Muslim immigration? Forty-one per cent said they don't integrate into our society, 27% said they were a terrorist threat, 22% said they don't share our values, 4% said Australia is a Christian country, 4% said none of the reasons mentioned so far and 2% said they did not know. 


The reasons given by Australians for supporting a ban on immigration from Islamic countries tell the political class that we need laws to ensure applicants for citizenship will integrate, and share our values because evidently Australians in the real world are finding that not to be the case.


Australians know I am a very good listener and this Bill represents the views of the majority of Australians. 


The Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Testing Act) 2007 introduced the requirement of a four year residency with one year on a permanent visa and a sixty per cent pass rate on a 20 multiple choice question test, but these requirements are now inadequate. 


Every poll I have looked at for twenty years says speaking English is very important for migrants. Not one poll has said speaking English is unimportant because without English in this country you cannot integrate into the broader society.


Given our experience we need to make sure applicants for citizenship have already proven themselves before they are granted citizenship.


The Bill asks that applicants for citizenship demonstrate their suitability for citizenship by obeying our laws, respecting our culture and assimilating into broader society. 


The Bill is not about access to welfare benefits, because permanent visa holders can access all the same welfare benefits as citizens, but it is about providing evidence that applicants for citizenship have already integrated into Australian society.


The consequence of low entry requirements for citizenship still haunts Australia, in the form of pockets of organised crime and ethnic enclaves. 


If this Bill had been law we could have avoided the social problems in south-west Sydney, Melbourne and other parts of Australia. 


Many of the decisions made by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal are out of step with the expectation of most Australians and this Bill goes a small way to addressing these types of decisions.


It is far too common that we are unable to deport criminals and those who work against Australia's interests because they have the protection of certain kinds of visas or recent citizenship. 


The commitments sought from applicants for citizenship in this Bill are very reasonable when compared with those sought by other countries, but I know from the positions taken by the Australian Greens and Labor that they believe the increased residency period and the increased level of proficiency in English proposed will discriminate against some people and in particular refugees.


I would say to them that they need to take off their rose-coloured glasses and look at the problems and how they can be addressed.


Additionally I would say Australia is one of the most generous countries in the world, in terms of accepting genuine refugees. Once they arrive in Australia we provide lifetime financial support and the provision of 500 hours of free English lessons. 


Refugees on permanent visas can stay in Australia indefinitely and would only face deportation under extraordinary circumstances.


Labor and the Greens have said that the standard of English expected in this Bill is just too high. I would say citizenship carries responsibilities and that those responsibilities cannot be fulfilled by ticking the box to get 12 questions right out of 20.


In the Netherlands applicants sit a four hour test and must demonstrate they can read, write, speak and understand Dutch. Additionally they need to have knowledge which permits them to understand what they need to do as citizens.


As I have said before citizenship is one way we can promote social cohesion amongst peoples from very different backgrounds. 


In the period 2010 to 2011 a government study found 168,700 migrants arrived here speaking 174 languages other than English. How can we create social cohesion if we do not speak a common language?


Migrants from these 250 countries know very little about Australia's political system, our values and our way of life.


In Australia citizenship is a legal relationship between the individual and the State. It can be acquired by birth, by descent and by the granting of citizenship, but this is not the case elsewhere in the world. 


In the Middle East from where we have drawn hundreds of thousands of migrants, citizenship is a matter of religious affiliation and family relationship.


The United Arab Emirates (UAE), like Australia, has high rates of immigration and is resource rich, but here the similarities end. One hundred percent of Australian citizens have access to the welfare state but in the UAE few do and most don't.


This is because only the 13% of UAE citizens whose name is written in their fathers' Family Book can access free health care, subsidised housing, free education and other entitlements. 


Why is this the case? Under the rules governing citizenship in the UAE only citizens with an Emirati father can enjoy full citizenship but they still need their name to be written in their fathers' Family Book.


Eighty-seven percent of UAE citizens acquired that citizenship by demonstrating fluency in Arabic, providing evidence of a job and meeting residency requirements of up to 20 years. These citizens have a passport, a work right and the right to remain in the UAE but no access to the welfare state.


The UAE is not alone in demanding lengthy residency periods and mastery of the language. These requirements are also demanded in Denmark, Germany, South Africa and Spain where 8-10 year residency periods are mandatory. I could name many more countries.


In any case I don't see the need to rush the passage from permanent visa holder to citizen. I see benefits in extending the time which is the reason I want applicants to spend 8 years in Australia before applying for citizenship.


When you come from another country like the UAE, where the language and the ways of that country are very different from our own, it takes time to learn about how our country works. It takes time to prove you are worthy of citizenship.


Australian citizens need to work, but the nature of work has changed a great deal. 


In 1960, 63% of Australian jobs were in the service sector but today it's 84%. This growth in service sector jobs and the increasing importance of English in world trade is driving the increasing need for better standards of English by naturalised citizens. 


The argument that you don't need English to be a productive citizen does not wash with me because English is critical to getting a job and integrating into our society. Study after study supports that claim. 


Points based skilled migrants are required to have a competent level of English just to make an application for a visa and 95% of them have jobs within six months of arrival. 


We can contrast that outcome with the poor level of participation in the labour force for refugees where English proficiency plays no role in the selection.


It is common ground that humanitarian migrants suffer very low levels of employment. English proficiency is not the only factor in low participation in the labour force but it is an important one.


The benefits of Australian citizenship come with responsibilities including defending our country in time of need and voting in Federal and State elections where the future of Australia is decided.


One Nation represents people who are patriotic. They love this country and they want to keep it safe, secure and stable for the next generation.


In Australia, gender equality is the foundation of our democracy. I don't want to see citizenship given to people who don't understand or don't agree with our law, our values, or our way of life. 


I commend the Bill to the Senate.

Senator McGRATH:
  Due to the strong economic framework provided by this coalition government, over 400,000 jobs were created in 2017—a record for a calendar year. Three-quarters of these jobs were full-time. The Reserve Bank of Australia governor recently stated the improved labour market will lead to higher wages growth and the MYEFO forecast wage growth to pick up to 2.75 per cent to the June quarter in 2019. This government does not believe that giving unions more power to cripple public services through an unrestricted ability to strike, as Labor proposes, will help any Australian into a job or increase wages.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",AC,2018-02-07,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (16:14):  I present this matter of public importance with the concurrence of my colleagues, Senator Leyonhjelm and Senator Anning. Whilst we haven't come to an appropriate name for our taxpayer focused alliance, we are committed to getting better value for money for the taxpayers in this country and we are committed to finding a more efficient and effective way of governing.


Today we're focused on the need for Australia to reduce taxes on business. We have to leave aside for a moment the impost of red, green, and other tape on business and, indeed, the payroll tax and other taxes on jobs. All of this is endemic across the country. But we need to talk specifically about the income tax burden. On this front I have to commend the government for maintaining a commitment to lowering business taxes. It falls to the Australian Conservatives to keep making the case that gives the coalition the backbone and strength to secure truly conservative achievements.


Tax relief for business is a topic I know is attractive to almost a majority in the Senate—almost. Unfortunately, we've missed it by this much. That's the wedge of the Greens and others in the Senate that reject fiscal prudence. Again, as I said on the cashless debit card this morning, we always crash into what I might now describe as the budgetary Berlin Wall: the left-wing barricade in this place that is the Nick Xenophon Team, the Greens and the Labor Party. The real Berlin Wall, as you well know, this week has actually been down longer than it was ever up, but a budgetary Berlin Wall remains here in the Senate, and the bricks are coloured orange, green and red.


Why reduce business taxes? It makes sense for reasons I'm going to outline shortly, but the Trump administration in the United States have done two things. They've led the way with their business tax cuts. They've also put pressure on Australia to follow suit. If we do not follow suit, businesses will prefer to set up in more tax-friendly countries where the markets are bigger and it's more efficient and effective for them to do so. Businesses will go to where they're made to feel welcome. Reduced business taxes lead to increased after-tax profit, which encourages more capital investment. It allows business to increase, update and improve the capital available to their workers. This in turn leads to greater productivity per worker, greater economic outcomes and higher real wages. Indeed, Labor may claim the mythical cigar-smoking bosses will pocket the increases, but with labour mobility workers in a healthy economy will seek better-paying employment if the bosses and not they are enjoying the rewards of their labours.


Lower business tax rates can fundamentally address some of the key ills that have been afflicting our workers, households, cost of living and economy more generally over the past decade and particularly since the end of the mining boom around 2012. These are the very kinds of economic reforms that the Hawke-Keating and Howard government years successfully instituted for all Australians.


Cutting business taxes is the kind of economic reform and mindset this country urgently needs to return to the path of prosperity. We need to return to it today. The budgetary Berlin Wall of Nick Xenophon, Labor and the Greens cannot sustain business tax rates that are now at entirely uncompetitive levels by world standards whilst also pushing instead for artificial hikes in minimum and other wage rates to try and address sluggish wage growth. The evidence of this is apparent to anyone who has run a small business, who has employed people, who understands the economy and how it functions. Unfortunately, there are too few in this place, too few on the crossbenches and too few on the left side of politics who want to confront the reality of what we need to do.


This type of discredited central planning or command-and-control structure never works in the medium or long run. It simply destroys jobs rather than having the tide lift all boats. Of course, the current opposition aspires to hold government, and their ideological followers from the Nick Xenophon Team and the Greens simply don't seem to care about the medium or long term. The political Left want the short-term sugar hit of populism in order to reclaim power, to centralise more power within their ranks and to move across to the government benches by winning the next election.


Higher business tax rates are a disincentive for our young people trying to get jobs, they're a disincentive for businesses to invest in this country and to continue to reinvest in this country, and a they're a disincentive for mums trying to re-enter the workforce. Wage increases can only be sustained if they are driven or underpinned by similar productivity improvement. Otherwise we all suffer—particularly our young people seeking a chance to get their first job or to move into a better-paying job.


The reality is this: the more businesses we have competing for labour in the market, the more people we will have employed and the more attractive it will be for an employer to pay them higher wages in order to meet the competitive demands. I know that, as an employer in a small business, you do whatever you can to keep your good employees, whether it's giving them additional benefits, preferential hours or additional wages. But you can only do that if you are making a fair profit. Too many businesses in this country seem to be working for the benefit of the government—working for the benefit of a range of government departments and pen pushers—rather than to the benefit of the economy overall. We need to change that. Cutting company tax and business taxes will be a massive step in the right direction.

"Paterson, Sen James",LP,2018-02-07,"



Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (16:20):  I find myself yet again following Senator Bernardi in a debate about economic matters. I thank him for bringing this very important economic matter to the attention of the chamber today because he's absolutely right. The case for company tax cuts in Australia was already very, very strong, and no-one on this side of the chamber needed any further convincing, but, as Senator Bernardi has pointed out, the success of the Trump administration in legislating massive tax cuts for companies and individuals has brought that into even further and even starker vision for Australians.


We already knew that Australia's corporate tax rate was high and uncompetitive. We already knew that it was way out of step with the OECD and becoming increasingly out of step every single year. As major OECD nations like the United Kingdom, Ireland, France and others continued to cut and reduce their corporate income tax, Australia's became increasingly out of step, high and uncompetitive. From the most recent statistics, even before taking into account the US tax cuts, Australia was in the top handful of high corporate tax rates in the OECD—only Germany, Belgium, France and the United States were higher. As we know, very shortly the United States will be lower. There are many countries below Australia in that OECD list of rankings that you wouldn't normally think of as having lower and more-competitive corporate tax rates than Australia, particularly Scandinavian countries such as Sweden and Denmark, and the Netherlands and Luxembourg, but it's true that Australia's corporate income tax rate is even higher than those.


But we already knew all of that, and we knew that courtesy of people like Ken Henry, who in his review of the taxation system for the Rudd government identified the corporate tax rate as being very high and uncompetitive almost a decade ago—and it has only become more so in the years since. He also identified that, of all the taxes that the Australian government levies, the company tax is one of the least efficient—that is, the deadweight loss, the loss to the Australian economy, of raising $1 of revenue through the corporate income tax makes it one of the least efficient ones compared to others. It causes more displacement, it causes more ill effects and it reduces economic activity more than dollars raised from other forms of taxation.


So there was already a pretty compelling case from Ken Henry, there was already a pretty compelling case from where we stand in the OECD and there was even a very articulate case made in recent years by none other than Bill Shorten and Chris Bowen, when they were in government, for the need to cut the corporate tax rate in Australia. We already knew from historical records that when nations, including Australia, cut the corporate tax rate it stimulated economic activity, increased investment, increased jobs and flowed through to higher wages. We know from economic research that all of this is true. But now we have a very powerful real-world example from a very relevant neighbour and friend of Australia, the United States. It has put this issue into very, very stark focus.


The United States has legislated massive corporate and personal income tax cuts. This is relevant to Australia not only because the United States is the world's largest economy, and that's obviously an important factor, and not only because the United States is a competitor for global capital—and a competitive corporate tax rate is an important means by which we will compete with countries like the United States for global capital—but also because the United States is by far and away the largest foreign investor in Australia. Why is that important? Why is it important that the largest foreign investor in Australia has just cut its corporate tax rate? An investor in the United States who invests in countries like the United States and Australia, in contemplating where they're going to make their big investment next year, deciding between an equivalent investment in Australia and the United States, will now know that they can get a relatively better return on that investment in the United States than they would have received in Australia, because the corporate tax rate in the United States is now going to be considerably lower, at 21 per cent, than Australia's rate of 30 per cent for large companies. So that investor will think, 'Previously, I might have invested in Australia.' The corporate tax rate in Australia used to be 30 per cent compared to the United States' 35 per cent, where they would get, relatively speaking, a better return on an equal investment because of Australia's lower company tax rate. But now that same investor making that same choice will be much more sympathetic and more likely to invest at home in the United States, given there is a nine per cent advantage in the corporate tax rate in the United States. So by far and away our largest source of foreign investment in this country—those investors—will now be contemplating whether or not Australia remains a good destination for investment.


If we were to lose that investment or even if that investment was to decline slightly, that would have profound implications for Australians. We want foreign investment and we particularly want foreign investment from likeminded, close nations like the United States. It is a good thing when they come here and invest. When they come here and invest, they do so to create jobs, to create employment, and they provide products and services to Australian citizens, and we benefit from that. So it is vitally important that Australia has a company tax rate which is at least in the ballpark of the United States' company tax rate—let alone being way, way above it, as it will now be if we don't take action, if this parliament doesn't legislate the government's enterprise tax plan.


We had a powerful example of the kinds of benefits that the United States will reap from the company tax cuts that the Trump administration has legislated. Wouldn't it be nice if Australians could enjoy these benefits too? I will read from a selected list of the companies that have announced the actions they are going to take after the Trump administration decided to reduce its corporate tax rate. One is American Airlines. After the Trump administration's tax reform bill passed Congress, they announced that a $1,000 bonus would be paid to all of their employees in the first quarter of 2018. AT&T, a major telecommunications company, announced a $1,000 bonus to more than 200,000 US employees, and is also going to invest an additional billion dollars in the United States in the 2018 year. The Bank of America Corporation announced a one-time bonus of $1,000 for US employees earning up to $150,000 a year, which amounts to about 145,000 employees. Boeing has announced $300 million in charitable giving, workplace development and workplace facility enhancements. There are many others. 


Comcast, another major telecommunications company, announced a $1,000 bonus for more than 100,000 workers. They said they would hire thousands more employees and invest over $50 billion in infrastructure. Disney, the entertainment company, announced a one-time $1,000 cash bonus for its more than 125,000 employees. ExxonMobil announced $50 billion in new US investments over the next five years. FedEx announced over $200 million in pay rises, about two-thirds of which will go to hourly team members—they are, the employees who are on the lowest wages—and they'll contribute $1.5 billion to the company's pension plan, which will ultimately go to its workers upon their retirement.


JP Morgan announced it would hire 4,000 new employees and open up to 400 new Chase branches, including increasing the minimum wage from $15 an hour to $18 an hour for 22,000 of their employees. Lowe's, a major department store, announced up to a $1,000 bonuses for more than 260,000 employees. They said they would expand their maternity and parental leave benefits. UPS, the distribution company, said they were going to invest $5 billion dollars in their pension plans and $7 billion dollars in a new smart logistics network. Visa announced they would hike their 401K—the equivalent of superannuation for US workers, the rate at which they match their contributions—from six per cent to 10 per cent. These are all the really tangible benefits from major US companies to their employees, to their shareholders and to Americans who will benefit from this increased investment. Wouldn't it be nice if Australia could share in these benefits too? The truth is that we could share in these benefits. 


I want to share the announcement of one other company, which is Apple. Apple has announced that they are going to bring back the vast majority of their hundreds of billions of dollars of offshore cash into the United States. They estimate that they have $269 billion of cash outside the United States, and they're going to bring that back onshore. That's going to have a couple of benefits. Obviously that money can then be invested in Apple's business in the United States, in their employees, returned to their shareholders, invested in new products, in R&D, but it is also going to result in a one-time tax payment to the US government of $38 billion. So, a tax cut by the US Congress is going to result in a massive once-off payment from Apple to the US government in the form of higher tax payments. Wouldn't it be nice if Australia could share in this? The answer is we can, and all it requires is for this chamber to take action in passing the government's enterprise tax plan.

"Ketter, Sen Christopher",ALP,2018-02-07,"



Senator KETTER
 (Queensland—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (16:30):  I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate on a matter of public importance on the issue of company tax rates. One of the things I do regret in relation to this debate is that the focus on the headline company tax rate often—in fact, always—obscures the true picture of the tax burden that companies face around the world, and I will expand on that later. 


I want to start off by looking at the fiscal position in Australia. We have a government that wants to go down the track of looking after the big end of town and providing tax cuts to companies in the order of $65 billion. But what is the fiscal context of that? If we look at the 2016-17 final budget outcome, we can see that, at that point, net debt had blown out by $147 billion under the government, having ballooned from $175 billion in September 2013, to $322 billion in the latest FBO figures. Gross debt at that time was at record highs, having crashed through half a trillion dollars for the first time in our history, with no peak in sight. The government's own budget papers showed that net debt would hit record highs at that point. That was the 2016-17 final budget outcome. 


Last year the Parliamentary Budget Office's national fiscal outlook came out in October, and what did it say about the situation at that point? The national fiscal outlook showed that the Commonwealth net debt was continuing to rise and would be at record highs for two more years; net debt had blown out by another $19.6 billion since last year's outlook, due to higher than expected deficits; the government's projected return to surplus relied on wages growth—and we know that wages growth is at record lows—and also relied on higher personal income tax revenue—heroic assumptions there; and a projected return to surplus relied on a period of faster growth in taxes than the 2001-06 period, when we know that the mining boom was in full swing. We also saw there that, under the government's watch, taxes would rise to the highest levels since before the GFC. 


Let's look at MYEFO and what the position was at that point in time. We know that, despite the minor improvements that were expected in the budget position, the budget deficit remains eight times larger than the $2.8 billion deficit in the government's first horror budget of 2014; net debt had blown out by $80 billion to $343 billion since 2014; economic growth is down on the back of families struggling to pay their bills and weaker household consumption; and the Liberals' return to surplus continues to rely on a $44 billion tax hike for middle Australia delivered in the budget from last year. So that is the fiscal position that this government is intending, many would argue, to make even worse, by virtue of a further raid on the fiscal position, by introducing the tax cuts.


Now let's look at the tax cuts in the United States, which Senator Bernardi has drawn attention to. We know that the IMF has come out and made some comments about the tax cuts there. There's an IMF report which points to the negative impact of the US tax cut package and what this would do to growth. I quote:


Due to the temporary nature of some of its provisions, the tax policy package is projected to lower growth for a few years from 2022 onwards.


This is from the IMF's World Economic Outlook for January 2018. I also note in passing that the Treasurer's own advice that he received on the $65 billion tax handout to big business showed that any benefits that would flow from that would be negligible at best and would not be felt for a very long time. So the Treasurer is ignoring the advice of his own Treasury. That IMF report that I referred to also calls for inclusive growth, which is something that Labor has been talking about for some time. All Australians need to enjoy the benefits of economic growth, not just the big end of town. Unfortunately, the government's policies on tax, wages and the social safety net make our economy less inclusive and more unequal.


I mentioned that focusing on this headline company tax rate is quite misleading. I also want to draw attention to the fact that currently, if you don't look at the headline rate and look at the average corporate tax rate, or the effective corporate tax rate, Australia looks much better, if you are looking at it from Senator Bernardi's perspective. I'm relying on Congressional Budget Office figures that were prepared on corporate tax rates in G20 countries back in 2012, so they are a little bit old, but many of the figures are quite relevant. At that point in time, the average corporate tax rate in Australia was listed at 17 per cent. There are only three countries in the G20 table that are below that level of average corporate tax rate. When you look at the effective corporate tax rate, which many commentators talk about from time to time, Australia is in the middle of the pack of the G20 countries, at about 10.4 per cent.


There are a range of factors that need to be looked at that the debate at the moment tends to obscure. We're yet to see any facts that back up the scare campaign from the coalition that, if we don't do something about corporate tax rates, capital investment will go elsewhere and multinational companies won't come to Australia and those that are here will leave. I believe that multinational companies have an extremely sophisticated approach when it comes to analysing the tax burden that they face in any of the countries in which they operate. They're not just going to look at the headline tax rate; they're going to look at the overall burden of tax which will confront them. As we can see from those figures, the real level of tax that companies are paying is quite different to the headline level.


There are a whole range of other factors that need to be taken into account when one looks at this issue of the tax burden. The differences in our health systems, for example, are quite an important factor. We know that in the US it's companies that face the burden of paying for the health system, whereas in Australia the taxpayer picks up that. That is something that is obscured in this debate. We also have a rather unique system in Australia of dividend imputation, which ensures that dividends are not taxed twice. The overall burden of tax is something that's quite sophisticated. I don't think that the public is done any favours if we are just going to focus on one aspect of the overall picture and not look at the full level of the impact of tax across the country.


If the coalition is serious about debt and deficit, they should stop looking after the big end of town. They should stop refusing to take action to stop corporate tax dodgers. They should look at negative gearing and capital gains tax. There's a growing list of supporters for Labor's policy of addressing those distortions, including the IMF, the OECD, ACOSS, CEDA, the former RBA governor Glenn Stevens, Jeff Kennett and Mike Baird. All of them understand that these are distortions which need to be addressed. They could look at trust tax policy, and they really have taken a lacklustre approach to productivity reform. Cutting penalty rates has not created jobs and it has impacted on consumer spending. Fundamentally, Labor believes it's irresponsible to spend $65 billion on the big end of town when wages growth is historically low and cost of living is weighing heavily on low- and middle-income households.

"Anning, Sen Fraser",IND,2018-02-07,"



Senator ANNING
 (Queensland) (16:40):  Mr Acting Deputy President, this is not my first speech. I rise to speak on today's matter of public importance and the need for the Australian parliament to provide significant and meaningful tax relief to Australian businesses.


An immediate cut to the company tax rate is essential in the interests of boosting jobs and investment and Australia's international competitiveness, and yet there is resistance. The opposition have not always been so short-sighted. Those of us who are old enough can remember the Hawke and Keating era of relatively business-friendly, responsible Labor government. However, an enthusiastic revival of the antibusiness policies and collectivist sentiments of the Whitlam era has seen Labor devolve to the harebrained business-wrecking approach previously cast aside. We have seen unnecessary opposition to reasonable policies that will result in benefits for all Australians.


Economic history remembers that in a not-so-distant past, meaningful cuts by none other than Labor themselves resulted in company tax rates tumbling from 49 per cent to 33 per cent. Australians reaped the benefits of those tax cuts, seeing, in conjunction with a number of factors, a marked increase in GDP from the late eighties. In 2010 Gillard promised to cut company tax rates, with the then Treasurer, Wayne Swan, saying:


Reducing company tax will create new jobs and grow the economy right around the country …


At the time, Mr Swan also stated that he was open to a reduction in the rates from the current 30 per cent to 25 per cent, exactly what we see being proposed today. Mr Shorten himself has previously criticised the Greens for their opposition to similar so-called big business tax cuts proposed by Labor.


Why has Labor abandoned this responsible approach? Maybe the idea of hypocrisy is lost on those opposite, because they now argue that the company tax cuts are unaffordable and that the whole concept is ridiculous. They have called it wasteful and flawed, and labelled it as trickle-down economics and a giveaway that will have negligible effect on job creation. I have to say I am deeply disappointed in the Labor Party for taking such a cynical position. The argument previously used by successive Labor governments to support tax cuts in the eighties, nineties and 2000 applies equally today. A reduction in the corporate tax rate will grow the economy, and the benefit to GDP is at least one per cent after the budget cuts are included. It will total many billions of dollars.


Outside Australia what we have seen since 2000 is a global downward trend in company tax rates which continues to widen the gap between Australia and many other countries. Yet successive governments haven't implemented any meaningful cuts. Our current rate of 30 per cent is amongst some of the highest rates around the globe. It is uncompetitive, plain and simple. It's higher than the OECD average, higher than the Asian average, higher even than the European average and, surprisingly, higher than the 'socialist union' average—excuse me—the European Union average.


What we need in this place is for those opposite to support meaningful tax relief for Australian businesses. The cut to the corporate tax rate similar to the US will see an increase in Australian competitiveness on the global stage and flow-on benefits to businesses and workers in equal measure. Lockheed Martin, the world's largest defence contractor, is earmarking for its pension program some of its exceptional expected windfall as a result of President Trump's tax cuts. The company has also come out and stated it is going to increase its commitment to initiatives like employee training, charitable contributions and education in science and math. Additionally, AT&T have reported they have some more flexibility as a result of the tax cuts. I call on the Labor opposition to close their ears to the socialist siren song of the Greens and not to allow the economy to be drawn onto the rocks of business-wrecking high taxes. Channel your inner Paul Keating and support business tax cuts.

"Hume, Sen Jane",LP,2018-02-07,"



Senator HUME
 (Victoria) (16:45):  I also rise today to speak in response to the matter of public importance submitted to the Senate by our parliamentary colleague Senator Bernardi. Senator Bernardi is correct: this is a matter of public importance, and there is a pressing need for parliament to provide significant tax relief for Australian businesses. The only thing standing in the way of parliament doing just that is the obstinacy, the obstructiveness, the recalcitrance and the political self-interest of the Labor Party.


The verdict is in: company tax cuts create opportunities for Australian businesses to invest, to grow and to employ. The Turnbull coalition government has already delivered tax cuts to 3.2 million small and medium businesses, giving them the flex to grow their businesses and create more and better-paid jobs. And the results couldn't be clearer. More than 400,000 new jobs have been created in the past year alone, and 300,000 of those are full-time. There have been 15 consecutive months of jobs growth. That's the longest consecutive run of jobs growth on record. The participation rate is at its highest in seven years and, on average, 178,000 jobs were advertised each week in January alone. That's up 6.2 per cent. That's the strongest monthly increase in eight years. So the results are irrefutable: get the policy settings right and the economic benefits will follow.


Despite an economy disrupted by the transition from a reliance on the mining boom, the laws of supply and demand still apply. Continued jobs growth will eat into capacity in the economy and put upward pressures on wages. We have already seen above-average wages growth in the fastest-growing sectors of the economy, such as health care and education. And this is what the coalition are all about: more jobs and better-paying jobs for all Australians. But you must get the policy settings right.


Whether it be through crazy, snake-oil-salesman economic thinking, political expedience that panders to the Left-Green flank of the Labor Party, the politics of envy, the politics of grievance or just plain old belligerence and an inability to concede the obvious, the Labor Party has resisted time and time again the opportunity to step up, to do the right thing by the Australian people and to demonstrate that it cares about the prosperity of future generations. But it's not too late. Labor can still support the coalition's proposed second tranche of company tax cuts and give Australians the very best chance at a thriving economy, more jobs and better-paying jobs.


I hope that the better angels of the Labor Party will win this argument, but I fear that, with Mr Shorten at the helm, there is little hope of that. As the Prime Minister so rightly noted yesterday in the other place, the reality of it is this: the Leader of the Opposition hates business. And, since it is business and not government that is ultimately the best at creating jobs, joining the dots, one could rightly infer the Leader of the Opposition hates new jobs.


Prior to January the United States had the highest corporate tax rate of any country in the OECD. However, President Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, slashing those corporate tax rates from 35 per cent to 21 per cent. When he did that, he showed the United States is indeed open for business. Meanwhile, however, Australia is languishing with the fourth-highest corporate tax rate in the OECD. The coalition government's enterprise tax plan will cut our corporate tax rate to 25 per cent for all businesses, making Australia more competitive with countries like the USA, like the UK and like Singapore. Without that second tranche of the enterprise tax plan, our international competitiveness will be put at risk. I note that Senator Ketter quoted the IMF World Economic Outlook, but he failed to mention that that same report identified a significant threat to Australian GDP as a result of the decreased competitiveness in the face of the US tax cuts. Treasury, however, have reported that the loss of GDP as a result of President Trump's tax cut could, in effect, be offset by the implementation of the government's enterprise tax plan.


Put simply, inertia is not an option. Our economy is under threat, but it is a threat that can be mitigated. Only the obstinacy of Labor stands in Australia's way. Even in the context of the opposition's rhetoric of inequality and fairness, this obstinacy is entirely unjustified. Recent economic research from Germany has demonstrated that not only does cutting corporate tax lead to jobs growth but those who are helped the most are those that stand to benefit the most: women, young workers and low-skilled workers. This, in turn, will help redress economic inequality, an issue about which the Labor Party purportedly cares so very deeply.


The fact is that even the opposition don't really need convincing of the benefits of company tax cuts because they already know. Professor Richard Holden, who is a go-to economist for the Labor Party, has stated the coalition enterprise tax plan is reform that 'deserves across-the-board political support when it comes before parliament again this year.' Furthermore, Professor Holden also asserted:


Cutting the Australian company tax rate from 30 per cent to 25 per cent is not just good for business, and workers. It is also helps to redress economic inequality.


The opposition leader apes Jeremy Corbyn and Bernie Sanders with that class warfare rhetoric, asserting that the coalition's enterprise tax plan is nothing more than a gift to the top end of town. I don't want to insult Jeremy Corbyn or Bernie Sanders because, for all their radical socialist tendencies, at least they actually believe in what they say. It wasn't so long ago that Mr Shorten himself said:


Reducing the corporate tax rate … sees more capital flowing into our domestic economy, which will then flow on to workers in the form of higher wages—thereby improving standards of living.


Similarly, the shadow Treasurer, Chris Bowen, has also previously stated:


It's a Labor thing to have the ambition of reducing company tax, because it promotes investment, creates jobs and drives growth.


These are the very same people who now threaten small- and medium-sized businesses, telling them that a Shorten-led Labor government would legislate to reverse the first round of company tax cuts that they supported only last year.


What has changed for these new apostles of socialism? At which point did they divest their party of the legacy of Keating and Hawke and move so far to the left that they could make Lenin blush? This is the most anti-business, anti-growth, anti-jobs opposition we have seen since Whitlam. The parliament knows it, economists know it, the media commentators know it, the business community know it and the Australian people know it. We expect such economic nonsense from the Greens, who dwell on the fringe, but you are a party auditioning to govern. You have abandoned your tradition, you have abandoned your principles, you have abandoned Australian workers who want more jobs and better-paid jobs and, by denying our economy every opportunity to grow and flourish, you abandoned your chances of winning the election for years and years to come.


You can man the barricades all you like. You can man the barricades. You can storm the Winter Palace with your rhetoric, your politics of envy and your economics of snake oil, but Australians know the truth: it is Labor that stands in the way of cuts that will keep Australia competitive, that will grow the economy, that will allow—




Senator O'Neill:

Senator HUME:
  I ignored you perfectly well the first time, Senator O'Neill; you don't need to repeat yourself. These tax cuts will keep Australia competitive, will grow the economy, will allow businesses to invest and employ, and will create more and better-paying jobs. The Leader of the Opposition and this marching band of incompetents and sycophants have no plan to grow the economy, they have no plan to boost wages and they have no plan to create jobs.

"Lines, Sen Susan",ALP,2018-02-07,"



Senator LINES
 (Western Australia—Deputy President and Chair of Committees) (16:54):  I'm pleased to follow Senator Hume, because we can put some facts on the table. The MPI today from Senator Bernardi urges the Australian government or the Australian people to follow in the wake of Mr Donald Trump, the President of the United States, in terms of tax cuts. 


I can't imagine that Senator Bernardi really believes this, because what we've seen in the US is that a significant number of top US companies are using those tax cuts to restructure their businesses and sack workers. Let's put a truth on the table—no rhetoric, no fluff, no spin: a truth. The company Kimberley-Clark, who make the tissues and the nappies, are using their tax savings—gleefully triumphed by those opposite—to restructure their business to sack workers and cut a staggering 5,000 to 5½ thousand  jobs. That's what Kimberley-Clark are doing with their tax money. They're not the only ones. Walmart is also in the business of using its tax cuts to sack workers. When Senator Bernardi put this proposition to the Senate, surely he did not mean we should emulate those US companies and start to sack Australian workers with a tax cut? But he's not here to defend himself, so I don't know. Maybe he missed this. It's been in the media for the last couple of weeks that US companies are using the tax cut to sack workers. I don't know how he missed it; certainly I didn't. Those are the facts there; that's what is happening in the US. 


Today we found out that just nine per cent of top US companies are actually using those tax cuts to share with workers and customers. We are always hearing from the government that somehow trickle-down economics still works. But the trickle-down ends in the boss's pocket. That's where it ends; it trickles down to the boss's pockets. Never have we seen any trickle-down ending up benefiting workers. Never in my 20-odd years as a union official did I ever see that. Every wage increase won by the workers of United Voice was hard fought by them. In the days of enterprise bargaining, they traded off to get wage increases. 


Let's have a look at what's happening here in Australia. One of the things Labor has consistently raised, over and over again, is: let's go after the companies who are not paying tax. Before we give hard-earned dollars to the big end of town, let's see which companies are not paying tax. Well, 732 companies who last year had a collective income of over $500 billion paid no tax at all in Australia. How shameful. What we see from the Turnbull government is this banging on about, 'We need to give tax cuts to big business.' Actually, what we need to do is make sure that the 732 companies who paid not one cent in tax last year in Australia start paying their fair share. 


All of us in this place who are PAYE taxpayers—the same as Australian workers—are paying our fair share of tax. I don't have a problem with paying tax, because I know that it goes to our hospitals, to our schools, to Medicare and to a whole range of government services that I value. I see that it is the role of government to provide these services. But it annoys me—it beyond annoys me—when 732 companies who operate in this country, who made $500 billion last year in income, paid not one cent of tax. 


I want to go back to Glencore. As I said earlier in this place, I was really shocked and very disappointed to see a senior member of the government attack workers in the gallery yesterday. All those workers did was vote against their enterprise agreement, and their company, Glencore, locked them out. They've been locked out for more than 200 days. That has set a record in Australia. Let's have a look at Glencore. They declared $18.3 billion in income—$18.3 billion—and here they are arguing with their workers, locking them out for more than 200 days. How much tax have they paid? Not one cent. So, they've locked out their workforce, they've paid not one cent in tax and yet they've earnt $18.3 billion. Yesterday a senior member of the government attacked two workers in the gallery. I'm happy to stand corrected but as yet I have not seen an apology from that man who attacked workers. What a disgrace. But we shouldn't be surprised, because that's what the Turnbull government excels at: attacking workers, attacking unions. But yesterday was a new low—they went right down to workers. 


Thankfully, the ATO is after Glencore. To put more facts on the table: the 732 companies that I'm talking about paid no tax in Australia and, in the 2015-16 financial year, their collective income was more than $500 billion. That's not some made-up, left-wing jargon. That's not some airy-fairy figure plucked out of nowhere. That's in the dataset on corporate tax released by the Australian tax office. That tax evasion by companies like Glencore and Chevron is on the public record for anyone to see. But, rather than look there, the Turnbull government, who we know always looks after its mates at the big end of town, is simply saying, 'No, we'll give you a tax cut.' Well, these companies don't need a tax cut; they need to pay their fair share. If they were fair dinkum Australian-managed companies, they would pay their fair share, because Australians still believe in a fair share. I think the ATO went after Chevron for two or three years, and they owed millions of dollars. Now it seems that they've been caught out, but not before a showdown, not before the ATO had to invest millions of dollars in pursuing Chevron simply to pay what it should be paying in this country—its fair share. 


People are talking about tax cuts and the Prime Minister is going on about how trickle-down economics works, when it doesn't, but we've got record low wage growth in this country that all manner of experts are worried about. It's no longer an issue just for trade unions; we've got business leaders in this country saying, 'In order to get our economy moving, we need workers to earn money.' We don't need them being locked out by Glencore, who paid no tax, or having to bargain for 12 months or more to get a one or two per cent increase. They should have a fair share put into their pockets. But companies never do that willingly. They need governments to take the lead. We need the Turnbull government to start to take the lead and talk the sort of language that companies need to hear—that is: when you're making profits, you share with the people who made the profits for you. 


The managing director or CEO of a company getting millions of dollars a year in income is not the one making the money for that company; it's the workers putting in the hard yards. That's who's making the profits for those companies, and it is time those profits were shared. I don't begrudge anyone making a lot of money—good on them—as long as they're paying their fair share, as long as they're paying what they should be and not having a free ride on the backs of workers, because that is not fair. BlueScope Steel—there's another one; Sydney Airport—another one; Toll Holdings; and Transurban are all companies we hear a lot about and that most Australians would have heard about at one time or another that are not paying proper tax in this country. It is time for the government to focus on tax avoidance and getting big companies to pay their fair share. Big companies who've made $500 billion in profits need to start paying what they owe. They're the facts on the table. Never mind a tax cut for the big end of town; let's get these companies paying their fair share so that we can put it into services, and workers can start to get a fair share of it, not the one or two per cent wage increases that are being doled out—and workers should not be locked out by a company such as Glencore that's paid not a cent of tax in this country.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2018-02-07,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (17:04):  Today, we are talking about the need to cut company tax rates. For years the Liberal Democrats have talked about the new jobs and higher wages that would come from cutting the company tax rate. But we have to change this message. It is no longer so much about winning new or higher-paying jobs. It's about keeping our current, poorly paid jobs. The message of hope is less relevant. Unfortunately, it is fear for our jobs that needs to motivate us now. 


In 2003, the worldwide average corporate tax rate was 30 per cent. That's our current rate. In 2016, measured across 202 tax jurisdictions, the corporate tax rate was 23 per cent. It's now 19 per cent in the UK and 17 per cent in Singapore. It's 12.5 per cent in Ireland. And now the United States has cut its company tax rate, and the federal rate there is now 21 per cent. Even socialist countries like France are cutting their company tax rates to below ours. As a result, the great majority of the countries of the world charge companies far less than Australia does for the privilege of investing in their countries. So the great majority of the world's investment is passing Australia by, along with the jobs and wage growth that come with it. And it will only get worse while our company tax rate remains stuck at 30 per cent, notwithstanding the minor concessions for small businesses. 


We need to live in the real world. Lamenting, ignoring or quibbling about the lower company tax rates in the rest of the world won't make them rise back up to Australia's rate, and it won't make foreigners invest here instead of elsewhere. Our current jobs, as unsatisfying as they may be, are at risk if we stand still. Not for me or others who suckle on the taxpayers' teat, but for the six in seven employees who work in the private sector in Australia. Those who refuse to acknowledge the connection between attracting company investment and the employment and wages offered by companies are either stupid or devious. Either way, they are traitors to the everyday Australians we are supposed to represent.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2018-02-07,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (17:07):  I am always suspicious of simple solutions to complex problems, and the proposal put forward by Senator Bernardi is a doozy. Does the senator realise a lower tax rate equals lower franking credits and less money in the hands of self-funded retirees and those saving for the future? One Nation has already supported tax rate cuts for businesses with a turnover of up to $50 million, but I draw the line at that. What we need are incentives for businesses to invest in Australia and tax rate cuts are not the answer.


Today we have been asked to agree with the suggestion that failure to lower business income tax rates like the United States will mean we are going to be uncompetitive. By that, I mean that existing businesses will leave Australia for countries with lower tax rates or that other businesses will not come to Australia. Foreign owned multinationals don't consider corporate income tax rates in their investment decisions, because they don't expect to pay any tax in Australia. It is just too easy to contrive a paper loss or a non-taxable income. Lowering business income tax rates will not make Australia an attractive destination for investment unless government delivers globally competitive electricity and gas prices. We also need labour reform. We have a $600 billion debt and no prospect of paying it back because this government and the previous Labor government have no appetite to collect tax from foreign owned multinationals which often pay more in political donations than they do in corporate income tax. The truth is Australia could compete for investment if only the two major political parties had the real interests of Australian citizens at heart. Instead, the prefer to spend their time and energy on silly games and pursuing private agendas.


It is an attractive idea to think someone else has already solved Australia's economic problem, but let us be clear: the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law by President Trump only started on 1 January this year. It will take time to see what it achieves. It does introduce a 21 per cent tax rate at a federal level, but many states in America also have corporate income tax law, so, really, the business tax rate in the United States will be about 26 per cent. A tax rate comparison between countries is ridiculous when the new system in America restricts deductions but in Australia deductions are unlimited. The new company tax system in America provides huge incentives in terms of capital write-offs to encourage things to be made in America.


Central to the reform of the United States tax code is departure from the international tax system, which taxes companies on their worldwide income. The American Congress wants to end the shell game multinationals play so well where profits are moved from one country to another and end up in a tax haven. It is alright screaming for a reduction in Australian company tax, but make it in relation to other countries around the world what they're paying—understand their tax system. I know for certain that most of the senators in this place have no understanding of the tax system and how it works. I am learning. I don't know everything but I have an adviser who has worked in the system for 20 years and I've learnt a lot.

Senator KITCHING
 (Victoria) (17:11):  by leave—I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to Singapore, Myanmar and Indonesia, which took place from 2 July to 13 July 2017. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the document.


Leave granted.




Senator KITCHING:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


It's a pleasure to have this opportunity to speak on the report of the parliamentary delegation which visited Singapore, Myanmar and Indonesia in July of last year, of which I was the deputy leader. I want to begin by thanking my fellow delegation members: the Hon. Kevin Andrews MP, Mr Ken O'Dowd MP and Ms Cathy O'Toole MP. Although we hold a range of political views we worked well together as a delegation, and I'm pleased we were able to present this unanimous report to the parliament. I now know their middle names, because at some of the places we went to in Indonesia they put up our full names, including our middle names, so I do feel I know them reasonably well. I would also like to thank Dr Cameron Hill, who performed the duties of the secretariat of the mission, all of the Australian missions and the staff at those missions and the attaches. They did everything they could to make the delegation a success and as smooth-running as possible.


We visited these three ASEAN states at a crucial time in the evolution of Australian foreign policy. In each one of them we saw in real time, as it were, the issues which were addressed or, in some cases, perhaps, not addressed in the government's new foreign policy white paper. These issues include the rise of China's economic, political and strategic power in our region; the role of the United States as an ally and guarantor of the region's security; the increasing challenges to the ideals of democracy, human rights and secularism, which Australia has promoted in the region; the threats of terrorism and of ethnic and religious conflict; the challenge of refugees and population movement; and the escalating threat of climate change to food security and economic progress.


The dominant narrative in Australia about our ASEAN nations over the past few decades has been of their rapid rise to prosperity and, perhaps not in all cases but in some, to democracy. There is a lot of truth to this narrative, as we can see when we compare, for example, the Indonesia of today with the Indonesia of the Suharto era, but the picture is far from uniform. Of ASEAN's 10 members, only Indonesia and the Philippines are fully-functioning multiparty democracies. Vietnam and Laos are communist party regimes, Thailand is under military rule and Brunei is an absolute monarchy. Malaysia and Singapore have each been ruled by a single party since before independence. Cambodia is succumbing to authoritarian rule, and Myanmar is making a difficult transition from decades of military despotism. Even in Indonesia and the Philippines we can see disturbing trends: increasing authoritarianism, and ethnic and religious conflict. The three countries we visited vividly illustrated the great political and economic diversity of the ASEAN countries.


In the limited time I have left—and I would urge senators to read the report or perhaps to participate in the upcoming ASEAN delegation—I want to go to some of the matters we saw. We started in Singapore. We were greeted with great depth and a really great openness by both the Singaporean departments we visited, the foreign affairs department and the defence department, and also by the politicians we met. We did run into the Prime Minister in a lift and then later had a meeting with him. We ran into him in the lift as he was running into the chamber, so we all had some sympathy for him!


We also went to the Kranji War Memorial and paid respects to those who were buried there. We laid crosses made by school children from our respective states at some of the graves, and it was an incredibly moving experience.


I want to go to some of the other programs we saw. In Indonesia we went not only to Jakarta but also to Surabaya and Malang. In those cities we saw the difference we are making through a water sanitation program. While we were there we visited a household where the husband and father of that household had died recently because the water system there is so polluted. In fact, many people who still wash or wash clothing in that water system die from disease. Obviously, this is a country not that far away from us. This is a great program that the Australian government is rolling out— (Time expired)

Senator BARTLETT
 (Queensland) (17:18):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of the documents.


These documents all relate to Commonwealth Ombudsman's reports regarding people who are in immigration detention for prolonged periods of time.


These are immigration issues covered very effectively for the Greens by my colleagues Senator McKim and, prior to that, Senator Hanson-Young. I speak about them partly because it has become a bit of a theme for me in the few months since I've been back here: it is impossible to ignore how ongoing and unresolved some problems are. The process of these assessments by the Commonwealth Ombudsman under section 486O of the Migration Act relates to people who are in prolonged detention. My memory might be wrong on this, but I'm fairly sure that these occurred when I was in this chamber over 10 years ago. It was certainly put in place during the era of the Howard government in recognition that there were failings in our immigration detention system because people were in detention for very long periods of time without adequate oversight of their situation and without proper monitoring of whether adequate steps were being taken to resolve their situation. It might not have directly stemmed from it, but it certainly gives me cause to remember the period when former Senator Amanda Vanstone was the immigration minister and we had what was a major scandal when an Australian citizen, Vivian Solon, was not only detained but then deported to the Philippines, and Cornelia Rau, another Australian resident—certainly with a valid visa—was detained for a long period of time in immigration detention completely unlawfully. It was sufficiently bad, in conjunction with other things, that the then minister recognised that there was a cultural problem. Those were the words she used. There was a 'cultural problem' in the immigration department. Clearly it was no fault of the government at the time, so it seemed, but a problem of culture in the department. They put in place various mechanisms to try to ensure it didn't happen again.


Clearly what we're seeing is a deliberate application of a culture from the very top down, from the minister via a horrendous new, militarised, antimigration regime under Home Affairs and flowing on from the so-called border protection department. It is now the megadepartment of Home Affairs, complete with nice black militaristic-looking uniforms, deliberately imposing a culture of locking people up for as long as possible and causing as much harm for as long as possible. We had a debate in this chamber yesterday about the inhumanity—the clear, undeniable evidence of massive suffering inflicted on people offshore because of the detention regime. There are plenty of independent reports to look at that and to detail that. It is still important to remember that there are still people in Australia right now who are suffering and being made to suffer as part of what I would say is a much deeper cultural problem and one that has been knowingly created. It's no surprise we are now seeing people being wrongfully detained yet again as part of that. There is a complete lack of care about that fact.


To look at a couple of the cases here—and they're summarised in the Ombudsman's report—the first couple of people have been in detention for seven years. We're getting to the stage where, for nearly all of the 10-year period when I was not in this chamber, people have been locked up in immigration detention and still are. The Ombudsman, of course, doesn't have power to release people. It has a power to make recommendations. Of course, the other documents tabled as part of this give the minister's or the government's response to the Ombudsman's assessment and recommendation. I think I'm correct, in flipping through them all, that there are about 18 in one report and another nine in the other, so that is close to 30 people. Not all of them have been detained for seven years or more, but all of them have been for a very long time. There are 100 assessments referring to 135 people who've been in immigration detention for over two years. For all of them, I think—certainly the vast majority—the Ombudsman's recommendation has been ignored.


This is the situation we're facing now in our country. This is a deliberate state of affairs not just being perpetrated but continuing to be prosecuted with enthusiasm by the current minister. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

Clearly what we're seeing is a deliberate application of a culture from the very top down, from the minister via a horrendous new, militarised, antimigration regime under Home Affairs and flowing on from the so-called border protection department. It is now the megadepartment of Home Affairs, complete with nice black militaristic-looking uniforms, deliberately imposing a culture of locking people up for as long as possible and causing as much harm for as long as possible. We had a debate in this chamber yesterday about the inhumanity—the clear, undeniable evidence of massive suffering inflicted on people offshore because of the detention regime. There are plenty of independent reports to look at that and to detail that. It is still important to remember that there are still people in Australia right now who are suffering and being made to suffer as part of what I would say is a much deeper cultural problem and one that has been knowingly created. It's no surprise we are now seeing people being wrongfully detained yet again as part of that. There is a complete lack of care about that fact.


To look at a couple of the cases here—and they're summarised in the Ombudsman's report—the first couple of people have been in detention for seven years. We're getting to the stage where, for nearly all of the 10-year period when I was not in this chamber, people have been locked up in immigration detention and still are. The Ombudsman, of course, doesn't have power to release people. It has a power to make recommendations. Of course, the other documents tabled as part of this give the minister's or the government's response to the Ombudsman's assessment and recommendation. I think I'm correct, in flipping through them all, that there are about 18 in one report and another nine in the other, so that is close to 30 people. Not all of them have been detained for seven years or more, but all of them have been for a very long time. There are 100 assessments referring to 135 people who've been in immigration detention for over two years. For all of them, I think—certainly the vast majority—the Ombudsman's recommendation has been ignored.


This is the situation we're facing now in our country. This is a deliberate state of affairs not just being perpetrated but continuing to be prosecuted with enthusiasm by the current minister. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (19:20):  The Kimberley in Western Australia's north is by every definition grand: it's grand in its size and its scope, it's grand in its perspective and natural beauty, and it's grand in its possibility. Larger than 75 per cent of the world's countries, the Kimberley is a wild land, hemmed in by impenetrable coastline and unforgiving deserts, a severe climate, sparse population and minimal infrastructure. That is why life in the Kimberley is not for the faint-hearted, but for those who choose to call it home there is no greater place to live, work or raise a family. 


There are no greater guardians of the Kimberley than the people who call it their home. Tonight I would like to pay tribute to one of those great guardians, a woman whose influence, ebullience and big heart has held the people of the Kimberley in good stead for almost three decades. Elsia Archer has served in local government for nearly 30 years and became an outstanding champion in Western Australia's north-west. As president of the Shire of Derby-West Kimberley, she presided over almost 20 years of ups and downs in the region and has always been a steady and passionate voice. 


Elsia campaigned to improve health and youth services in the West Kimberley long before such issues became prominent in our national agenda and certainly before they entered the national conversation. She fought to have a culturally appropriate prison built in Derby so Aboriginal people in custody were able to remain on their land rather than be transferred to a prison in the south of the state. She was instrumental in securing funding for the refurbishment of Derby Airport, which, at a time of economic and social decline in the West Kimberley, is paramount to reinstating Perth to Derby flight services. 


She has been a leading voice in supporting local artists. The shire's Kimberley Creative Visual Arts Month is a stand-out event for Western Australia every year, with artists converging on the Kimberley to showcase their work and attracting people from the Australian arts industry. Elsia says:


The Kimberley Art Prize showcases some fantastic works each year and the quality of entries just gets better and better.


Our standard is set because of Elsia's nurturing of existing and emerging artists across the Kimberley region. 


Time spent in regional Western Australia is always a meaningful and joyful experience. I've paid countless visits to WA's far north, and these were always made more special whenever I was able to spend time with Elsia and hear about her various causes. Whether we were visiting Indigenous communities or shooting the breeze beside a livestock pen, I saw firsthand the determination and generosity for which she is known. You can always recognise authenticity in a person, and Elsia is as straight a shooter as they come in the west, with a genuine love of the Kimberley. 


The community spirit she forged over decades, underpinned by inclusiveness, diversity and celebration of residents from all walks of life as well as the promotion of cultural events, will remain forever unparalleled. Of everything she has achieved, she has said the most significant was moving the West Kimberley Regional Prison to Derby. She reflected on this achievement, saying: 


… it was a real high for the community. It brought families into town, children into school and created more jobs for locals …


Few truly understand the adage that 'all politics is local' better than Elsia does. Her focus always was to be the best voice she could be for the Kimberley and for its broad community. For her exceptional contribution, the Western Australian Local Government Association recognised Elsia as an honorary life member. Late last year she stepped down as President of the Shire of Derby-West Kimberley. 


I would like to not only acknowledge Elsia's faithful service to the people of WA's north-west but celebrate her tireless effort, resounding energy and positive impact on the community. I am truly grateful for Elsia's professionalism throughout her career and the strong personal friendship she's shown to me over many years. You meet a lot of people in politics, and it must be said: Elsia is most definitely one of a kind. Elsia, your community honours you, your state thanks you and your country salutes you.
