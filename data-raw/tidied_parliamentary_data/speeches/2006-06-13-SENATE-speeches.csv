"PRESIDENT, The",N/A,2006-06-13,"—I inform the Senate of the death on 13 May 2006 of Mr Roy Edward Bullock OBE, a former Clerk of the Senate. Mr Bullock joined the Senate department in 1946 and served until 1980, holding the office of Clerk of the Senate in 1979 and 1980. On behalf of the Senate I have conveyed condolences to Mrs Bullock and her family, and I record our thanks to Mr Bullock for long and faithful service.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Mr Roy Edward Bullock OBE</title>,Condolences,0,1
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2006-06-13,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Senator Vanstone) to questions without notice asked today relating to skills shortages and to detention practices.
Senator Vanstone, in her public comments over the last week or so, has let the cat out of the bag. She has made it clear that one of the real agendas behind the government’s skilled migration policy—the increase of skilled guest workers in this country—is to suppress wages. She has confirmed again today in question time that one of the benefits of the government’s guest worker policy is that it helps suppress wage claims—the ones she regards as unreasonable.
We know that this government has an agenda that is all about downward pressure on wages. It is about seeking to drive down wages and conditions in this country. We know that that is the effect of the extreme industrial relations laws that this government has rammed through this parliament. The effect of these laws will be the seeking to lower the minimum wage in this country. We know, for example, that the government is imposing, through the delay in the so-called Fair Pay Commission considering the minimum wage claim, an effective wage freeze in this country for low-paid Australian workers because the Fair Pay Commission will not be considering this until spring this year, which is well over a year after the previous wage increase.
We also know that Professor Harper, the head of the Fair Pay Commission, has acknowledged that the government’s industrial relations legislation may well result in a lower minimum wage and we know for sure that, under this government’s extreme industrial relations changes, Australian workers can be required to trade away wages and conditions—such as overtime, penalty rates and rostering—for just 2c an hour. We know all of these things about the government’s industrial relations agenda and the effects it will have—that is, reducing wages, particularly those of the low paid in this country.
But this government is not content with simply imposing the parameters for lower wages on the poorest Australian workers through its industrial relations laws. The government also wants to ensure that employers have access to cheap sources of labour to undermine the wages and conditions of those workers in Australia who are lucky enough to be able, through their union or because of their position in the marketplace, to negotiate wages and conditions above the paltry minimum that this government seeks to impose. That is where the skilled migrant scheme comes in.
What we have seen from this government is a failure to train. The skills shortage we are experiencing in this country, particularly in the traditional trades, is a direct result of the Howard government’s failure to train Australians. I want to point out something, because in one of her answers Senator Vanstone decried Labor’s record on training. There was a particular Commonwealth minister who in 1996-97 proposed and presided over a reduction in Commonwealth training expenditure in 1997 and 1998. Which minister might that have been? Might it have been Senator Amanda Vanstone? Might it have been Senator Vanstone as Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs in 1996-97 who presided over a cut in Commonwealth training expenditure from $909 million to $904 million in 1998?
Because there was an attack on the Leader of the Opposition’s training record, can I also point out that as minister in 1992 he provided an additional $720 million over three years to grow the vocational education and training system in this country, which is about $925 million in today’s dollar terms. This government reduced VET grants in 1996-97 and abolished the National Skills Shortages Strategy in the 1997-98 budget. It has presided over a failure to train. As a result of that, we have a skills shortage that means that there are some workers in this country who, by virtue of having skills in demand, can negotiate, under certified agreements, higher wages and conditions than the minimum that this government seeks to impose through its industrial relations changes.
So what do the government do? They say: ‘We’ll get you too. We’ll make sure that these employers can bring in skilled workers who can be employed under the minimum conditions.’ So workers in this country get it every which way. They get it under the government’s extreme industrial relations laws, which are about reducing wages, as Professor Harper demonstrated and as the examples that we have cited, like Spotlight, have demonstrated. These industrial relations changes are effectively about reducing minimum wages in this country and, on top of that, the government are ensuring through their guest worker strategy that those workers who are able to negotiate higher wages and conditions above these minima have to compete with cheaper labour sources from overseas.

"Lightfoot, Sen Ross",LP,2006-06-13,"—Let’s look at the big picture about the skills shortage prevailing in Australia at the present moment. It is a pity we do lack skilled workers, but that is a manifestation of an economy that is working.
I recall that, when Labor was in power, the apprenticeship scheme had failed in every state. Why did it fail? It failed because the trade union movement did not like young people clogging up the system and working as what was seen by the trade union movement as cheap labour, because it could not extract the fee from apprentices that it could from a worker on full wages. That is why the coalition government, when we inherited the position we did in 1996 from the Labor Party, had to practically start from scratch and rebuild the skilled trades from the apprenticeship system that the Labor Party had failed to foster. One of the major reasons that we have skills shortages today is that the trade union movement put the kibosh on training young people back in the eighties and nineties. Of course, the big picture now is that instead of having one million people unemployed we have created well over one million jobs in the decade that we have been in power—the decade we have been in office; I understand that a subtle difference is that the Labor Party come to power and the Liberal coalition come to office.
I am qualified to speak on this point because I have been a member of the Australian Workers Union, the police union, the plasterers society, Actors Equity—some people say I should still be in the latter—and the Waterside Workers Federation. I know what the trade union movement is. I know that it only represents 11 per cent of private sector workers. I also know that AWAs, Australian workplace agreements, are very successful. People who are working on an AWA in the Pilbara do not want to go back to the trade union dominated competition between the employer and the employees. They are far better off now. A questionnaire was put out by one of the major miners in the Pilbara; it asked: do you want to go back to that system or are you happy with AWAs? Eighty-four per cent said they wanted to stay with AWAs. And why wouldn’t they? More productivity led to more wages and, strangely, led to more employment in the Pilbara.
The reason we are bringing in skilled workers from overseas is simply that the economy is booming. The economy of Western Australia is the best of the six states and the two territories. It is absolutely and totally booming. The Western Australian Labor government seems to be taking the credit for it. Mr Eric Ripper, the Treasurer of Western Australia, takes the credit for the booming economy in Western Australia. I wonder what the Chinese think about that, when the growth rate in their steel mills for the past 10 years has averaged 25 per cent. It is there to which our ore—not exclusively but significantly—goes from Western Australia. That is the sort of thing that is booming—that causes housing booms, more roads, more bridges and the extension of our freeways, and allows, in some instances, the trade union movement to survive. Had it not been for the boom, the trade union movement would represent less than 10 per cent of the private sector workforce.
We bring people in from overseas to try to keep the economy going—to satisfy the demand. We do not bring them in to lower wages. Hansen—one of the companies which is anathema to those on the opposite side—is bringing in skilled migrants, not exclusively but predominantly from the Philippines, and is paying them the wages that the unions demanded. Hansen is paying the same wages to the people that are coming in—what is the beef? What is wrong with keeping the economy going? Don’t you know? I will tell you what you do know: you know that, unless the economy dips seriously, you people on the other side will never see the Treasury bench. And I think that is a good thing. Labor’s proposal for dropping AWAs is the greatest thing that could have happened to the government and guarantees our re-election in a couple of years. Do you think any business in Australia would put up with the dropping of AWAs? (Time expired)

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2006-06-13,"—I rise to take note of answers given by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to questions about the Howard government’s use of foreign guest workers to lower Australian rates of pay and conditions. The ‘minister for deporting Australians’ has the gall to call the Labor Party xenophobic. Strewth overboard! Talk about hide: the government have made an art form out of playing the race card. But that is not the only card game this government play. Since the Howard government took control of the Senate they have legislated a three-card trick to create a second-class set of foreign guest workers in Australia. They have done this for one reason alone—that is, as the economists say, to put downward pressure on wage growth. What that really means is taking the money out of workers’ pay packets and putting it into the bosses’ pockets.
The first card was to remove the no disadvantage test so that bosses are legally able to offer work under AWAs at much lower wages and conditions than the going rate. The second card was to change the welfare laws so that if a person wanted to refuse being exploited by a scungy boss offering an insultingly low-level of wages and conditions then they would be refused the dole—‘Take the crap job or starve,’ they say. The third card was to open the floodgates to a wave of foreign guest workers on temporary visas with conditions which effectively remove any bargaining power they might otherwise have had. The cumulative effect of this three-card trick is that, even in this time of low unemployment, the Howard government has created the conditions necessary to drive wages and conditions down. There have been low-paid guest workers in Australia for years; that is not new. In the maritime industry, the Howard government has exploited a loophole in our maritime laws to allow foreign flagged ships with cheap and exploited foreign labour to move freight around our coasts for years. And now that the Howard government has taken control of the Senate it has been able to bring this practice onshore. I take the point made in Senator Lightfoot’s comments about a certain employer in the state of Western Australia—in my and Senator Webber’s home state. A certain builder, Hansen, is well known and quoted in the West Australian newspaper for bragging about bringing in 170 Filipino labourers that he could proudly use to undermine 30 years of union collective bargaining and improving wages and conditions within the construction industry.
I want to touch on another point that Mr Hansen was confronted with two weeks ago while he was beating his chest in every form of the Western Australian media about how he wanted to bring in more and more guest workers. He said that he was paying them the minimum wage: ‘What is the big deal? There’s no drama.’ But the CFMEU in my home state actually went and confronted one of Hansen’s building jobs and put a protest on his front gate. And do you know what? Not only were there CFMEU officials on the site, highlighting the danger to Australian jobs and Australian wages and conditions of guest workers’ being exploited, but workers—employees of Mr Hansen’s company—actually walked off the job and joined the protest. What does that say? I will tell you what it says: they know darn well what is happening. Australians are not stupid; they are not silly. They can see that these guest workers are coming in. Yes, we have a skills shortage created by 10 years of a Howard government. Let us make no mistake about that; you have been in office 10 years. It is no good blaming anyone else. You have given people like Hansen the loophole to exploit foreign workers.
What has happened—and this is a fact that was reported in the West Australian, that great media outlet in Western Australia that would not tell any fibs—is this: the West Australian said quite clearly that not only were these people on lower wages and conditions but they also resided in a house that was supplied to them by a family member of an employee of the company. They each paid $100 a week, and there were eight of them living in that house. That is $800 a week going straight to paying off an investment for someone else.
I ask you, and I ask everyone with a conscience, to think about this: when the boom subsides—and let us hope it does not for a long time—what are we going to do? The foreign workers will be exported back to their countries and Australian children will not be trained. Australian children will not be given the opportunity. (Time expired)

"McGauran, Sen Julian",LP,2006-06-13,"—If we ever doubted that Mr Beazley’s weekend announcement of rolling back existing Work Choices legislation and the 1996 workplace reforms was a reversion to old Labor repaying its labour masters with the abolition of AWAs and returning all things to a collectivity run by the unions with the central focus back to the old, grinding industrial relations, and if we ever doubted that that was a return to the old Labor—a party that has not adjusted and will not adjust to the new, flexible economy—we only needed to hear the previous speaker, Senator Sterle. He used all the old language of Labor. He came in here in defence, no doubt, of a surprise decision by Mr Beazley. But he was willing within a day or two to take up the cudgels and support that policy, though he may have been caught on the hop.
Mr Deputy President, you only needed to listen to his old language—that old, union, industrial language—that is so out of place today. It is so out of place amongst his own workers, for that matter. He was using terms like ‘scungy bosses’, ‘crap jobs’ and ‘hordes of foreigners’—and throw in the word ‘Filipino’ while you are at it! He said ‘exploited workers’; what a shrill performance that was. That is an example of how Labor have learned nothing since the 2004 election. They went to that election under Mr Latham with the policy of abolishing AWAs, and now they are going to the next election with that exact same policy. You have learned nothing from the lessons of the election, which was that you must have some economic credibility. People have to have some skerrick of trust in your management of the economy, but you may as well bring back Mr Latham. Your hate, your language, your paranoia and your shrillness, Senator Sterle, are equal to Mr Latham’s. You have learned nothing, and if you think the Australian public—let alone your workers, whom you purport to represent, or your new claim on middle Australia—will trust you, you will have the same destiny as you have had the past four elections. And thank goodness for that.
You will not be trusted with the Australian economy with your old-world industrial relations policies. You talk about grinding and lowering wages and you say that this is our ambition with the new Work Choices legislation.
—They know all about that.
—What an absurdity. I heard Senator Campbell’s interjection. Before I go on to that point, to outline the record that this government has—and why would we jeopardise it?—I want to pick up the previous speaker on just one more point. I want all points home about the previous speaker and those on the other side, about just how old world they are and how tied up with the old union movement they are. That is his claim of the detriment to the unions of our new industrial relations laws in that most corrupt and criminal world of the building and construction industry and the unions involved in it. That was found by the Cole royal commission, and you come in here and defend those unions and defend that industry as if it was totally picked on. A royal commission found out what that industry was, and this government had the guts to reform it and put in place a running commission to reform that industry as part of all our reforms of industrial relations. And you cannot take it. You will not take it.
You have been rejected by your own workers. You have been rejected by the so-called middle Australia that you claim to have because our record is on the board. Why would we jeopardise a 16.8 per cent rise in wages? Why would we jeopardise a 4.9 per cent unemployment rate? These are all records for the past 30 years. I say that we will be tested on this reform, as we have always, and we know you are going to make this the centrepiece of your election campaign. But what a miscalculation you have made here today.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Skills Shortage</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,9,1
"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2006-06-13,"—Perhaps after that unique contribution from Senator McGauran we might actually return to the issue at hand and inject some reality into the debate about wages, skills shortages and the temporary migration of overseas workers. For Minister Vanstone to assert, as she did last week, that the only reason there is opposition to temporary skilled migration is that it undermines a union’s ability to exploit high wages amidst the skills shortage is just ludicrous. The reality is, as I have said in this place time and time again, skills shortages in this country do not just materialise overnight.
This issue has been confronting this government for 10 long years. Let us consider the build-up of this crisis in skilled labour over the last 10 years. Firstly, we have the decreases in TAFE funding and places for young Australians in training. Who presided over that? This government and Senator Vanstone in particular. Secondly, fewer people of all ages are actually completing their apprenticeships. Who is responsible for coming up with a package that encourages people to do that? This government. Thirdly, we have an ageing workforce that has seen many tradespeople retire and they are not being replaced. Finally, after years of economic growth, this government has not seized the opportunity that offers and has just sat on its hands. That is how you get a skills shortage, a skills crisis, after 10 years. They are the ingredients, not whatever it was that Senator McGauran was trying to say.
As I said, a skills shortage does not suddenly appear without warning. This current crisis is no different from any other that we have had before. To then argue that the only interest that unions have in the skills shortage is to drive up wages is absolutely absurd because, if that were the only interest they had, they could do what this government is doing and just sit on their hands and not talk about training or access for people but just let wages go up, as they inevitably will with a skills shortage. Unions have been trying to alert this government to the skills shortage for years. If it were as the minister claimed last week, the unions would have been sitting on their hands, waiting for the skills shortage to force up wages. Instead, responsible trade unions do not want the boom-bust cycle that Senator McGauran seems to rejoice in; they want long-term growth and full employment.
Wages and skills are about basic laws of supply and demand—I would have thought that those opposite would know that. When any commodity or service is in high demand and low supply, it has the effect of driving up the price. That is no secret. It is basic economic theory that is widely accepted and in common knowledge everywhere, except perhaps among those opposite. To argue that unions in this country are only interested in driving up wages to exploit a skills shortage is to turn that economic theory on its head. The reason the trade unions and those of us on this side of the parliament are involved in this current argument about temporary workers from overseas is not about driving up wages but about ensuring that nobody is being exploited.
It does not serve our national interest if we fail to meet our training challenges in the years ahead. Simply importing labour from overseas meets the short-term needs of overcoming a skills shortage, but it does not and cannot address the longer term needs of our country. There has always been an acceptance on all sides in this country that immigration was and is an important factor in building our country. That has not changed, but our concerns are that, if employers are using the skills shortage to source foreign labour as a means of driving down costs, this is not in our national interest and it is certainly not in our long-term interest.
The government and those opposite should be about ensuring that this skills shortage is overcome by a range of policy initiatives that deal with the problem now and well into the future. Do not just sit on your hands for another 10 years—or however long you are allowed to sit on that side of the chamber—actually do something to address the long-term needs of our labour market. The approach of this government has been to ignore all the warning signs. (Time expired)

"Minchin, Sen Nick (Leader of the Government in the Senate)",LP,2006-06-13,"—I seek leave to move a motion relating to the death of the Hon. John Murray Wheeldon.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate records its deep regret at the death, on 24 May 2006, of the Hon. John Murray Wheeldon, former federal minister and senator for Western Australia, and places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.
John Wheeldon was born on 9 August 1929 in Subiaco, Western Australia. He was educated at Perth Modern School and then attended the University of Western Australia, graduating in arts and law before commencing work as a solicitor. Despite later serving as a minister in the Whitlam Labor government, we note with interest that John Wheeldon’s political life began when he took on the role of President of the Western Australian Young Liberals. Given his subsequent illustrious career and his rather dry views on a range of subjects, he was clearly a loss to the Liberal Party.
—He had some views on Vietnam, as well.
—I noticed that. John Wheeldon was elected as a senator for Western Australia in 1965, representing the Australian Labor Party. He served as a senator for 16 years, until his retirement on 30 June 1981. There are only a couple of senators still serving today who had the privilege of serving with Senator Wheeldon, including Senators Ray and Watson. Regrettably, neither Senator Evans nor I had that privilege.
John Wheeldon served at an interesting time in Australia’s history. He served during the time of the Vietnam War, and witnessed first hand the events leading to the dismissal of the Whitlam government in 1975. He had a deep and abiding interest in international affairs. He was, as Senator Evans has just noted, a fierce opponent of our involvement in the Vietnam War and made a visit to North Vietnam in the mid 1960s, at the invitation of the North Vietnam peace committee, when the war was at its height. In 1967 he also visited the United States, campaigning against that war. In parliament, he served as a member and chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee and the joint committees on foreign affairs and defence.
John Wheeldon’s esteemed political career also included time as Minister for Repatriation and Compensation from 1974 to 1975 and later in 1975 as the Minister for Social Security in the Whitlam government. His ministerial career would have been much longer had the Whitlam government survived more than one term. He served as a member of the opposition shadow ministry in 1976.
Senator Wheeldon was particularly proud of his involvement in a report on human rights in the then Soviet Union which gave timely exposure to a range of very significant humanitarian issues in that country. In common with a number of Senate colleagues, he also served as parliamentary adviser to the United Nations General Assembly in New York during his last year in parliament.
Following his retirement as a senator, John Wheeldon was approached by Rupert Murdoch and offered a position on the Australian. He was chief editorial writer for the Australian from 1981 to 1995—a position many of us might aspire to following our political careers. With his encyclopaedic knowledge of world politics, he specialised in editorials on foreign affairs and politics. During his time with theAustralian, editorials in that newspaper covered a number of key international events, including Nelson Mandela’s release from prison, Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait and Mikhail Gorbachev’s perestroika reforms of the Soviet Union.
Editorials written while John Wheeldon was at the Australian stated among other things that, for example, ‘claiming a moral monopoly’ on environmental issues would not be of assistance to the ALP; and in support of free trade that ‘undoing the harm of protectionism will take time and pain, but less pain than preserving the industrial basket cases’. So he followed in a long tradition of free trade that is evident among Western Australians from both sides of politics.
John Wheeldon will be remembered for his vast knowledge of and passion for world politics, his dry and incisive wit and his intellect both during his time as a senator for Western Australia and in his career outside of politics as a lawyer and journalist. On behalf of the government, I offer condolences to his wife, Judith, daughter, Miriam, and sons, Andrew and James.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Hon. John Murray Wheeldon</title>,Condolences,10,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2006-06-13,"—On behalf of the Labor opposition, I would like to support the condolence motion moved by Senator Minchin following the death of former senator John Murray Wheeldon. I extend the sincere sympathies of all Labor senators to his wife, Judith, to their son, James, and to Andrew and Miriam, his children from his first marriage. John Wheeldon was a very significant Western Australian Labor figure through his role as a senator, his brief period as a minister in the Whitlam government and his long involvement in the Western Australian Labor Party. After his retirement from politics, he remained engaged in public life through his work in journalism. He was a figure who commanded a great deal of respect across the political spectrum for his intellect and wit. That cross-party respect is clear from remarks made in the other place by my Labor colleagues and senior members of the government and in the obituaries that have been written about him.
Although I did not know him well, I was fortunate enough to meet him on a couple of occasions when he was a senator and I was a young, impressionable activist. He impressed then with his wide knowledge and his ability to put an argument succinctly. I actually met him at the home of the Konwills in Western Australia. They were a very influential couple in the development of Western Australian politics and were active on the Curtin electorate council, and he was certainly very much involved in that circle.
John Wheeldon was born in August 1929 and studied at Perth Modern School. Perth Modern was a selective government school, now well known for educating a number of public figures, including Bob Hawke, John Stone, my partner, and journalist Maxwell Newton. Despite its strong academic credentials, Wheeldon was not too enamoured of his school, describing it as an ‘exam factory’. For a man who was later known for his erudition and intellectual sophistication, it seems the school was somewhat limiting. He later said:
Passing exams was all that mattered to the headmaster—he even disapproved of our attending ABC Youth Concerts, because in his opinion they were a waste of time.
That seems remarkable, given that it is actually a music school as well.
Various of the tributes that have flowed since Wheeldon died have noted that in his early days he was, as Senator Minchin pointed out, a Liberal. I am glad to say he saw the error of his ways. Apparently, this allegiance was due in part to his difficult relationship with his headmaster. Wheeldon noted:
The headmaster was a Labor man. In my youth I was a dedicated Liberal, largely because of him.
I think it shows how one can be influenced by certain individuals. I owe a lot to Malcolm Fraser—the old Malcolm Fraser, not the new one.
It seems that at school Wheeldon shared with Bob Hawke a characteristic Australian independence and suspicion of authority. In her biography of Hawke, Blanche d’Alpuget writes that Bob:
... joined the school cadets but then found himself rejecting the commands of his senior officers and, after three years of training, was still a private. Only three boys, another being Wheeldon, managed to remain privates.
Like Hawke, Wheeldon studied at the University of Western Australia and took an honours degree in philosophy as well as a law degree. It was during this time that he was involved with the Young Liberals and held some leadership positions in that organisation. No doubt that required drinking a lot of champagne and eating a lot of chicken. Thankfully, this did not last long. In 1950, he quit the Liberals in protest at Menzies’ act to dissolve the Communist Party—something he saw as an attack on democratic freedom.
He joined the Labor Party the following year and was a member of the Claremont-Nedlands sub-branch—a branch that was well known as an intellectual powerhouse of the party. It ranked among its members refugees from Hitler’s Europe and old-school Austrian socialists. It was a very influential part of the Western Australian Labor Party, and a lot of people like Bob McMullan, me and others were exposed to that group over the years. Wheeldon himself was strongly influenced by Joe Chamberlain, the secretary of the party in WA. Wheeldon served as a member of the WA state executive of the ALP from 1952 until 1979. In his preparliamentary life he worked as a barrister and solicitor. As the Leader of the Opposition noted in his condolence remarks, Wheeldon worked for a time in the Fabian bookshop in London—a job which, on his departure, was taken by Jomo Kenyatta, later to become the first President of Kenya.
In 1965, Wheeldon took his place as a Labor senator for Western Australia. He remained in the parliament until 1981. His first speech was an eloquent discussion of the politics around the stevedoring industry bill—a bill which Wheeldon saw as a direct attack on the Waterside Workers Federation. I think it proves again that the more things change the more things stay the same. Victorian DLP senator Francis McManus, the speaker to follow Wheeldon, noted the ‘considerable fluency’ with which Wheeldon had delivered his first speech. Wheeldon’s capacity as a speaker was highly regarded and formidable and has been much commented on in the last few weeks. He was known not only for his eloquence but also for his wit, which could be biting at times.
The current foreign editor at the Australian, Greg Sheridan, who was recruited to that newspaper on Wheeldon’s recommendation, described him as perhaps the wittiest man he had ever met. A report from that newspaper gives an account of a discussion during estimates hearings in May 1973 on food in the parliamentary dining room:
Senator Wheeldon asked whether the appalling quality of the food was meant to encourage ‘Spartan living’ or ‘involuntary support for the Freedom from Hunger Campaign.’
I hope that the questioning in estimates is now slightly more focused on government accountability. I also noted a response he gave to Senator Melzer in question time when, as Minister representing the Minister for Health, he was asked about the practice of inducing births between 9 am and 4 pm. He responded:
I am afraid that I was not aware of the practice of inducing births in office hours. I suppose it would enliven an otherwise dull morning tea break. I do not know what effect it has on the mother and child. However it could have a rather startling effect on fellow clerks and stenographers. I shall refer the matter to the Minister for Health and obtain a detailed answer for Senator Melzer.
Jim McClelland described Wheeldon as ‘one of the verbal pyrotechnists of the Whitlam era’, and noted:
In full flight, speaking entirely without notes in flawless syntax on a subject such as the Vietnam War, he was a hard act to beat.
Wheeldon, who was fluent in French and German, was known for his knowledge and interest in the area of international affairs. As an opponent of imperialism in any form, he spoke out passionately against the Vietnam War from his early days in the Senate. In 1967 he and Jim Cairns travelled to the US to give a series of speeches regarding their opposition to the war and in 1973 he made a visit to North Vietnam—highly controversial visits at the time. On leaving the Senate in 1981 he said that international affairs should not be treated as a side issue by the parliament because he felt that successful foreign policy was a precondition for successful domestic policy. In his valedictory speech he said:
However excellent our policies may be on social welfare, finance, agriculture or anything else, if our country is under serious threat from some other source then it is all to no avail whatsoever.
The sentiment that led Wheeldon to oppose what he saw as American imperialism in Vietnam also made him a staunch critic of the Soviet Union. He was rightly proud of the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence from its inquiry into human rights in the USSR, which he presented to the Senate in 1979. He was concerned about both the rights of the people of the Soviet Union and that country’s international policy and saw the committee’s inquiry as a vital contribution to Australia’s broader security. It was a report which was criticised by some contemporaries for its great length and, as the Leader of the Opposition pointed out in the House, Wheeldon wrote much of it himself.
When Labor was in government in the early 1970s he was instrumental in encouraging closer dialogue with China, a policy which has served this country well since that time. On the election of the Whitlam government in 1972, Wheeldon did not at first become a minister, though in 1973 he did become Chair of the Joint House Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. He was elected to the ministry by caucus following the 1974 election and he filled the vacancy left after the election defeat of Al Grassby. He served as Minister for Repatriation and Compensation from June 1974 and Minister for Social Security from June 1975, holding both positions until the dismissal of the Whitlam Labor government. His career, like the careers of many others, was cut short in 1975.
In his first speech, discussing the stevedoring industry bill and the coalition’s attempt to crack down on industrial activity on the waterfront, Wheeldon had spoken out about the miserable and dangerous conditions for workers on the wharves. He said:
The figures show that despite the claims made by the Government and other people of the many hours lost through industrial disputes and stoppages on the wharves, in any year the total number of man hours lost through industrial accidents is greater than the number of man hours lost through industrial stoppages or disputes.
Given these comments made so early on, it was fitting that he was minister at the time that Labor was trying to establish a national rehabilitation and compensation scheme. Gough Whitlam described how the Senate Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee inquiry into the bill was overloaded by those who opposed the scheme in order to stymie the legislation. After a great public debate—one which I got involved with on the periphery as a young man—the tactic seemed to work and the government was unable to deliver a single national regime to deal with what Whitlam described as ‘hardships imposed by one of the great factors for inequality in society—inequality of luck’.
In keeping with the broader program of the Labor government, Wheeldon was the minister who in 1975 tabled the Henderson report, Poverty in Australia, the result of the groundbreaking investigation into disadvantage in this country established in 1972. In WA during the Whitlam years, Wheeldon was a central figure in the 1974 and 1975 election campaigns, when his considerable oratory skills were used to great effect at mass rallies and public meetings. Wheeldon stayed on in opposition until 1981, by which time he was more than ready to move on from the Senate.
In June 1981 the Australian reported on a caucus dinner for departing senators, which is a bit of a tradition on the Labor side. Outgoing Senator Cavanagh began his remarks by saying he felt like Mark Antony who entered Cleopatra’s tent and said, ‘I am not here to make a speech.’ Wheeldon, who was next to speak, began his remarks with the words, ‘After 16 years in the Senate I feel like Cleopatra after Mark Antony left the tent.’ Those of us with long careers in the Senate understand the sentiment.
After parliament Wheeldon had a distinguished career in journalism and, for a time, was senior leader writer at the Australian where he specialised in editorials on politics and foreign affairs. He was a man of very considerable intellect and personal authority. He was someone who debated and believed passionately but was not afraid to reassess his intellectual positions. I must confess that some of his later contributions in the Australian were not highly popular with me or members of the Labor Party but they were always very strongly argued and intellectually sound.
He was by all accounts a man of brilliance with a very independent mind. He made a very significant contribution to the Labor Party, to the Senate and to the nation. It is a shame, from our perspective, that he was denied the opportunity of a significant ministerial career. He died at his home in Sydney on 24 May and a state funeral was held on 2 June.
Many people who have paid tribute to him over the last few weeks have also paid tribute to his wife, Judith. She is by all accounts a remarkable woman, a distinguished teacher, and was a devoted carer for her husband. On his passing I would like to reaffirm to her and to the family the deep and abiding sympathies of all Labor senators. We acknowledge the tremendous contribution he made and, certainly on behalf of the Western Australian senators, we acknowledge the contribution he made to our state and to the Labor cause. He will be fondly remembered.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Hon. John Murray Wheeldon</title>,Condolences,10,1
"Watson, Sen John",LP,2006-06-13,"—This afternoon I rise to honour one of the Senate’s great orators, the Hon. John Murray Wheeldon, who passed away peacefully on 24 May 2006. I had the pleasure to hear Senator Wheeldon speak back when I was first elected, and I believe I am possibly the only person present here today to have done so. I can safely say that he was one of the best speakers I have ever had the pleasure to hear. In fact I believe he was only surpassed in the field of public oratory in the Senate by Sir John Carrick, on our side of politics.
It is a great shame that Senator Wheeldon served before television cameras were introduced into the Senate chamber because his skill with the spoken word together with his quick wit stick in my mind even now, more than 20 years later. The late Hon. John Wheeldon was not only a gifted speaker but a passionate parliamentarian who served his state of Western Australia admirably for over 15 years. I recall he was most active in the field of foreign affairs and his work on the various committees was invaluable. I note also that he is survived by his widow, Judith, and their three children. I extend my condolences to them and their family and hope they will take some comfort from knowing that their husband and father was one of the most remarkable men ever to sit in this chamber.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Hon.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2006-06-13,"—John Wheeldon seems difficult to pin down: ex Liberal, lapsed Labor, self-styled ‘19th-century Liberal with social democratic tendencies’. He went from being president of Western Australia’s Young Liberals, aged 20, to being a critic of the Menzies government’s attempts to ban the Communist Party, then from being a member of the Australian Labor Party from 1951 to being a protege of the Labor Left Western Australian patriarch of the 1960s, Joe Chamberlain. Wheeldon was to say in the 1960s:
I am a thorough-going Socialist; I am on the far Left of the Labor Party.
By 1965 he was a Labor senator, the youngest in the parliament. By June 1974 he was the second youngest minister in the Whitlam government, first as Minister for Repatriation and Compensation. He was to say about war service,
I was too young for World War II, too old for Vietnam and too scared for Korea.
He was given additional responsibilities in June 1975 as Minister for Social Security. He was of course sacked, along with the other members of the Whitlam government, on 11 November 1975. After that, for just two months, he was a member of the opposition shadow ministry in early 1976 until his resignation in protest over the Iraqi campaign donation issue. John Wheeldon was twice an unsuccessful candidate for Senate leadership positions. He remained a backbench Labor senator until 1981. After he left parliament, his Labor Party membership lapsed. As you have heard, he became chief editorial writer for the Australian newspaper from the time of his retirement as a senator until 1995. It was a long journey and there were many twists and turns on the road.
John Wheeldon was bright—very bright. He was articulate, erudite, a wit, an intellectual, a libertarian. He had a wide general knowledge and he used it. As his political career lengthened, he would be considered more a dilettante, undisciplined, less than engaged in the political process and more carping than constructive in his criticism of colleagues and party. One of his closest friends was to say about his parliamentary career in the latter years that he travelled many thousands of kilometres a week to avoid work.
Through all this, he was exhilarating company. He was interesting and he was different. He held strong views and beliefs and he had the courage to express those views. He was his own man. John Wheeldon had a sharp tongue and he had a pointed sense of humour. I want to quote from former Labor Senate leader John Button’s autobiography, As It Happened. He mentions John Wheeldon in this book. He mentions just two instances of the sorts of interactions he had with Wheeldon. On one occasion John Button took John Wheeldon aside in King’s Hall in Old Parliament House and he decided to ask John Wheeldon what he thought of a particular issue—what we should do about a political issue. This was Wheeldon’s reply:
Speak for yourself. Don’t say ‘we’. I’m a swinging voter.
On another occasion, Wheeldon explained to Button that he had been to a Labor Party meeting in Perth. I quote Wheeldon:
I went out of curiosity. They kept complaining that people didn’t know what the Labor Party really stood for any more. I told them they were very lucky. If people knew what the Labor Party really stood for we’d have no members of Parliament at all.
So he certainly did have a sense of humour. I think it is fair to say that his attitude changed and his politics changed somewhat over a very lengthy political career. In fact, he was quoted at the end of his career as saying that being a senator was ‘a bloody awful job’. As his friend former senator James McClelland wrote of Wheeldon:
While he reads a book a day, he’s allergic to real toil. The thing he likes least about Canberra is parliament.
I think it is fair to say that John Wheeldon always showed real passion for the causes he believed in: his opposition to the Vietnam War, his support for the independence of East Timor, his abhorrence of apartheid and his deep concern about Soviet imperialism. There was not a better advocate in parliament on those issues or any issue to which he turned his mind.
But John Wheeldon did not apply his extraordinary talents with discipline and dedication. I believe that John Wheeldon did not fulfil his political promise. Without doubt, he was an achiever. Without doubt, he could have achieved much, much more. I join with my leader and other colleagues in the Senate in expressing my sincere condolences to his wife, Judith, and family, on their bereavement.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Hon. John Murray Wheeldon</title>,Condolences,10,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-06-13,"—I would like add the Australian Democrats’ voice to the expressions of condolence to the wife and children of former Senator Wheeldon. I think it is appropriate to acknowledge the contributions of somebody who has served 16 years in this place, including time in the ministry. As always when he is speaking about Labor people, Senator Faulkner has done so not only eruditely but also with insight and frankness—not that I am dismissing Senator Evans’s contribution, which was also good. We have also heard a fair bit from others about former Senator Wheeldon’s talents, his idiosyncrasies and his great ability with the spoken word.
There is one aspect of Senator Wheeldon’s career which I do not think was mentioned among all the other things that have been outlined. In his valedictory speech he mentioned that he had participated in all aspects of parliamentary life with the exception of the federal Parliamentary Christian Fellowship. However, I gather that even in that area he was not completely uninvolved. During his time in the Senate I gather that, along with some other members, he engaged in a serious attempt to establish a federal parliamentary fellowship of atheists, agnostics and members of other faiths, to cater for those who felt excluded from the Christian fellowship. I am not necessarily floating that suggestion again now, but it is interesting that that idea occurred back at that time as well.
That is another insight into Senator Wheeldon’s attitude about various things, and it is also a sign that he was not someone who would just follow predetermined positions. As Senator Faulkner indicated, he may have done so in a way that was sometimes less than constructive, but it also showed a person who would think for himself. It also demonstrates once again that you can put somebody in a box because they take a certain position on a matter, or you can label someone as being from the Left at a certain time and therefore think you can tell what they think about 99 other matters. If you look at Senator Wheeldon’s strong involvement in opposition to the Vietnam War—going as far as visiting Hanoi and doing a trip around the United States with Jim Cairns—clearly most people would think that that would put him in the package of the hard Left; and I can almost hear the kind of speech that someone like Senator Mason would immediately make about what that means about what those people would do about some things and how they would ignore certain other things.
Of course, one of the other big achievements of Senator Wheeldon was his strong involvement in putting more focus on human rights abuses in the Soviet Union. Most people would have criticised people who were perceived to be in the Left at that time for turning a blind eye to that issue. It does demonstrate that most people cannot be easily put into a single and simple box but that people can have a range of views on different positions, and it shows the benefits of considering each issue on its merits.
I join in acknowledging the extensive activities and achievements of former Senator Wheeldon’s career, both in and out of the Senate, and I join with other senators in expressing our sympathies and condolence to his family.

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2006-06-13,"—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report of the Community Affairs References Committee Workplace exposure to toxic dust, together with the Hansard record of the committee’s proceedings and documents received by the committee.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report tabled earlier today.
I seek leave to incorporate a short tabling statement and also a short speech from Senator Polley.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
The Committee’s inquiry into toxic dust arose out of the exposure of workers to crystalline silica in the sandblasting industry. One worker, Mr Richard White, sought compensation for lung disease resulting allegedly from exposure during employment as a sandblaster in the 1970s. The litigation was unsuccessful and Mr White then contacted others who knew or suspected that they had acquired lung or other disease through sandblasting. Eventually, Mr White compiled a list of over 900 names. It appeared that very few had received or sought compensation for their disability.
The Committee received 46 public submissions and 2 confidential submissions during the inquiry from a range of organisations, individuals and Commonwealth and State Government bodies. Public hearings were held in Melbourne, Sydney and Canberra.
The evidence highlighted the harmful effects of toxic dust: workers may suffer silicosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer as a result of exposure to crystalline silica; damage to the lungs, liver and spleen from exposure to beryllium dust; while exposure to timber dust is associated with cancer of the nasal sinuses.
Identifying the extent of illness related to workplace exposure to toxic dust is difficult as the main source of data is workers’ compensation statistics which do not record work-related illness that is of less than five days duration and do not record unsuccessful claims.
Added to the limitations of the datasets is the impact of the long lag time for some dust related diseases to be diagnosed. This often means that disease is blamed on lifestyle factors such as smoking rather than workplace exposure to toxic dust. It is for this reason that witnesses emphasised the importance of regular health surveillance of employees, including lung function tests and X-rays.
While the Commonwealth and State and Territories have developed a regulatory system to ensure worker safety, witnesses stated that problems with the system mean that some workers were still being exposed to unacceptable levels of toxic dust. These problems include slow implementation of changes to the regulatory regime, poor enforcement of regulations, particularly in small industries, and lack of information on exposure to toxic dust being provided to workers. These issues, coupled with poor work practices, have resulted in many Australian workers suffering potentially harmful exposure to toxic dust.
Compensation issues for those affected by exposure to toxic dust are complex: the long latency of disease makes it difficult to link work exposure to disease; compensation systems vary in the States and Territories; various limitations exist to prevent access to compensation; and a number of models for financial support exist. The Committee has noted the compensation mechanism in place in New South Wales and has recommended that that State and Territory Governments move as soon as possible to set up nationally consistent identification, assessment and compensation mechanisms for persons affected by workplace related exposure to toxic dust and their families to at least the current New South Wales standard. The Committee has also recommended that statutes of limitation that restrict legal proceedings for claims for personal injuries resulting from exposure to toxic dust be removed.
While concern exists to ensure that workers who have already been exposed to toxic dust receive adequate medical assistance and compensation, the emerging field of nanotechnology presents new occupational health and safety challenges. Research already indicates that nanoparticles may have serious health outcomes and the significant gaps in knowledge about how nanoparticles act, their toxicity and how to measure and monitor nanoparticle exposure. The Committee has made a number of recommendations so that these issues are addressed and to ensure that adequate regulations are introduced to overcome occupational health and safety concerns surrounding nanoparticles.

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2006-06-13,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

Mr President, I rise to speak on the Community Affairs’ Committee’s inquiry into Workplace Exposure to Toxic Dust. The importance of a thorough inquiry into the impacts of exposure to Toxic Dust was recognised by the Senate, which referred several matters to the committee for inquiry back in June 2005.
The Community Affairs Committee has consequently undertaken a thorough and detailed inquiry, receiving numerous submissions in respect of what is becoming a very serious and common work related health problem.
We all know, due to many well publicised cases, of the effects of asbestos and past work practices have been a contributing factor to many cases of asbestosis. Asbestos was commonly used throughout Australia from the 1940s until its use, in all forms, was banned from December 31 2003—except in prescribed circumstances.
The fibres of asbestos cause asbestosis, lung cancer and asbestos-related pleural diseases. Unfortunately, we have not only seen cases of asbestosis due to the mining of the product. Many cases have been a result of the use of asbestos as a building product, or even from indirect contact with dust—such as that which may come from renovating a house containing asbestos. The Asbestos-related Claims (Management of Commonwealth Liabilities) Bill 2005 and the Asbestos-related Claims (Management of Commonwealth Liabilities) (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005 Bills Digest tells us that estimates for Australia’s total liability for future asbestos claims start at around $6 billion.
The effects of asbestos are well documented and State, Territory and Federal Governments, have all put mechanisms in place to manage asbestos related compensation claims. With that in mind, the committee chose not to particularly address asbestos but instead review the issue of workplace exposure to other toxic dusts including silica dust, beryllium and timber dust, the effects of which are not so widely known.
The inquiry found that workers may come into contact with forms of toxic dust such as crystalline silica, wood dust and nanoparticles. Silica is a naturally occurring mineral in most rocks and soil, and occurs in several crystalline forms amorphous non-crystalline forms. Exposure to respirable crystalline silica (RCS) occurs through cutting, chipping drilling or grinding substances containing crystalline silica, but it may also occur through the use of materials that contain RCS for abrasive blasting.
Workers may come into contact with RCS through a range of activities including: excavation, sandblasting, grinding of materials such as granite, concrete cutting and drilling, road building, glass making, bricklaying and demolition.
The number of workers who risk a potential exposure to RCS was reported by the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission to be at nearly 294,000 in 2002. However, it was noted that not all workers across all industries have similar levels of risk to exposure—some may be at high risk, while others have a significantly lower risk of exposure.
Exposure to crystalline silica is known to cause a number of diseases, including Silicosis, but is also linked to others.
Silicosis has traditionally been known as a disease associated with mining and is caused by the inhalation of dust containing crystalline silica. However, there have been increasing numbers of cases of Silicosis occurring in workers in other trade-based industries as exposure over time to dust can be just as detrimental as working in a mining environment.
Silicosis is known to cause breathing difficulties, chest pain, respiratory failure and lead to death. The three main types of silicosis are: Chronic or Class Silicosis (which occurs after 15-20 years of moderate to low exposure); Accelerated or Subacute Silicosis (which can occur after 5-10 years of exposure to high levels of silica); and Acute Silicosis (which occurs after a few months, or as long as two years following exposure to extremely high concentrations of RCS.) Often the Acute form of the disease results in death, regardless of treatment.
The committee heard that there was a magnitude of evidence on the latency of chronic silicosis. Cement Concrete Aggregates Australia, or CCAA stated in a submission to the inquiry that chronic silicosis has a latency that may be up to seven years after cessation of exposure—even when there is little or no clinical evidence of the disease in the intervening period and there is no ongoing exposure during that time.
However, CCAA then went on to state that a delayed appearance of the disease or latency, is rare and that around 96 per cent of all cases of silicosis are diagnosable within a year of cessation of exposure, if not at the time of exposure.
CCAA also noted that silicosis does not have a long latency period at all, if compared to something like mesothelioma—which may occur up to 40 years after exposure has ceased or other occupational cancers.
However, Workplace Health and Safety Queensland stated that there is a general consensus among researchers that the latency period for most cases of the disease is in excess of twenty years from first exposure.
Of the submissions received by the committee as part of the inquiry, there were many from people living in communities located near quarries and smelters with concerns about their risk of developing dust-related diseases.
CCAA stated in their submission that there have been no known cases of silicosis arising from exposure to RCS in the community, either in Australia or overseas. Silicosis, they said, is seen as an industrial problem, not a community problem.
CCAA reported to the committee that there are procedures to monitor exposure around industrial sites and around perimeters, and controls are also in place around sites to prevent dusts from escaping and organisations can and are prosecuted for failing to meet those standards.
The committee also found that there is some dispute over the association of airway disease with crystalline silica. University of Tasmania Professor E Haydn Walters told the Committee in a submission that internationally there is now acceptance that non-organic dust can also be a cause of fixed airflow obstruction and chronic bronchitis. This, he said, may be either additive to cigarette smoking or be more evident in smokers.
When looking at the incidence of airway disease involving crystalline silica, the committee noted that its Regulation Impact Statement on the Proposed Amendment to the National Exposure Standard for Crystalline Silica in October 2004, the National Health and Safety Commission stated emphysema, the main cause of chronic obstructive lung disease, can be caused by inhalation of crystalline silica and that silica dust can worsen the damage done by smoking.
The National Health and Safety Commission’s Regulatory Impact Statement states that Occupational exposures to respirable crystalline silica can also have heart effects. In severe cases, it says, fibrosis sin the lungs can lead to prolonged increase in the blood pressure in the arteries and veins of the lungs, which is known as pulmonary hypertension. Exposure to silica has also been linked to the development of numerous disorders including autoimmune disorders such as scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and chronic renal disease.
Apart from crystalline silica, the committee also looked at several other forms of dusts which are known to cause severe health problems.
Beryllium cooper alloy or cooper-beryllium is used in numerous industries including mining, glass manufacturing, automotive manufacturing, smelters, foundries, ship manufacture, dental laboratories, aviation and nuclear power.
Exposure to high levels of beryllium dust results in acute beryllium disease or ABD. While workers generally recover from ABD, some will develop chronic beryllium disease, or CBD, which is incurable—although if it is caught early, its symptoms can be suppressed with steroids.
CBD can damage the lungs, liver and spleen and has a long latency. It can appear up to 40 years or more after the initial exposure. A submission received by Mr John Edwards, of Victoria, stated that he and other considered CBD to be far worse than asbestos-related lung diseases as, and I quote: “CBD can affect every major organ of the human body.”
The exposure to timber dust, alumina and textile dusts were also looked at by the committee. Exposure to timber dust is known to produce simple irritation but in some cases may also provoke rhinitis, asthma, bronchitis and pneumonitis. However, sino-nasal cancers associated with hardwood dust have also been reported in many countries including Australia.
Aluminosis is the occupational lung disease seen in workers exposed to fine aluminium powder, or dust, while Byssinosis is an occupational airway disease that occurs in textile workers due to the inhalation of certain textile dusts. A submission from the Dust Diseases Board of New South Wales informed the committee that, thankfully, this condition is now rare.
Due to the long latency periods involved in many of these diseases and ailments, there is a problem with the diagnoses of toxic dust-related health because some symptoms may not be seen for up to 40 years after exposure.
Many witnesses affirmed the need for further research to fully understand the extent of diseases caused by toxic dust, and the ACTU recommended that the Government fund research into improving medical tests for dust diseases, with a focus on early detection.
There was also mention of the need to ensure all workers who are exposed to toxic dust are adequately surveyed and regularly checked for signs of illness. The States and Territories already have hazardous substance regulations in place based on the national model regulations produced by the Commonwealth in 1994.
However, the committee noted that there are problems regarding the confusion of dust-related diseases with other lung conditions or lifestyle factors such as smoking. A recommendation from the Committee asks that the Australian Safety and Compensation Council, in conjunction with the Heads of Workplace Safety Authorities, consider mechanisms to improve health surveillance of employees, particularly those exposed to toxic dust.
A further problem uncovered by the inquiry is that particular problems of exposure to toxic dust are not well understood or recognised by medical practitioners and that not all workers with dust related diseases will be identified.
The Union Movement has been pivotal in uncovering problems associated with workplace health and has been at the forefront in the fight for compensation for asbestosis victims. Indeed a great deal of the exposure that has been brought to the problem has come directly from Union involvement in these cases.
To increase the level of awareness already brought about by Union involvement, the committee has thus recommended that an information campaign promoting the effects of toxic dust to the medical profession be undertaken, and that the need for improvements in testing regimes for lung disease, as well as the training of those conducting tests and equipment requirements, be examined.
The effect of toxic dust and its related illnesses has unfortunately only just been touched on with the cases of asbestosis we have seen in recent years. With the ban on the use of asbestos as a building material, it is hoped that eventually cases of the illness will dwindle. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for other diseases caused by various forms of dust examined as part of the inquiry.
Overwhelmingly the most obvious factor challenging those working against the effect of toxic dust in the workplace is a lack of knowledge. Timber dust, for example, was seen by Dr John Bisby from CCAA as a greater issue than silicosis, because the risks associated with it are simply unknown.
Also of relevance to this issue is the incidence and increase of workplace induced asthma. AAP reported on June 6 that one in 10 people who develop asthma as an adult have their work to blame. Hairdressers, spray painters, bakers, dry cleaners and other occupations with exposure to chemicals are most at risk.
Again, the issue needs to be about education and awareness. People in these occupations need to be aware of exactly what conditions they are at risk of and what they can do to prevent or decrease their exposure to toxins.
As we all know, prevention is much easier than a cure.

The evidence highlighted the harmful effects of toxic dust: workers may suffer silicosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer as a result of exposure to crystalline silica; damage to the lungs, liver and spleen from exposure to beryllium dust; while exposure to timber dust is associated with cancer of the nasal sinuses.
Identifying the extent of illness related to workplace exposure to toxic dust is difficult as the main source of data is workers’ compensation statistics which do not record work-related illness that is of less than five days duration and do not record unsuccessful claims.

Compensation issues for those affected by exposure to toxic dust are complex: the long latency of disease makes it difficult to link work exposure to disease; compensation systems vary in the States and Territories; various limitations exist to prevent access to compensation; and a number of models for financial support exist. The Committee has noted the compensation mechanism in place in New South Wales and has recommended that that State and Territory Governments move as soon as possible to set up nationally consistent identification, assessment and compensation mechanisms for persons affected by workplace related exposure to toxic dust and their families to at least the current New South Wales standard. The Committee has also recommended that statutes of limitation that restrict legal proceedings for claims for personal injuries resulting from exposure to toxic dust be removed.
While concern exists to ensure that workers who have already been exposed to toxic dust receive adequate medical assistance and compensation, the emerging field of nanotechnology presents new occupational health and safety challenges. Research already indicates that nanoparticles may have serious health outcomes and the significant gaps in knowledge about how nanoparticles act, their toxicity and how to measure and monitor nanoparticle exposure. The Committee has made a number of recommendations so that these issues are addressed and to ensure that adequate regulations are introduced to overcome occupational health and safety concerns surrounding nanoparticles.

However, it was noted that not all workers across all industries have similar levels of risk to exposure—some may be at high risk, while others have a significantly lower risk of exposure.
Exposure to crystalline silica is known to cause a number of diseases, including Silicosis, but is also linked to others.
Silicosis has traditionally been known as a disease associated with mining and is caused by the inhalation of dust containing crystalline silica. However, there have been increasing numbers of cases of Silicosis occurring in workers in other trade-based industries as exposure over time to dust can be just as detrimental as working in a mining environment.
Silicosis is known to cause breathing difficulties, chest pain, respiratory failure and lead to death. The three main types of silicosis are: Chronic or Class Silicosis (which occurs after 15-20 years of moderate to low exposure); Accelerated or Subacute Silicosis (which can occur after 5-10 years of exposure to high levels of silica); and Acute Silicosis (which occurs after a few months, or as long as two years following exposure to extremely high concentrations of RCS.) Often the Acute form of the disease results in death, regardless of treatment.
The committee heard that there was a magnitude of evidence on the latency of chronic silicosis. Cement Concrete Aggregates Australia, or CCAA stated in a submission to the inquiry that chronic silicosis has a latency that may be up to seven years after cessation of exposure—even when there is little or no clinical evidence of the disease in the intervening period and there is no ongoing exposure during that time.
However, CCAA then went on to state that a delayed appearance of the disease or latency, is rare and that around 96 per cent of all cases of silicosis are diagnosable within a year of cessation of exposure, if not at the time of exposure.
CCAA also noted that silicosis does not have a long latency period at all, if compared to something like mesothelioma—which may occur up to 40 years after exposure has ceased or other occupational cancers.
However, Workplace Health and Safety Queensland stated that there is a general consensus among researchers that the latency period for most cases of the disease is in excess of twenty years from first exposure.
Of the submissions received by the committee as part of the inquiry, there were many from people living in communities located near quarries and smelters with concerns about their risk of developing dust-related diseases.
CCAA stated in their submission that there have been no known cases of silicosis arising from exposure to RCS in the community, either in Australia or overseas. Silicosis, they said, is seen as an industrial problem, not a community problem.
CCAA reported to the committee that there are procedures to monitor exposure around industrial sites and around perimeters, and controls are also in place around sites to prevent dusts from escaping and organisations can and are prosecuted for failing to meet those standards.
The committee also found that there is some dispute over the association of airway disease with crystalline silica. University of Tasmania Professor E Haydn Walters told the Committee in a submission that internationally there is now acceptance that non-organic dust can also be a cause of fixed airflow obstruction and chronic bronchitis. This, he said, may be either additive to cigarette smoking or be more evident in smokers.
When looking at the incidence of airway disease involving crystalline silica, the committee noted that its Regulation Impact Statement on the Proposed Amendment to the National Exposure Standard for Crystalline Silica in October 2004, the National Health and Safety Commission stated emphysema, the main cause of chronic obstructive lung disease, can be caused by inhalation of crystalline silica and that silica dust can worsen the damage done by smoking.
The National Health and Safety Commission’s Regulatory Impact Statement states that Occupational exposures to respirable crystalline silica can also have heart effects. In severe cases, it says, fibrosis sin the lungs can lead to prolonged increase in the blood pressure in the arteries and veins of the lungs, which is known as pulmonary hypertension. Exposure to silica has also been linked to the development of numerous disorders including autoimmune disorders such as scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and chronic renal disease.
Apart from crystalline silica, the committee also looked at several other forms of dusts which are known to cause severe health problems.
Beryllium cooper alloy or cooper-beryllium is used in numerous industries including mining, glass manufacturing, automotive manufacturing, smelters, foundries, ship manufacture, dental laboratories, aviation and nuclear power.
Exposure to high levels of beryllium dust results in acute beryllium disease or ABD. While workers generally recover from ABD, some will develop chronic beryllium disease, or CBD, which is incurable—although if it is caught early, its symptoms can be suppressed with steroids.
CBD can damage the lungs, liver and spleen and has a long latency. It can appear up to 40 years or more after the initial exposure. A submission received by Mr John Edwards, of Victoria, stated that he and other considered CBD to be far worse than asbestos-related lung diseases as, and I quote: “CBD can affect every major organ of the human body.”
The exposure to timber dust, alumina and textile dusts were also looked at by the committee. Exposure to timber dust is known to produce simple irritation but in some cases may also provoke rhinitis, asthma, bronchitis and pneumonitis. However, sino-nasal cancers associated with hardwood dust have also been reported in many countries including Australia.
Aluminosis is the occupational lung disease seen in workers exposed to fine aluminium powder, or dust, while Byssinosis is an occupational airway disease that occurs in textile workers due to the inhalation of certain textile dusts. A submission from the Dust Diseases Board of New South Wales informed the committee that, thankfully, this condition is now rare.
Due to the long latency periods involved in many of these diseases and ailments, there is a problem with the diagnoses of toxic dust-related health because some symptoms may not be seen for up to 40 years after exposure.
Many witnesses affirmed the need for further research to fully understand the extent of diseases caused by toxic dust, and the ACTU recommended that the Government fund research into improving medical tests for dust diseases, with a focus on early detection.
There was also mention of the need to ensure all workers who are exposed to toxic dust are adequately surveyed and regularly checked for signs of illness. The States and Territories already have hazardous substance regulations in place based on the national model regulations produced by the Commonwealth in 1994.
However, the committee noted that there are problems regarding the confusion of dust-related diseases with other lung conditions or lifestyle factors such as smoking. A recommendation from the Committee asks that the Australian Safety and Compensation Council, in conjunction with the Heads of Workplace Safety Authorities, consider mechanisms to improve health surveillance of employees, particularly those exposed to toxic dust.
A further problem uncovered by the inquiry is that particular problems of exposure to toxic dust are not well understood or recognised by medical practitioners and that not all workers with dust related diseases will be identified.
The Union Movement has been pivotal in uncovering problems associated with workplace health and has been at the forefront in the fight for compensation for asbestosis victims. Indeed a great deal of the exposure that has been brought to the problem has come directly from Union involvement in these cases.
To increase the level of awareness already brought about by Union involvement, the committee has thus recommended that an information campaign promoting the effects of toxic dust to the medical profession be undertaken, and that the need for improvements in testing regimes for lung disease, as well as the training of those conducting tests and equipment requirements, be examined.
The effect of toxic dust and its related illnesses has unfortunately only just been touched on with the cases of asbestosis we have seen in recent years. With the ban on the use of asbestos as a building material, it is hoped that eventually cases of the illness will dwindle. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for other diseases caused by various forms of dust examined as part of the inquiry.
Overwhelmingly the most obvious factor challenging those working against the effect of toxic dust in the workplace is a lack of knowledge. Timber dust, for example, was seen by Dr John Bisby from CCAA as a greater issue than silicosis, because the risks associated with it are simply unknown.
Also of relevance to this issue is the incidence and increase of workplace induced asthma. AAP reported on June 6 that one in 10 people who develop asthma as an adult have their work to blame. Hairdressers, spray painters, bakers, dry cleaners and other occupations with exposure to chemicals are most at risk.
Again, the issue needs to be about education and awareness. People in these occupations need to be aware of exactly what conditions they are at risk of and what they can do to prevent or decrease their exposure to toxins.
As we all know, prevention is much easier than a cure.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2006-06-13,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document tabled earlier today.
I rise to talk to Audit report No. 40 of 2005-06: Performance audit: procurement of explosive ordnance for the Australian Defence Force (Army): Department of Defence, Defence Materiel Organisation. From Afghanistan to the Solomons, our forces are stretched, yet the government is stretching its credibility with the latest peccadillo outlined in the audit report before the chair for discussion this afternoon. Yet again it has bungled the buying of major defence items, this time ordnance. The Auditor-General, fresh from finding fault with the purchase of 22 Tiger helicopters, is now highly critical of Defence’s purchase buying of ordnance. Findings from the report before the chair include: a failure by Defence to follow government guidelines in purchasing ordnance; a failure to rein in a startling propensity for prepayments; a failure to safeguard against significant risk when it comes to storing and servicing ordnance; and a failure to keep its main leasing and purchasing agreement up to date, making it more than difficult to manage the SAMS agreement.
Closer scrutiny of this report card on Defence’s procurement activities makes for most disappointing reading. Once again, when it comes to economic management and accountability, Defence fails to make the grade. It chalks its first black mark against financial management specifically in the area of prepayments. This seems to be a bad habit to which Defence has become more than accustomed. It pays virtually up front for goods worth tens of millions of dollars in return for benefits that never materialise. Take in this instance the purchase of key munitions to maintain stocks. Defence paid $44.9 million on a $50 million contract up front for this particular ordnance. The largest purchase under this agreement was a tranche of Bolide missiles. Defence paid $33 million or 90 per cent of the total cost to suppliers Saab back in 2003. This was on condition that it received the goods ahead of schedule, yet three years later Defence is still waiting for a number of these benefits to become apparent, to materialise.
But this is not the worst example of Defence being taken for a ride because of its penchant for prepayments. Officials at estimates a fortnight ago confirmed what was laid out by the Auditor. In some instances, Defence has paid the entire price up front for a number of munitions for very little return and, in some cases, no delivery. This is in spite of assurances before previous Senate estimates that such a practice would be reined in. It seems from the Auditor’s reports that prepayments remained the preferred option for Defence to balance its budget books at the end of each financial year. It is a practice whereby Defence, finding itself in the black in one year, uses this money as an up-front payment on equipment for the following year. It is a devil-may-care attitude as to whether this will result in any benefit to the taxpayer. Incidentally, Defence advised the Auditor mid last year that it was reviewing this practice. I suppose we will see.
Defence’s second black mark is notched up in the area of inventory management. Here it received a real blasting from the Auditor. It appears that Defence has spent a total of $212 million on ordnance it cannot use. When I followed this up at Senate estimates the week before last, I was told that nearly half of Defence’s $2.4 billion worth of ordnance was currently incapable of being used. The Auditor also criticised Defence for not having the technical data to store and maintain this particular ordnance. This exposed it to significant risk regarding safety. This is in spite of setting up its own specialist group within the DMO to overcome or to keep tabs on this particular problem. The Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance Branch should audit and assess whether guided and explosive weapons are safe and suitable.
Defence officials assured the committee at estimates that they now have the technical know-how to safely store the particular ordnance. They also admitted that unusable explosive ordnance is being stored at Orchard Hills in Penrith, a main population centre west of Sydney. This is not just bullets, but grenades and missiles. But the greatest concern remains the way Defence have managed their own Strategic Agreement for Munitions Supply, or SAMS, which I referred to briefly earlier. In short, SAMS assures Australia can meet its ordnance capability and sets out how much we pay for munitions. It is under this agreement that Defence pays $800 million over a 16-year lease to munitions suppliers ADI. Incidentally, ADI was the beneficiary of another series of prepayments under this particular agreement. Yet, when auditors went to check on this critical contract, they found Defence had not kept it up to date for each of the last five years. That says a lot about how Defence manage their business. The Auditor made no less than 15 recommendations to ensure Defence lift their game in the procurement of ordnance—bombs, warheads and rockets and guided and ballistic missiles and artillery. As I said, Defence have agreed to these 15 recommendations. We were led to believe at estimates that improvements have already begun. I will certainly follow that up at the next round of estimates.
Meanwhile, it is worth noting that, since becoming Minister for Defence, Dr Nelson has called for no less than nine reviews within his own department. I think it is fair to say that we do not need reviews; we need reform and we need that reform urgently. Dr Nelson has been taking charge, but the government has been doing too little for too long. Dr Nelson is about to find out what is happening in his own department. This government’s self-professed record of economic management is being severely undermined by its continuing mishandling of defence procurement. Urgent reform is needed to ensure there is accountability for how taxpayers’ money is being spent in the procurement of anything from missiles to particular brands of bullets. Our troops, as is often stated, are giving first-class service in a number of operations all over the world. Our troops depend on the professional procurement of defence goods. Our troops need to rely on their minister to give them the best equipment at all times and act in their best interests when it comes to procuring and providing them with that essential equipment. There is a lesson here for the new minister, Dr Nelson: read the Auditor’s reports and right the wrongs identified repeatedly in the administration of Defence. Only then will you master your department and ensure our troops’ first-class service is being backed by top-grade procurement. I seek leave to continue my remarks.

"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,2006-06-13,"—I present three reports of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade as follows:

Australia’s defence relations with the United States
Expanding Australia’s trade and investment relations with North Africa
I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report on Australia’s defence relations with the United States.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
The security treaty between Australia, New Zealand and the United States of America, the ANZUS treaty, which came into force on 29 April 1952, is a key element supporting Australia’s national security. The treaty has operated for more than 50 years and still remains relevant in a strategic environment increasingly challenged by terrorism and non-state actors. It is as a result of this environment that the treaty was first invoked following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States. Since World War II, Australia and the United States have developed strong defence relations. In particular, the last decade has seen a new level of defence relations encompassing Australian involvement in the first Gulf War and in the US-led coalitions in Afghanistan and Iraq.
The evidence given to the committee was overwhelmingly in favour of the alliance and the security that it provides for Australia. There was some discussion about the ongoing relevance of the treaty and whether there was a need to enhance the treaty to more broadly reflect contemporary strategic needs. While there was little support for renegotiating the treaty, some groups suggested that traditional alliances will need to adjust considerably to defeat the types of asymmetric threats faced by Western allies in the 21st century. Other groups cautioned that Australia should be more careful in how it manages the alliance, to ensure Australia’s interests are not subsumed by those of its larger alliance partner.
The committee, through its inquiry, has examined how Australia’s alliance with the United States impacts on the security of the Asia-Pacific region. Evidence to the inquiry strongly supported United States engagement in the Asia-Pacific region and indicated that Australia’s relationship with the United States is seen by most countries as a positive influence on regional security. The committee found that Australia and the United States can do more to encourage the development of democratic processes in the security forces of Indonesia, and has encouraged the United States to lift legislative restrictions on US training assistance to the Indonesian military. It is pleasing to note that the US has already acted in relation to that matter.
The committee also considered the impact on the Australia-US defence relationship of the emergence of a more powerful and assertive China. The committee found that Australia’s relationships with both the United States and China are such that Australia has the potential to act to ease any future tensions that might emerge between these powers. In undertaking its inquiry, the committee has received significant assistance from both the Australian and US departments of defence, including support for our delegation to the US to seek their perspective of the alliance. During this interaction, even the most senior US military personnel consistently reported on the excellence of the performance of the ADF in all training and operational activities. That performance bolsters Australia’s contribution to the alliance and earns great credit for the Australian Defence Force and for Australia. The challenges faced by Australia in its region and internationally will continue to be met in concert with our United States ally. Australia’s defence investment will ensure that Australia continues as an effective and reliable alliance partner as well as a self-reliant regional power.
It was a long inquiry, one that stretched over the period of the last election. It was a very important inquiry, which allowed all members of the joint standing committee to better understand our relationship. The inquiry also reasserted the importance of that relationship, which has been in place for so many years. As part of the inquiry, a group from the Defence Subcommittee spent just over two weeks in America in July of last year and presented a separate report on that visit, during which we were able to gain first-hand information about many of the future operations and procurements of the Australian defence forces, notably the Joint Strike Fighter, the Abrams tanks and a number of other programs that the Australian defence forces have put in place in order to ensure the ongoing reliability of our defence relationship.
I also place on record the marvellous work of our committee and of our Defence liaison officer from last year, Colonel Gus McLachlan, who was involved for most of the duration of the inquiry and enabled us to gain access to many defence officials throughout the United States and managed to make this inquiry work in such a good manner. I commend the report to the Senate and I seek leave to continue my remarks on this report later, as other members may also wish to speak at a later stage.
Leave granted.

The statements read as follows—

Visit to Australian Defence Forces deployed to support the rehabilitation of Iraq, 22 to 28 October 2005

In late October 2005, a delegation of eight members from the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade visited Australian Defence Force personnel deployed on active service in the Middle East.
Thanks to first class support by both the Diplomatic and Defence Staffs in the Middle East the Delegation was able to meet with the following organisations or agencies:
Two members of the delegation conducted an operational mission with the Royal Australian Air Force Maritime Patrol Aircraft Detachment over the Northern Arabian Gulf and Southern Iraq;
Royal Australian Navy personnel deployed aboard HMAS Newcastle;
Royal Australian Air Force personnel conducting C130 Hercules air lift operations in support of coalition forces in both Iraq and Afghanistan;
The Al Muthanna Task Group conducting security operations and training for the new Iraqi Army in southern Iraq;
The Australian Embassy in Baghdad’s International Zone hosted the delegation for a meeting with the Speaker of the Iraqi Transitional National Assembly, Mr Hajim al-Hassani and members of the Transitional Assembly;
The US Commander of Multi-National Forces Iraq, General George Casey; and
The Australian National Commander, Commodore Geoff Ledger and his staff at Camp Victory Baghdad.
The visit to ADF units in the Middle East area of operations formed part of the Committee’s wider program of inspections to Defence Force units and Defence Industry sites. Where it is practical the Committee has also sought to visit ADF personnel while they conduct operations. In recent years the Committee has visited Australian Forces in Afghanistan, East Timor and Solomon Islands.
The delegation had three specific aims in undertaking the visit to the Middle East. Its primary purpose was to demonstrate the Parliament’s strong bipartisan support, and the support of the Australian community, for Defence Force personnel deployed on this demanding operation.
Secondly the visit allowed the members of the delegation to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the situation in Iraq, the tasks being undertaken by Australian personnel and the suitability of the training and equipment they receive.
Finally the delegation, in meeting with the Speaker of the Iraqi Transitional National Assembly, became the first delegation from the Australian Parliament to the Transitional National Assembly of Iraq, supporting Australia’s engagement with the newly democratic nation.
The comprehensive delegation itinerary allowed the members to achieve each of these aims. Exposure to this range of issues and experiences could only be achieved as a result of a very well orchestrated program. The delegation thanks the Australian Defence Force for developing and coordinating a visit program that ensured the safety of delegates while giving them exposure to a wide range of personnel and locations. In particular the delegation thanks the Australian National Commander in the Middle East, Commodore Geoff Ledger, for his hosting of the delegation throughout the visit. Commodore Ledger provided the delegation the benefit of his considerable experience throughout the visit, leaving the members confident in the leadership and organisation of Australian Joint Task Force in Iraq.
The Committee would also like to thank Australian Embassy staffs in the Middle East for supporting the program. In particular the delegation thanks Dr Ralph King in Kuwait and Mr Howard Brown in Iraq. Both of these experienced officials operate under some of the most demanding conditions experienced by Australian Government personnel anywhere in the world.
The Committee returned from the visit extremely impressed by the dedication and professionalism of the Australian Defence Force personnel conducting operations in this demanding, often hostile environment. Australian personnel are working closely with the emerging Iraqi institutions and personnel, showing compassion in their daily dealings with the local people and considerable restraint when called upon to apply force. They are performing with distinction and have earned the respect and admiration of both the coalition and Iraqi forces with whom they are working.
All Australians should be proud of the achievements of the ADF on operations in the Middle East and the contribution they are making to the reconstruction of Iraq.

Expanding Australia’s trade and investment relations with North Africa

The countries of North Africa represent a market nearly eight times that of Australia. Australia has yet to fully engage with the 155 million people living in Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia.
In May 2005 the Minister for Trade asked Committee to examine our trade and investment relations with North Africa and the likely future trends in these relations.
The Committee was also charged with assessing the role of the government and its agencies in maximising opportunities as they emerge in the region.
In addition to holding public hearings and receiving submissions the committee visited Algeria, Egypt, Libya, and Morocco to review trade and investment opportunities for Australia in person.
Two members of the committee also visited Tunisia to attend the World Summit on the Information Society.
During visits to Algeria, Egypt, Libya, and Morocco the committee met with senior Government figures, the Parliaments, Government agencies and departments, and importers.
The contacts made included meeting with the Prime Minister of Morocco and several senior ministers in each of the cities visited. In Morocco, Algeria and Libya there was considerable television and media coverage of our visit.
The response to the committee’s visit was positive and very encouraging.
We looked to see if there were any impediments to trade in this region, and what could be done to capitalise on the opportunities.
Although the countries are different they share some common characteristics which are relevant to Australia’s commercial interests.
GDP growth is strong in all five countries. In the resource rich countries of Libya and Algeria, further strong growth based on escalating oil prices can be expected.
Each of the countries is going through some degree of market s liberalisation and reductions in taxes, and tariffs.
The privatisation of companies could be seen across the board.
In the region major infrastructure projects for roads, ports, electricity, water supply, airports and agriculture represent opportunities for Australian companies.
Increased consumer demand also means further opportunities in the market for Australia. Currently the most promising are:
Wheat and agricultural products;
Livestock and meat products (particularly lamb);
Mining and agricultural equipment;
Consultancy in a wide range of areas;
Tourism training; and
Education—particularly post-graduate students
Of course, the biggest potential remains in the oil and gas fields, especially those of Algeria and Libya.
Australia’s biggest oil explorers continue to bid for major projects in these countries, with BHP Billiton being successful in Algeria, and Woodside in Libya.
Iron ore production as well as aluminium smelting is also possible in Libya, with BHP-Billiton interests. An Australian manganese smelter is being assessed as to its possibility in Egypt.
In summary the potential for Australia in North Africa is significant because of the opportunities in resource development, because of the GDP growth rates of the big countries and because there is export potential to Europe through the countries where trade conventions with the EU exist.
In the light of its on-the-spot reconnaissance of the region, and the numerous submissions it received, and the evidence from public hearings, the committee concluded that Australia should ensure that appropriate resources are allocated to these markets to encourage Australia’s access and export growth.
To pursue these aims, the committee has recommended that, at the government-to government level, the Australian Government should seek to improve access for Australian exports through negotiating lower tariffs on a bilateral basis, particularly in agribusiness. (Rec 1)
It should also initiate or continue ministerial discussions with North African trading partners to address technical access issues, particularly harmonising customs and standards requirements. (Rec 2)
Following discussions in North Africa about visa arrangements for entry to Australia the committee recommends that there should be closer focus given to expediting visa processing requirements. Specifically the Department of Immigration should review its visa processing arrangements for North Africa as a priority, and also consider reviewing the assessment processes for North Africa students sponsored by their governments. (Rec 3)
As requested by the Minister for Trade, the committee examined the roles the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Austrade.
The committee concluded that Austrade should reconsider its organisational and representational arrangements for North Africa (Rec 4)
Australia has to compete in the region with traders and investors from Europe and America. It would be better placed to do so with a presence in the region.
Specifically, the committee recommends that high priority be given to the establishment of a Trade Commissioner and Consul-General in Algiers. (Rec 5)
Such a post would indicate Australia’s intention to pursue a long-term relationship; increase our visibility in the region, and open a gateway to opportunities there for Australian entrepreneurs.
In closing, I am grateful to all those who gave evidence to the inquiries. I also wish to thank my colleagues, and the secretariat.
I commend the report to the Senate.
I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

Secondly the visit allowed the members of the delegation to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the situation in Iraq, the tasks being undertaken by Australian personnel and the suitability of the training and equipment they receive.
Finally the delegation, in meeting with the Speaker of the Iraqi Transitional National Assembly, became the first delegation from the Australian Parliament to the Transitional National Assembly of Iraq, supporting Australia’s engagement with the newly democratic nation.
The comprehensive delegation itinerary allowed the members to achieve each of these aims. Exposure to this range of issues and experiences could only be achieved as a result of a very well orchestrated program. The delegation thanks the Australian Defence Force for developing and coordinating a visit program that ensured the safety of delegates while giving them exposure to a wide range of personnel and locations. In particular the delegation thanks the Australian National Commander in the Middle East, Commodore Geoff Ledger, for his hosting of the delegation throughout the visit. Commodore Ledger provided the delegation the benefit of his considerable experience throughout the visit, leaving the members confident in the leadership and organisation of Australian Joint Task Force in Iraq.
The Committee would also like to thank Australian Embassy staffs in the Middle East for supporting the program. In particular the delegation thanks Dr Ralph King in Kuwait and Mr Howard Brown in Iraq. Both of these experienced officials operate under some of the most demanding conditions experienced by Australian Government personnel anywhere in the world.
The Committee returned from the visit extremely impressed by the dedication and professionalism of the Australian Defence Force personnel conducting operations in this demanding, often hostile environment. Australian personnel are working closely with the emerging Iraqi institutions and personnel, showing compassion in their daily dealings with the local people and considerable restraint when called upon to apply force. They are performing with distinction and have earned the respect and admiration of both the coalition and Iraqi forces with whom they are working.
All Australians should be proud of the achievements of the ADF on operations in the Middle East and the contribution they are making to the reconstruction of Iraq.

Expanding Australia’s trade and investment relations with North Africa

The countries of North Africa represent a market nearly eight times that of Australia. Australia has yet to fully engage with the 155 million people living in Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia.
In May 2005 the Minister for Trade asked Committee to examine our trade and investment relations with North Africa and the likely future trends in these relations.
The Committee was also charged with assessing the role of the government and its agencies in maximising opportunities as they emerge in the region.
In addition to holding public hearings and receiving submissions the committee visited Algeria, Egypt, Libya, and Morocco to review trade and investment opportunities for Australia in person.
Two members of the committee also visited Tunisia to attend the World Summit on the Information Society.
During visits to Algeria, Egypt, Libya, and Morocco the committee met with senior Government figures, the Parliaments, Government agencies and departments, and importers.
The contacts made included meeting with the Prime Minister of Morocco and several senior ministers in each of the cities visited. In Morocco, Algeria and Libya there was considerable television and media coverage of our visit.
The response to the committee’s visit was positive and very encouraging.
We looked to see if there were any impediments to trade in this region, and what could be done to capitalise on the opportunities.
Although the countries are different they share some common characteristics which are relevant to Australia’s commercial interests.
GDP growth is strong in all five countries. In the resource rich countries of Libya and Algeria, further strong growth based on escalating oil prices can be expected.
Each of the countries is going through some degree of market s liberalisation and reductions in taxes, and tariffs.
The privatisation of companies could be seen across the board.
In the region major infrastructure projects for roads, ports, electricity, water supply, airports and agriculture represent opportunities for Australian companies.
Increased consumer demand also means further opportunities in the market for Australia. Currently the most promising are:
Wheat and agricultural products;
Livestock and meat products (particularly lamb);
Mining and agricultural equipment;
Consultancy in a wide range of areas;
Tourism training; and
Education—particularly post-graduate students
Of course, the biggest potential remains in the oil and gas fields, especially those of Algeria and Libya.
Australia’s biggest oil explorers continue to bid for major projects in these countries, with BHP Billiton being successful in Algeria, and Woodside in Libya.
Iron ore production as well as aluminium smelting is also possible in Libya, with BHP-Billiton interests. An Australian manganese smelter is being assessed as to its possibility in Egypt.
In summary the potential for Australia in North Africa is significant because of the opportunities in resource development, because of the GDP growth rates of the big countries and because there is export potential to Europe through the countries where trade conventions with the EU exist.
In the light of its on-the-spot reconnaissance of the region, and the numerous submissions it received, and the evidence from public hearings, the committee concluded that Australia should ensure that appropriate resources are allocated to these markets to encourage Australia’s access and export growth.
To pursue these aims, the committee has recommended that, at the government-to government level, the Australian Government should seek to improve access for Australian exports through negotiating lower tariffs on a bilateral basis, particularly in agribusiness. (Rec 1)
It should also initiate or continue ministerial discussions with North African trading partners to address technical access issues, particularly harmonising customs and standards requirements. (Rec 2)
Following discussions in North Africa about visa arrangements for entry to Australia the committee recommends that there should be closer focus given to expediting visa processing requirements. Specifically the Department of Immigration should review its visa processing arrangements for North Africa as a priority, and also consider reviewing the assessment processes for North Africa students sponsored by their governments. (Rec 3)
As requested by the Minister for Trade, the committee examined the roles the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Austrade.
The committee concluded that Austrade should reconsider its organisational and representational arrangements for North Africa (Rec 4)
Australia has to compete in the region with traders and investors from Europe and America. It would be better placed to do so with a presence in the region.
Specifically, the committee recommends that high priority be given to the establishment of a Trade Commissioner and Consul-General in Algiers. (Rec 5)
Such a post would indicate Australia’s intention to pursue a long-term relationship; increase our visibility in the region, and open a gateway to opportunities there for Australian entrepreneurs.
In closing, I am grateful to all those who gave evidence to the inquiries. I also wish to thank my colleagues, and the secretariat.
I commend the report to the Senate.

"Watson, Sen John",LP,2006-06-13,"—On behalf of the Joint Committee on Publications I present the report of the committee entitled Distribution of the parliamentary papers series together with the Hansard of the proceedings, minutes of the proceedings and submissions received by the committee. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
The parliamentary papers series does not contain all the documents presented to the parliament. However, the significant documents that comprise the series provide vital information on the activities of government and the parliament since Federation. While electronic distribution may provide the greatest opportunities for widening the access to the series, long-term viability of these documents is not yet assured. A framework is therefore required to ensure the series is permanently available in both hard copy and electronic form for the widest possible audience.
I remind the Senate that the committee feels that the 23 recommendations contained in this report provide a foundation from which the parliamentary papers series can continue to be available to the widest possible audience. I will add background to our inquiry and report. I remind the Senate that this parliamentary papers series, the PPS, has been in existence since 1901—since Federation. Documents of a substantial nature presented to the parliament are included in the series by a resolution of either house of parliament, usually on the recommendation of the publications committee. In an average year, 430 documents out of 800 presented to the parliament are selected in the series.
Recipients of the series include national, state, parliamentary and university libraries. On 12 May 2005 the Presiding Officers wrote to the committee, informing of changes to the distribution of the parliamentary papers series to take effect from 1 January 2006 and seeking advice on further, more extensive changes to the series. The committee received 20 submissions and held hearings in Canberra on 31 October and 28 November 2005. On 6 February 2006 the members of the joint committee conducted inspections and received briefings from the National Library of Australia, the PANDORA web archive project and CanPrint Communications, parliament’s distributor of the series, regarding the processing of the documents which comprise the series. I commend the report to the Senate.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2006-06-13,"—On behalf of the Chair of the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, Senator Payne, I present the report of the committee on the provisions of the Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill 2006 together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2006-06-13,"—I was speaking on this legislation before I was so rudely interrupted by question time—a sign of the mistaken priorities of the government! I was indicating the concern Labor has for the lack of compliance with regard to the current child support arrangements and said that we were offering the government support in looking to improve compliance and in supporting a range of compliance measures. It is a key to ensuring fairness and ongoing community support for the child support arrangements. People have to believe that the system works and that they get justice from the system. Compliance is a very important aspect of improving the system. I am hopeful that the increased payment of liabilities will diminish some of the negative effects of the new formula for low-income resident parents.
I note that this year’s budget measures allocate $146.6 million to improve service standards and carry out organisational change in the Child Support Agency. Concerns in the community about the administration of the Child Support Scheme by the CSA are just as profound as those about the payments formula and compliance. To recognise this is not to attack the CSA staff; they work in a very difficult environment. All senators and members would recognise the hard work of agency staff and the pressures they are under. Nonetheless concerns exist, and I hope that the budget allocation and related action results in some more positive outcomes for both clients and staff. I think that some of the measures to do with case management, et cetera will improve outcomes for clients but also allow the CSA staff a better working environment.
I was concerned to hear recently that an internal CSA audit found that there have been 405 privacy breaches in the last nine months—of which 69 saw sensitive information being given to ex-spouses—and that at least two families have had to be relocated for their own safety as a result of such breaches. Labor notes, from the report in the Australian newspaper, that the Minister for Human Services is satisfied that the agency was taking action in this regard. We encourage the government to ensure that its reforms within the agency do as much as they can to prevent a repeat of these breaches.
The ministerial task force has examined the scheme, using sound principles, and its report was generally well received. Labor believes that it does provide a strong and constructive basis for reform. As I have indicated, our principal concern is in regard to the effect that the new assessment formula will have on low-income resident parents with children aged 12 years and under. They are the losers in this change. The government has supported the report and has picked up most of its recommendations, which it now seeks to implement.
Labor has taken a constructive approach to the reforms. We do not believe that any side of politics should seek to politicise this issue. Our aim has been to support positive reform of the scheme. In this we have endeavoured to work with the government, and there has been constructive engagement between my office and Minister Brough’s office. The changes that the government is seeking to implement cut across a range of areas, and the government plans to introduce them in three stages between July this year and July 2008.
We recognise that the package as a whole is carefully crafted by an expert committee, which has endeavoured to provide a balance based on the results of its research. In designing a new payments formula, the task force has based its calculations on research into the actual costs of raising children. It recognises the fact that the costs of care for older children are greater than those for younger children. It notes also that regular contact between children and non-resident parents increases the costs of care considerably, due to the duplication of infrastructure in two households, and that the costs of children change in accord with the parents’ income level.
At the heart of the formula is the attempt to divide these costs fairly between both parents in a way which recognises the level of care each provides. The current formula, by contrast, is not based on research into the actual costs of raising children and therefore lacks some of the intellectual rigour and underlying fairness of the new formula. The resulting package presents a trade-off in costs between resident and non-resident parents. This is in effect a zero-sum game. The new arrangements, as the Parkinson report noted, do not alter the amount of resources available for the children’s upbringing, but they do alter their allocation between households.
The task force argues that the new formula is grounded in evidence about the costs of raising children and the most defensible principles for allocating those costs. It notes the presence of anomalies in the current system and that the correction of these means that obligations must go up or down. It states:
... its recommendations can best be assessed by reference not to a comparison between the outcomes of the current and proposed formula, but by reference to the principles and evidence upon which these recommendations are based.
The package developed by the task force is a result of expert examination and analysis and seeks to balance competing factors in a sound manner. This is reflected in a balanced package of measures: a new payments formula balanced by increased compliance measures and attempts to make it harder for parties to hide their income in order to reduce their liabilities. The House of Representatives standing committee noted that ‘the CSS has a number of complex and interrelated components’ and that changing one aspect impacts on other aspects of the scheme. I believe that the same applies for the reform package. Therefore, attempting to unpick the package by amending certain measures would undermine its integrity as a whole and could create further inequities. After some consideration, the government has picked up the package largely in its entirety and Labor is prepared to support the government’s legislation as a whole.
However, Labor have indicated that our support for the package as a whole is contingent upon there being a satisfactory outcome and government action to put in place sufficient protection against income reductions for low-income resident families. We have very serious concerns about the impact of certain parts of the package of reforms. Our principal concern regards the impact the new formula will have on low-income single parents of children up to the age of 12. These households are generally headed by women. The House of Representatives report Every picture tells a story noted that 91 per cent of child support payees were female and nine per cent were male. Many single-parent families are among Australia’s poorest and most likely to fall into poverty.
While Labor accept that the new formula is based on a fair estimation and division of costs, we do not believe that the parliament can be blind to the practical consequences for the families affected. The aim of the reforms is to share the costs fairly between parents recognising the level of care they provide. The redistribution of those costs imposes minimal financial burden on the Commonwealth. While that reallocation of costs between parents is based on fair principle, Labor argue that there is a broader responsibility on the part of the Commonwealth and the parliament to ensure protection against loss of income for low-income resident parents. We do not want to see these families with less money to raise their kids.
The reforms attempt to encourage contact between children and non-resident parents by reducing that parent’s support liability in line with their level of care. At present, the non-resident parent’s liability is the same whether they have no contact or care for 29 per cent of nights each year. The task force recommends that, where the non-resident parent has care of the child for between 14 and 34 per cent of nights per year, their liability should be reduced by 24 per cent. I know this attempts to recognise the cost of providing domestic infrastructure such as a second bedroom but, clearly, the cost of renting a two-bedroom unit rather than a one-bedroom unit does not change depending on how many nights the parent has care of the child.
Recognition of the ongoing costs for non-resident parents and the encouragement this can provide for ongoing contact is a sound principle and should be supported. However, we must recognise the fact that the fixed infrastructure costs faced by the resident parent such as rent do not decrease at a rate commensurate with the other parent’s level of care. Yet, under the proposed changes, she or he faces a 24 per cent cut in their child support payments. Fairness has to work both ways. Just as we must be fair to the non-resident parent and recognise the fixed costs they face, we must also apply that same fairness to the resident parent. This is the area in which real concern exists. This is the measure which most starkly challenges the fairness of the package.
We should also acknowledge the reality that many of the people who face cuts in their child support payments will also be hit by the government’s Welfare to Work changes. I am not seeking to politicise this debate on child support. Labor’s vehement opposition to the welfare changes is well known, particularly those aspects which result in reduction of support for single parents. However, we have to acknowledge the fact that some of the poorest families in the country face the prospect of increased work obligations, reduced welfare payments, more punitive taper rates and, now, a reduction in child support payments. If we are to observe the principle of putting the interests of children first and respect the original intent of the Child Support Scheme to reduce child poverty, then we cannot ignore the impacts that these changes will have on these families.
While Labor are signalling broad support for the package, I am also indicating that we are seriously concerned about the impact on low-income families. We argue there is a clear responsibility for government to ameliorate the negative effects the changes may have on children in these families. We urge the government to look closely at this issue and examine ways of ensuring that carer families are not unfairly penalised and whether greater protection can be offered to them. It is a small issue in many ways compared to the totality of the package, but it is a very big issue for those families—it is a very big issue for those single-parent families who are potentially getting whacked by three or four separate measures.
These legislative reforms in this first tranche include the following principal measures: changing the capacity-to-earn provisions, increasing the minimum payment and its indexation to the CPI, increasing the amount of the child support payment that the non-resident parent can direct to specific purposes, dealing with a constitutional issue regarding application of the Child Support Scheme to ex-nuptial children in Western Australia and reducing the cap on the income of non-resident parents which is assessable for child support purposes from just under $140,000 to just under $105,000. This final measure means a reduction in payments by non-resident parents on incomes over $104,702 of up to $180 a week and a commensurate loss of income for the resident parents. This is another measure which causes me some concern. While I understand the logic behind it, the effect is that some families—some carer parents—will lose up to $180 per week from 1 July. Bang! No phase-in. Some of them I think may even still be unaware of the impact.
I think the new cap is defensible. I have certainly had a lot of encouragement to think that by some people whom I know personally. But I do think that there is an issue here in terms of phase-in. It does not matter how much income one has coming in—and if they are anything like me they are spending five per cent more than what is coming in—to say to a family, ‘As of 1 July, you suddenly have a reduction of $180 per week,’ when people have committed to school fees, mortgages, car payments et cetera, I think is harsh. While I accept the overall argument, I think the government should look again at that issue as to whether they cannot ameliorate the sudden impact of that provision on single parents caring for children. I do not pretend that the impact here is nearly as serious as it is on low-income parents who have a lot less to assist them in raising those children, but it has a very serious effect on some families. I got a very eloquent letter from a particular parent about that and I think there is an argument for them to say that there should be some sort of phase-in.
That is the main area of concern we have with the first tranche of reforms. In an effort to try and build bipartisan support and positive support for the changes, I am not looking to move amendments. Labor will not be moving amendments, but I make those two points to the government. I urge them to take them on as serious issues that ought to be addressed. I know the first stage is fairly minimal in terms of the broader package, but we urge the government before they proceed with the later stages of the package to take very seriously our concerns about low-income parents and the impact this will have on them.
There is a set of losers that even the Parkinson report identified who will be substantially hurt by these measures. Many of them will be women raising kids who will also be affected by the government’s welfare reforms or so-called welfare reforms, which also seek to cut their income. So they get a cut in income from the movement onto Newstart and they get a cut in income when the child support reforms come in. I do not think in all conscience that this parliament should be seeking to impose these two burdens, these two whacks, on them and their capacity to provide for their children.
Labor will be supporting the bill. We will be supporting the whole package in broad terms and we will be seeking to build community support for the child support system and the reforms contained herein. But there are issues on which we want the government to respond, in particular the issue about the impact on low-income sole parents. There is time before the second tranche for the government to address those concerns. At a time of large budget surpluses and the ability for the government to throw quite large amounts of money at those who perhaps do not need it as much, we could do better in how we treat low-income parents. Labor will be supporting the bill and not be seeking to move amendments to this particular piece of the legislative package.",SENATE,<title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (REFORM OF THE CHILD SUPPORT SCHEME—INITIAL MEASURES) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,32,1
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2006-06-13,"—In talking to this piece of legislation this evening, I think it is important that all of us in this place and those in the community understand that the people whom we are discussing are those in deep personal crisis. The history of this legislation is that in 1988, when the first round of reforms was announced and the Child Support Scheme was introduced, there was massive community involvement and outrage because it was a new system. It was a system that was being introduced to deal with families at a time of great disruption and pain. We acknowledged this at that time—and I was working in the Public Service—and there was extensive discussion amongst those of us working in the public sector about the impact of this legislation on the wider Australian community.
There were allegations at the time of social intervention and experimentation. At this time of breakdown and dealing with the handling of such difficult arrangements, it was important that through this process the government would offer support, personal support, and give a degree of understanding while working with families to ensure that the No. 1 priority would be the rights, welfare and security of the children. That principle has never changed. In terms of the way the scheme has operated, there has been significant debate about whether any piece of legislation can effectively fulfil that outcome. There are arguments that no single piece of legislation can effectively work through these difficult processes. But, whilst balancing the impact of this legislation, we need to understand that families are working through so many other elements of change.
As Senator Evans outlined, when we are looking at the introduction of this round of amendments to child support, there is no way that you can consider this in isolation. The families who are working through how they will be affected by the document called the Child Support Legislation Amendment (Reform of the Child Support Scheme—Initial Measures) Bill 2006 are also working through the complexities of the family tax system. They are often working through various elements of the family law system and they are seeking to survive at a time when other elements of welfare change are being imposed on the community.
For many of the families affected by this piece of legislation and seeking to know where their family income will be coming from, the Welfare to Work changes will be imposed at the same time. Whilst we are not here to debate those changes, once again it reinforces that we cannot in this place talk about bills in isolation because the families cannot be absolutely clear about where one piece of legislation begins and ends and where the other one takes up when we are talking about their very survival and their livelihood. I think this is something all of us should consider. The complexity of the whole legislative framework is one with which we are struggling and I can assure you it is one with which families are struggling on a daily basis.
I am aware of that struggle through my experience working in the public sector in the then Department of Social Security and, subsequently, having the privilege of working in this place and being involved in Senate committee hearings such as the poverty inquiry. Many of the people who came to give evidence and share their personal stories about family struggles during that inquiry were trying to survive on single incomes. They are the people that a government must keep in mind whenever we are looking at change and, most particularly, when we are looking at equity of change.
This particular initial measures bill is but the start of the current round of reforms to the Child Support Scheme. The legislation was introduced in 1988. People’s personal experience, the operations of departments and changes in government were worked through until early in the 1990s when the first round of legislative changes were made. This legislation continues to impact on people and must continue to be reviewed constantly. Also, nothing can be put aside and left alone.
This bill is possibly the first major, significant change to the child support legislation since it was introduced, and it has not come upon us suddenly. We had the very, very valuable House of Representatives committee report, Every picture tells a story, which I hope all senators have had the chance to consider. Through that process, the families of Australia, as well as so many of the agencies that work with them, the legal profession and the support groups chose to come forward and work with their political representatives, to give their stories, to talk about the proposed changes that they think would best impact on their own circumstances and to share with their political representatives what the impact of the current legislation has been on them and their lives. We had significant response to the public meetings across the country. I urge people to read that report if they have the opportunity, because it effectively reflects so much of the personal experience—and also the pain.
This particular area of legislation is one where I cannot separate the issues of personal pain from those of legislative change. Through the Every picture tells a story process, we heard the genuine, painful experiences of families who had worked through interpersonal breakdowns but who were then working through how they were able to maintain contact with their children, how they could retain the financial security that was being sought and, most importantly, how they could effectively develop family relationships after an initial parenting relationship had broken down. These are the people who will be affected by the raft of changes that are coming through now in three parts from the government. These are the people who most know the experience, because it is their lives.
Indeed, as a result of the Every picture tells a story report there was further community consultation. I know that through my own party and, I would anticipate, through other parties represented in this place there was great debate about the best process to take on from the community consultations that occurred. The government decision to institute a formal review of the process through introducing the Parkinson task force was extremely positive and one which I think was welcomed by all of us here and, I think, more importantly, by those people who had been part of the Every picture tells a story experience because they could see that their experience was being considered and that the government was then going to take professional advice on the issues that were raised.
I do not think there was anyone in the community who felt that any range of legislation was going to solve all the problems, but I think that there was genuine acceptance that the government process was at least considering a way forward. Now, two years down the track, we are in the position of looking at the initial round of what is now going to be a three-part implementation of change. Certainly I have some concerns about the time period over which these changes are going to be implemented and also about the time period for some of the most important changes—in particular, the formula change. Anyone who works in this area knows that the formula on which the financial arrangement is based is the key component to working out what you are going to receive in your budget on a regular basis, and that is the living money of people who are raising children in single relationships, often without very much extra money around. So the fact that the formula change is further down the track—the actual way that people can see their own circumstances and make the calculations is further down the track—makes the immediate impact of the legislation less powerful. In terms of expecting the change to happen, in the community in which I was working there was an expectation that these changes were going to happen in 2006 as a result of the previous processes. But when you examine the way in which the legislation is being brought in, the full complete changes—whatever they turn out to be in terms of the government debate and what happens—will not be in place in family relationships until 2008. That is a long way down the track.
In terms of the concerns we have had about the impact on any family in this process, of course we welcome the fact that the Parkinson report did some very valuable modelling of the financial impact and the expenses of raising children. That was something that was long overdue. Anecdotally, people talked about their own experiences and we had heard of the various expenses involved in child rearing, but until, through the Parkinson process, we were able to have a look at the data sets and see the background on which the decisions were made, there was still a degree of uncertainty about what the basis of the legislation was. I think that having that research was a very effective way of engaging people and showing that, whilst all of us have individual circumstances, at least there was a genuine attempt in developing the legislation to look at objective data—as objective as any discussion on families can be. There is no such thing as a model family. All of us need to work within the constraints of the community. We all look at different expenses and demands. It is very difficult, when you are talking about the impact of raising families, to be able to see yourself in the data. That is one of the things that I have been doing with some of the groups with which I have been working—taking the standard environment and the background and then working with people to see how they best fit within the mix.
Indeed, in terms of the process of finding out how people best fit, one of the things that I think is most valuable in the changes that the government is introducing is, I believe for the first time, a significant influx of funding into the Child Support Agency and some genuine dedication of resources into upskilling the people who work in that area, providing alternative service delivery mechanisms and putting outlets closer to the community so that people who are working through this system are able to deal with people who best know the system. All of us in this place would have regular contact with families who are not happy with the service that they receive from the Child Support Agency—in some cases a feeling that it is distant, that the staff in the Child Support Agency are not taking a personal interest in their circumstances and are somehow so far away, so uncaring and so unmoved by the individual pain of those with whom they are dealing that there is no genuine understanding of what it is like to be balancing a family expense account as well as working through all the other demands of raising children alone.
I think that the acknowledgement by the department that there is a need for some immediate work on behalf of the people who are working in the field—to look at specialised training programs and to ensure that people working in the Child Support Agency have effective support mechanisms as they work through quite difficult circumstances—is a major advance. That alone will ensure that the people who are working in this field feel better about themselves and feel more confident that they understand not just the technical aspects of the legislation but also the difficult personal circumstances of the people who are their clients.
I also believe that the introduction of better telephone services and hotlines will help, as will people knowing that Child Support Agency staff are well trained, they will understand their situation and they are accessible at any time. That is because some of the key issues for people who come to us concerned about decisions that have been made about their circumstances are that there is a delay in getting service from the public sector workers; there is a lack of sympathy, a lack of compassion; and there is no understanding that every single case has its own dynamic. The acknowledgment of this need for training and development is a major part of my hope that at least this first step of the process will be more effectively communicated to the public and that there will be a move towards making the process of implementing the legislation more accessible to the wider community.
Labor is concerned that, for the people who will immediately lose funding under the changes to the legislation, there will not be effective support or any ability to readjust their financial circumstances before the impost is placed on them. No matter how well you think you are operating your budget and no matter how effectively you believe you are planning your future, if there is a significant loss of regular income from your budget, which is going to impact on your lifestyle as well as that of your children, that will cause more stress and sometimes quite serious disruption to the operation of the family unit.
We acknowledge that the funding experiment has been done and that we understand that there are models in place to work out some changes to the way non-residential parents are working with the residential parents and how there can be variations to the expected amount of money that is paid on a regular basis. There are specific aspects of the legislation, such as lowering the cap and the changes to the way that people’s money can be assessed in terms of their ability to work, that are welcome. However, when that translates to a fortnightly decrease in the money on which you are expected to live, that can create great pain. As Senator Evans pointed out in his contribution to this debate, these are the people who need particular support from all of us as we look at the long-term impact of the changes.
In the whole process of the Child Support Agency working with the community, there must be an understanding that this particular change will have varying impacts on the families that are currently clients of the Child Support Agency and that, once again, there is no way that one size can fit all Australian families. We would expect there to be personal service given to each of the families who are working through the changes—a personal approach to each family so that they fully understand the impact of the changes on them. During the Senate estimates process, we talked to officials from the department about what process will be in place to implement the changes when they have been approved by the different levels of government. There was an acknowledgment that there would have to be an implementation process on a personal level, rather than just a general notice—or even a general letter like the letters that come from many government departments. Whilst some of us believe that such correspondence fulfils our legal responsibilities to ensure that a change is known and understood, those of us who have worked in the public sector understand that in reality it does not. The responses of individual clients to getting a letter from a government agency vary enormously, and there have been some research papers done on this issue.
I urge the government, in working out the implementation process for whatever changes come through, to do so through a very personalised information-sharing process with the families who will be impacted. Unless these changes are fully understood, there will be even further pain for the people who can least balance such changes. It is very simple for us in this place to talk about balancing the various costs and imposts of raising children, and understanding the various streams of income that come through from the government, including the range of family tax benefit changes we have discussed at length in this place. But, all too often, things that seem quite straightforward to the people who are developing the legislation and those working with it every day are not that straightforward or clear to those who are relying on the payment.
We already have a complex child support system, and that is one of the biggest complaints we have heard. So, in putting forward this major review of the way the system is going to operate, along with the fact that the government is going to do it in three stages, it is very important that we bring the people along with us so that every step of the way is clear to them.
There is absolutely no guarantee that a personalised process would be accepted by every client or something that they would welcome, but the least that the people of Australia who are clients of the child support system should be able to expect is that such a service is offered to them so that the changes are explained. If that is done, I think it will at least show that we have listened to some of the experiences to come out of the House of Reps committee inquiry—because the people who gave evidence to that review were clear that sometimes they felt that their interests were not best protected by the people who created the legislation. They also felt that the very title of the House of Reps committee report, Every picture tells a story, reflected the need for this personalised explanation of any changes that are going to be implemented.",SENATE,<title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (REFORM OF THE CHILD SUPPORT SCHEME—INITIAL MEASURES) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,32,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-06-13,"—I rise to speak on behalf of the Australian Democrats to the Child Support Legislation Amendment (Reform of the Child Support Scheme—Initial Measures) Bill 2006. As other speakers have indicated, this bill is the first of three stages of a very significant overhaul of the Child Support Scheme. I do not think there would be a politician in this place, in the Senate or the House of Reps, who has not had significant representation from a wide range of perspectives expressing concern about how the Child Support Scheme operates, which I think is an indication of how fraught and difficult this area is.
This first stage of the legislation contains a number of key measures: increasing the minimum payment for child support; strengthening the Child Support Agency’s capacity to ensure parents pay their payments in full and on time, which I think is particularly important; recognising non-resident parents on Newstart and related payments who have contact with their children; and reducing the maximum amount of child support payable by high-income earners to ensure those payments are better aligned with the actual costs of children, an area which is perhaps one of the more contentious parts of this first part of the legislation. There are also arrangements for assessing the capacity of parents to earn income, enabling non-resident parents to spend a greater proportion of the payments directly on their children and helping separating parents agree on arrangements for their children. There are more changes coming down the track in the second part of the year. A particularly important one is the allowance of an independent review of all Child Support Agency decisions by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, which I think will address one area that has been the source of very significant frustration. And there are further changes coming in from July 2008.
The aspect of this legislation that causes me some concern is the reduction in the maximum income for payers under the child support formula. This will mean very high income people—people in the top three or so per cent of income earners in Australia—will pay less. I think there is an arguable case for doing this, although I agree with Senator Evans that doing it basically overnight on 1 July, when it will potentially mean a very significant reduction in someone’s income, is not that desirable. What is put forward here is one of three parts of a comprehensive package that results from a very comprehensive review process which involved a lot of engagement with a wide range of stakeholders on the issue. Of course, it is problematic to pick out just one aspect and to trash that bit without it having flow-on effects to all of the other areas. Obviously there has been some attempted balancing in terms of the different interests and impacts on people. As I indicated at the start, this is an incredibly fraught area and one where it is impossible to satisfy all of the different views and concerns.
The key issue for the Democrats is to look at what will produce the best outcome for the children. I should say that part of that includes ensuring that you do not maximise the antagonism between parents. Obviously having a better relationship and connection with parents is in the best interests of the child as well. I think even the wisdom of Solomon would fall short of satisfying people in many respects, but this is somewhere that we need to continue to make the effort to get the system working as well as possible. I think the change that is coming down the track to enable appeals to be made to CSA assessments is an important one. I also agree with Senator Moore about the improvement in resourcing of the Child Support Agency. It is very important that they have the ability and time to make some of these very difficult assessments.
From my experience and from the perceptions I have got from the many people who have complained to me, the problem is not just the decision they have received from the assessment people; it is the process that has been used. Many people have perceived a dismissive attitude or a brick wall approach from the Child Support Agency. Whilst I do not suggest that a nice smiling face will necessarily satisfy everybody if they do not get a result they like, the process is important. It is an important part of how people perceive what is done and why a decision is reached. It is an important part of people at least having more understanding of why certain outcomes have occurred. If they have an opportunity to work through that with people more able to explain it and more able to ensure that the correct decisions are made the first time around, then it will at least reduce some of the very severe dissatisfaction that some people have with the Child Support Agency. So those certainly are positive measures.
It is also important to review how these measures operate and what the impact of them is. I imagine most people would not like to have another continuing set of reviews of this whole area. The process of reviewing the child support system and formula has already taken a very long period of time. It will take another couple of years yet before the whole lot of it is embedded in legislation, so I am loath to talk immediately about whether there is a need to change it again. But it is important to review how these changes operate—whether they function in a way people have anticipated, whether there are unintended consequences and whether there are more difficulties encountered by various people, particularly by children, than expected. Having said that, it is very difficult to pull one part out without the whole house of cards falling down, given how much this has all been knitted together.
The main thing the Democrats would emphasise is that, whilst that could apply as a general comment, that does not mean we give carte blanche endorsement to every aspect of the package of changes that are being put forward now or will be put forward down the track. It also means that we will continue to do what we can to monitor the impacts. We do believe it is an important issue. It obviously affects many Australian families of all types and, of course, many children, so it is important that we do it as well as possible and do all we can to get it right. Overall, this is certainly a step forward in that regard. I acknowledge that. I do not think it is perfect. From that point of view, I think we will all keep focusing on it, and I am sure we will all keep hearing about aspects that are creating dissatisfaction for people.",SENATE,<title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (REFORM OF THE CHILD SUPPORT SCHEME—INITIAL MEASURES) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,32,1
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2006-06-13,"—Family First supports a fairer system for child support and believes the Child Support Legislation Amendment (Reform of the Child Support Scheme—Initial Measures) Bill 2006 is a step in that direction. The bill implements a number of the recommendations of the report of the Parkinson ministerial task force set up in 2004 to examine the Child Support Scheme and how it can be improved. The bill will increase the minimum rate of child support from $5 to $6 per week; increase the proportion of child support that can be directed by the payer to cover the costs of medical care, school fees and child care; and change the test under which parents can be deemed to be reducing their earnings to pay less child support.
Child support is a complex and sensitive issue. Too often it descends into conflict between mums and dads. It can be hard to separate the issue of child support from the broader difficulties and sadness of the relationship break-up. It can also be hard to determine how changes affect children. Professor Patrick Parkinson and his ministerial task force had the difficult task of wading through all these issues and proposing a better and fairer system. I have no doubt that they did not get it 100 per cent right, but they have closely examined a very difficult policy area and come up with detailed recommendations to improve the system.
There are always going to be winners and losers when changes are made to areas like child support that involve carving up a person’s income, so it is vital to get the fundamental principles right. Family First believes the task force’s approach of focusing on the cost of raising children and ensuring the income of both parents is taken into account when determining child support payments will result in a fairer system. Currently, the custodial parent has to earn more than $40,000 a year for their income to be included. The Parkinson report also acknowledges that some non-custodial parents have been paying more than they can cope with. It is important we have a fairer system because parents are more likely to respect it and cooperate. Many non-custodial parents who recognise and accept their responsibility for contributing to the financial cost of raising their kids are still reluctant to pay under the current system because they believe it is unfair or because it places an unfair burden on them.
Family First is in no doubt that other senators have been contacted by many fathers with stories of their despair after losing contact with their children after a marriage breakdown. That affects their employment and ability to pay child support. I have been told stories of fathers who have taken their own lives, partly because of the difficulty of trying to make ends meet and start a new life after they pay the required child support. Obviously, many fathers have been able to start new lives and have perhaps married and had a new family but they also find it difficult to survive under the current formula of paying child support for their children as well as supporting their new family. Clearly they have responsibilities for both families, but what is the fairest way of assessing their financial responsibility and ensuring they honour their obligations? One father described himself to me as an ‘EFT dad’—that is, an electronic funds transfer dad. That is the only contact he had with his children. Family First can understand the frustration of contributing financially to raising your children yet not being able to be part of their lives.
One of the aims of the Parkinson report is to remove disincentives for greater contact between children and both parents, and that can only be a good thing. Family First believes we should be doing all we can to ensure children have as much contact as possible with both parents, except in exceptional circumstances, such as abuse. It is certainly disturbing that 40 per cent of non-custodial fathers, or about 300,000, do not pay more than the minimum payment of $5 per week or $260 per year. That is a huge number, and Family First believes that should not be tolerated. About half of these fathers receive welfare. It may be that many other dads are trying to reduce their taxable income, by taking cash payments for work, for example, so that they pay as little child support as possible. The people who really suffer here are the kids. That is the real tragedy here. Family First strongly believes that both parents should pay their fair share of the costs of raising their kids. I support the Child Support Agency in its efforts to track down child support cheats and ensure they meet their responsibilities. I believe most Australians would also think this is fair and reasonable.
Finally, Family First is concerned at how long it is taking the government to implement the recommendations of the Parkinson report. While it was published a year ago, this is the first piece of legislation we have seen which implements some of its recommendations. Further, I understand that other changes will not be fully implemented for years to come. Clearly these changes are long overdue and I call on the government to implement them a lot more quickly. Family First supports a fairer system for child support and supports this bill. (Quorum formed)

"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2006-06-13,"—I rise to speak on the Child Support Legislation Amendment (Reform of the Child Support Scheme—Initial Measures) Bill 2006. There have been a number of speakers on this issue this afternoon, and I have a few comments to make in relation to this. Senator Moore referred to the report that the then House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs released in 2003. As she said, it would be a good idea for all senators to have a look at that report. It is a very important contribution to public debate.
The report I refer to, of course, is Every picture tells a story. It made 29 recommendations that covered the family law process, parenting arrangements and the Child Support Scheme. From that, we have seen some legislation emerge and today we are debating some of that legislation. In February of this year there was a government response given to the report of a task force chaired by Professor Patrick Parkinson, which was released in June of last year. The report made 30 recommendations to overhaul the Child Support Scheme. In its response, the government indicated its intention to adopt most of the ministerial task force recommendations for change and to implement the reforms in a three-stage process commencing in July this year.
Labor welcomes the release of the government’s plans to reform the child support system. As Senator Evans said in his speech a little earlier this afternoon, Labor accepts the need for reform of the child support system. We consider that the report released by Professor Parkinson and his task force provides a strong basis for reform. Labor notes that the government appears to have picked up on most of the recommendations contained in that report. As a consequence, Labor will support much of the government’s package and, as we have today—as we always do!—will approach the debate on all of the changes in a constructive manner. Labor supports encouraging shared parenting and a fair balance in meeting the costs of a child’s care and his or her upbringing. The fact that only half of all non-resident parents meet their child support obligations in full and on time is an issue of grave concern to Labor. On that point, I will conclude my remarks.",SENATE,<title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (REFORM OF THE CHILD SUPPORT SCHEME—INITIAL MEASURES) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,32,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2006-06-13,"—I thank senators for their contributions. The Child Support Legislation Amendment (Reform of the Child Support Scheme—Initial Measures) Bill 2006 is a very important bill and a great deal of thought has gone into the preparation of it. A number of very interesting points were made by senators and the government will look very closely at what has been said in this chamber. A number of senators remarked on the high degree of cooperation and consultation which has occurred in the preparation of the bill. That is entirely appropriate. The government is a consultative one—it is a government which listens to people—so that does not surprise me.
I will conclude by summing up a number of matters which were raised during the second reading debate speeches. To recap: the bill will introduce a number of significant changes to the Child Support Scheme. It is the crucial initial stage in implementing the government’s overhaul of the Child Support Scheme which was announced in February of this year. More extensive and complex elements included in the new formula will be introduced in the second and third stages. These changes are a response to the ongoing community concern and concern by this government about child support issues.
Presently, the scheme affects 1.4 million parents and 1.1 million children who have experienced family separation. In response to concerns about custody arrangements, the then House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs released its report Every picture tells a story in late 2003. Following that, a ministerial task force on child support was established to examine more closely the details involved, leading to its report In the best interests of children, which was presented to the government in mid-2005.
The task force’s report suggested that some elements of the present scheme are not aligned with community standards on shared parenting and the increased participation of women in the workforce. It suggested that the scheme is not an accurate reflection of the relationship between income and spending on children in ordinary families, nor is it well integrated with the income support family payments and family law systems. Under the bill, the minimum child support payment will be increased from the current amount, which is equal to $5 per week, to the amount that would have been in place if the old minimum had been indexed since its introduction in 1999. Linking the new minimum payment, currently equal to $6.15 per week, to indexation ensures that the value of the payment will not be eroded. The figure that sets the cap on a liable parent’s adjusted income to child support—
Sitting suspended from 6.30 pm to 7.30 pm
—I seek leave to move a motion relating to the leave of absence of two senators.
 (Senator Crossin)—My understanding is we will deal with the bill first and then take that motion. Sorry, I thought you were intending to move or speak to something in relation to this. I will call the minister, and we will finish dealing with the bill that is currently before us.
—When a Carlton supporter speaks to me and asks for leave to present some information to the Senate I generally take a very conciliatory approach. But I commend your ruling, Madam Acting Deputy President; it was entirely correct.
To recap, just before the dinner break I was indicating that the figure that sets the cap on a liable parent’s adjusted income for child support purposes is also amended by the bill. The cap is designed to limit the possibility of child support being paid by high-income parents at a level that exceeds the actual costs of caring for the child. Consequently, this measure provides that a liable parent’s income will be assessed in a way that is more in line with the actual costs of the children and that is more consistent with the treatment of the payee’s income. This measure replaces the full-time adult average weekly total earnings figure with the all employees average weekly earnings figure. These changes will effectively lower the maximum amount of a child support payment by high-income liable parents because, to use the initials, the EAWE figure is lower than the AWE figure.
The bill also includes a measure that sets out further matters for the child support registrar or a court to consider when making a decision about a parent’s capacity to earn. The capacity to earn decision is one where the parent’s real income is not disputed but the decision maker considers that the parent has a capacity to earn at a greater level than is being exercised. Consequently the decision maker may decide to assess the parent’s child support liability as being at a higher rate.
Capacity to earn decisions have been amongst the most controversial in the Child Support Scheme, as many senators will know. This measure will improve the clarity and accountability of capacity to earn decisions. The new method of assessment is intended to be flexible enough to allow parents whose earning capacity has been assessed for child support purposes to make work and lifestyle choices in the same way as parents in intact families. This might include pursuing a different career or reducing work hours because of caring responsibilities.
However, it is important that parents whose earning capacity has been assessed do not deliberately choose to avoid or reduce their child support liability by changing their working patterns. The Child Support Agency can still decide, if a parent cannot show that he or she had an appropriate reason for his or her decision about work changes, to find a higher capacity to earn.
The bill also increases the maximum percentage of a child’s support liability that may be credited towards prescribed non-agency payments such as child-care costs or school fees. This is designed to give payers of an enforceable maintenance liability greater determination over how child maintenance money is spent. This measure provides that credit may now be given up to a maximum of 30 per cent, instead of 25 per cent, of the ongoing liability in any payment period.
Finally, the bill addresses a constitutional issue with the application of the Child Support Scheme to ex-nuptial children in Western Australia. The Commonwealth government has the power under the Constitution to make laws in relation to the children of marriage; however, in relation to ex-nuptial children, Commonwealth laws only apply if the states have referred their powers to the Commonwealth or adopted Commonwealth laws. Except for Western Australia, all the states have referred to the Commonwealth their power to make laws in relation to ex-nuptial children. Western Australia has chosen instead to adopt the Commonwealth child support legislation from time to time.
However, the Western Australian adoption acts have tended to lag behind the Commonwealth amendments. Consequently in the periods before Western Australia has adopted Commonwealth amendments two parallel child support schemes have operated: a pre-amendment scheme applying to ex-nuptial children in Western Australia and a post-amendment scheme relating to the up-to-date legislation applying to all other children in Australia, including the children of marriage in Western Australia. The bill’s amendments confirm the legal status of this arrangement and provide certainty to the families and children affected.
In conclusion, as I mentioned, this is a very important bill. It is one which has engaged the interest of a considerable number of senators, and we congratulate the senators on their contribution. My understanding is that there will not be any amendments moved in the committee stage, but I think I am able to say that the government will be looking very carefully at the contributions that senators have made in this chamber in their consideration of future policy initiatives in this area, which affects a large number of Australians.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2006-06-13,"—I rise to speak on the ASIO Legislation Amendment Bill 2006. This bill comes with a significant history attached and it is worth while—in part at least—going through some of the background of this particular bill. Those in the chamber might recall that it was introduced in a form in 2002. It sought to enable the incommunicado detention of nonsuspects, both adults and children, for up to 48 hours with potential for the indefinite renewal of warrants under which they were to be held. That is the background upon which this current bill is before us. That bill was referred to the then Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD, together with other antiterrorism bills at that time. It was also referred to the committee that I served on—and still do—as a participating member of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee.
To go back through some of the history, numerous recommendations came out of that particular process, the 2002 bill passed the House of Representatives and was further amended in the Senate. The House of Representatives had accepted many of the amendments but negatived others that the Senate continued to press for. As a result the bill did not proceed. In fact it was laid aside and the rest finally came when the government brought forward a second bill—the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002. It was introduced into the House of Representatives back in March 2003. It was passed but, during the course of the passage through parliament, significant amendmentswere also made to the extent that it was—as those on this side of the chamber would say—a significantly improved bill that finally passed and was enacted.
It had significant powers, and you have to recall the time that was around—it was post-September 11, the government was urging these matters to be pressed and passed, and the opposition was taking a careful and considered approach as it always does in examining these matters. But ultimately what occurred was that the bill became law. What that also laid out was the ability for the matter to come back and be reviewed. What we have now is another report by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD entitled ASIO’s questioning and detention powers: review of the operation, effectiveness and implications of division 3 of part III in the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979. It provided the ability for the parliamentary joint committee to conduct what can only be considered an extensive review. It commenced, effectively, on Friday, 17 January 2005 with an advertisement which started the process. Background papers were prepared by the committee secretariat, hearings were then convened and conducted by members on that committee, and finally this report was produced. That is, in effect, the background to where we are today.
What I can say is that that committee did provide a significant number of recommendations, 19 in all, and it provided for the position where—and I will not go through, and certainly do not have the time to, each and every one of those recommendations—many were picked up by the government in this bill. But I think it is important to look at what the current provisions for questioning and detention are. In short, they enable:
... ASIO to obtain a warrant from an ‘issuing authority’ for a person to appear before a ‘prescribed authority’ for questioning in order to obtain intelligence that is important in relation to a terrorism offence.
Of course, the reasons for that would seem obvious to most. ASIO does have extensive powers but it is also charged with a very important task. ASIO is responsible for protecting Australia and its people from espionage; sabotage; politically motivated violence, including terrorism and the promotion of communal violence; attacks on Australia’s defence system; and acts of foreign interference. So ASIO does have significant powers under this legislation but it also has significant responsibility to ensure Australia is safe.
This bill deals with the ASIO terrorism related questioning and detention powers. The ASIO Legislation Amendment Bill 2006 includes a number of changes that adopt many of the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, which I was just speaking about. This is a significant breakthrough in improving a flawed bill. It also extends the sunset clause to 10 years, for review by legislation on 22 January 2016. I will come to this matter, as it clearly needs to be corrected.
Recommendations 2, 3, 6, 8, 11 and 12 of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security have been adopted. I will look at a couple of those. Recommendation 2 states:
The Committee recommends that, in order to provide greater certainty and clarity to the operation of the Act, the legislation be amended to distinguish more clearly between the regimes that apply to a person subject to a questioning-only warrant and that applying to detention.
In other words, it was not clear that there were two regimes. The recommendation seeks to ensure that there is a difference to be brought to bear, depending on whether the person is subject to a questioning-only warrant or detention. Recommendation 3 states:
The Committee recommends that the Act be amended to achieve a clearer understanding of the connection between the period of detention and the allowable period of questioning.
These seem to be fundamental matters that are now being sought to be corrected and agreed to. Recommendation 11 states:
The Committee recommends that:
a subject of a questioning-only warrant have a clear right of access to the IGIS or the Ombudsman and be provided with reasonable facilities to do so ...
I will not go to every recommendation, but schedule 2 provides certain rights for those being questioned or detained and questioned. Those rights clarify the maximum length in detention and how long a person may be questioned for and provide some clarification of the involvement of lawyers. The committee’s recommendation of a clearer regime dealing with the period of detention and the allowable period of questioning has been adopted. The joint committee’s recommendation that division 3 of part III of the act be amended to provide clarity between procedural time and questioning time has also been adopted. The recommendations to improve the operation of the act by distinguishing more clearly between the regimes that apply to a person subject to a questioning-only warrant and that applying to a person held under a detention warrant are in this bill.
I think it is clear that Labor has succeeded in achieving an amendment that clearly distinguishes between ASIO warrants for questioning and those for questioning while in detention. The bill also protects client-lawyer privilege in cases involving questioning warrants and in such cases enabling contact between a subject and their lawyer at any time while the subject is before a prescribed authority for questioning. In this amendment there is an explicit right of access to the state ombudsman or other relevant state bodies with jurisdiction to receive information and investigate the conduct of state police officers. It also imposes an obligation on the prescribed authority to advise the subject of this right.
That seems reasonable. You would expect that to occur. The ombudsman would be entitled to investigate state police officers. It is reasonable that the prescribed authority advise the subject of a warrant of their right to complain to relevant state bodies like the ombudsman. Items 5 and 6 of schedule 2 of the bill include amendments that ensure both questioning warrants and warrants for questioning and detention permit the person to contact a single lawyer of their choice at any time that they are appearing for questioning or are in detention. This equates to recommendation 4, in which the committee recommends that ‘a person who is the subject of a questioning-only warrant have a statutory right to consult a lawyer of choice’. If a person is appearing for questioning before a prescribed authority under a questioning warrant and indicates that they want to make a complaint to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security or the Commonwealth Ombudsman, then the prescribed authority can defer questioning and the person must be given facilities to make the complaint. This gives effect to recommendation 11, in which the committee recommends that ‘a subject of a questioning-only warrant have a clear right of access to the IGIS or the Ombudsman and be provided with reasonable facilities to do so’.
This bill allows a person who is detained under a detention warrant to make a complaint to the complaints agency of a police service, state or territory. The bill also enables a person’s lawyer to address the prescribed authority during breaks in questioning, which equates closely to recommendation 5. Whilst there are improvements to this legislation, the government has failed in two very important areas. Labor is deeply concerned that the government has not agreed to recommendations 10 and 19. Recommendation 10 states:
The Committee recommends that:
the supervisory role of the prescribed authority be clearly expressed; and
ASIO be required to provide a copy of the statement of facts and grounds on which the warrant was issued to the prescribed authority before questioning commences.
In recommendation 19, the committee recommended that the bill have a sunset provision. But, more importantly, the government and the opposition differ on the time. The government has proposed 10 years, which is, quite frankly, untenable. When the government was in opposition, the Liberals argued on many occasions for sunset clauses of much shorter durations. You can go back and have a look at some of those pieces of legislation, such as the Copyright Amendment Bill 1990. Way back in 1991, the Hon. Andrew Peacock argued for two years in a coalition amendment. You can go back to the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1994, for which, surprisingly, Mr Ruddock, while not opposing the bill, looked at three years. Mr David Connolly, for those who might recall, back in 1995 argued in a coalition amendment for two years.
Parliament imposed a three-year sunset clause on the 2002 antiterrorism laws together with an independent review. That was the standard this parliament set in 2002 on similar laws. The United Kingdom’s 2005 antiterrorism laws are subject to a one-year review. I could say a couple of things about the proposed 10-year sunset clause, but it is inconceivable that you could say with a straight face that 10 years is an acceptable period without a review. It would be ridiculous to suggest it if you were not the government, but it seems that the government can say with a straight face that it is reasonable. I do not think it is and nor do the opposition and, I suspect, minor parties and many who made submissions.
The second amendment deals with this government’s arrogant refusal to adopt the committee’s recommendation to require ASIO to provide a copy of the statement of facts and grounds on which the warrant was issued to the prescribed authority. The prescribed authority is supposed to supervise the questioning of a person. It is, you would think, impossible for the prescribed authority to assess whether any questioning is outside the scope of a warrant if they are not provided with a statement of facts and grounds on which a warrant was issued. At 3.59 of the committee report, the committee states:
The Committee believes that, for the prescribed authority to discharge fully their responsibilities, it is important that they have access to relevant information. The prescribed authority is not currently provided with a copy of ASIO’s statement of facts and grounds which support the issuing of the warrant. Access to this information will assist the prescribed authority exercise their supervisory role and a copy of all the relevant documentation should be provided before questioning begins.
It would seem sensible to follow that course. However, this government has demonstrated on many occasions before that it is not and does not wish to be sensible in respect of these matters. Labor will seek to move these amendments and will give the government another opportunity to reconsider its position and support Labor’s amendments. I can foreshadow that now.
Turning to the substantive debate, we have to recall that this was no ordinary run-of-the-mill legislation that sometimes passes in this house. It was perhaps best described in ASIO’s questioning and detention powers, the parliamentary joint committee report, which indicated that this legislation was one of the most controversial pieces of legislation ever to come here. When you look at the period of time, it was a significant piece of legislation which took a while to get through parliament in a form that was finally acceptable to all to pass.
Now we have the review and the government should be in a position to look at the recommendations that arise out of the review and adopt those recommendations, but we find again that the government has chosen not to do that. That is, as I indicated earlier, a significant disappointment. It is the case that the recommendations would provide greater clarity in the operation of the bill but, without picking up some aspects of those two important amendments, the government continues down the track of only doing half its job in this matter. The bill will provide greater certainty and clarity in the operation of the act and it will ensure that greater differentiation is applied in respect of the questioning-only warrants and those applying to persons held under detention. And those changes are welcome, as are the other matters. (Time expired)

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2006-06-13,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

I rise to speak to the ASIO Legislation Amendment Bill 2006.
The existing laws—and now the re-enactment of these laws—are a violation of the civil liberties of Australians. The laws curb the everyday freedoms of Australians and compromise the integrity of the fundamental institutions that are the foundation of our Government. Worse still, without any official codification of individual rights in this country, we are reduced to simply trusting that the Government knows what constitutes an abuse of its powers. This is simply not good enough.
The legislation gives the Executive the power to detain and question people who are not even suspected of a crime for up to seven days. It gives them the ability to detain and question minors.
These laws undermine the separation of powers doctrine which is the central political convention of this country. This Government is allowing itself to be manipulated by Terrorists to take away the freedoms which we hold dear. If we unjustly strip the freedom of just one person in the name of fighting the terrorist threat, we have already lost not just the battle, but the entire War on Terrorism.
ASIO’s so-called ‘questioning and detention powers’ are extreme measures that are unprecedented in Australia’s history but let’s call them what they really are: interrogation and detention powers. These laws are not proportionate to the supposed threat of terrorism. So far, Australian interests have been attacked by terrorists offshore in Indonesia in 2002 (Bali), 2004 (Australian Embassy Jakarta) and 2005 (Bali). Thankfully, we have no experience with so-called home grown ‘clean skin’ terrorists of the kind that struck at London last year.
When the original legislation was introduced in 2003, the then Attorney-General acknowledged that the measures were extraordinary “We have always said that we recognise that this bill is extraordinary; indeed, I have indicated repeatedly that I hope the powers under the bill never have to be exercised. But this bill is about intelligence gathering in extraordinary circumstances and is subject to significant safeguards.” despite ASIO’s assessment that this country is currently facing a ‘medium level’ threat.
The Government and the Opposition have had time to review and assess the operation of ASIO’s powers of interrogation and detention. The Democrats despite not being directly involved in this committee process have followed it closely and have observed the submissions made to the Parliamentary Joint Committee Inquiry into the interrogation and detention laws.
I note the report produced by the Committee states there was an overwhelming view from the submissions that these powers not be renewed and that all but 3 of the 113 submissions made to the inquiry called for the sunset clause to at least remain in operation.
The Government intends this legislation be in operation for a 10 year period before another parliamentary review and the sunset clause should be activated.
This level of delay is unacceptable and irresponsible.
In order to ensure that laws that dramatically affect the lives of all Australians are not abused, it is crucial that we maintain safeguards to ensure accountability and provide a check on executive power.
The fact that these laws will not be reviewed until 2016 suggests the Government would like to see them as a permanent part of the legal landscape in this country.
The report published by the Committee states that ASIO, to date, has been judicious in its use of the extended powers, however, it remains that the scope of these powers could potentially allow for them to be abused at some future date by an overzealous or incompetent Minister. This possibility would undercut the professional ethos of ASIO and any supporting security agency. Furthermore, under these conditions, what recourse do citizens unjustly singled out and victimised by these laws have in making the government accountable for their actions when things go catastrophically wrong?.
For example there is nothing in the legislation that requires that anyone must ensure that interrogation stops after a 48 hour period. While, to date, we have not had any incidents of interrogation continuing longer than the 48 hours, there still remains the potential for investigators to go beyond this period of time.
Such actions would be in breach of international conventions but not illegal under domestic legislation.
The ability of such abuses of power to go unnoticed is also possible as the legislation does not contain sufficient methods for an affected person to bring complaints to the attention of a non-governmental party. The secrecy provisions ensure that that this person does not communicate any grievances in a manner which would satisfactorily hold someone accountable for abuse of power.
Furthermore, as a Civil Liberties Australia submission dated November 2005 stated: “The world’s best police and security services with the world’s best laws and regulations will, on historical evidence, undertake surveillance on, detain and control/arrest a minimum of 500-1,000 individuals over that same time frame to achieve conviction of a possible 100. At the very least, twice as many innocent people will be caught up by provisions of the legislation each year as those with any case to answer” (CLA 07/11/05: 1). These types of figures are unacceptable.
Under this legislation, a person who discloses anything without authorisation regarding what transpired during their interrogation or detention within a two year period is liable for imprisonment for up to five years. The International Commission of Jurists stated in their submission that
‘because of the two year ban, there is little public scrutiny of the operation of the questioning powers. We have really no way of knowing what is going on. In this way, Australia’s laws are even more oppressive than those in the US and the UK.’
Australia remains one of the last bastions of Western democracy not to have some form of legislative instrument that encapsulates our basic freedoms and rights as Australian Citizens.
The framers of the Australian Constitution believed at the time of its drafting that the doctrines of Responsible Government, Natural Justice and the Separation of Powers should be enough to protect the freedoms of Australian citizens. They would turn in their graves if they were to bear witness to the events of recent times in these chambers, where we have legislation introduced that has the Executive being given the power to detain innocent people for periods beyond what any reasonable person would consider not to be punitive.
In the absence of a Bill of Rights or a Humans Rights Act, it is essential that the Parliament ensure that appropriate mechanisms are included in legislation to strengthen protections for civil liberties.
The secrecy provisions contain no balance of public interest and national security. As they stand, they operate as a blanket ban on anyone—including the media—from informing the public of any information regardless of whether it is in the public interest. In reference to the secrecy provisions Professor George Williams from UNSW, stated during the inquiry that;
They apply a very strict test in circumstances where such a test is not reasonable. They may catch people in circumstances where people ought not to be caught.
Of great concern was one confidential submission from the lawyer of a witness which claimed that the press may be used to print stories favourable to the Government agenda. In the submission the lawyer stated;
…it appeared material was briefed or leaked to the media to create sensational stories about the matter, often with aspects that appeared favourable to the government agenda… any person who seeks to correct such stories by giving the full information or even a proper explanation to the media would face the serious risk of prosecution under these provisions.
During the inquiry, there was a repeat of classified information being leaked to the media, with the images of the house of the affected person being shown on national television.
The idea that the media may be manipulated to serve a government agenda while the affected person may do nothing to defend themselves contravenes natural justice.
It is actions like these that have led to a strong sentiment of distrust and fear of the Islamic Community. The Islamic Council of New South Wales stated during the inquiry that:
The Australian Muslim community needs to feel protected and involved within the fabric of Australian society. The current ASIO laws and any proposed increase in powers will only act to reinforce anti-Muslim sentiments that are not in the best interests of a harmonious society.
If we are to encourage the existence of a harmonious multi-cultural society it is crucial that legislation promotes this as much as possible and reduces the potential for vilification on the grounds of race.
Not only are these actions creating anti-Muslim sentiment but it is also creating distrust of ASIO and other government agencies within the Islamic community. The Federation of Community Legal Centres stated during the inquiry that the legislation ‘leads to genuine fear in the community’ and that the level of fear within Melbourne’s Muslim Community was such that people would not attend information sessions about ASIO’s powers for fear of showing interest in terrorism.
A critical issue with the interrogation and detention laws is access to effective legal representation. The legislation provides that a person subject to a detention warrant may have access to a lawyer, however; a person subject to a so-called questioning only warrant is not assured of the right to legal representation.
Despite recommendations made by the Parliamentary Joint Committee report to allow for persons subject to a questioning only warrant to have access to a lawyer, the Government has not amended the legislation to allow this.
The reason given for this failure to include the right to legal representation was that such a requirement might delay interrogation in the face of an imminent terrorist attack.
While this reasoning might seem on the face of it to be reasonable, it does not take account of section 34U (5) of the legislation which allows for legal representation to be removed during interrogation where that legal representation is being unduly disruptive.
The fact that the Government would suggest that a lawyer could be disruptive is also surprising when we consider section 34U (4) of the current legislation, section 34ZQ (6) in the amendments, which states that a “legal adviser must not intervene in the interrogation of the subject or address the prescribed authority before whom the subject is being questioned.”
The effect of this section is to make the role of the lawyer completely redundant and ineffective.
The ability of the lawyer to know whether a particular line of interrogation is appropriate or not is also reduced because a person’s legal representation is not informed why their client is being questioned.
In addition to these measures, a person who is being questioned or detained is not guaranteed the right to talk confidentially with their legal representation. The proposed amendments state that the communications are not required to be made in a way that can be monitored. The inference from this statement is that while they may not be required to be made in a way that can be monitored, they may still be monitored.
Lawyers who made submissions during the inquiry stated these restrictions were unfair to clients.
They also stated that they believed that the interrogation powers were being used to supplement general policing powers, made possible by the lack of derivative use immunity and by the presence of police who seemed to be investigating police, on one occasion State police who were apparently concerned with a non-terrorist related matter.
We have extraordinary powers introduced on the supposition that they will be used to fairly and judiciously fight terrorism yet, we have reports from a lawyer who witnessed an interrogation session and claims that these powers are being used for purposes beyond which they were created.
It is hard to claim that there is no scope for abuse of powers when we already have allegations that such abuses have occurred.
The transcript of these allegations is classified and not having been given the opportunity to participate in the inquiry, I am restricted to calling on the Government to initiate an investigation into these allegations. This is clearly a situation which would suggest that these laws need further and more serious consideration.
Where there is the potential for serious breaches of civil liberties and, in particular, this case where review is not set for another ten years, it is necessary that the legislation contain adequate reporting requirements so that the Parliament can properly consider the success of the laws.
Despite recommendations from the Parliamentary Joint Committee, the Government has not increased any reporting requirements.
Such a move further reduces the agency’s level of accountability.
Australia is constantly being reminded that it is only a matter of time before we suffer from a terrorist attack; that the world on the whole has changed for the worse; and, we must introduce laws that will address this issue.
In 2003 when the ASIO laws were first introduced many concerns were raised by ASIO that the powers were not expansive enough and that the compromises made by the Government operated to weaken the ability of the intelligence agencies.
It was stated that the compromises made the legislation unduly complex.
Yet, during the inquiry on the review of these laws, the Director-General of Security stated that “our concerns were misplaced. We were wrong in worrying about it.”
Admittedly, implementing safeguards can often be more resource-intensive but it is worth the extra strain on ASIO’s massively increased resources in order to keep this highly secretive agency accountable.
In response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, the Prime Minister made the observation that it would be:
... a terrible, tragic, obscene irony if, in responding ... to these terrible, terrorist attacks, we forsook the very things that we believed had been assaulted ...
With a heavy heart I say to the Prime Minister that the Government has terribly, tragically and with obscene irony forsaken the very things that we believed to have been assaulted by the terrorist attacks of September 11.",SENATE,<title>ASIO LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,35,1

"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2006-06-13,"—Unexpectedly, it would seem that I too now have the opportunity to speak on the ASIO Legislation Amendment Bill 2006. As Senator Ludwig outlined in his contribution, the bill deals with the ASIO terrorism-related questioning and detention powers. It is claimed that it provides clarity for questioning warrants and also for warrants for questioning whilst people are in detention. It extends the sunset clause for 10 years, with a review of the legislation on 22 January 2016. As Senator Ludwig reminded us in his contribution, for those senators who joined this place at the same time as I did, the initial legislation was one of the first and one of the most controversial bills that we dealt with, and we spent an exhausting amount of time considering it.
It is important to place on record that Labor welcomes the changes to clearly distinguish between ASIO warrants for questioning and those for questioning whilst in detention, and it welcomes the subject’s access to lawyers and to the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security. But, as has been outlined—and as I am sure some of my colleagues who will follow will outline more eloquently—we are concerned that the government has not agreed to recommendations 10 and 19 of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD.",SENATE,<title>ASIO LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,35,1
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2006-06-13,"—At the outset, let me say that this legislation deals with intelligence gathering pertaining to a potential terrorist act. This is not about law enforcement; it is not about providing criminal sanctions for involvement in terrorism. It has to be said: this is tough legislation, bordering on the draconian. It has caused eyebrows to be raised in the United Kingdom and in the United States. I have been asked by members of the House of Commons and members of the US Congress: how is it possible to bring in legislation that is this tough? Sure, the Patriot Act in the United States is pretty tough legislation, but it basically applies to non-citizens. This particular piece of legislation, especially as it denies the right to silence, is regarded as at the extreme of antiterrorist legislation. Given the many hardline provisions in this ASIO legislation, the crucial thing I stress to these people is that if you have sufficient oversight then some of the more draconian aspects come back into balance.
The joint intelligence committee has, as it was mandated to do, made a detailed study not only of the legislation as it exists but also of how it has operated over the last 2½ years. We say that it is pleasing that only a few people have been subject to questioning warrants and, indeed, no-one has been subject to a detention warrant coming out of this legislation. Overall, one would have to say that the processes have worked fairly well.
There have been some weaknesses identified in the current legislation, and we have made quite a number of recommendations from the joint intelligence committee to the government. In turn, the government has adopted many of those suggestions—all of which, by the way, were unanimous. A few of the recommendations were either accepted in part or were rejected with valid reasons provided by the government, and generally I accept their sincerity on these issues. The reasons for not adopting some of the recommendations seem to me to be well argued and well reasoned. However, two crucial recommendations have been rejected, and the reasons provided by the government for rejection are insipid at best.
Before I go to those two recommendations, let me remind the Senate of what was in the original bill which was introduced into this parliament in 2002 and which was basically set aside, because it remains, to this day, the worst piece of legislation—by far—ever submitted to this Australian Senate in over 105 years. Let us not forget that those provisions were put into this parliament by former Attorney-General Williams and were concurred with by the Prime Minister of Australia, John Howard. Just remember some of the original provisions, if you will.
According to the legislation as it was then construed, we were able to detain and question non-suspects, on a renewable warrant, forever. There were not proper limitations put in. What is more, these very people who were being questioned could be held incommunicado. There was no provision on legal representation, in fact there was a bar on it, for suspects who were to be questioned or detained. There was no protection from self-incrimination. Given the fact that there was no right to silence, we left these people in a position where they were better off to say nothing and cop five years in jail than to self-incriminate themselves and possibly leave themselves open to 10 to 20 years in jail. Under the original legislation, 10-year-olds could be detained and kept incommunicado. Ten-year-old girls could be strip searched. It was a horrible, horrible piece of legislation. Attorney-General Williams and the Attorney-General’s Department showed no shame. Not even ASIO, I think, were happy with the legislation as it first appeared. It is possible that it was introduced as a negotiating tactic: go to the extreme, then retreat back to the middle. That would be more understandable if the legislation had not been set aside because this Senate would not approve it. And, of course, there was no sunset clause whatsoever in the legislation. It was to go on forever. I have given only a small summary of the horrors that existed in the bill.
Once the bill was set aside, some commonsense started to prevail. An enormous effort was put in by the joint intelligence committee to improve the bill. The Senate References Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs did some magnificent work in this area. And I have to say my colleague Senator Faulkner, who was the then shadow minister, put in an enormous effort in terms of negotiation and consideration to see this bill improved. I should not be churlish: let me acknowledge that some Liberal backbenchers also put in hard yards on this particular legislation. What emerged from it was still tough legislation, but it was balanced and it had scrutiny. It had technical errors in it and the reason it had technical areas is that we were all concerned with these big picture items and some things slipped through. Now is the opportunity to correct those technical errors. For the most part, the government has done so and is to be congratulated for picking up those recommendations.
The Labor Party wants to pursue two of the joint intelligence committee’s recommendations that the government has failed to adopt. The first one relates to making the warrant available to the prescribed authority. The problem at the moment is when a lawyer wants to intervene—and their right to intervene will be increased under this legislation—on the question of relevance of the questioning process, the prescribed authority does not know the grounds on which the warrant has been issued; therefore, it is left in the impossible position of not knowing whether those questions are relevant or not or whether it is just a giant fishing expedition, trawling through a whole variety of things that were never relevant to the original warrant. I do not think there is any reason why the prescribed authority, which, after all, is trusted with some fairly sensitive information, cannot be at least apprised of the fact of what the original warrant was issued for.
The second of the recommendations already mentioned in this debate relates to the sunset clause. In their submissions to the joint intelligence committee, both A-G’s and ASIO argued for no sunset clause, arguing that the current implementation of the legislation had been exemplary. It is possible of course to attribute that exemplary behaviour to the fact that we had a sunset clause in the legislation. It is a pretty good straightener: when you know the legislation is going to expire in three years time, you are not likely to abuse it. That is the value of sunset clauses. There was a time when the Liberal Party were keen on sunset clauses. If you look to the mid-nineties, you would see that every second piece of legislation they were moving a sunset clause to. There were one-year, two-year and, in one case, just a six-month sunset clause—I think that was taxation legislation or something similar.
—The Training Guarantee (Administration) Bill.
—Yes, as my colleague the senior senator from New South Wales tells me.
—I will speak more about that in a moment.
—Indeed, I do not want to steal his thunder on that particular point. The Attorney-General, Mr Philip Ruddock, in his second reading speech argued for a much longer sunset clause because reviewing was such an intensive process. Oh, poor old Attorney-General’s Department and poor old ASIO are exhausted because in 5½ years they may have to review this legislation! Frankly, if you cannot hack it, put the cue in the rack. A sunset clause of 5½ years is exceptionally generous. The committee recognised—unanimously, by the way, with a government majority—that three years was a short period of time in terms of security legislation. Why 5½ years? Because it fell perfectly in the electoral cycle—mid stage of an electoral cycle where it could be considered rationally and dispatched well out from an election period.
At one stage, it was argued to us, ‘Oh, we do not want to deal with it in an inflammatory environment.’ For the first lot of legislation, you could not have got a more inflammatory environment—all of which ran the way of Attorney-General’s, the Attorney-General himself and ASIO itself. It really is insulting to us legislators that we may be, in some way, swayed by an inflammatory environment; that we cannot make rational decisions on security legislation. We are so immature, apparently, that that cannot occur. I notice that argument has at least dropped away, and I appreciate that it has.
The argument for a 10-year sunset clause is a total joke. We have not seen many sunset clauses of that length. It is not a sunset clause. We will have probably two directors of ASIO come and go before this legislation ceases. We are all old hacks, I guess, on the joint intelligence committee. Nearly all of us have our careers behind us. We recognise that. We were probably picked for the fact that we do not have a big stake in the future; therefore, we can be more objective. We all joked that with a 5½-year sunset rule, we will not be around for the next review. For heaven’s sake, under this 10-year rule, our successors will probably not be around to review the legislation! In effect, the 10-year sunset clause is no sunset clause at all.
I really believe, irrespective of the government having a majority in this chamber, that this is one occasion on which I would like to see the chamber insist on a reasonable sunset clause—one that serves the nation and does not reward people not wanting to be scrutinised. This is what it is all about: it is about balance—yes, it is tough legislation—but it is also about scrutiny and as much transparency as the secrecy of these areas allows. From that you get an honest system. No-one doubts at the moment that ASIO and the representatives from the Attorney-General’s Department are acting with full propriety in this regard. All those scare campaigns that were run, all those horrific pictures that were raised about this legislation, have not come to pass. All that crying of wolf was for nothing. But people would be less likely to cry wolf, less likely to raise those scare campaigns if they were convinced that this legislation would expire in 5½ years, not 10 years off into the distance.
I want to leave on one last point. One concern that was raised with the committee, and not with full evidence, is the role of state police in these activities. We must have for a variety of reasons the cooperation of the Federal Police and the state police in these regimes. But one wonders whether the state police have been trying to ask, if you like, the interrogators to ask the suspect or the witness about matters not relating to intelligence matters but to criminal activities. You have to understand that derivative use remains in this particular legislation, and I support that—self-incrimination has gone but derivative use remains. But we cannot have, as alleged by at least one counsel for one of the suspects, a situation pertain where police get questions asked before they can pursue them through other avenues, because if the people do not answer the questions or falsely answer them they could get five years jail.
Why we worry about this is that in certain ASIO raids executing warrants, guess what has happened at the premises where the warrants have been executed? The cameras from television stations are outside. They can only do that if they are tipped off. What we are involved in here is a difference in culture—the difference in culture between law enforcement and intelligence gathering, and the two should not get mixed up. This will require a fair degree of leadership from ASIO to make sure that when people are examined and questioned, it is for the purpose of intelligence gathering and not for the purpose of criminal investigation where derivative use will assist them in their inquiries. I do not allege, by the way, that that has happened. All I say is that the allegation has been made and therefore there is a need for vigilance in this particular area. I am absolutely convinced that the leaking of the location of execution of warrants does not come from ASIO. It is not part of their culture. It is not in their self-interest to do so, but it is a bit of a tradition in various state police forces and it must be avoided at all cost.
In conclusion, this legislation on the whole sees improvements incorporated in the system. I would prefer, however, that our amendment in relation to showing the warrant to the prescribed authority go through, but even more so I think this chamber, if it could, should reinsert the sunset clause of 5½ years. It fits the electoral cycle. It was a unanimous decision of nine members of the joint intelligence committee, and I believe it was sensibly thought through. A 10-year sunset clause is just a throwaway line to say we are not going to have one. It will not in certain circumstances keep ASIO honest in terms of their execution of the legislation.",SENATE,<title>ASIO LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,35,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2006-06-13,"—This bill is intended to respond to the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD: ASIO’s questioning and detention powers—Review of the operation, effectiveness and implications of Division 3 of Part III in the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979. It was undertaken by the joint committee. I am currently a member of the newly re-formed Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security but I was not involved with the committee’s inquiry at the time it was undertaken and reported in November 2005.
It is fair to say that the provisions of the ASIO Act involving questioning and detention powers have always been controversial provisions. They have always in this chamber engendered an enormous amount of debate and engendered real concern in the community. The new powers were originally introduced in the ASIO Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002. That bill was subject to thorough and exhaustive committee consideration from both the old Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD as well as the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. Lengthy examinations of the bill were undertaken.
The legislation before us responds to the report of the then Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD. That committee made 19 recommendations. All those recommendations were unanimous. The committee, of course, has a government chair and it has a government majority. I think any fair-minded person would say if they examined the report of the committee that it was a thorough inquiry. The committee held private hearings on five days and public hearings on four days into these controversial provisions of the ASIO Act. It was a thorough and exhaustive examination of those provisions.
What was the government’s response to the government chaired and government controlled committee? It agreed to six of the 19 recommendations. It agreed to recommendations Nos 2, 3, 6, 8, 11 and 12. To another six recommendations it agreed only in part. That was to recommendations Nos 4, 5, 7, 10, 13 and 19. To a further six of the 19 recommendations the government did not agree. They were recommendations Nos 1, 9, 15, 16, 17 and 18. The final recommendation, recommendation No. 14, was described in the government response as ‘not agreed at this stage’. In my view, it was a disappointing and inadequate response to a serious inquiry by a serious parliamentary committee.
In this second reading contribution, I wish to refer to just two of those recommendations. I want to highlight those two recommendations because the opposition will be attempting to reflect the recommendations of the joint parliamentary committee in amendments to this bill during the committee stage a little later on. The first is recommendation No. 10. It is a two-part recommendation. I read the recommendation to the Senate:
The Committee recommends that:
the supervisory role of the prescribed authority be clearly expressed; and
ASIO be required to provide a copy of the statement of facts and grounds on which the warrant was issued to the prescribed authority before questioning commences.
The government’s failure to act on the second part of this recommendation significantly diminishes the safeguards in the detention regime. Ask yourself the question: what possible negative consequences could flow from a statement of facts and grounds on which a warrant was issued being made available to the prescribed authority? It makes obvious good sense that the prescribed authority should have access to all relevant information and that that information should be available to the prescribed authority before questioning commences. I would suggest that a prescribed authority could not possibly fulfil their crucial obligations if they were hamstrung and kept in the dark. We must have transparency on this matter.
Of course, prescribed authorities, by their nature, are persons of high standing. Their role is important—it is very important. It is essential for accountability under this legislation. How can a prescribed authority determine whether questions are appropriate if they do not know the grounds for the issue of the warrant in the first place? How can they judge the fairness of questioning if they do not know the grounds for the issue of the warrant in the first place? And obviously there can be no national security implications here. The government determines who the prescribed authorities are, and no argument has yet been presented by the government against this very sensible and, one would have thought, straightforward recommendation of the PJC.
The second recommendation of the PJC that I would like to draw attention to—which, as I said, will be the subject of an amendment at a later stage—is recommendation No. 19, in relation to continuation of the legislation. I read that recommendation to the Senate:
The Committee recommends that:
Section 34Y be maintained in Division 3 Part III of the ASIO Act 1979, but be amended to encompass a sunset clause to come into effect on 22 November 2011; and
Paragraph 29(1)(bb) of the Intelligence Services Act 2001 be amended to require the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security to review the operations, effectiveness and implications of the powers in Division 3 Part III and report to the Parliament on 22 June 2011.
In other words, it recommends a review by the committee of the parliament charged with undertaking these reviews, which now has the name of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, and for a sunset clause to come into effect later that year, in late November 2011. The proposition in simple terms, if you like, is a 5½-year sunset clause, as opposed to the government’s proposal, which is a 10-year sunset clause. As Senator Ray said a little earlier in his contribution, a 10-year sunset clause is no sunset clause at all.
It is clear from the statistics that are available that a majority of senators will not even be here in 10 years time. The last available statistics in relation to the length of Senate terms show that the average length of a senator’s term is some seven to eight years, so a majority of the place will have turned over. Of course, it is a similar pattern for the House of Representatives. So this 10-year sunset clause is farcical. There is no point at all in having a 10-year sunset clause. It is a clayton’s sunset clause.
I am also interested in the hypocrisy of the Liberal Party when it comes to this issue of sunset clauses. When the Liberal Party was in opposition, it had a very different view on these matters. In December 1990, Mr Jull, now the Chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, proposed a three-year sunset period in a coalition amendment to the Australian Sports Drug Agency Bill. In December 1990, the Hon. Andrew Peacock, well known in the Liberal Party, proposed a two-year sunset clause in a coalition amendment to the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Bill. In 1991, the aforementioned Andrew Peacock, in a coalition amendment, proposed a two-year sunset clause for the Copyright Amendment Bill. As Senator Ray mentioned, Kevin Andrews, now infamous as the workplace relations minister, proposed a six-month sunset clause in a coalition amendment to the Training Guarantee (Administration) Amendment Bill. We had the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Amendment Bill in 1992 where David Connolly opposed the removal of a sunset clause and wanted it continued for another year—a sunset period of a year. We had the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) in 1994, when the shadow minister was Minister Ruddock; he did not oppose a three-year sunset period in that legislation. And we had the Small Superannuation Accounts Bill of 1995 where David Connolly proposed a two-year sunset period in a coalition amendment.
The key point about all that legislation is that none of it was as controversial as this legislation. This is amongst the most controversial legislation ever introduced into the parliament. And one of the reasons, of course, that it was so controversial is that it was so poorly drafted by Mr Daryl Williams QC, MP, the Attorney-General at the time. It was draconian, it was extreme, it was sloppy and it was poorly drafted. Only someone like Mr Daryl Williams could have been responsible for the embarrassing legislation that he brought forward. No wonder Mr Daryl Williams QC, MP, left the parliament with his tail between his legs.
I will never forget the meetings I had with Mr Daryl Williams QC, MP, negotiating with him, as I was then the responsible shadow minister for the opposition, and trying to work through a reasonable regime. It was not a question of getting a straight answer to a straight question: you could not get any answer from Mr Daryl Williams QC, MP, to any question at all. You would ask him a question. He would sit there like a rabbit in the spotlight. He would look to one side to his advisers and then to the other side to his advisers—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. There is fair comment allowed in a robust debate, but I think now the senator is reflecting on a former member in a manner which is inappropriate. The comments that Senator Faulkner has been—
—Under what standing order is that?
—I would say, in relation to Senator Faulkner’s comments, that they have been robust and that is the nature of debate in this place; however, the more recent ones, which I will not repeat, I believe are inappropriate and he should be called to order.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—Whether it is right or it is wrong, Senator Ellison, the standing orders do not protect former members.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. The former Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill, when I complained to him that we could not negotiate on these matters because of Mr Williams’s incompetence or lack of interest or lack of knowledge said, ‘Oh, just deal with Daryl’s harem.’ That is what he called Mr Williams’s office: Daryl’s harem. I was not going to deal with Daryl’s harem. I wanted to deal with Mr Daryl Williams QC, MP. I wanted to talk to the horse’s head in relation to these matters. I have to say that he was completely under the thumb of these junior staff in his office and it was extremely difficult to conduct any sensible negotiations at all with Mr Williams.
Mr Williams should be absolutely ashamed of himself for that draconian and sloppy, poorly drafted legislation that he was responsible for introducing into this parliament. Senator Ray said earlier in this second reading debate that it was the worst-drafted piece of legislation ever introduced into this parliament in the 105-year history of the Commonwealth of Australia. And Senator Ray was absolutely right. What a legacy for Mr Daryl Williams QC, MP—and how appropriate that he snuck out of the parliament with his tail between his legs. He should never, ever be forgotten for that appalling performance as Attorney-General of the Commonwealth of Australia.",SENATE,<title>ASIO LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,35,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2006-06-13,"—The ASIO Legislation Amendment Bill 2006 is an important step towards balancing protection measures with appropriate safeguards. As previous senators have outlined, it is in response to a review of the ASIO Act by what is now called the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. I can say that the work done by that committee was extensive, and I acknowledge the work done by members of that committee. I also want to acknowledge the comments of Senator Ray, who pointed to some of the positive aspects of this bill, albeit that there were recommendations of the committee that the government is not accepting. Senator Faulkner outlined accurately the recommendations which have been agreed to, those which have been partially agreed to and those which have not been agreed to, and the government has tabled its response outlining the reasons for accepting or not accepting some of those recommendations.
I would like to address some points in relation to the debate. The first one relates to the sunset provision, particularly the length of the provision. The government accepts the parliamentary joint committee’s recommendation for ongoing review and a further sunset period for ASIO’s questioning and detention powers. The length of time, however, is a matter of issue. The government is saying that the period of 5½ years recommended by the parliamentary joint committee is insufficient. The government believes that a 10-year sunset period is more appropriate. A 10-year sunset period is consistent with the sunset period applying to the recently enacted Anti-Terrorism Act (No. 2) 2005 and agreed to by state and territory premiers. The experience of recent statutory reviews has shown that such reviews are resource-intensive and impact on operational priorities. I think that is an important aspect to bear in mind when dealing with an agency such as ASIO.
Given these considerations, and the fact that the government is continuously reviewing the effectiveness of legislation, an earlier review or sunset period is not warranted. The longer period is also consistent with the period the government assesses there is likely to be a need for this legislation. As the Attorney-General has said in the other place, it is important that we do not get lulled into a false sense of security that no terrorist attack will happen in Australia. Just recently we saw the head of ASIO at Senate estimates once again outline, in an opening statement to the committee, the current threat to Australia in relation to terrorist activity. It is important that we ensure, therefore, that powers which have been found to be effective by the parliamentary joint committee continue for a period of time in which it is assessed that they are likely to be required.
The opposition expressed concern about the government’s decision in relation to recommendations 10 and 19, which relate to the provision of information to prescribed authorities and the sunset clause. I notice that the opposition has circulated amendments on these topics and I will deal with those during the committee stage when they arise. Suffice to say the government will not be supporting these amendments, for reasons previously set out by the Attorney-General. I particularly note that the bill imposes not just a sunset clause but a requirement for a detailed review by the parliamentary joint committee. That is an important point to note in this debate. One aspect of the sunset clause which the government rejects is the notion that a shorter period would mean that ASIO is less likely to abuse its powers. In the affluxion of time that has taken place, the review has found that the measures provided by the legislation have worked reasonably well. I think that, having regard to that, one can safely assume that they will continue to do so. We are not saying that the legislation should continue without a review; however, a 10-year period is a much more appropriate period to adopt.
The bill has many positive aspects which are very important for the security of Australia. I have acknowledged the work done by the parliamentary joint committee. It is the case with legislation, when it is reviewed by a committee, that the government of the day does not necessarily accept all the recommendations made by that committee. That does not necessarily mean that the committee did not carry out extensive work or that the work was not thoroughly done; it is a question of policy and accepting what is relevant and appropriate for the needs of the day. I think that the government has approached this in a rational manner in determining which of those recommendations should be agreed to. I therefore commend the bill to the Senate.
Question negatived.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2006-06-13,"—I rise this evening to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Tax Reduction and Improved Depreciation Arrangements) Bill 2006. This bill gives effect to tax changes announced in the 2006-07 budget by amending the tax laws and the Medicare Levy Act 1986 to change personal income tax rates and thresholds, the low-income tax offset, the Medicare levy phase-in rate and the fringe benefits tax rate. This bill also increases deductions for the decline in value of depreciating assets under the diminishing value method and project pools.
Whilst not indicating opposition to these measures, I wish to highlight the problems in the government’s approach to taxation. Prior to the budget the case for wholesale reform of Australia’s taxation system was absolutely compelling. Our system lacks both vertical and horizontal equity, is excessively complex and no doubt is a brake on economic growth. Individual taxpayers were paying too much, ridiculous compliance burdens were killing small business, and poor interaction between individual, company and capital gains tax systems posed a serious threat to our future prosperity.
At the coalface, serious questions were being raised about the way the Australian Taxation Office deals with individual taxpayers and some small business entities. People were calling for regulations to be simplified and radically reduced, not just pruned at the edges. There is no doubt that our tax system is a cumbersome giant tripping over its own heels. Were any of those issues dealt with in this budget tax cut measure? Unfortunately not.
The first priority for the repair and redesign of the personal tax area is critical. The way that rates and thresholds are structured results in the tax burden on the average employee being unjustifiably high. The economy-wide effects of a high tax burden on labour are very significant. The first effect is the disincentive for labour market participation. The second effect is that the incentive for labour productivity growth is curtailed. Labour productivity ultimately flows through into higher wages, but if they are too highly taxed then the rewards for innovation and better workplace outcomes are weakened. The third effect is a reduction in our competitiveness. High rates tend to reduce Australia’s capacity to compete for skilled labour. This will ultimately reduce productivity and, of course, has also led to the regime this government now has in place to import labour from other countries rather than giving Australians an opportunity.
One aspect of the tax debate which is misguided is the assumption that the majority of these economic benefits will necessarily flow from tax reform at the top end of the income scale. Indeed, the combination of tax cuts and family payment systems has become a potpourri of disincentives. The burden of these disincentive traps falls most unfairly on low-income earners, especially sole parents, who are lucky to retain $1 in every $4 from a wage increase. This is the prime reason why Australia’s labour market participation rates lag behind those of our international competitors, especially the United States.
The personal tax system remains too complex. Growth in deductions is rapidly outpacing growth in revenue. How is this explained? This is further evidence that the review of aspects of the personal work related deduction system is long overdue. Tax returns are far too onerous. The government should consider a tick-the-box type of approach so that taxpayers can be freed from the complexity of the current system. Major problems also exist outside the personal tax area. The small business sector continues to face crippling compliance burdens, which eat into its capacity to innovate. Differential rates in company, personal and capital gains tax distort economic incentives. Treatment of tax losses discourages investment in exploration and venture capital.
Tax legislation and administrative practice have been poor in recent years. At least 13 flawed tax measures were introduced into the parliament during 2005 alone. Treasury’s record in providing regulatory impact statements is notoriously bad, as the Productivity Commission has pointed out. Where explanations of new law are provided, they are not in plain English and are often inaccurately costed.
Simplification is a major challenge and cannot be properly tackled with half-baked measures. The lesson of history is that such attempts to simplify tax law tend to have the perverse effect of increasing complexity. Now that the legislation has exploded to 9,000 pages, the plan to cut 2,000 redundant pages looks a little bit less than ambitious. The government must begin a serious program of simplifying and consolidating operative provisions. Perhaps they should look to the UK system of targeted reductions in business regulation.
The ATO is performing below par. For example, the overly aggressive approach to the handling of small business tax debts is a real worry. This approach led to more than 2,000 small business bankruptcies last year alone. The tax inspector’s call for a more case-by-case approach is well justified and I support it. It may be time to look at a US-style loans guarantee program for small business.
The tax system is the primary driver of incentives in our economy. When it does not fit together neatly, harmoniously and simply, consumers and investors face increased uncertainty and high transaction costs. This is a brake on economic growth. Genuine tax reform is needed to lift workforce participation and productivity to the levels of our competitors. This will lead to increases in growth and per capita GDP. We need to realise that Australia will not bridge the gap between Australia and US GDP per capita with the current tax system.
Did the budget address these concerns? The overwhelming answer has to be no. The Treasurer does not seem to understand that there is a difference between tax cuts and tax reform. The Treasurer consistently says in public that there is no difference. Tax reform improves the efficiency of the tax system. It restores vertical and horizontal equity to the tax system. It reduces the compliance impact of the tax system. But we saw none of that in this budget, and there is none of that in the bill before the Senate this evening.
I turn to the second point I want to make—that is, how this package is funded. This takes me to the issue of forecasting. Senators may have been reading the Australian Financial Review with some interest recently because, in the Senate estimates process, Labor senators tried some teasing-out of their own to try to determine what is going on in this area of revenue forecasting. Something very strange is happening. While there was no increase in the company tax rate, for example, in the budget, the effective tax rate on companies is actually increasing. Mr Chris Richardson from Access Economics made the point that something strange is happening when company revenue is growing at 18 per cent and company profits are growing at 12 per cent.
We challenge the minister when summing up this debate to tell us the basis on which his projections of company tax revenue are made. It is pretty simple. These increases in company tax receipts are critical to funding the tax cuts, and I think it is appropriate for the Treasurer, given the uncertainty that was raised in the budget estimates period, to tell us exactly what is happening. He should tell us specifically why it is that the budget is getting an 18 per cent increase in company tax receipts while company profits are growing by only 12 per cent. He might come in here and say: ‘This is very easy to explain. Companies, particularly mining companies, over the last year or so have been investing heavily in additional capacity to try to catch up with demand, particularly in China.’ That would explain why there would be a disparity in the figures.
But nowhere in the budget papers are we given any such explanation, so the minister, in closing the debate, should perhaps explain why it is that we have company receipts growing at 18 per cent and company profits growing at 12 per cent. As I said, if it is the result of heavier deductions which flow from the additional investment in productive capacity, we would be satisfied with that answer, but if the minister says, ‘No, that’s not what it’s all about,’ can he tell us what it is about? It is a new phenomenon, one we have not been familiar with in the past, and I think the Australian people deserve an explanation.
These revenue forecasts are so important, and of course we all know that revenue forecasting can be manipulated for political gain. Senator Watson in the Senate estimates hearings made the point that it is possible that real and meaningful wholesale tax reform might have been overlooked because of conservative revenue forecasts. Maybe it is time to learn from international practice, perhaps by taking a US-style approach and having an independent agency to do the forecasting on behalf of the government or by looking at the UK model of having, in parallel, an institute funded by the government also measuring the forecasts to keep the government of the day honest.
I wish to conclude by highlighting a little hypocrisy of the Treasurer. He was bragging to the G8 meeting that Australia leads the world in transparency of budget processes. I do not think so. The hopeless performance of Treasury in revenue forecasting is surely proof against this. Moreover, the Treasurer will not open up his forecasting assumptions and explain the enormous upgrading in estimates by over $40 billion since MYEFO in December last year. Where is the transparency in this? Poor forecasting records hamper tax reform, as it makes it impossible to construct good policy. Perhaps this explains why all we get from the Treasurer is tax breaks and not real tax reform.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (PERSONAL TAX REDUCTION AND IMPROVED DEPRECIATION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,36,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-06-13,"—Schedules 1 to 4 of the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Tax Reduction and Improved Depreciation Arrangements) Bill 2006 amend the tax laws and the Medicare Levy Act 1986 to provide changes to personal income tax rates and thresholds, the low-income tax offset, the Medicare levy phase-in rate and the fringe benefits tax rate. Schedules 1 to 4 will cost $10.6 billion over four years.
Schedule 1 increases the 30 per cent tax threshold from $21,601 to $25,001. It reduces the second highest marginal tax rate from 42 per cent to 40 per cent and increases the threshold for that rate to $75,001. It reduces the highest marginal tax rate from 47 per cent to 45 per cent and increases the highest tax threshold to $150,001. Schedule 1 also makes a range of consequential amendments resulting from the reduction in the top marginal tax rate.
Schedule 2 reduces the fringe benefits tax rate from 48½ per cent to 46½ per cent from 1 April 2006. Schedule 3 amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to increase the low-income tax offset from $235 to $600 and increases the income threshold from which the tax offset begins to phase out from $21,600 to $25,000. Schedule 4 amends the Medicare Levy Act 1986 to increase the income threshold that applies to taxpayers who are eligible for the senior Australians tax offset and reduces the Medicare levy phase-in rate from 20 per cent to 10 per cent.
Schedule 5 amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to increase deductions for the decline in value of depreciating assets under the diminishing value method and project pools. This schedule costs an astonishing $1.2 billion over four years.
The government changes to the personal income tax scales will take effect from 1 July 2006. These changes come on top of changes already due to take effect from 1 July passed following the announcement by the government in last year’s budget. The changes to personal income tax scales already passed in 2005 were to lift the top threshold for the 30 per cent band from $63,000 to $70,000, but that will now be $75,000. The changes to personal income tax scales already passed in 2005 were to lift the top threshold for the 42 per cent band from $95,000 to $125,000, but that will now be $150,000. And, of course, the changes to personal income tax scales now drop the top rate of 47 per cent, presently applying above $95,000, to 45 per cent applying above $150,000.
In addition, the government announced a large increase in the low-income tax offset from its present level of $235 to $600 from 1 July, and the threshold at which the offset begins to phase out will also rise, from $21,600 to $25,000.
The impacts at different income levels of the cumulative changes and tax arrangements vary. The Democrats have long advocated a tax-free threshold of $10,000, and this tax cuts package does deliver an effective $10,000 tax-free threshold. The budget papers indicate that, once the proposed low-income rebate has been taken into account, a person whose income is below $25,000 per annum has an effective tax-free amount of $10,000 per year excluding Medicare. Under the proposed Medicare levy rates, no Medicare levy is payable until a person’s income exceeds $16,772 per annum in 2006-07. A reduced rate of levy is paid until a person’s income reaches $19,332. This bill before us raises the disposable income of persons earning $10,000 by 3.8 per cent and persons earning $25,000 by 4.6 per cent.
The budget also delivers additional family tax benefits, and for that you must see other legislation that increases the real income of low- and middle-income Australians. None of this justifies an estimated 5.4 per cent increase in disposable income for those earning $125,000 and 6.5 per cent for those earning $150,000 when lower and middle-income Australians still suffer such high effective marginal tax rates.

"Watson, Sen John",LP,2006-06-13,"—Tonight I rise to honour a man who served the Senate for most of his working life. I refer to Mr Roy Edward Bullock OBE who passed away recently. Roy Bullock was Clerk of the Senate in 1979 and 1980 prior to his retirement due to ill health, and I honestly believe that I am the only serving senator who worked with Mr Bullock in those years prior to his retirement. His retirement in 1980 ended a dedicated and long term of service to the Senate, dating back to 1946.
Roy Bullock was born in Wagga in 1916 and went on to earn an honours degree in arts from the University of Sydney and a degree in commerce from the University of Melbourne. He worked briefly on the staff of Trinity Grammar School in Sydney in 1939 and worked with the Commonwealth Treasury between 1939 and 1946.
He began his work for the Commonwealth parliament in 1946 and married his wife of nearly 60 years, Phyllis, in 1948. Although it is sometimes an overused and misapplied description, Roy Bullock was definitely a true gentleman of the old school. Commencing his parliamentary service as Clerk of Papers and Accountant in 1946, Roy Bullock became chamber officer in 1954 when he was promoted to the position of Usher of the Black Rod. From 1965 he served as Deputy Clerk and was promoted to be the ninth Clerk of the Senate on 9 August 1979.
During his years with the Senate, Mr Bullock served on a number of delegations to the Interparliamentary Union and acted as secretary to the Senate Select Committee on the Development of Canberra, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, and the Senate Regulations and Ordinances Committee. In 1969, he was awarded the Order of the British Empire for his service to the parliament.
When he retired due to ill health in 1980, Roy Bullock received accolades from the President at the time, Senator Sir Condor Laucke, as well as senators from government, opposition and crossbenches paying tribute to his great experience, his store of knowledge and his service to the parliament. The President, Sir Condor Laucke, paid the following tribute:
He has been a dedicated Senate Officer and has always been available and ready to advise when needed.
He went on:
The many articles that he wrote for publication in overseas parliamentary journals on the activities of the Senate and its committees are testimony to his expert knowledge and dedication. I am sure that all honourable senators join with me in the hope that time will restore his health and enable him to enjoy a long and happy retirement with his wife and family.
As indeed he did.
Other accolades followed from Senators Chaney, Button, Chipp, Young, O’Byrne, Davidson, McLaren, Georges, Collard, Harradine, Bishop from South Australia and Evans from Victoria. I note from the Hansard of that day, 26 November 1980, that note was made of the promotion of one Mr H Evans to the position of Principal Parliamentary Officer, Special Projects, so I am not the only person here who knew Roy Bullock and his work, as the current Clerk also does.
It must be remembered by younger and newer senators here tonight that Roy Bullock’s career in the parliament was served in the Old Parliament House, where regular contact between senators and those who worked in the building was very different from the current situation in this spacious and at times very impersonal building. It was a place where you got to know your colleagues and other workers much better because necessity drove us to be working much more closely than we do here, certainly in a physical sense.
Sir Condor Laucke’s wishes that Roy Bullock’s health would improve to allow him a long and happy retirement turned out to be fulfilled, as he passed away at the noble age of 89, hopefully after many opportunities to enjoy his favourite recreations of gardening and photography in this city he loved so much, Canberra. I pass on to his wife, Phyllis, and to his family my sincere condolences at their sad loss. Mr Roy Bullock was a true and faithful servant of this house, and his work will be remembered as a valued part of the history and traditions of the Senate.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Mr Roy Edward Bullock OBE</title>,Adjournment,37,1
