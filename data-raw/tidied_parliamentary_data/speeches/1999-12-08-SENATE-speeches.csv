"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1999-12-08,"—The Democrats oppose schedule 1 in the following terms:
(4)	 Schedule 1, item 26, page 19 (line 20) to page 21 (line 33), TO BE OPPOSED .

(5)	 Schedule 1, item 34, page 25 (line 14) to page 27 (line 26), TO BE OPPOSED .

The Democrats cannot support the increase of the ANZFA's regulatory powers to determine food regulatory measures independently of the health ministers of the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Council. The bill as it stands enables the ANZFA to formally manage food standards and codes of practice without the additional mechanism for review, public input and information about food regulations and decisions that the health ministers meeting currently provides. We believe that this is an inadequate situation for the purposes of public consultation and public education, a theme that has been a feature of the debate about this bill.
Furthermore, the term `less significant' is not defined under the bill. It is not clear how extensive the new ANZFA's powers will be if this bill is enacted as it stands. Additionally, the 28-day turnaround period in which the health ministers can veto the ANZFA's 
 decisions of less significance as proposed under the bill, we believe, is inadequate for consumer consultation and for lobbying. For these reasons the Democrats cannot support the increased regulatory powers of the ANZFA. Therefore, we seek to omit such changes under the bill.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 1999 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech

"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1999-12-08,"—I appreciate the issues being raised by Senator Stott Despoja, but can I give her an assurance that these mechanisms do not cut out the public consultation process. It is a matter that the Australian New Zealand Food Standards Council, the 10 ministers, would have particular oversight of and would always be mindful of in any of the issues that are being addressed. We do not support these amendments as they remove an important streamlining provision allowing matters of minor significance to be dealt with more efficiently than through the sometimes lengthy current arrangement. For the provisions relating to these kinds of matters to be used, three hurdles have to be cleared. Firstly, the ministerial council has to have previously approved a general approach to be followed in the development of the specific type of standard; secondly, the draft standard must raise issues of minor significance or complexity only; and, thirdly, no substantive objections have been raised by stakeholders in their submissions.
In addition to these three hurdles, the bill contains an important safeguard. Even if these requirements are satisfied, it will take only one minister on the ministerial council to object to the draft standard and the process will revert to the standard arrangement of having all ministers vote on the issue. This is an important efficiency measure that does not reduce the integrity of the standards development process or, for that matter, the rights of the community in the public processes that are always transparent.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 1999 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-12-08,"—The Labor opposition does not support these amendments, which seek to remove the provisions for the faster handling 
 of less significant applications. We sought successfully to make amendments in the House of Representatives to remove some of the deficiencies of the government's original approach which were raised in the committee hearings and which we took quite seriously. It is recognised that there are excessive delays for some minor matters and that there should be procedures that avoid every single matter banking up waiting for formal ministerial council approval. We believe the opposition's amendments make it possible for concerned community groups to object and prevent any particular application from being fast-tracked if it contains a contentious matter. We think that provides the effective protection to ensure there is proper scrutiny of all matters if there is a group or interest that feels that the fast-tracking should not apply. We obviously will monitor that in practice to make sure that that intention is met and that it does work successfully. We are, therefore, happy to support at this stage the current proposal and will be opposing the amendments.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 1999 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1999-12-08,"—I would like to ask 
 the minister similar questions. First of all, I would like to know what Senator Tambling understands the term `less significant' to mean in relation to areas where ANZFA will make food regulatory measures without the approval of the health ministers under the Australian New Zealand Food Standards Council. What is his understanding of that term? Who is to determine what regulatory measures are of less significance? As I said in my speech at the second reading stage, is it the media, is it consumers, is it the industry, or is it ANZFA? How does the government define `less significant', and at what stage along the development of a public debate will the relevant persons, whoever they may be, gauge what is of greater or of lesser significance? Certainly I suggest that ANZFA was not too good at determining the significance of the matters in relation to substantial equivalence in the past. Can Senator Tambling explain his understanding of `less significant'?",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 1999 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1999-12-08,"—This is an important policy issue where the ministerial council would determine the guidelines under which it would operate. Let me give a couple of examples. Senator Stott Despoja would probably be familiar with the folate project which, of course, relates to special foods and special food issues with regard to pregnancy which militate against spina bifida. In that particular situation there is a listing of quite a number of products and commodities. The matter would still be addressed very properly by the ANZFA board in the process of determining that particular area.
Similarly, Senator Stott Despoja would also probably recall that in the discussions that are taking place at the moment with regard to genetically modified food there was a list of policy criteria determined by the Australian New Zealand Food Standards Council. Whilst that is still an ongoing matter to be properly determined—it will come back here for debate in the early part of next year—when we get to the detail of the particular issues, that will be a matter of where the appropriate authority lies as to what is less significant, otherwise 
 Food Standards Council ministers' conferences, which generally try to embrace their agenda a couple of times a year within a half-day or a day session, will in effect become major areas. There is a board. The board has appropriate responsibility. In looking at the amendment, I can assure Senator Stott Despoja that there is no way of avoiding public accountability or transparency in the process, but we would not want to subject the changes to unnecessary delays as they go through the processes.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 1999 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1999-12-08,"—I thank Senator Tambling for his answer. He raises the issue of public transparency and the issue of accountability. I ask whether the rationale behind a 28-day turnaround period is that a precedent has been set. I do not know if that is the case for other bodies or what have you, but does the government really believe that that is a satisfactory period of time in which to allow members of the public, consumers as well as different representative and lobby organisations, to come together to register their understanding of or concerns with the decision? Is a 28-day turnaround period really sufficient? Does the government honestly believe that? To me it seems a very short period of time, and one that is inadequate.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 1999 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1999-12-08,"—I am advised, regarding the 28-day process to which Senator Stott Despoja refers, that there is a time constraint from when a decision goes through the board and is then presented to ministers out of session, with ministers having 28 days in which to advise whether they have an objection. As I commented earlier, if any one minister raises an issue it then goes back to the full process.
—The question is that schedule 1, item 26, page 19 (line 20) to page 21 (line 33) and schedule 1, item 34, page 25 (line 14) to page 27 (line 26) stand as printed.

		 (b)	 may also give notice of the matter to another body or person (if it considers it appropriate to do so).
This amendment was contingent upon amendments Nos 4 and 5. If they lost, this is perhaps an alternative way of ensuring that public notice is given. Again, this relates to the theme of public education and transparency and accountability. We believe that public notice should be in an easy and accessible form to a wide range of groups in the community. We do not believe that a simple listing, say, in the Gazette  would adequately improve the general public education of food regulations and development.
This amendment is based on the fact that the last amendments were not successful. It is part of our attempts to ensure that the community has adequate information about decisions being made.

I will therefore support the amendment.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 1999 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1999-12-08,"—I thank both Senator Brown and the opposition for their support. I refute any suggestion from the government that this is an unnecessary amendment. It was pretty much the same argument provided by the government for a number of the amendments we have put forward, especially the first two, for which we did receive majority support in the Senate. I thank the Senate for that.
The theme of a lot of this discussion has been the issue of wider public participation in the ANZFA. I hope that the government will take it on board. As I said yesterday, unless  consumers and the public feel that they have access to information and education about food, including foods that may be genetically modified, et cetera, there will be scare campaigns and fear in the community. Perhaps we will have a community that does not make best use of technological advancements that could have potential benefits.
We believe that the bill grants the authority the ability to determine itself in a manner in which the public is provided notice. Currently, if an application is accepted by the authority, it must publicly invite submissions. It is determined that this practice will continue under the bill being considered. Again, this amendment is just elaborating on some of the public processes available.
On behalf of the Democrats, I argue that public consultation and involvement is fundamental to maintaining ANZFA's amended objective to ensure a high degree of consumer confidence in the quality and safety of food produced, processed, sold or exported from 
 Australia and New Zealand. That is why we have done our best during this committee stage to enhance the bill to at least achieve some of those objectives as outlined in the legislation. Again, I thank the other senators for their support. I urge the government to perhaps reconsider.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-12-08,"—We are dealing with Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1999 . The stated policy objective of this bill is to ensure that superannuation savings are invested prudently, consistent with the requirements of the Superannuation Industry Supervision Act 1993 for the purpose of providing retirement income and not for providing current day benefits. This is a policy objective that Labor established when in government. It is an objective that we still support. However, it is precisely because we support this objective that we cannot support this bill, which by the admission of the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, extends the opportunity for superannuation funds to be invested for current day benefits.
Labor will be opposing this bill based on five key criteria. Firstly, the government has 
 provided no substantive evidence of a systemic abuse of the current investment rules by what are known as do-it-yourself superannuation funds that would require the proposed changes as they are drafted. Secondly, the changes contained in the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (No. 3) Bill, which passed the parliament with the support of the Labor opposition, should begin to address many of the problems where they may exist. Thirdly, there are other ways of tightening the existing laws that will better address the perceived problems where they may exist. Fourthly, this legislation, if passed, will make it tougher for small business. It will increase restrictions, red tape and costs. Fifthly, it does have some adverse implications for people living in rural and regional Australia.
The government has argued that some self-managed superannuation funds, SMFs, are not complying with the spirit of the current laws, which are designed to prohibit superannuation funds from borrowing. The government claims that, where this practice is occurring, it increases the risks associated with superannuation fund investments and is contrary to a retirement income policy designed to ensure that superannuation savings are preserved until retirement and not accessed for current use.
Labor in determining its position on this bill, and on just about every bill that comes before the Senate that amends legislation established by a Labor government, asks itself: how will this improve the operation of the superannuation law for the benefit of all Australians? A threshold issue for Labor is whether, as the government claims, the practice of superannuation funds borrowing and using retirement income for current day use is so widespread and constitutes such a systemic threat to retirement incomes policy and to the retirement incomes of fund members that it needs to be significantly changed. In addition, Labor has been required to make a judgment on whether the government's legislation actually achieves what it claims it is designed to achieve. To Labor, the obvious answer to all of these questions is no, the government fails the tests.
To ensure that our legislation was based on the widest possible evidence, Labor referred this legislation to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services. The decision to refer the bill to a specialist committee for examination was also taken to allow the government the opportunity to present its case in support of the bill. The usual materials supporting the bill—the explanatory memorandum, budget announcement and various press releases—did not present an appropriate supporting case. Disappointingly, the government did not provide adequate evidence in support of its bill.
According to the evidence presented to the committee, the opposition is not convinced that there is a widespread practice of inappropriate use of superannuation funds. The committee did not receive convincing evidence that the retirement income of fund members is at high risk. However, where the government can show that unusual investment practices which place retirement incomes at unacceptable risk are occurring, Labor will support appropriate measures to crack down on this type of behaviour.
Firstly, is there a need for change? The Insurance and Superannuation Commission, or ISC, as it was known, carried out a survey in support of its claims for the need for this legislation. The government drew upon a random survey of 1,000 excluded funds conducted by the ISC in 1997. The survey found that around 20 per cent of excluded funds were investing in unit trusts that were effectively controlled by the fund members or the employer. It appears that one-half of these unit trusts were undertaking geared investments. Around 13 per cent of superannuation funds were leasing or renting assets to associated parties such as members or employers.
The ISC conducted follow-up fieldwork of 100 selected funds which provided an example of superannuation funds investing in unit trusts which, in turn, invested with the employer sponsor, made loans to members and employer sponsors, and leased assets to employer sponsors. The government claims, based on the evidence of the ISC survey and fieldwork, that these practices affect the integrity of the SIS investment rules.
The majority of the evidence provided to the committee roundly criticised the data provided by the government in support of the bill, in particular the fieldwork conducted by the ISC on which the bill seems primarily based. Much of the evidence to the committee argued that the ISC's fieldwork, while identifying problems with the investment practices of some of the 100 chosen funds, did not consist of a representative sample of excluded funds. In addition, evidence from the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants pointed out that the research was now three years old and was undertaken by a different regulator to the Australian Taxation Office, which now regulates SMFs as a consequence of the recent legislation in the No. 3 bill that I referred to earlier.
The Assistant Treasurer provided a response to questions taken on notice during the committee hearings which included some additional information about a small sample of 145 funds conducted in 1998-99 based on funds' historical activities. The sample found that around seven per cent invested in geared trusts compared to a total of around 30 per cent that invested in related trusts. Where breaches of the existing law were identified, APRA put in place enforcement or rectification action. It would have been more useful for the committee to have had access to this information at an earlier stage and in a fully disclosed format. The opposition referred this bill to the committee on the premise that it was incumbent on the government to provide more substantial evidence of the need for the measures contained in the bill.
The additional survey conducted by APRA does not provide any substantive support for the legislation. Even assuming that the survey was both representative and robust, the information provided by the Assistant Treasurer actually supports the retention of the existing legislation. If breaches of the current laws were identified and APRA were able to take corrective action, that would support the view expressed by many at the hearings that there is little need for changes as contained in this SLAB 4 legislation. I emphasise that point. Where some abuse has been taking place, the regulator, APRA, has been able to enforce the 
 law as it now stands. The Australian Taxation Office, which now regulates this area, will, I suspect from evidence we have received, be a more efficient regulator in this regard.
The committee received little, if any, convincing evidence of SMFs failing. The Small Independent Superannuation Funds Association argued that, where SMFs had invested in a small business, the success or failure of the business itself did not necessarily equate to the success or failure of the SMF. This is because not all SMFs invest in small business or property. In addition, the government did not provide any conclusive evidence of SMF fund members losing their retirement incomes as a result of poor investment practices and becoming fully or partly dependent on the government.
I will make some comments about self-managed superannuation fund investment returns. One would expect that, if self-managed superannuation funds are conducting some sort of risky investment practices, this would be reflected in the investment returns of these funds. However, evidence provided by the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants citing an article from the Personal Investment magazine stated that, according to research conducted by Rainmaker Information Services and Rice-Kachor Research, SMFs actually earned better than average investment returns in the three years up to 1997. The government was unable to refute this evidence, which does not support the need for this bill to be passed.
There is now a significant doubt about the tax concessionality of superannuation. Currently, higher income earners pay tax on superannuation at 45 per cent. With the new income tax rates to apply from 1 July next year, most middle income earners will be on the 30 per cent tax rate, which is the same rate for superannuation. Lower income earners pay tax on superannuation at a rate higher than their marginal tax rate. Thus, it can be argued that superannuation for a significant number of people is no longer taxed concessionally. But it can be argued that, if it is, it should not be used for current day purposes or investment practices which place the generous tax concessions at undue risk. In 
 answer to a question on notice from the shadow Assistant Treasurer, Kelvin Thomson, the government was unable to provide evidence of the extent of tax concessions used by SMFs.
In addition, the government has contradicted its own claims that superannuation funds should not be invested in assets with the intent of using them for current day purposes. In a speech in Brisbane on 28 May 1999, the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, said in commenting on the SLAB 4 changes:
Funds with fewer than five members will be able to invest up to 100 per cent of their assets in business premises leased to members or the employer-sponsor of the fund. This will enhance the ability of small business owners to use their superannuation savings to invest in their own business premises.
If the government has admitted that it is extending the opportunities for small business owners to invest their superannuation savings in their business premises, surely that is in conflict with the claim that superannuation funds should not be used for current day benefits.
In addition, deliberately permitting—in fact, encouraging—a superannuation fund to invest all its assets in one asset, as opposed to one asset class, is hardly consistent with what is generally considered to be an appropriately diversified investment strategy that balances risk and return. While there are a few investment restrictions on trustees of super funds, they are required to ensure that the funds' investments as a whole are diversified and do not expose the fund to risks from inadequate diversification. A strong case could be argued that the extension of the business real property rule to 100 per cent does not allow for appropriate diversification.
As was the case with fund returns, one would expect that, where the government has identified an alleged abuse of the investment rules, this legislation would result in revenue savings. However, in both the explanatory memorandum of the bill and evidence before the committee, the government was unable to provide any substantial evidence of a risk to revenue that the existing investment rules pose. Neither was a strong case mounted that additional revenue will flow or that the 
 existing revenue base will be preserved as a result of the passage of the bill. In response to a question on the revenue impact of the bill, Mr Painton from the Treasury said:
As presented in the 1998-99 budget, it was in terms of not having a revenue effect within the forward estimates years. But the understanding is that, over time, these measures will improve the integrity and investment rules, and that is expected to have a positive effect on the budget. But there is no identified budget effect within the forward estimates . . . 
It is the prerogative of governments to ask the parliament to pass legislation which relies on an understanding rather than on cold hard facts. But it is the responsibility of opposition parties to scrutinise the evidence presented by a government and, where it does not measure up, to reject the legislation it purports to support.
We have an existing investment rules regime and it should be possible for the government to substantiate its claims with existing experience or robust statistical modelling and analysis. The government does have available to it the resources of the highly respected Retirement Incomes Modelling Unit in Treasury which is able, given the availability of appropriate data, to model the longer term effects of government retirement incomes policies. It would have greatly supported the government's case if it had provided some analysis of the government's proposed changes through the RIM Unit. The facts are that there is little substantial evidence supporting the government's bill: SMFs are not in crisis, retirement incomes are not being jeopardised and there is little evidence to support that the alleged high risk investment practices the government claims are occurring are causing a systemic breakdown in the retirement incomes system.
Is the existing law adequate? The Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants claimed that the provisions of the existing laws regulating investment practices are adequate and that existing abuses, where they occurred, are minimal. They also argue that the government's proposed changes were like using a sledgehammer to crack a walnut and were not the most effective way of meeting the government's stated policy objective.
The association also argued that the changes implemented as a result of the recent passage of the SLAB No. 3, which require all SMF fund managers to be trustees of the fund and transfer regulation of SMFs to the Australian Taxation Office, go a long way to ensuring that advertent or inadvertent breaches of the existing investment rules were remedied. We had similar evidence from Mr Murray Wyatt from the CPAs.
I would now like to turn to the issue of a unit trust look-through requirement. Evidence to the committee raised the issue of whether there should be a look-through requirement for auditors to require them to look through the fund and into any unit trusts that the fund operates to ensure that the unit trusts are also complying with the spirit of the legislation and not conducting risky or non-commercial practices. This would seem to be a sensible suggestion and is something that Labor would encourage the government to consider as an alternative to what is being proposed here. In support of the argument that the transfer of the regulation of SMFs to the tax office will result in better compliance than occurred previously is the additional $6 million in resources the ATO will be putting into its role as SMF regulator.
A range of other issues which this bill raised have convinced the opposition that it would not be good public policy to support this bill. Many of the witnesses appearing before the Senate committee examining the bill claimed that the proposed bill will increase the complexity of operating an SMF. This is disturbing, as the parliament should be acting to simplify the operation of superannuation, not make it more complex, particularly for small business. Increased cost is usually commensurate with increased complexity. The evidence before the committee suggests that the passage of the bill will increase costs by at least $2,000, depending on the complexity of the fund. In some cases the fund might just be wound up and the money put into a master trust.
I mentioned the impact on rural and regional Australia as an important principle. Most disturbingly, Labor is concerned about the negative impact this bill is likely to have in 
 these areas, particularly by restricting small business investment. Mr David Coogan, chairman of the superannuation task force for the Institute of Chartered Accountants, said in evidence to the committee that there will be areas of the market, for example the rural sector, where it could have a negative impact. The Small Independent Superannuation Funds Association also supported this view. It must come as a great shock to National Party senators in this chamber, given the enormous problems National Party members have been having recently, particularly in Victoria, that yet again a piece of legislation has come before this chamber supported by this coalition, dominated by the Liberal Party, which will negatively impact on regional and rural Australia. But where is the National Party?
There has been a significant time delay with this legislation, some 18 months between the initial 1998 budget announcement and introduction of the bill, which means that some superannuation funds which acted in accordance with the announcement may be in breach of provisions of the bill. The Senate has a non-binding procedural order that recommends that the Senate not pass any tax legislation that comes before it more than six months from the time it was announced. There seems little doubt that if this bill is passed by the Senate it should operate prospectively rather than retrospectively.
On the issue of the choice of funds, the government has asked the Senate to support its choice of funds legislation, which surprisingly, given the government's apparent support for it, has yet to be debated in the Senate and has been pulled from the list of bills to be debated this year. The government's approach in respect of this legislation for small business is inconsistent with its so-called choice of funds philosophy.
Labor will not be supporting this bill in its current form. Where there is evidence that the existing law is being abused, Labor will support reasonable changes that crack down on that abuse. It is clear that more evidence is required to accurately ascertain the extent of the problems that the government claims are occurring and which this bill claims to address. Labor will not be a party to compli 
 cated, difficult changes to superannuation which make it tougher for small business, add to cost and add to problems in regional and rural Australia.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 4) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1999-12-08,"—Before commencing my speech on the second reading, I wish to declare for the record that my partner has a self-managed superannuation fund which has some investments in a unit trust and in which I also have an interest. As far as I know, this bill would restrict the activities of that fund.
This bill, the  Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1999 , deals with an extremely complex area of superannuation law governing the investment rules for small superannuation funds. As our report on this bill suggests, it has not been an easy bill for us to develop a position on. However, investment rules are designed to limit the risks to superannuation savings and to ensure that superannuation is preserved for retirement incomes. This is done by restricting investment in the employer or associates, prohibiting super funds from borrowing funds or lending them to members, preventing member assets from being acquired by the fund and requiring all transactions to be at arm's length. The ISC became concerned that a number of funds, particularly smaller funds, were getting around those tough investment rules by investing heavily in unit trusts which were then not bound by the rules, and proceeded in some cases to flout them. This opened up the prospect of a very large proportion of tax preferred superannuation assets being invested back into a person's business or heavily geared, thereby reducing their contribution to retirement savings.
A 1997 survey of excluded funds covering 1,000 of the 140,000 funds revealed that 20 per cent of funds invested in unit trusts, that 13 per cent of funds were leasing or renting assets to associated parties and that, in all, around 10 per cent of funds used unit trust or lease arrangements that circumvented investment standards. This legislation has sought to overcome these difficulties by preventing superannuation funds from investing in closely held unit trusts. The prohibitions on super funds borrowing or dealing with associ 
 ates would also continue. Against that, the legislation provided a new concession for superannuation investment, allowing small funds to invest a greater amount of their assets into real business property. Currently only 40 per cent of assets can be invested in real business property. Under the new bill, this rises to 100 per cent.
Given the continuing prohibition on super funds' gearing, this will increase the flexibility of super funds to invest in big, lumpy but attractive real property investments. That concession will be particularly important in regional Australia. Small superannuation funds, the Senate committee was told, are an important source of finance for investment in regional areas. People want to invest in their local areas and this concession will allow for increased direct investment by small super funds in real property in their local regions.
However, it remains a tall ask for a small superannuation fund to undertake an investment in real business property off its own bat. For a fund with, say, $200,000 to $300,000 of funds, an investment in a single real property could make up 60 per cent to 70 per cent of the fund's total assets, and that is a real risk to the investment diversity of the fund and its associated risk profile. Of course, this was part of the attraction of investing in a unit trust: it allowed a super fund to spread its investment in real property across other unit holders. This bill precludes that by precluding investment in a closely held unit trust; that is, a trust with less than 20 members.
The Democrats have come to the conclusion that there are very sound reasons for super funds investing in a closely held unit trust, particularly where such a trust is investing solely for real business property. There are sound reasons for allowing the large and lumpy cost and risk of property investments to be shared by a superannuation fund with other investors, even associates, through a unit trust. However, I think that the prohibition on borrowing which applies to a superannuation fund should also apply to a closely held trust on the basis that it could affect the liquidity and the risk profile of the underlying closely associated super fund.
I understand that in the committee stage the government will be moving an amendment to ensure that small superannuation funds can continue to invest in closely held trusts where the sole asset of those closely held trusts is real business property, provided the trusts do not borrow more than the currently allowed five per cent. That extends the same investment rules for a superannuation fund to a closely held trust but allows that extra bit of flexibility by allowing a super fund to spread the cost and the risk of a real property investment. I do not think that there is any need to allow closely held trusts to also invest in shares. Shares are much smaller unit investments than real property parcels and can and should be dealt with directly by the small superannuation fund.
Another issue raised by submissions to the Senate committee is the supposed retrospectivity of the legislation. The government's intention to introduce this legislation was first announced in the 12 May budget in 1998. An exposure draft was released more than six months later with a number of significant concessions agreed to by the government during the consultation phase. The bill was finally tabled in the parliament on 11 August of this year, some 15 months after the budget announcement.
There are two sets of transitional arrangements with this bill for assets purchased prior to May 1998. The transitional rules allow, effectively until 2009, for such funds to rearrange their affairs to comply with the new rules. For assets purchased after May 1998 and prior to royal assent of this bill, the funds will have only until July 2001 to comply with the bill. We think this is a rather tough ask particularly given that there was a 15-month period before the actual law was tabled. I think it is almost impossible to ask trustees to comply with rather vague budget press releases and then wait 15 months for legislation, particularly when the legislation ends up being rather different from the Senate announcement.
While we appreciate that this bill is designed to deal with potential tax planning through unit trust structures, it also has the effect of severely affecting what may be quite 
 legitimate investment decisions by super funds as well. Indeed, as evidence to the committee from Cleary Hoare Solicitors, quoted in the Senate report, points out:
If a taxpayer, even with the best advice, has acted contrary to the provisions of the Bill since May 1998 in a way as to make complying superannuation funds non-complying the taxpayer on the current laws, will have 47% of the assets in the superannuation fund confiscated.
Given these sorts of concerns, the Democrats do not believe that we can retain the 12 May 1998 operative date for this bill. I understand that the government has agreed that in the committee stage it will move to make this bill operative from 11 August 1999.
The penultimate issue I want to deal with is that of the actual definition of business real property. A number of submissions to the committee suggested that the definition of business real property might need to be extended. It was suggested that leases, vacant land and other types of property might be included in the definition. A government amendment will make business real property the only allowable investment for a closely held unit trust, and I think this definition becomes very important. The Democrats will be seeking an assurance from the minister that the Treasury will be prepared to consult industry groups over enacting a regulation that might ensure that the definition of business real property is as wide as is practically possible within the risk and investment constraints intended by the law.
The Senate will be aware that for some time the Democrats have advocated and moved to see that all superannuation legislation deals with the inequitable situation that applies to same sex couples. We are advised that in the case of this bill it is technically difficult to amend the legislation. However, my colleague Senator Bartlett will be moving a second reading amendment requiring the government to prepare a report for the Senate on the technical and legislative requirements for removing the discrimination faced by same sex couples in superannuation and tax laws. With that comment I will conclude and indicate that the Democrats will be supporting the bill at the second reading.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 4) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Watson, Sen John",LP,1999-12-08,"—I rise on behalf of the government to support the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1999  put forward by the government. One of the strengths of the superannuation arrangements in Australia, particularly the superannuation guarantee system, is the flexibility in terms of investment restrictions. We are different to most other countries in that superannuation funds are free from some of the very onerous investment regulations. While this bill will certainly restrict certain investments which may expose funds to greater risk, it will allow superannuation funds considerable scope for diversified investment.
It is important to look at the matters that have moved since the budget announcement some time ago. For example, there have been very generous grandfathering provisions, especially for those funds that had particular arrangements in place on budget night. Essentially, all those funds would have been protected. Also, there is the incentive to increase the business rule property exemption from 40 to 100 per cent. A number of submissions acknowledged the very extensive consultation that has taken place. It has taken a long time and there has been a great deal of consultation. Naturally, not everybody was happy about particular outcomes.
I am particularly pleased about an amendment that the government agreed to following the hearing in Melbourne on 18 November. I refer to the government's agreement to the use of an interposed unit trust, but only in circumstances where that unit trust is not allowed to borrow. Perhaps one of the most contentious issues arising from the deliberations of the hearing that I chaired in Melbourne was the view that widely held trusts are in a position to leverage and to borrow much more extensively than is possible under the arrangements for the smaller funds. That seemed to be a grievance. I must say that that sort of issue raises a number of problems for me in superannuation. Leverage is always a difficult area because any leverage at all exposes funds to a greater risk. Obviously, the responsibility of any superannuation trustee is to get the highest return, commensurate with 
 the minimum amount of risk. Of course, any situation which allows leverage is a situation where members' investments are open to greater risk. Perhaps this was the issue that really dominated the whole of the hearings.
We have to go back a little in history, because when the SIS arrangements were first put in place—they were put in place by a Labor government with close supervision by the superannuation committee, which Senator Sherry and I chaired over that period—there was a very strong feeling that there was to be no borrowing whatsoever. Subsequently, a piece of paper was issued by the ISC that allowed an extraordinary situation where you could not borrow directly, but if you interposed a unit trust, that unit trust was able to leverage or borrow. As such, it meant that super funds were in a position to acquire a wider range of assets. But the whole process effectively lifted the risk profile of many small funds. It is always difficult for regulators to look closely at investment strategies, so broad guidelines have to be laid down. The government in its wisdom has seen fit to do so, but in some cases where you have an interposed trust there is exploitation of the situation. That is not in every case—in fact, I would say the majority of super funds that use this interposed trust as a mechanism for leverage do so very responsibly. But, of course, we have to be careful as legislators to make sure that we do not allow those who are unscrupulous to move in.
One of the big challenges in the superannuation industry at the present time is that this pot of gold in superannuation continues to grow at a tremendous rate. Despite the government announcement, it is significant to point out that do-it-yourself funds, small super funds, et cetera are still increasing in number, size and importance. I remind you that it was always the original intention of the SIS, supported by both levels of government, that there should not be borrowing. This raises the wider question that a number of funds alluded to: why do you put so-called tighter restrictions on the smaller funds rather than on the larger funds, where they can invest in companies that have a certain amount of gearing or have these sorts of trusts?
There is also the question of investing in certain types of derivatives. Derivatives are an issue that I think will challenge the superannuation industry in the future because, used inappropriately, they can be used as a mechanism of leverage—and no, I am not satisfied that we have got these rules completely right in Australia at the present time. It could well be an issue for further evaluation not only by our committee, if time permits, but also by the industry generally. That is because, after all, we have to safeguard the protection of these moneys, particularly as more and more of people's money is being put into the private sector, and there will always be people within the private sector who put private profit, personal greed, ahead of members' interests. You can always get situations where you have a very aggressive chairman taking a fund in directions which may not necessarily be in the best interests of the wider membership, despite all the sorts of powers that we seem to be giving to the individual members. My time is brief; I know the minister is anxious to get on with this bill, so I will conclude my remarks in support of the bill.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 4) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-12-08,"—I rise to speak to the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1999  on behalf of the Democrats in conjunction with my colleague Senator Allison. As Senator Allison indicated at the end of her second reading contribution, one issue of ongoing, frequent and regular concern to the Democrats has been the inequities suffered by same sex couples under superannuation legislation—and a range of other legislation—at Commonwealth level. I have spoken on this a number of times, as have many of my colleagues. The Democrats have an overarching piece of legislation in the Senate aimed at removing all forms of discrimination and ensuring recognition and equal treatment of same sex couples across all Commonwealth legislation.
Unfortunately, parliament being what it is, getting private senators' bills passed through the parliament is a fairly difficult process, as the close to 100-year history of this parliament would attest. I am not totally sure but, off the top of my head, I think about six or 
 eight private senators' bills have been passed in the whole history of the parliament, so it is not an easy road for ensuring legislative reform. I hasten to add that that should not be taken to suggest in any way that the Democrats are not continuing to pursue every avenue to obtain the passage of that legislation.
Nonetheless, the Democrats are also about trying to ensure outcomes. It is important to raise the issue, but the people that are suffering unfair discrimination around the country are looking for that discrimination to be addressed and are looking for concrete outcomes in that regard. Many times in the past, the Democrats have moved specific amendments at the committee stage of legislation trying to address discrimination against same sex couples, and we could have approached this piece of legislation in the same way. If it had been accepted, it would have at least opened the door and removed one area of discrimination, but discrimination in a lot of other areas of superannuation legislation would have been maintained as it exists. It would also have put that issue in the middle of a potential bouncing backwards and forwards between the two houses of parliament of the overall bill that we have put it onto.
I will actually be doing the government a favour this morning, although I am not sure that they will see it that way. Instead of having it embodied in a piece of legislation which the government would be unwilling to accept, thus putting the whole legislation at risk, on behalf of the Democrats I will address the issue through a second reading amendment, which has been circulated. I apologise for the late circulation but, hopefully, all senators are aware of the content of it now. I move the Democrat second reading amendment:
At the end of the motion, add:
""and that there be laid on the table, on or before the last sitting day in March 2000, details of all legislative changes that would be required to ensure the recognition and equal treatment of same-sex couples under all Commonwealth superannuation and taxation legislation"".
The second reading amendment, which I hope will receive the support of the Senate, specifically and quite simply requires the govern 
 ment to provide details of all the legislative changes that would be required to ensure the recognition and equal treatment of same sex couples under all Commonwealth superannuation and taxation legislation.
There was a suggestion that this issue could have been referred to a Senate committee for examination. On one level, this sounds like a reasonable idea except that we have already had a number of reports on these issues over the years, not least a very comprehensive Senate committee report into the Democrats' sexuality discrimination legislation that I spoke of previously. There was also the report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, chaired by the previous speaker, Senator Watson from the coalition. Their report of November 1995 on superannuation and broken work patterns contained a recommendation that superannuation regulations be amended so that those in bona fide domestic relationships and single people be treated in the same manner as married and de facto superannuants. That recommendation was aimed at ensuring that all people in bona fide domestic relationships, whether same sex or opposite sex partners, would have equal treatment. That was a unanimous recommendation of the committee from four years ago, and it has not been acted on. I think people are getting tired of waiting.
There was also a Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report on superannuation entitlements of same sex couples, which did not focus on the whole gamut of superannuation legislation but on a broad range of it, particularly in relation to public sector recipients of superannuation. Again, that report contained a recommendation, which was brought down by the Human Rights Commissioner in April this year, that various sections of the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973 and relevant trust deed rules under the Military Superannuation and Benefits Act 1991 be amended to remove provisions which impair equality of opportunity in employment and deny protection before the law. In particular, it recommended that gender specific terms should be replaced by gender neutral terminology so that benefits apply equally to 
 opposite sex and same sex partners. This is another report with another recommendation relating specifically to superannuation entitlements which clearly highlights the unjustifiable discrimination that same sex couples face and recommends that that discrimination be removed.
The second reading amendment that I have moved basically requires that all the legislative changes that are required to ensure equal treatment and recognition of same sex couples would have to be compiled and presented to the Senate. Part of the aim of that is to ensure that all of the required changes would be presented in one block. It might be a fairly feeble defence, but nonetheless the defence that is regularly used by the government is that it is inappropriate to make piecemeal changes, thus creating anomalies where you have different definitions of couples in different areas of legislation. This would ensure that the whole range of required changes across all the superannuation and taxation legislation would be put together and, in effect, would require some degree of government response to recommendations from reports such as those that I have just detailed. It obviously does not commit the government to adopting them, and that is a decision for the government to make. In that sense, it is not a policy based amendment at all; it simply requires that the legislative detail be provided as a single group to the Senate. I believe that would make some advance.
As I said at the start of my contribution, when one speaks often on this issue one is conscious that outcomes are slow in appearing, certainly at the federal level. Even in the short couple of years that I have been speaking about these issues in this chamber, we have seen very significant and positive legislative changes being made at the state level in Tasmania, and there are positive changes now being made by the state government in my own state of Queensland. It is getting more and more unacceptable and, from my point of view, embarrassing that the federal legislative level is now lagging far behind most states—even states such as Queensland and Tasmania, which some people might mistakenly see as 
 conservative, backward or red-necked on these sorts of issues.
Queensland and Tasmania have shown a progressive approach. They have made positive changes and the sky has not fallen in. In fact, significant benefits have arisen as a consequence. We are getting to a stage where the Commonwealth, instead of taking a leadership role, is very much behind the pack. Apart from the situation in Western Australia, where legislation there is completely unacceptable and even more discriminatory, the Commonwealth is now about the worst in the country. Whilst this amendment will not achieve concrete legislative change, which is what the Democrats are aiming to achieve in the long run, it will hopefully move a step towards that in a way that does not commit the government on any policy level but provides the information to be made available to the Senate for consideration.
I do hope that all senators will give favourable consideration to the amendment. As I said at the start, in effect it does provide the government with an easier path than attempting to make specific legislative changes to this particular bill, which deals with only one small component of what is, as all Australians know, a very large and complex superannuation industry governed by quite a range of legislation and regulations. It provides better opportunity for the government to present the information to the Senate without having it enmeshed with other policy and legislative changes. I hope the Senate as a whole does see this as a positive way forward and supports the amendment.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 4) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1,speech

Whilst we are anxious to cooperate with the government's program and to make sure that everything is dealt with, this was not indicated to me until about a minute ago. If there are problems with the amendment and the deal the Democrats have entered into with the government, the government and the Democrats should get it right.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-12-08,"—To assist us in progressing through the amendments on the running sheet, as I indicated before and as I think Senator Sherry indicated, the adjourning of the previous bill was solely the government's decision and one which I was not willing to support. But that has been adjourned so we are now onto this bill. I appreciate it is always problematic to get a bill brought on for debate unexpectedly; nonetheless, all the amendments that are going to be moved have been circulated.
I anticipate that I will not be proceeding with some of the Democrat amendments, but as far as I am aware there will not be any extra amendments. It is just that I will not be moving some of the amendments that have been circulated in my name. I will indicate those when we get to that stage of the debate, but it should not present any problems for our progressing through this bill. We do have a running sheet, we do have all the amendments circulated, and I will indicate as we get to the appropriate stage, or earlier if people wish, which amendments I will not be proceeding with. It should be feasible for us to proceed through this bill for as long as necessary until the government has figured out whatever their problem was with the superannuation bill and we can get back onto that one.
Having said that, I believe the amendment before the chair is government amendment (1), which the minister has indicated is an 
 administrative amendment which fixes up typos and things like that. I guess we will have to take him at his word on that.

On the same principles as the government has outlined for foreign officials, which we absolutely support, denial of tax deductibility should also be extended to domestic bribery situations. This would level the playing field for businesses operating in Australia.
We would like the government to consider and respond positively to the suggestion that non-deductibility should be extended to domestic bribery situations at all government levels—Commonwealth, state, territory and local governments—not just to foreign situations.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-12-08,"—I think there was a request for information in Senator Brown's contribution which we are waiting on. While that is being gathered I will add an extra one in relation to this opposition amendment. The principle of it seems fairly straightforward. It uses exactly the same wording as is already in the bill in relation to foreign public officials. I know that the parliamentary secretary has explained that it is a technical issue and why it would be problematic from the government's point of view for this amendment to become part of the tax act. But it seems straightforward enough from the Democrats' perspective and the principle, obviously, is a positive one. So, for us not to support it, I need to hear some indication from the government as to why it would present some issue of unworkability.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-12-08,"—I have been provided with some additional material which I think will answer Senator Sherry's points in more detail as well as respond to Senator Bartlett's request for information. I think Senator Sherry by interjection responded accurately to Senator Brown's point about why you cannot deduct a speeding fine. I do remember a particular year in Western Australia where it would have been very helpful for me to be able to do so. I had about five speeding fines in a row. It was a significant expense involved in getting to and from work. But I realised it 
 was probably cheaper if I just got out of bed 10 minutes earlier and left home earlier, rather than speeding along the Roe Highway to my Cannington office and meeting the constabulary on the way. The answer is, as Senator Sherry said by way of interjection, that there is a specific exclusion in the tax law about those fines. In a way this is clarifying the tax law in a not dissimilar way, ensuring that moneys used to bribe foreign officials cannot be deducted.
The point that should also be made clear is that there is no evidence that taxpayers are claiming tax deductions for expenditure on bribes paid to Australian officials. I guess that would apply to foreign officials as well. It makes some sense to say that if you are involving yourself in illegal activities it is unlikely that you are going to bring the money you might use for that activity into a formal system such as the taxation system. It is more likely that you are using money that you want to ensure is outside the system. So it makes sense that there is no evidence of it. Certainly there is no evidence of claiming tax deductions for expenditure on bribes paid to Australian officials. While some royal commissions and inquiries into corruption have reported the payment of bribes to police officers and other government officials, these payments have not been claimed via the taxation system. I think, again, on the face of it, that is logical. You are not likely to report money that is being used for those circumstances to the tax office and try to claim a deduction for it. You would have to be pretty stupid to do that.
To respond to Senator Sherry's point, the government obviously takes the matter of any bribery of Australian officials most seriously. There are very strong criminal penalties applying to Australian officials acting corruptly. These penalties are backed up with effective enforcement regimes, including via the Federal Police. The rationale for denying deductibility of bribes to foreign public officials is that effective criminal sanctions against such behaviour do not exist in certain less developed countries, and this rationale does not apply within Australia. This answers Senator Bartlett's question as to why we do 
 not need this amendment. Therefore, any extension of the bill would have no impact on illegal behaviour. We do not believe that it is a beneficial measure.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-12-08,"—For clarification of the matter, I ask the parliamentary secretary: why is there not a simple law which says that if it is illegal it is not tax deductible?
—The question is that the amendments moved by the opposition be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-12-08,"—That was quite an important question I put. I would like an answer to it. The question is that if an activity is illegal, it ought not be tax deductible. If we had such a law, we would not be getting into specifically whether it is bribing a foreign official or something else. It would be automatically excluded from deductibility because it would be illegal. The implication otherwise is that there are some illegal activities which you can tax deduct, but that does not seem logical to me.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-12-08,"—The point that needs to be made is that illegal income is assessable but, to refer back to the point I made in my previous intervention in the debate, it is very rarely reported. Just as, to our knowledge, there is no evidence of illegal deductions being claimed, again it is commonsense that someone making illegal income will not report it and say, `Here's some illegal income; please tax me.' They are not likely to say, `Here are some deductions for illegal expenditures.' Does that make it clear to you?",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-12-08,"—No, it does not. Here we are dealing with an amendment to the tax law which says that if you bribe a foreign official, which is an illegal thing to do, you cannot tax deduct it. I would have thought that there should be a tax law which says that if you do anything that is illegal, you cannot tax deduct it. I can see the merit in looking at illegal activities. The obvious ones that come to mind, for 
 example, are running a brothel when it is illegal, a gambling activity that is illegal or growing a crop that is illegal. If the taxation department knows about them they should be taxed like any other activity. But I think it should be clear in the tax law that there ought not be the facility for getting a tax deduction for an illegal activity. That is surely what the government is saying here.
If you bribe a foreign official that is illegal. Under Australian law, that is not allowed. You will not be able to tax deduct it either. What we all know is that Australians and Australian companies are involved in the business of bribing foreign officials in countries to our north. Apparently that is being put down as a necessary part of business and tax deductibility is being sought for that. I believe that it ought not be. As the parliamentary secretary has explained, there is a worldwide move to try and stop tax deductibility for bribing foreign officials.
I do not want to hold up the committee. I would say that the government needs to look at amending the tax law, if it has not done so already, to simply say that the money gained from any activity which is illegal is not tax deductible. It would save listing every crime under the statutes and saying, `You can't deduct this, you can't deduct that.' If you are speeding on your way to work, you cannot deduct the fine that you have to pay, because that is an illegal activity. If you incur a business cost when you are making money illegally, while you get taxed for the making of the money, you cannot deduct whatever illegal thing it is you are doing as a tax deduction. I think it would make tax law much simpler if the Taxation Office and the minister look at this and come back to the parliament with a very simple amendment to the tax law which says, `Costs incurred through illegal activities are not tax deductible.'",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-12-08,"—I appreciate Senator Brown's comment that he does not want to bog down the committee stage in this debate. It is actually a very 
 interesting debate. I am getting lots of very good advice about some of the examples. The brothel is one that you raised. I am not sure whether using that as an analogy is the best way to put this argument forward into the public domain when there are hundreds of thousands of people tuned into the parliamentary and news networks across Australia listening intently to this debate, as well as those plugged into the Internet who are following it in that way.
The best way to summarise it without getting into difficult hypothetical examples about income derived from brothels and then potentially taxing that income, and then the tax treatment of potential deductions that might occur in the business of running a brothel—and the mind boggles as to the various business expenses that might go into that operation and the various goods and services that may need to be deducted in terms of running that—is to say that the point in general is that the tax office's job is to assess the income and tax the income. We have made the point about how the tax office will get that information in the first place and that it may well be sparse. But their job is to assess the income and collect the tax on that income. It is not their job—it is the job of the criminal enforcement side of things—to make judgments as to breaches of the law.
It is not the tax office's job to make a judgment as to how that money has been derived. It is a difficult issue. We would probably all agree with your principle. It is a matter of how to apply it in legislation. I think the way we are applying the principle in relation to the bribery of foreign officials is a sensible move forward and is achievable. I commend the bill as it stands to the Senate.

6  Application
		 The amendments made by this Schedule apply to losses, outgoings or expenditure incurred in the 1999-2000 income year or a later income year.
This amendment is consistent with the two amendments that the opposition has just moved and which have been passed. There are two very minor corrections to this amendment. They correct what would be described as typographical errors. Where we have `insert ""bribes to public officials""', we have 26.53. It should read 26-53. We have at the end of section 110-25:
	 Add:
	 (1)	 Expenditure does not form part of—
it should read `Add: (10) Expenditure does not form part of'. They are typographical errors. I do not want to unduly keep the Senate. The arguments we put forward in 
 respect of the two previous amendments that were carried are the same as those for this amendment.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-12-08,"—I agree with Senator Sherry's proposition that the arguments are similar. I do not think we need to put them again, unless the Democrats have a different view on this amendment, which I would be surprised at. I record that the government is opposed to this for the same reasons I have put previously. But after a long training in politics, I can see where the numbers lie.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-12-08,"—As Senator Ian Campbell suspected, the Democrats support this amendment for the reasons that we supported the previous two amendments. We see them as consequential, basically. I agree with Senator Campbell's idea about not unnecessarily chewing up time in the chamber. I speak in the interests of ensuring the maximum productivity of one of our future amendments. I am keen to deal with this prior to my amendment coming on, which is in the not-too-distant future.
The policy sense and the detail of the amendment that the opposition has moved are appropriate. In the debate between Senator Campbell and Senator Brown on the previous amendments, I did not indicate at much length the Democrats' rationale behind supporting those amendments. It is probably appropriate to do that now. Whilst there may be some technical issues related to having such amendments in legislation, the policy intent and the message contained in the body of this amendment that we are debating now, which is probably the substantive one, are positive. It ensures consistency and represents a consistent message. It ensures that bribes to foreign public officials are not tax deductible, which is the government's intent. That intent extends to bribes to all public officials, including those within Australia. The definitions of `public official' and `bribes' contained in here mirror what is contained within the government's bill. I cannot see any problem with it. 
 For that reason, the Democrats will support the amendment.

	 (2)	 You can only make this choice if the valuation was made no more than 90 days before or after the CGT event.
I will put some quick words on the record to support the amendments. Amendment No. 3 clarifies that the cost of obtaining a valuation from the Commissioner of Taxation is tax deductible where the valuation is required under the gift provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. Amendment No. 4 relates to the cultural gifts program. It ensures that donors making gifts of property under the cultural gifts program will receive a deduction equal to the amount they would have received before the new capital gains tax exemption under new subsection 118-60(2) became available.
Amendment No. 5, which relates to trading stock, will allow taxpayers to choose to use the commissioner's valuation obtained under section 30-212 for the purposes of valuing the disposal of trading stock outside the ordinary course of business. Taxpayers may only choose this alternative valuation where the disposal occurs no more than 90 days before or after the date of the commissioner's valuation. Finally, amendment No. 6 allows taxpayers to choose to use the commissioner's valuation obtained under section 30-212 for the purposes of valuing the disposal of a capital gains tax asset where the disposal occurs no more than 90 days before or after the date of the commissioner's valuation.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,5,1,speech

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-12-08,"—I have a couple of questions to ask in this section to do with the general issue of philanthropy and the amendments we are considering. In the committee hearing, Senator Campbell, we heard evidence that in the United States, on the issue of philanthropy, those individuals and organisations that give money under this broad heading do have to publicly disclose. Their accounts are available publicly for people to look at to see where the money is going. Why did the government not consider that approach in respect of the issue of philanthropy in this legislation?",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-12-08,"—While Senator Ian Campbell is deliberating there, I would like to ask a question. Why is the $5,000 limit there? Why is there a differentiation under this and coming sections so that you can get tax deductibility if the donation you are making to, for example, the National Trust organisation is worth more than $5,000 but not if it is less? There are different conditions that apply. I will be moving an amendment to remove that distinction. Why has the government decided that $5,000 is the barrier and why, if your gift is worth more than that, do you get better deductibility than if your gift is less than that?",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-12-08,"—Senator Brown, I am sorry, I was taking advice while you were speaking.
—Give your response, Senator, and then I will come back with mine.
—Thank you. The issue Senator Sherry raises is an important one. As Senator Sherry will know from the committee's hearings, as with virtually everything in public policy there are pros and cons to different approaches. The government's approach in this area is to be dealt with under the next package of bills that is coming before us, which will see the Senate return to the second reading debate on the four remaining ANTS bills.
Senator Sherry will know about the register of charities, which will be established as part of the new tax system. I have noticed from 
 flipping through the papers that there seems to have been a focus on charities and the new tax system in the last few hours. The opposition seem to be focused on it. That is part of a range of new integrity measures in terms of charities. We do not believe that the tax law is the appropriate place to be creating a new disclosure regime for charities.
Charities themselves and philanthropic organisations would realise there are benefits to having a disclosure regime and to having transparency so that people involved in those charities and people who donate to those charities feel some comfort that the money going into them is being directed for the purpose for which the charity was established. The way to achieve that is not through taxation law.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-12-08,"—There is just one other point that I wanted to touch on briefly in this area. There is obviously a cost to government revenue of philanthropic activity. That is obviously a line item in the budget papers. Will the tax office be providing a report giving more detail about where these moneys are being directed through philanthropic activity? I am not talking about a list of who gives what in terms of naming individuals or companies, but some idea of where these moneys are being directed. From an opposition perspective and, I would have thought, from a government perspective it would be very useful to indicate what is occurring with the use of public expenditures. Would you indicate, Senator Campbell, what degree of reporting is likely from the tax office on this matter?",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-12-08,"—The advice I have received is that the Australian Taxation Office has not provided that level of detail in its reporting since time immemorial. Under the previous government it was not done. However, as all honourable senators know, independent research is done on these matters—important research trying to find out where the benefit of these deductions falls. Senator Sherry quite rightly points out that giving tax breaks and tax deductions is a form 
 of expenditure because it potentially costs the revenue. It is worthwhile information, but the tax office has never done it in the past and does not propose to do so in this case.
Senator Brown, I have been provided with a response to your question, but as I was taking advice while you were asking it, I am not sure that the brief I have specifically answers your question. So that I do not say something that is not right on the mark, as I seek to make all my answers, could you quickly recap?",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-12-08,"—The question was: why are donations of property valued at more than $5,000 being given better tax deductibility than those valued at less than $5,000? For example, if a property is worth more than $5,000, that is okay, but if the value of the property is less than $5,000 it is only tax deductible if it was bought during the 12 months before making the gift. Why is that $5,000 barrier put there?",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-12-08,"—Congratulations to my bureaucratic advisers: the answer is right on the mark. It may not be the answer that Senator Brown wants to hear, but I have read it and it seems a reasonable proposition. There may be a disagreement about whether the tax office always proffers reasonable suggestions, but the reason is that the government does not support varying the current provisions of the legislation in this area—that is, the $5,000 cut-off. The threshold is imposed quite simply to avoid the compliance costs associated with allowing deductions for donations of low value items, for example, second-hand clothes or used household goods, and to simplify enforcement. Donors making donations below the threshold are still able to access tax deductions by selling the asset and donating cash. The bill provides for income tax deductions to be allowed for the market value of donations of property worth more than $5,000 regardless of when it was purchased or acquired.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-12-08,"—That presumably means that, if some 
 body donates a painting worth $4,000 which could have some regional significance, for example, to a Bendigo or Dubbo or Launceston collection, they do not get deductibility unless it was done in the last 12 months. I do not think it is difficult to differentiate that from second-hand clothes. The problem I have with this is that it means the small donor right across the Australian populace who may not have works and properties of more than $5,000 that they can donate is disadvantaged against the big donor who, being better off, is going to have works or properties worth much more and who gets the deduction regardless of how old the item being donated might be.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-12-08,"—In relation to cultural gifts, I am advised that the example you used, which is a painting, would fall under the category of cultural gifts and under that category there is not a $5,000 threshold. So you would be able to donate a painting to a collection in Launceston, Dubbo or anywhere else and still get a full deduction for it, probably for the very reasons the honourable senator is thinking about.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-12-08,"—Then why the limitation on cultural donations and not, for example, donations which add to the environmental amenity?",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-12-08,"—Cultural gifts is a quite specific program. Senator Brown would understand why there is such a program; he has just given a good example of that—a piece of art or cultural heritage being donated to a specific collection or other purpose. Gifts that might add to environmental or other heritage values fall under the same advice I gave previously, that is, it is purely a compliance cost issue. There is always a problem in these debates in the parliament as to where you set a threshold. There comes a stage where you need to draw a line. By their nature they are always arbitrary. Someone who wants to donate something worth $4,500 is going to ask why the 
 system is biased against them and point out that if they made a donation worth $5,500 they would get a deduction. That is the problem. You will have the same arguments whether you set it at $2,000 or $1,000.
Our advice is that compliance costs are balanced in the national interest if you set the threshold at $5,000. We could easily spend the next two sitting days coming up with examples illustrating that that is not a good threshold. Our best advice is that that is a reasonable threshold in terms of costs and benefits. The cultural gifts program specifically creates a system that will allow cultural gifts to be given, which solves the problem that Senator Brown first raised. In terms of giving gifts to an organisation that may seek to benefit Australia's natural environment or other heritage, donations of over $5,000 of property will be tax deductible; if property is worth less than $5,000 the option is that the good could be sold and the donation made. In that case the donation would be tax deductible.
We are not therefore saying that anybody who has got property of less than $5,000 to give cannot benefit the organisation. We are just saying that, in terms of the compliance mechanisms in relation to the gifting of property, there are bigger compliance issues at stake. I am not an expert in this field, but obviously, if you donate property, valuation issues come into it. If you are donating cash, it is quite clear: you write them a cheque. If you were, for example, to auction or put up for sale on one of the many excellent Australian electronic auction rooms on the Internet these days a good or an item that you wanted to sell and donate the money to the Wilderness Society in Tasmania—an excellent cause, I am sure you would agree, Senator Brown—
—Absolutely.
—My younger brother Colin spent many years of his life raising money for the Wilderness Society in Tasmania.
—Why didn't you?
—I actually helped to raise money for the Wilderness Society in Western Australia and gave over 
 my property in the Swan Valley for the Wilderness Society in Western Australia to have a fundraising function for my younger brother. That is why Senator Brown and I get on so well: he knows where my feelings lie in relation to wilderness and the Wilderness Society.
That is an example. Let us say I had something of value to auction. I could easily sell it, create some money and hand over a cheque to the Wilderness Society. That means that someone who has a piece of property that is worth less than $5,000 can still do the right thing by the Wilderness Society or any other organisation that they wish to donate to. It ensures that that sort of philanthropy can go on. But, in terms of the compliance cost of property and the additional compliance that will relate to gifting property, the government believes that $5,000 is a good threshold.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-12-08,"—I am tempted to add that, with Christmas being around the corner, the Wilderness Society shops are the best place to go to.
I have a couple of follow-ups on that. I will give an example. Let us say you have made a collection of historic labels for apple boxes from the Huon Valley, which are very brilliant and colourful, for the apples being sent overseas in the 1950s, 1960s and so on, and you want to donate that. They are assessed as being worth $3,000. Surely it is not a sensible option, if you are going to get tax deductibility, to have to sell them somewhere to a private collector when you want to put them into the public domain and then add $2,000 to get tax deductibility. I want to check on that. I hope Senator Campbell is going to say that, because it is a cultural donation, exemption will apply. The second thing is that I wonder about the provision which says that gifts of property valued at less than $5,000 are tax deductible only if the property was bought within the 12 months before making the gift. Why is that proviso there?",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-12-08,"—On the first point, yes, that would be the answer 
 I would give. I hope the tax commissioner would agree with me. Senator Brown would be shocked to learn that I had a collection of those apple crate logos, so I will not surprise him. I do not.
—They are very sought after in Tasmania.
—It would be fascinating to see them. I think that is the right answer. That would certainly, in my own interpretation, be regarded as a cultural gift.
In terms of the issue of buying something within 12 months and gifting it and therefore not having the $5,000 threshold, again it comes down purely to compliance issues. If you have purchased something within 12 months and gifted it, quite clearly the valuation issues are a lot simpler and it will be easy to say what the value was because there would have been a transaction that has taken place to make the value quite clear. The other point I should make is that it has been part of the legislative regime and we are not seeking to change that. It is not a new measure; it is something that has been in place for some years.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-12-08,"—The problem with it is that it has the effect of giving tax deductibility to somebody who buys an item of less than $5,000 value and then donates it to a public institution or collection. But somebody who has got something which may have greater historical value because it has been part of a family collection or a household for 150 years and is valued at $4,500, and there are lots of such items, does not get the tax deductibility unless it falls within whatever the definition is of cultural value. If that is the case, if such items get exemption because they are of cultural value, why have this proviso of 12 months? What items are you looking at that a person might buy that are not cultural items and might gift within 12 months to an institution that is going to draw the allowance for tax deductibility? Can you give me an example?",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-12-08,"—There is not a lot to add. The cultural gifting pro 
 gram is a quite specific one. I know from some experience that there are clearly guidelines in relation to that and I hope that they have not been altered too much by incorporating apple crates from the Huon Valley.
An example would be if someone wanted to gift an item to the Smith Family, St Vincent de Paul or anyone else. Say they wanted to gift some item that is useful to them—a washing machine, cooking equipment or anything else—and I am sure it would happen quite regularly that people would buy something and provide it to a charitable organisation. And it is very obvious what the value of that good is if it has been purchased within the past 12 months.
With the compliance cost in relation to determining the value for the sake of tax deductibility purposes, the key issue of why you set the threshold at $5,000—which is how much paperwork and how much compliance cost is involved by the parties involved, including the tax office, in setting the amount for the deduction through valuation processes and other issues—is solved if the item has been purchased within 12 months because the valuation is therefore quite clear.
An item with some historical value or significance that has been in the ownership of a family over 150 years is clearly a different matter when you come to valuation. Ultimately, the tax office needs to place a value on things, and the costs involved in trying to determine the value of those items make the government's point. That is why there is this exemption for items purchased in the past 12 months. It is a provision that has been in the law for many years and it makes sense. That is why we are keeping it there.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-12-08,"—Could Senator Campbell enlighten me as to the provision that, for gifts of property to cultural institutions only, tax deductions can be spread over five years? Why not the gift of a property which, for example, has high environmental value, where an endangered species may be involved? Why can't that be spread over five years as well? Why is there the restriction as to it being a gift of cultural value? I might add that I have some intention down the line of giving a block of 
 land that I own to the Bush Heritage Fund. Maybe that is an interest that I should declare in debating this particular area of tax reform.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-12-08,"—I can offer two things in response to the important issues raised by Senator Brown. Firstly, the cultural gifts program is a quite specific one. You have made a fair point: why cultural gifts and why not others? It is a specific decision of government to assist with cultural gifts. It is a discrete program.
As for the issue that Senator Brown raised in relation to gifts, for example, of land with environmental significance,  Senator Hill, the minister for the environment, has made it clear to me—and I now pass this on to the chamber—that he does intend to come into the chamber shortly. He was going to address these issues using the platform of the proposed Democrat amendments, which we are moving towards, if not rapidly. Senator Hill was wanting to come into the chamber to deal with those issues and it might pay, since he is certainly far more versed in these matters than I am, for him to address that issue when he arrives. I am sure he is watching this on the monitor in his room and that could be a good cue for him to leave his room and wander towards the chamber.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-12-08,"—I think you might be right—I am not going to ask a question about the issue that Senator Brown is referring to. I will be brief. In the supplementary explanatory memorandum, on page 3 the last dot point paragraph says:
. ensure that the consequential amendments to the political donations provisions in the ITAA 1997 will not commence until immediately after the provisions of Taxation Laws Amendment (Political Donations) Bill 1999 commence.
Can you explain what the purpose of that is and if you are moving that in the amendments we are considering here? The reason for asking is that we have a later amendment that you would be aware of and we want to know whether that paragraph is going to cut across it. ",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-12-08,"—Firstly, that was contained in amendment No. 1, which has been agreed to. Secondly, because the political donations bill is still to be considered, the commencement provisions have been altered by that amendment to ensure the provisions that relate to that in this bill do not come into effect until the political donations legislation becomes law. Clearly, it would be presumptuous of us, and technically silly of us, to predict such a thing occurring. We hope it will occur at some stage in the future, but this just will not come into being until that happens.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-12-08,"—The final point I was going to make relates to the question that I asked earlier about the tax office giving us an overview of where these philanthropic monies are going to in the community. We do not agree with your approach that information will not be provided—we would like that information. We have not moved an amendment to that effect, but I indicate that we will be pursuing that issue at another time, perhaps on other legislation. I do not have any other comments. We are supporting these government amendments.

I am not sure about it because I have not discussed it with clerks, advisers or anyone else, which is very dangerous. Would there be any downside to moving to the consideration of some of the Democrats amendments and Australian Greens amendments in relation to gifts of property?
—We are not proceeding as the parliamentary secretary requested.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1999-12-08,"—Can I try to help the committee.
—We would love your assistance.
—And you would help me if you could liberally interpret the standing orders for a moment or two. We are coming to a range of amendments—particularly from the Australian Democrats but there are also some from the Greens—that seek to extend the benefits that we have included in this bill in relation to philanthropy for conservation purposes. Within this bill there are quite historical changes to encourage donations of property for conservation purposes, and that should not be overlooked. In the future, a donation of property for that objective will be tax deductible, which will be a huge incentive for the transfer of properties. That is somewhat consistent with a trend that is taking place in some other countries, in particular the United States. It has contributed there to a vast array of property being dedicated by individuals to conservation purposes, which significantly complements the traditional way of doing that through a national park system. So, through this bill, the government is taking a major step to encourage the development of such a philosophy in Australia. It does it in relation to the income tax deduction. It is also a benefit that capital gains tax will not apply to a test of entry disposition of such a property.
The Australian Democrats, as is not unusual, say, `Yes, we'll take that, but we want to go further.' Their amendments cover a range of other initiatives that could be addressed by government to even further encourage philanthropy in this area. In particular, they provide that where a property owner covenants a property or part of a property for conservation purposes and that results in a reduction in the value of the property, then that should be treated as a tax deductible sum. In addition, they say that where a property has been donated, the donor should have the additional advantage of being able to average out that donation for income tax purposes over a period of five years. Again, they argue that if a property is donated for this purpose capital gains tax should not apply.
The government's position on each of these additional measures is that we are not pre 
 pared to support them in this bill. We think, as I said, that we have made a historic start along this road of encouraging the disposition of property for conservation purposes, and we are prepared as a government to seriously consider other initiatives during the course of next year. It has been interesting to reflect upon the work that has already been done in this area, particularly by the CSIRO's Carl Binning and Mike Young, which has been very helpful in putting together a possible suite of initiatives that a government might take in regard to this—two of which, as I said, have been picked up by the government in this bill. It is also interesting to note that significant property owners and business people in Australia are now coming together and debating among themselves what they might be able to do to encourage this philosophical change in the Australian people towards the disposition of property for conservation purposes. So the community is moving to a position which the government would obviously regard as desirable.
There is considerable information on the public record as to a possible suite of further initiatives, and the Australian Democrats and the Greens have put on the table today some further options in that regard. The government's view is that they should be seriously considered during the course of next year—obviously not surprisingly in relation to the cost as well as the issue of effectiveness—and then the government can make a decision as to which further initiatives, if any, it should take, within the budgetary constraints of the government but also with the objective of getting the most effective outcome in terms of conservation for whatever commitment that the government might be prepared to make in relation to revenue forgone. The government put to the committee that that is a better way to proceed on these other initiatives that are put up in the form of amendments by the minority parties today, and to that sentiment the government would not be prepared to support them on this occasion in this bill.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-12-08,"—Senator Hill spoke to amendments that I have not moved yet. To give context to his comments, I will move the amendment I think 
 he is talking about, which is No. 10 on sheet 1669. I move:
(10)		 Schedule 5, page 24 (after line 12), after item 11, insert:
11A  After section 30-220
	 Insert:
30-222  How much you can deduct for certain gifts of land
	 (1)	 This section contains the rules for working out how much you can deduct for a gift of property that you made to a recipient covered by item 1 or 2 of the table in section 30-15 if:
		 (a)	 the property is land or an interest in land; and
		 (b)	 the recipient is:
			 (i)	 an *environmental organisation or a fund, authority or institution covered by the table in subsection 30-55(2); or
			 (ii)	 a public fund established and maintained under a will or instrument of trust solely for the purpose of providing money, property or benefits to an entity mentioned in subparagraph (i).
	 (2)	 If you sell land that you own to an entity mentioned in paragraph (1)(b) for less than its market value, you can deduct the difference between the market value of the property on the day you made the sale and the actual sale price.
	 (3)	 If you give land that you own to an entity mentioned in paragraph (1)(b) but you retain the right to live on that land for the remainder of your life, you can deduct the market value of the property subject to your life interest.
	 (4)	 For the purposes of sections 30-247 and 118-60, a transaction covered by subsection (2) or (3) is deemed to be a gift of property that is deductible under section 30-15 of an item in the table in that section.
30-223  How much you can deduct for land affected by a conservation covenant
	 (1)	 This section contains the rules for working out how much you can deduct if the value of land is decreased by a conservation covenant.
	 (2)	 If you enter into a conservation covenant in respect of land you own and the market value is decreased because of the covenant, you can deduct the difference 
 in the market value of the land before and after you entered into the covenant.
	 (3)	 For the purposes of sections 30-247 and 118-60, your entry into a conservation covenant is deemed to be a gift of property that is deductible under section 30-15 because of an item in the table in that section.
	 (4)	 In this section,  conservation covenant  means any approved form of agreement relating to the management, use and development of an area of land that is registered or noted on the land title and requires the landholder and all subsequent landholders:
		 (a)	 to maintain native vegetation and undertake any other actions required to conserve the biodiversity values of that land; or
		 (b)	 to maintain buildings or structures or other items of cultural significance that are registered on a recognised Commonwealth, State or Territory heritage register;
		 and includes, but is not limited to, an agreement under the following provisions:
		 (c)	 sections 304 to 311 of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 ;

		 (k)	 section 29 of the Heritage of Western Australia Act 1990  (WA);
		 (l)	 sections 37A to 37H of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1970  (Tas).
There is a range of amendments on the running sheet that I was listed to move together, most of them relating to an independent valuer. I indicate to the chamber that I will not proceed with those. The substantial issue that the minister's comments were addressing and the policy change that the 
 Democrats want to achieve through taxation legislation are contained within Democrat amendment No. 10, so I will just speak to that one.
—You have moved amendment No. 10 on sheet 1669. Is that correct?
—Yes.
—And you are not proceeding with the others in that bloc as listed on the running sheet?
—No, just amendment No. 10. I will not proceed with amendments Nos 1 to 6, 8, 9, 11, 12 or 17 on the Democrat sheet 1669 as per the running sheet. Amendment No. 7, which I am not moving either, was not listed there because it was a duplicate.
—I am told it should not have been.
—The other ones were to do with providing an opportunity to have an independent valuer as well as the commissioner, which is a small issue that we decided not to proceed with. The substantial issue is amendment No. 10, which basically adds an extra component to the act. As I said in my second reading contribution on this bill, some of the aims of what the government has done with this bill are laudable and the Democrats support them. As Senator Hill indicated, the bill does broaden opportunities for taxation incentives for some conservation related measures. In our view, it presents an ideal opportunity to extend that further in a way that we believe will be at fairly minimal cost to the public purse. In terms of savings to the public purse in the long term through improvements to our land quality and to our record in the conservation of land, it would be money well invested that, in our view, would pay itself off many times over.
The amendment inserts two new sections into the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997—I think that is the correct one. The first relates to rules for working out how much people can deduct for a gift of land if it is given to an environmental organisation, fund, authority or institution—as defined—or to a public fund established and maintained under a will or 
 instrument of trust solely for the purpose of providing money, property or benefits to environmental organisations or related institutions. When people sell land they own to an environmental organisation for less than its market value, it provides the opportunity for them to deduct the difference between the market value of the property and the actual sale price. Or, if they give that land to an environmental organisation or related authority and retain the right to live on the land for the remainder of their life and, upon their death, pass the ownership of the land over to that environmental organisation or trust, again, the market value of the property can be taken into account for tax purposes.
The second section enables deductions for land affected by conservation covenants. Establishing a conservation covenant on land means, in broad terms, having a requirement inserted into the actual land title to preserve particular parts of the land. This would usually protect the vegetation from being cleared or impacted on, prevent buildings from being constructed or preserve and protect the creeks and features of the land. If you enter into a conservation covenant like that with either a relevant trust or a government authority, the decrease in the market value that occurs as a result of putting that conservation covenant on your land is also able to be used for tax deductible purposes.
It is worth pointing out that the use of conservation covenants is not new. It has been used already throughout Australia to great effect—in some states more than others. The amendment lists various state based acts that conservation covenants currently operate under. In my own state of Queensland the state government is moving to improve the operations of that process. As I have mentioned in this chamber before, the Trust for Nature in Victoria is an excellent example of a conservation trust established and recognised under state legislation. I have also mentioned the operation of a large number of conservation covenants overseas, such as I have outlined in this amendment. The sort of work that the Trust for Nature has done has been incredibly effective, not just with its ongoing conservation outcome but also in 
 terms of the savings to the public purse. It is worth emphasising that point. It sits alongside the operation of national parks and publicly managed areas of land. I am not in any way suggesting that these sorts of measures should replace national parks and areas of land managed by state authorities, but resources at government level can go only so far in that area of activity. One of the major ongoing impacts on the environmental value of our land is the use humans put that land to and the way they live on it.
If we can provide mechanisms that encourage people to conserve and maintain the environmental values of that land, it will be a massive saving down the track to society as a whole, both economically and environmentally. It would assist the landowners themselves to be a part of conservation management. As I am sure all senators would be aware, a major issue in Queensland at the moment is land clearing, which is a very unfortunate and immensely environmentally destructive activity. For economic reasons, farmers feel it is a necessity to clear their land, predominantly for cattle grazing—for those of you who might be pondering having a steak for lunch.
Farmers are moving in that way because they believe there is some economic incentive for them to do so. In many cases it is very marginal. There are the costs of clearing the land, and the return they then get on it from cattle or whatever is often very small—there is a very thin margin of so-called profit there—but there is immense environmental damage that the community as a whole has to bear for many years to come. We can provide tax incentives for people to maintain vegetation on their land, and these sorts of measures can make all the difference in that regard, particularly when you are dealing with the marginal income making activities that are driving a lot of the land clearing at the moment. For a very small initial impact on the public purse, there is a massive environmental and economic benefit for the country down the track.
An immediate and prominent example that is proving to be of immense difficulty for the state Labor government in Queensland is their 
 unequivocal election promise to put adequate controls on land clearing in Queensland. The way the world works, for better or for worse, is that financial matters often drive a lot of human activity, including a lot of environmental destruction. Along with using measures such as strict legislative and regulatory controls and punitive measures, we all know that providing incentives and encouraging people through positive means to change behaviour are often just as effective, if not more effective. Where there are opportunities to adopt such an approach, I think we should try to grasp them.
This particular amendment is significant in that regard. I am not in any way suggesting that it would solve the land clearing problem in Queensland overnight; it is more about putting in place the mechanism for long-term behavioural change. I would not want the state Labor government to see it as an excuse to back out of their election commitment to introduce some proper land clearing controls, but it is a mechanism that can add to that. It has flow-on benefits across the country of involving landowners themselves in conservation, and it attaches some economic value to maintaining the health of our environment.
Often one of the big problems for people who want to preserve the environment is that there is no dollar value placed on things. There is a dollar value in raising a cow and getting someone else to slaughter it and slice it up, but there is often no dollar value in maintaining the health of the land. Down the track we will all have to pay those hidden ongoing costs of the environmental damage. Whether those costs are from repair of or reduced productivity from the land, or whether they are from pollution and other flow-on health costs, there are enormous in-built costs that just do not show themselves to the individual.
This is only one mechanism. I should emphasise that it is, in its own way, a small measure but it provides a good mechanism for a lot of that philosophy of providing incentives—of giving economic value to conserving land rather than just degrading it. In that sense I think it sends a positive message, as well as providing financial incentives for 
 people. It builds on systems that are already in place at a state level through conservation covenants. It does not limit covenants to those mechanisms, so it is flexible enough for other mechanisms for conservation covenants to be put in place, for example at the federal level.
Some marvellous work on using the tax system to encourage land conservation has been done by the CSIRO and others in the conservation movement. There are examples of how this has been done in the US and Europe to produce quite positive environmental benefits. I think Australia is lagging behind in that regard. There have been good proposals put forward by organisations such as the CSIRO about ways that we can expand on the fairly simple measure that is contained in this amendment, and on ways that we can move even further down the road of providing incentives for improving the conservation of our lands. This is a small measure, but I think potentially it is a very valuable one. I very much urge all senators, and in particular government senators, to take it seriously. As I said at the start, the immediate cost to the public purse would not be a major one, according to some of the work that has been done in this area by organisations such as the CSIRO, but the long-term economic and environmental benefit would be immense.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-12-08,"—Labor will be supporting the amendment moved and spoken to by Senator Bartlett and subsequent amendments that will come later. I attended the Senate committee hearings on this legislation, and it was obvious that there was a glaring omission from the philanthropic approach of the Prime Minister relating to the environment.
The proposals that we are considering form at least part of an effective approach to conserving the Australian environment. From that point of view, we are happy to support the amendment that is currently being considered. I am disappointed that the Prime Minister, in his emphasis on philanthropy, appears to have a very narrow approach in his principles in this area. The environment is just not on the agenda, it appears. This is one glaring omission from the Prime Minister's approach. We are happy to support the initia 
 tive. I note that the CSIRO is one of the organisations proposing this approach. The CSIRO is an organisation of considerable standing—deservedly so—in the community, and it enjoys significant respect and support from the entire community.
There has been an argument about the cost. Obviously this will extend the cost, but this philanthropical theme that the Prime Minister is attempting to move the nation on was his idea. If the amendment that we will be moving later to reduce the allowable deduction to political parties is carried, we will actually be saving money, and that would go some way to offsetting the cost. Frankly, I think the environment is a more important priority than massive donations to political parties. Senator Bartlett makes the perfectly valid point that there may be some short-term direct costs that are measured on budget, but we have to look at the savings—particularly longer-term savings—to the environment and the total cost to the community, not just at the narrow costs that are measured on budget with savings to our environment, to the general economy and to our social structure as a whole. They are not easy to measure, but I think it is legitimate to point to that in this debate. For those reasons, Labor will be supporting the amendment that has been moved and the amendments that will be moved later with respect to this and other areas.
I have made these comments now because I do not want to waste the time of the Senate and repeat them when we get to the later amendments.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-12-08,"—I am delighted to hear that. I also congratulate Senator Hill for providing the opportunity for this legislation to be brought before the parliament. As he said, it is historic legislation. It is marvellous for the environment that we are seeing recognition of the patriotism of people who protect land, ecosystems, wildlife, vegetation, coastlines and desert that they own and want to see protected in perpetuity. They put covenants on the land or they donate it to organisations while they are alive, or they make provision in their wills to ensure that the land will be protected as part of the nation's heritage. As far as human- 
 built property is concerned, this has been in place for many years, but when it comes to the environment it has been missing. This is not so in the United States where, for decades, if you donated land which had environmental value, it was tax deductible. But we are catching up, and this legislation is going to be of very big benefit to Australia's environment.
I was involved with the establishment of the Australian Bush Heritage Fund in 1990, and, although I am not directly involved with the organisation now, it has within the decade become one of the most powerful forces in Australia for protecting the environment. It has been able to purchase critically endangered blocks of land containing rare and endangered birds, animals, orchids, fish and trees from the Bega Valley—where only eight per cent of the original vegetation cover now exists—to Erith Island in Bass Strait, to rare coastal heathland in Tasmania and wildlife habitat in Western Australia and, more recently, to woodland in Queensland where, as we know, there is an utter disaster taking place at the moment. Hopefully, moves by the Queensland government to cut across that will be in place before Christmas.
So I congratulate the minister for the environment, Robert Hill. I am just sorry he is not here to hear me speaking these words—and the roof has not fallen in. I also congratulate the Democrats and the Labor Party for moving to make some obvious adjustments to the legislation which are going to be important to donors who are doing the right thing by this country.
The amendment that the Greens are moving in addition—and, I think, the Democrats as well—to ensure that tax deductibility of properties can be spread over five years by the donor, as happens with cultural properties, is a really good one. As it stands under this legislation, if you give Blue Poles, which was worth $1 million, to an Australian collection—and I am speaking theoretically; I know it has already been purchased and was not given—or you give a painting worth $1 million to a collection, you can spread your tax deductibility of that painting over five years. Under this legislation, if you give a 
 block of land which has rare and endangered species, water courses, lagoons and wildlife worth $1 million to a collection for permanent protection for this nation's heritage, you cannot do that. Quite clearly, it is very sensible that the donor ought to be afforded that tax deductibility and congratulated for their generosity. So congratulations all around. I feel that this is a marvellous change. It is encouraging rather than discouraging people who do the right thing by the environment.
Finally, let us look at what we have been debating in the last couple of days in this place. Just yesterday or the day before we were extending diesel fuel grants to people who get into bulldozers and drive through forests, knocking them down—in effect, a deductibility; an extension of largesse from the government. In a way, that this very positive moment for the environment has arrived makes me feel less bad that that legislation went through with only my dissent—with the support of the Democrats on that occasion, but it went through easily. Before I became a senator, I came to Canberra to lobby for this effect, and people had not even started thinking about it. But it is here now. It is excellent legislation. With the amendments it is going to be even better, and I want to congratulate all those involved.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,5,1,speech

I am very happy that Senator Brown is so happy and that Senator Hill has made him so happy. I am sure Senator Hill is sitting in his office sipping a cup of tea and is riveted to the monitor. He could even be clicked onto the Internet, but I do not think so—I do not think the honourable minister is an Internet clicker yet. I do not know whether Senator Brown is being slightly humorous or a little bit sarcastic or he did not hear Senator Hill correctly, but we are not supporting these amendments.
The most interesting thing about the debate in the last few minutes is that it has been such a monument to the Labor Party's policy 
 problems. Less than an hour ago we were informed by a Labor adviser that the Labor Party were not supporting these amendments.
Senator Sherry interjecting—
—We were. Obviously, we can have a debate about that, but the Labor Party advised us that they were not supporting these measures. We know as a matter of history—and Senator Brown would reinforce this—that throughout their 13 years in government they did not do this. I am sure former Senator Walsh and former Treasurer Keating probably would have argued with Senator Brown as to the cost of these things—and this is why I feel a bit like Senator Scrooge today. It would be lovely to make Senator Brown happy. We try to do that all the time—it is very hard—but it is nice to see that he has had this moment of happiness. But he should be happy about what Senator Hill said.
Senator Sherry might have been busy at the time trying to find a policy—trying to grope around for something that they believe in. Senator Hill did come in here. He put on the record that the government is seriously considering this whole policy. Maybe that is what Senator Brown is happy about. I think this measure will get through. One hour and 15 minutes ago it would not have got through, but it looks like it is going to get through. This amendment has the numbers on the floor of the chamber. But the government has said that it will not support it. I make it clear now that we will not call divisions on these issues. As the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, I personally regard calling divisions when it is quite clear what the vote is and when the parties have made clear their position a waste of debating time.
But I make it clear that the government is opposed to these measures for the reasons Senator Hill put down. We regard these as important ideas. We regard encouraging philanthropy in relation to giving land for conservation purposes as desirable. We think that can play an important part in a strategy to encourage private landowners to use their ownership and empower them to be part of the national conservation and environmental effort. I think Senator Brown and others 
 would recognise that this government has done more than any other government to encourage that in the past three years.
If Senator Bartlett and Senator Brown come to my great state of Western Australia, I encourage them—if they have not already done so—to go to Paruna Sanctuary, which is up in the Darling Range. It is an incredible private initiative, funded almost entirely out of the property of Martin Copley. I think he is actually a citizen of Great Britain. He is a great character who spends about half his time in Western Australia. He has created this fantastic sanctuary in the Darling Range—a phenomenal private initiative which has been facilitated by this government.
Senator Hill came in here today and said, as the minister responsible and therefore on behalf of the cabinet and the Prime Minister, that the government is more than sympathetic to these sorts of measures, has looked at the CSIRO work and other work that has been done in this area, and wants to put together an integrated package. So it is disingenuous of Senator Sherry to say that the Prime Minister is blind to this. The minister and the government have come in here and said, `We are going to bring'—to quote Senator Hill's words—`a serious consideration to an integrated policy package of which these sorts of measures could form part.'
These measures need to be costed. I guess when you are in opposition you can just say: `We didn't do this for 13 years when we were in government. We don't know how much it is going to cost.' I guess that is a continuation of Labor's policy when they were in government. They did not really care very much about what anything cost. The record of that was $10 billion deficits for nine out of their 13 years, high interest rates, high debt, high inflation, high unemployment. This is Senator Scrooge speaking, but you cannot just create any policy you want and ignore the cost, which is just what the Labor Party have done today. They have said, `We might pick up some money on political donations.'
The financial impact of the measures in this bill unamended is estimated to come to about $71 million in 2002-2003. We have no costings whatsoever on the amendment that is 
 about to be agreed to by the Australian Labor Party. The Labor Party will not be able to get up and say that this will cost $71 million, $100 million or $200 million because they have no costings. They have decided at some stage in the past hour or so, `This is a nice idea. We have no idea how much it will cost. We might be able to claw back some of the cost if you agree to an amendment on political donations. But we do not really know how much it will cost.' There would have to be one hell of a lot of political donations in a year to claw back $71 million.
—The $71 million is your cost.
—The $71 million is the government's estimates, the Treasury's estimates and the tax office's estimates of the measures in this bill.
—That's right.
—Exactly. Senator Sherry and the party he represents should come forward with some estimate as to what they think is the value of these measures.
—CSIRO says $2 million to $4 million.
—The CSIRO has not costed these measures, with all due respect. You would have to make an estimate as to how many people, for example, would decide that it is in their financial interest. They may be good environmentalists at heart—they are probably good capitalists at heart as well—who may, for example, decide to hand over all of their property and receive a life tenancy in return, put some covenants on and gain millions of dollars worth of taxable benefits.
—Are you filibustering?
—No, I am not filibustering. I am responding to two points. One is that the government thinks that these sorts of measures have some merit. We think there should be an integrated, costed approach. You need to look at how you achieve the best outcome for the environment and conservation values within the limited financial resources of the Commonwealth. It was Senator Sherry who earlier said that tax 
 deductibility is an expense to the revenue and that he would like to know where the money is going. Even though the tax office and the previous government never did that when they were in government, the opposition think it is a good idea now. That is good. The opposition seem to be developing some sort of policy. It changes from hour to hour, but at least they are wrestling with the concept of a policy. They have stuck to their old policy of no fiscal restraint. They have said, `If it is a good idea, let's do it and hang the expense. We'll let the next generation pay. Put it on the Beazley bankcard or, if Mr Beazley is not the leader, Mr Crean's bankcard. Hang the expense.'
The issue I am responding to is Senator Sherry's point that the PM and government do not care about it. We do care about it. We have said we will develop an integrated policy approach and that this sort of mechanism will be part of it. Senator Brown should be rightly proud of the fact that it has made it onto the government's serious policy agenda. He will be upset that it will not get through now. The government is not going to agree to these measures. So the strong likelihood of the decision of the Senate to support these measures is that the whole bill will be set aside, which is not a threat or anything; that will be what happens. Senator Brown has been lobbying for this and dedicating himself to this sort of public policy measure at the Commonwealth level for a generation, for his whole time in this debate, so he should feel rightly proud that it has got to this stage. It is now under serious consideration by the minister for the environment and ultimately the government of Australia, as Senator Hill has indicated historically here today.
This measure is not going to make it today. It is not going to make it into public policy because we do not think the measures have had enough thorough consideration, costing and analysing. Is this the best way to use the Commonwealth's resources? What if this does cost a quarter of a billion dollars, hypothetically? Is that the best way to spend a quarter of a billion dollars? How do you ensure that property owners are best encouraged by the taxation law to gift properties? What balance 
 is there in the use of covenants? What about the life tenancy issue? How do you do this? How do you find the best policy balance?
We do not think the approach that is taken today on the floor of the Senate is the right one. It could be a perfect approach, but we want to do it in a considered manner. Ultimately we will bring forward a policy. Ultimately it will have the scrutiny of a Senate committee, no doubt. Ultimately, it will be put into a package of legislation if that policy receives the assent. So I will not add to the debate. I am certainly the last person who would seek to extend this debate. But it is very important that people understand where the government is coming from. Certainly Senator Brown seemed to be under some illusion that the government may be supporting this amendment today. We are not.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-12-08,"—I am not surprised at the contribution we have just heard. Here we are attempting be cooperative, to get through this legislation prior to 12.45—
—I am ready for the vote right now.
—Good. I think what we have just heard could be classified as a filibuster. But there are a couple of points that I have to respond to.
Senator Campbell makes the point, `Well, how can you support something like this when you do not know the costings?' If that is a valid argument—and I do not believe it is because, as I pointed out, CSIRO says $2 million to $4 million—how on earth has the government costed the contents of the rest of this package and what sort of assumptions has it made? It is not a valid argument from Senator Campbell.
The points I have made still stand. The CSIRO have given us a costing. This was a glaring omission from the philanthropic approach of the Prime Minister as contained in this legislation. Senator Campbell has as much admitted that by acknowledging that the government will be looking at something like this at some future date. Senator Hill has come in and said that the government will be looking at it. Why didn't they look at it in 
 this particular piece of legislation? So we do not see any particular problem in supporting this at this point in time. We will be moving an amendment to reduce the tax deductibility of moneys to political parties. I did not say that it would save $71 million. I said there would be some saving that certainly would be some offset for the cost of the measure that is being supported and appears likely to pass here.
Finally, I want to make a comment about our advisers. I have spoken to both our advisers—very trusty, reliable, knowledgeable individuals. Neither of them indicated that we would be opposing this. We only got the final amendments halfway through the debate so I do not know where that information has come from. I think it is inappropriate to refer to private conversations with advisers. It is inappropriate and it should not happen. The conversation, as I am informed, did not occur. Again, I think that was an inappropriate comment and, frankly, irrelevant to the debate.
I am pleased that the non-government parties have been able to correct a very obvious defect in the Prime Minister's philanthropic approach. If it is good enough for health, it is good enough for education, it is good enough for a range of philanthropic endeavours in this country, and it is good enough for the environment. On behalf of the Labor opposition, as I have said, we will be supporting these amendments.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-12-08,"—In response, I wish to make a change to the amendments I have moved. On technical advice, I need to make a slight change; that is, to delete part 4 of the first section, 30-222, and part 3 of section 30-223.
Leave granted.
—Also, as a consequence of that, I seek leave to move amendments (1) and (2) as circulated on sheet 1677. I understand this is necessary to enable the provision to operate as intended.
Leave granted.
—I move:
(1)	 Schedule 5, item 16, page 25 (line 20), after ""section 30-15"", insert ""or by section 30-222 or 30-223"".
(2)	 Schedule 5, item 21, page 27 (line 14), after ""section"", insert "", or under section 30-222 or 30-223,"".
I will say a couple of things regarding the substance of some of the contributions, particularly from the government. Firstly, in terms of costs, I do not think the Democrats or the Senate are ignoring the costs. My understanding is that the CSIRO have done some costings of measures such as these and indicated they will cost only $2 million or $3 million per year. The government, as I am sure they would agree, have the resources to cost measures such as these and, given that these measures are going to pass through the Senate, I hope that they will use those resources to cost them themselves. Maybe they can do it more accurately.
I come back to the point that I hope, when they do those costings, they will add in the future savings—even purely in dollars and cents terms, let alone in terms of environmental benefits—of the improvement in land conservation that will occur as a consequence. I can outline lots of the costs of what we are spending now every day to fix up salination, deforestation, erosion and many other consequences of land clearing, and they are well and truly above whatever the immediate cost to the revenue might be from these measures. Whatever costing the government might say these measures have, I can guarantee that the savings as a result will far outweigh them.
The government also indicated it is better to do these sorts of things as an integrated package. I welcome Senator Hill's indication that the government is looking at doing that and moving that way. I think all people will understand that it is not necessarily the best approach always for everyone just to sit back and wait for the government to deliver on things it is going to do. I should perhaps remind the government that the Senate has a duty and a legislative role in terms of law making in this country. The government can put forward proposed legislation, as they have done, and it is for the Senate to consider that legislation and to amend it or to add in improvements. That is quite a legitimate part 
 of what the Senate is able to do. It is not something that government should attack as inappropriate. It should not be suggested that we should just sit back and wait for the government to deliver an integrated package once they have developed it.
These are self-contained, clear-cut amendments. They do not preclude the government developing a package of other measures down the line. Hopefully they will be an incentive for them to build a broader package of measures, but to suggest that we should just wait for the government to act is, I think, misreading and misunderstanding the actual role of the Senate as a law making body. Also, I think it is expecting rather too much in terms of the faith we are expected to put in the government to deliver on things. We have delivered amendments here; we believe they are good ones. We believe that whatever costs there are to them will be far outweighed by savings in the future. I urge the government to take that on board when they are considering this legislation as it is finally amended.
Consideration interrupted; progress reported.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,1999-12-08,"—The reason I have sought to make a statement today is based on a combination of factors. I have had to endure 14 months of adverse media coverage. Most recently, there has been an article in the West Australian  newspaper on 6 November 1999 and a further article in the Australian  on 7 December 1999 about my possible expulsion from the Liberal Party by a small committee in Western Australia called the Appeals and Disciplinary Committee.
I have not said anything during those 14 months in the interests of the Liberal Party. However, it needs to be stated here that the pursuit of me is in the face of the fact that the state executive of the party resolved over a year ago that the matter should not proceed. That decision was taken after I had provided 
 a comprehensive statement which they discussed. Following that, the state council also resolved that the matter should not proceed.
The West Australian article was written by a journalist called Anne Burns and is about Noel Crichton-Browne and me. It was almost entirely incorrect in every way. The Australian article by Roger Martin implied that I was being criticised for not saying anything. I stress that I have not spoken to either journalist for the sake of the Liberal Party. However, I am now compelled to come into the Senate.
Crichton-Browne has now mailed the Burns article across Western Australia because it is highly favourable to him and critical of me. The point needs to be made that Anne Burns has a very close personal relationship with Crichton-Browne. I do not have the luxury of such a compliant journalist. I have, therefore, after 14 months of silence, resorted to the Senate.
I wish to set the record straight on the many statements and allegations contained in the article. It, like so many other articles written by Burns, claims that I have apologised for alleging that Crichton-Browne has made death threats against me. I have not. I have apologised for, and I quote from the apology:
. . . statements that I had made to various individuals and on radio during 1995 [that] have been construed by some—
et cetera. There is no person I have spoken to or interview I have done that says anything other than the fact that I sought police advice on security matters following unidentified phone calls in the middle of the night that contained threats. I said to the police that I did not know the origin of the calls but that, given what had been going on in the party at the time, I wanted to know how best I could ensure my safety.
I at no stage requested police protection, which has been a further claim of Burns. I was also never given it. The article claims that I:
. . . narrowly escaped expulsion from the Party over the affair when the majority verdict of a discipline committee inquiry found her guilty of four charges of conduct prejudicial to the Liberal Party. 

That is plainly wrong. This so-called report was put together by two people, George Cash and Julie Debnam, who are two members of what once was a seven-member committee. The article says that there were originally six members. Wrong again.
It needs to be noted that one person was removed from the committee, Ric Mincherton, because he was a witness for Crichton-Browne in his case against me by making allegations against me that were simply not true. Julie Debnam is one of the complainants, but she too remained. Two other decent people resigned from the committee when they discovered that it was a witch-hunt to get me. Immediately they resigned, it was clear that the committee was nothing more than a kangaroo court. Last June, when the chairman tried to bring the matter to a conclusion some eight months or so after the matter had started, the remaining members removed a quorum by walking out of the meeting. The chairman then resigned.
This left three members, but only two of those three—Cash and Debnam—put together a so-called report recommending my expulsion. By this stage, the committee had no chairman and no quorum, but these two still tried to get their fake report accepted by the party. The party refused. As distribution of this document was highly restricted, one has to ask who gave a copy of the report to Crichton-Browne. I am told that he then went to state parliament and shopped it around to get someone to table it in the parliament. He was successful. A former member of the Labor Party, Mark Nevill, obliged.
Crichton-Browne then distributed this fake report to virtually all senators and members and very widely across Western Australia. He knew that the so-called report had no standing, but that did not stop him. According to the article, Mr Nevill went on to accuse David Johnston, the president of the party, of `nobbling the committee'. How preposterous! David Johnston is a lawyer and a well-respected person who as president has simply sought to have this matter finalised appropriately. He too is now being vilified by Crichton-Browne and his supporters.
The article claims that Crichton-Browne's destruction came about because:
. . . he led rebel coalition senators across the floor to vote against then Treasurer John Howard's retrospective legislation to outlaw bottom of the harbour tax schemes.
What nonsense! He made himself irrelevant because all he ever did was stack branches with the expectation that everyone else should do the same. Burns claims that I:
. . . had already fallen out with him over her performance as a WA senator.
I had certainly fallen out with him, but, as so many people who know Crichton-Browne would attest, it was because I would not spend my time stacking branches at his direction. I told him that I wanted to do my parliamentary duties and that I did not have the time to do his bidding.
If my so-called performance was so bad, why then was I serving as deputy whip in the Senate? Why have I chaired, by prime ministerial appointment, deputy chaired or participated in so many inquiries into policy matters on issues ranging from taxation to social security, health, aged care, child care, education and so much more? Additionally, if my performance had been in question, why was I was preselected to the No. 1 position on the Senate ticket in 1992 at the height of Crichton-Browne's political attack against me?
The article claims that I told Mincherton that I:
. . . had received death threats from Crichton-Browne at her homes in Perth and Canberra and was under police protection.
All I can say to that is that Mincherton is totally dishonest and manipulative and well known for it in the party in Western Australia. His bias against me is unquestioned.
As for the role of Mr McGinty and Mr Kobelke, two state Labor members of parliament, their claims are pure politicking of the highest order. I unequivocally stand by my claim that I telephoned Mr McGinty and asked him not to ask any question about me as the question that he was proposing to ask was factually incorrect by mentioning death threats and police protection. He said that he wanted to run the question in an effort to 
 embarrass the Premier and that he was not going to identify me. I said that he had to be joking when he said that he would not identify me because the question even had a reference to my dog. He was determined to run the question, but I begged him not to. The rest is history. He and Kobelke have continued to try to damage me and the Liberal Party ever since in relation to this matter.
Burns claims that the committee found that I had:
. . . conspired with Mr McGinty and had misled the party's Senate pre-selection committee.
Wrong. I have never conspired with Mr McGinty or anyone else in the Labor Party and I told the preselection committee precisely what happened. The article claims, `She did not lodge a defence,' referring of course to me. This suggests that I did not prepare one. Wrong again. My defence was presented to Crichton-Browne and he immediately sought to have the matter settled because he did not wish to have it made public.
My defence details the shocking treatment that I have had to endure from Crichton-Browne over many years. It contains many credible witnesses who were witness to his behaviour against me. I have resisted coming into the Senate over the last year and tabling it for all to see. This could have been done with complete immunity. The only reason I have not is to protect his former wife and children. However, if I have to endure much more harassment from this man, I will be left with no alternative but to table that document along with a copy of his statement of claim so that the facts will be there for all to see.
Crichton-Browne obviously gave a copy of my defence to the solicitor, Jack Courtis, who is supposedly acting for the division and branch that laid the complaints against me. I am aware that Crichton-Browne was most annoyed that Courtis had passed the defence to the committee sitting in judgment on me. The committee members read it. When Crichton-Browne was informed of this, he immediately issued instructions for it to be withdrawn from the committee. That leads me to another question: why is it that Crichton-Browne is running the case against me by instructing the prosecuting solicitor instead of 
 the complainants? I believe that to be a serious abuse of due process by him exercising complete influence over the deliberations and direction of the committee. I have asked the complainants to sign statutory declarations stating that they, and only they, have instructed Courtis and paid for his services. No such declaration has been forthcoming.
The question of funding for the case against me is an interesting one because the division and branch that laid the complaints have to declare any such funding to the Australian Electoral Commission. They have a duty of disclosure. If, by any chance, the solicitor is not charging for his time, then he too has a duty of disclosure to the Australian Electoral Commission.
Burns claims that I did not appear before the party's state council:
. . . despite a request from Premier Richard Court to give an explanation to the party.
Wrong. No such request has ever been made to me by the Premier verbally or in writing. He is too interested and involved in running the state and winning the next election.
Interestingly, this article does not even make an attempt to be balanced. While there is a cursory mention of Crichton-Browne's record of domestic violence, why was there no mention of him being a convicted criminal for fraud against the taxpayer? Burns clearly allowed her relationship with Crichton-Browne to influence the way in which she wrote the article. While she states that I refused to be interviewed for the article—that is true—I did provide her with a written statement which carried a rider stating that it was not to be printed in part without my prior written approval. What did she do? She printed the statement in part without my approval. 
I now come to the newly constituted committee. It has, as three of its members, Mincherton, who is a proactive agitator against me and who was removed from the previous committee; and Cash and Debnam, both of whom wrote the fake report recommending my expulsion. I have appealed that these three members cannot be deemed to be unbiased in their consideration of my case, but they have chosen to remain on the com 
 mittee. One can hardly wonder what conclusion they will draw this time. I am in a situation where I have witnesses sitting in judgment against me.
Many supporters have asked why I paid $20,000 to Crichton-Browne and have made the observation that doing so gave the appearance of guilt. To that I would say two things. Firstly, given my time again, I would do no such thing. Secondly, I wish to make it crystal clear that I have not pleaded guilty to anything; a casual observation of the events will illustrate that. Crichton-Browne commenced proceedings against me seeking damages and costs. He received no payment for damages and a meagre contribution towards his costs in comparison to what he sought. Once he saw my defence he did not wish to have it made public. He knew it was true. As a consequence he did not wish the matter to proceed to court, where witnesses to his behaviour and attitude toward me would be called to give evidence.
I most reluctantly agreed to the payment of a contribution towards his costs in an effort, which has clearly proven to be futile, to protect the Liberal Party and to stop his 11-year harassment of me. I wanted to draw a line in the sand and get on with my life and my work without his constant harassment. He and his mates will obviously not allow that. That is why I wish I had my time over again, because I would never make such a judgment.
The next question that I am asked is: why did I apologise? I already covered this earlier when I mentioned the exact words of the apology. The other question is: why were the terms of settlement not made public until after the 3 October election last year? The answer is that that is what Crichton-Browne agreed to. It is worth also noting that, whenever Crichton-Browne or Burns have referred to various interviews I did that form the basis of his action against me, there have never been full transcripts quoted. When one looks at the full interviews, as I have detailed in my defence, they clearly give a different view.
The time for me to explain in detail the level and extent of harassment and abuse I have had to endure is just not available. As I said before, that is contained in my defence 
 and will be tabled in the Senate if this harassment continues. Had Crichton-Browne been prepared, as I was, to finalise the whole matter and get on with his life, then I would not have had to take this step. I am enormously grateful for the ongoing support of the Prime Minister; my leader and deputy leader in the Senate, Senator Hill and Senator Alston; my parliamentary colleagues; my staff; members of the Liberal Party; and friends and family. To them I say thank you.

"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,1999-12-08,"—My question is to the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp. Does the Assistant Treasurer recall his own answer yesterday when he said:
Charities can structure their activities to take account of individual fundraising efforts, if that is the way they wish to go. Charities will undoubtedly take every advantage they can under the law, as the law is written, and that is what we would expect them to do.
If the government really wanted to help charities why are they not just taken out of the punitive GST net instead of encouraging them to do everything they can under the law to avoid the Howard-Lees GST? Wasn't one of the government's main claims for introducing the GST that nobody could escape paying their fair share?

But the Assistant Treasurer might be able to answer this supplementary. In regard to charities being able to `structure their activities to take account of individual fundraising efforts', can the minister outline exactly what restructuring charities will be able to do to avoid the Howard-Lees GST and at what further cost to the charities? For example, will charities now have to set up ABC Charities (Lamington Drive) Inc., followed by ABC Charities (Gala Evening) Inc. and maybe even ABC Charities (Money

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-08,"—What an astonishing question from Senator Murphy—a truly astonishing question. All the Labor Party complaints over the last week or so have been that a GST is being imposed on aspects of charitable works. That has been your complaint over the last week. Now Senator Murphy is worried that charities are going to avoid the GST. Get real! Where is the Labor Party coming from on any issue? It beats me. Because you do not believe in anything you 
 flip-flop on everything and one day you argue on one side of the street—
—Senator, address your remarks to the chair, not across the chamber.
—Thank you, Madam President. The trouble is, as I was saying, that if you do not believe in anything, if you do not stand for anything, if you do not know where you stand on an issue, you run contradictory lines, which we have just seen from Senator Shayne Murphy. We are bringing in a very fair tax system which will be of benefit to charities, of benefit to large and small business, of benefit to taxpayers, of benefit to families and, particularly, of benefit to those on pensions and benefits. We have a tax reform program; we want to make sure Australia has a tax system which will take us into the new millennium and which is fairer and more equitable and which will better enable Australia to compete on world markets—in other words, a tax system which is the world's best practice.
You ask such a question because you have no philosophy, you have no views, you have no policies. I ask the Labor Party to work out with their colleagues whether they are worried about the GST affecting charities or are they worried about charities escaping the GST. Just get your lines straight. It shows the appalling leadership the Australian Labor Party has both in the other chamber and in this chamber that you cannot get your lines straight on this particular issue.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Charitable Organisations</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1,answer
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-08,"—It goes from bad to worse with you, Senator Murphy. You are good at fly-fishing—no-one in this chamber argues that. You are probably the champion fly-fisher, Senator. But, frankly, this question? We are providing flexibility to charities—that is what we are doing. This means that pie drives, lamington drives, cake stalls, Christmas cake sales and all of those sorts of things will not come into the system unless the particular charity has a turnover on those projects of over $100,000.

Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
The Bushcare program has been working for the last two and a half years to achieve two key goals of the Natural Heritage Trust—a revegetation rate that is greater than vegetation loss and an improvement in the quality and condition of Australia's native vegetation. It has provided unprecedented support to the Australian community to protect and plant native vegetation.
Halfway through the first phase of the Bushcare Program and the Natural Heritage Trust Partnership agreements it is now clear that to achieve these objectives we will need more effective support by the States for integrated regional planning of natural resource management and control of native vegetation clearance.
Against this background this is an opportune time to review progress, to elicit the lessons learned, and to develop new directions. These longer-term directions will be refined as the Government analyses the findings of the Mid-Term Review of the Natural Heritage Trust in coming months. But to maintain momentum, there are steps that should be taken now to further improve the program:
.	 Effective State based constraints on broadacre land clearing;
.	 Institutional reform to ensure implementation through integrated catchment management;
.	 Building on regional strategies through new `devolved grants';
.	 Establishing new incentive mechanisms such as revolving funds; and
.	 Providing information to communities through the internet.
The Challenge
Australia's native vegetation is one of the richest and most fundamental elements of our extraordinary natural heritage. Native vegetation binds and 
 nourishes our ancient soils; it shelters and sustains native wildlife; it protects streams and wetlands, estuaries and coastlines; it absorbs carbon dioxide and emits oxygen.
Conversely, the depletion and degradation of native vegetation communities threatens the long term health and productive capacity of Australian landscapes. Destruction of native vegetation is the single biggest cause of biodiversity loss;  it is a primary driver of land degradation, salinity and declining water quality;  and it is among the single biggest components of our net Greenhouse gas emissions.
Land clearing is a central issue but there is much more to it than clearing alone.
Clearing is compounded by more insidious, widespread, incremental losses of remnant native vegetation. Grazing pressure, old age, insects, disease, weeds, rising watertables and firewood gathering are undermining the quality of bush remaining in rural landscapes.
Similarly in cities and towns, the precious remnants of native bush are depleted, fragmented and degraded incrementally.
The Solutions
The solutions to the decline in native vegetation cover, and the environmental problems stemming from that decline, are simple:  land clearing should be reduced very significantly;  revegetation of native vegetation communities should be enhanced; and a great improvement is required in the protection and management of the native vegetation which does remain in rural and urban landscapes.
Approach and achievements to date
The Natural Heritage Trust and Bushcare 
The Natural Heritage Trust is the largest investment in the environment ever made by an Australian Government. It is tangible recognition of the fundamental importance of natural capital, which underwrites other forms of wealth.
The Natural Heritage Trust marks the point at which Australia finally started re-investing in natural capital.
Reflecting the centrality of native vegetation management for many environmental issues, the Bushcare program is among the Trust's largest components, with almost $350 million in Trust funding over six years.
Bushcare has an historic and ambitious goal:  to reverse the long term decline in the quality and extent of Australia's native vegetation cover by the year 2001. This goal is pursued through three complementary forms of investment:
.	 Direct investment in on-ground projects at a community level; 

.	 Investment in institutional reform aims to improve decision-making and support for better vegetation management at all levels; and
.	 Investment to build community capacity to improve native vegetation management.
A central feature in the delivery of Bushcare has been the Natural Heritage Trust `One Stop Shop' process. It enables community groups anywhere in Australia to apply for funding through an integrated process, with community-based assessment of their proposals at regional and state levels.
Bushcare has funded more than 1800 projects through the Trust's One Stop Shop, in which it has invested over $127 million to date. About 70% of this funding has been invested directly in on-ground works to improve native vegetation management.
A great diversity of projects is being supported. For example:
In tackling the daunting problem of salinity in the Western Australian wheatbelt, the Trust is funding a project in the North Stirling area to protect 1,700 hectares of remnant bushland, of which more than 300 hectares is habitat for threatened species. More than 330 hectares of revegetation using locally sourced native species has already been re-established, protected by 1,270 kilometres of fencing;
In South Australia, to support the clearing legislation introduced during the 1980s, Bushcare has funded the protection of more than 90,500 hectares of high quality bushland covered by statutory heritage agreements;
Government's effort in urban areas is exemplified by Victoria's Metropolitan Vegetation Works  project which focuses on revegetation activities to prevent land and water degradation in high-priority areas along streams and to create wildlife corridors around greater Melbourne. Bushcare funds are helping 47 community groups to establish 110,000 new trees and shrubs in 27 separate projects.
Building community capacity
Natural resources are sustained or otherwise through the cumulative impact of the countless everyday decisions and actions taken by those with direct responsibility for the land including farmers, indigenous communities, municipalities, government agencies and utility companies. The Bushcare program recognises that attitudes, knowledge, skills and capacities of the people taking these decisions are crucial.
The Australian landcare movement is unique in its combination of grassroots voluntary community effort with technical and financial support from government and increasingly the private sector. Landcare, Bushcare, Rivercare and Dunecare groups are cleaning up the rivers and beaches, stabilising eroding banks and dunes, recreating wildlife corridors and restoring wetlands. They are 
 controlling feral animals and weeds, and putting back some of the vegetation which their forebears, and in some cases they themselves, have removed.
Despite the leap in community awareness over recent years, there remains a great thirst for information at a community level, and for hands-on skills and technical support. There also remain significant areas where the knowledge base is patchy or weak.  Moreover, some of the natural resource management issues Australia faces are of such scale and complexity that it is unreasonable to expect community groups alone to tackle them effectively through small-scale local projects.
The problem of dryland salinity is perhaps the best example. Salinity is a symptom of inappropriate land use and management, often over large areas and long timeframes. Solutions to it are likely to involve far more significant changes in land management practices than hitherto thought necessary.
We can broadly identify that large parts of south-west and south-east Australia require large-scale revegetation to help deal with dryland salinity. There is a large overlap between areas that have been cleared in the past, have moderate to high salinity risk, have potential for commercial reforestation and are in need of revegetation to restore biodiversity conservation values. The design of appropriate incentive structures and integrated program delivery mechanisms involving the community and lifting its levels of participation at the regional scale will be crucial to generate the investment necessary to achieve the scale of revegetation envisaged. In this way regions obtain a more diverse economic base, farmers get an alternative source of income, and Australians get a significant improvement in environmental outcomes.
Broad scale community participation is critical to increasing momentum in the transition towards more sustainable land management practices. Through thousands of local projects, the Natural Heritage Trust has provided extra resources, encouragement and technical support to help community groups to invest in their own natural heritage. Around 60% of Bushcare projects are for less than $20,000 per year, and 75% of Bushcare projects to date are being undertaken by voluntary community groups.
Bushcare has also invested in projects which are national in scope, aimed at enhancing the overall capacity of the Australian community to improve native vegetation management. These strategic national projects include:  FloraBank, which has developed a national framework and protocols for collection, storage and distribution of native seed;  and the new national Atlas of Australian Birds, involving thousands of volunteers generating a national overview and important insights into trends in the quality of habitat across Australia. 

Bushcare-funded research has also enhanced our overall capacity to manage native vegetation more strategically, more effectively, and at less cost. Research projects are giving us a much better knowledge base on issues such as more effective incentives for conservation on private lands; opportunities for local government to conserve native vegetation; legislation in States and Territories that facilitates or constrains conservation behaviour; and potential tax incentives for the protection of native vegetation, to name a few.
Bushcare has also catalysed improved native vegetation management on land managed by Aboriginal people. For example Bushcare funding has enabled the Anangu-Pitjantjatjara Land Management group to institute a program of capacity building for traditional owners. The Community Ranger project is developing a Property Management Planning process that will be used across all Anangu-Pitjantjatjara lands (which make up 14 % of South Australia). The project is currently implementing a program of traditional indigenous land and vegetation management practices, rehabilitating land and controlling feral animals and weeds.
The need for better incentives
Ninety-three percent of the Australian continent lies outside formal conservation reserves. On the vast majority of this land, much of it privately owned or managed, conservation of biodiversity is not the primary land use or management objective. In most circumstances it is not possible to obtain a cash flow from conservation. Further, taking steps to conserve biodiversity on private land often imposes on landholders a direct cost or loss of opportunity to profit. And because many of the benefits arising from the conservation of native vegetation accrue off-site and to the public as a whole, it is often difficult for conservation to compete with other land use options that provide direct economic returns.
As a consequence, conservation remains under-valued and under-provided in the market place in which traditional goods and services are traded.
Governments can support the conservation of native vegetation on private lands through the removal of disincentives and the creation and provision of incentives, to a level commensurate with the public good. Through such mechanisms, the costs of biodiversity conservation and land restoration can be shared appropriately between individual landholders, the local community and society as a whole.
The most common form of incentive used to date has been grants, such as the majority of community projects funded through the One Stop Shop. Other forms of incentives on a more limited scale include assistance for local councils to introduce differential rating schemes, which allow a reduction in, or 
 exemption from, rates payable on land managed for conservation values.
A fine example is the Johnstone Shire Council's Rate Rebate and Conservation Agreement Scheme. This Bushcare project aims to develop voluntary conservation initiatives and agreements with private landholders for all critical habitat areas within the shire. By the end of the project 2000-3000 hectares of critical habitat in the Wet Tropics will have been protected and enhanced. Conservation agreements with landholders are tied to the Shire's planning scheme and involve the rezoning of the area covered by the conservation agreement into a Conservation Zone. Landholders are offered a rebate on the general rates applicable to the allotment, and Council undertakes the rezoning process at no cost to the landholder. Johnstone Shire is committed to continue the program after Trust funding ceases.
The ongoing economic incentive provided to landholders through such schemes is highly symbolic, recognising their contribution to the wider public good. It is also practical in helping to offset  long-term management costs.
A regulatory bottom line
Under the Natural Heritage Trust Partnership Agreements, all State and Territories have committed to prevent any clearing of endangered ecological communities, any clearing which changes the conservation status of a vegetation community, and any clearing which is inconsistent with the sustainable management of biodiversity at a regional scale.
These are impressive commitments, which make an historic pledge to improve management of our natural resources. To further embed these agreements the Commonwealth is working with States and Territories to establish a national framework within which these commitments can be met.
Through the Australia and New Zealand Environment & Conservation Council (ANZECC, the Council of Environment Ministers), the Commonwealth and State and Territory governments have developed a National Framework for the Management and Monitoring of Australia's Native Vegetation . It sets out the national consensus on best practice arrangements in regulation and also planning, incentives, monitoring and evaluation. The framework will encourage cooperation in establishing a comprehensive platform for institutional reform.
But collective action between Governments can take us only part of the way. A clear lesson from the early years of Bushcare is that the national goal of a net gain in the quality and extent of native vegetation cover cannot be achieved in the absence of effective controls on broadscale land clearing in all jurisdictions. This is not something that can be delivered by landcare groups, or bird observers, or 
 committed individual landholders. It is the business of State and Territory governments.
Further actions and new emphasis
Improved regional action through Devolved Grants
Having successfully supported the thousands of landcare groups around Australia to restore and conserve native vegetation, the next great challenge is to assist landholders who are not members of landcare groups to undertake similarly important work. A key vehicle to assist such landholders will be `devolved grant' projects, including fencing incentive schemes and bush corridor revegetation projects. Devolved grants enable a regionally based organisation to administer Bushcare funds to assist many individual landholders to carry out works on their own properties that deliver regional priorities.
For grant recipients, those doing the work on the ground, there is a minimum of paperwork and delay, and funds are available at the time of year most appropriate to the region. These projects are potentially available to all land users, not just the members of landcare groups, and they concentrate the burden of paperwork on the professional staff of regional organisations, rather than on the volunteers who do most of the on-ground work.
For example, Greening Australia is now running a large-scale, Bushcare fencing incentives project in Tasmania, which in its first four months approved funding for more than 155 km of fencing, protecting 1876 hectares over 109 sites. Rather than requiring 109 separate project funding applications, this is a single project which allocates funds at a property level against defined criteria, in return for a management agreement with the landholder.
To date Bushcare has invested about $17 million in focused on-ground works through Devolved Grants. This model shows enormous potential and the Commonwealth will expand upon it. The Natural Heritage Trust Guide to Applications 2000-2001  provides potential new participants with new and additional information on Devolved Grants.
Improved One-Stop-Shop Process
A central feature in our delivery of Bushcare and associated programs is the `One-Stop-Shop' process which enables community groups anywhere in Australia to apply for funding through an integrated process, with community-based assessment of their proposals at regional and State levels. This process has delivered funding to over five thousand projects over the first three funding rounds.
The One-Stop-Shop process is continuously being improved. This year the guidelines for new applications are easier to follow. While keeping the same basic structure that past applicants are familiar with, the new guidelines are shorter and easier to 
 read. They also make it easy for applicants to get help or extra information if they need it.
This year has also seen an improvement in the delivery of cheques to community groups. This has been possible with the commitment and cooperation of all parties. The Government will continue to seek improvement in this area.
But to obtain maximum value for the Government's investment in the Natural Heritage Trust, increased emphasis will be given to funding participants in larger scale, regional projects which are underpinned by integrated natural resource management planning at a scale in which the community is capable of addressing the key issues.
Bush for Greenhouse
Addressing climate change creates profound challenges and opportunities for native vegetation management in Australia. The Government has established the Bush for Greenhouse  program, overseen by the Australian Greenhouse Office. Bush for Greenhouse is designed to facilitate corporate investment in revegetation `sinks' to sequester carbon dioxide and reduce our net greenhouse gas emissions. Delivery of this program is being let through a competitive tender process, the outcome of which I expect to announce over coming weeks.
Limiting the loss of native vegetation will form a critical part of any long-term greenhouse abatement strategy. There are important synergies to be captured between reducing net greenhouse gas emissions, abating dryland salinity, enhancing water quality and improving wildlife habitat at a landscape scale.
Through Bush for Greenhouse and through the development of further policy and program measures, the Government aims to maximise the positive effects of these synergies on Australia's native vegetation.
Bush for Wildlife
Bush for Wildlife  is a new initiative to provide a stronger focus on wildlife conservation through Natural Heritage Trust programs such as Bushcare, Endangered Species, Feral Animals and Weeds.
Through this initiative the Bushcare guidelines now give priority to projects which include a component which protects or restores habitat for endangered native plants and animals.
The initiative is also supporting State based `land for wildlife' schemes. These schemes provide a support base for landholders interested in protecting wildlife on their properties.
Communication
The information technology revolution offers major opportunities to enhance access for the thousands 
 of Australians who participate in Bushcare to the information they need to make their efforts a success. I would like a Bushcare grant applicant, school or community group anywhere in Australia, to be able to use the Trust website for obtaining information such as: recommended species for replanting, habitat requirements for endangered and migratory species, management plans for important wetlands, as well as summaries of relevant Bushcare research projects, best practice information, key contacts and other sources of support.
Work is well underway to enable this in the very near future.
Encouraging Philanthropy 
Community projects funded through the One Stop Shop are critical to providing land managers with the education, information, motivation and resources required to underpin and guide on-ground action and will remain central to the Commonwealth's overall strategy for Bushcare.
There is scope to provide even greater incentives for conservation management on private lands through the tax system, through recent measures to encourage greater corporate and personal philanthropy announced by the Prime Minister on 26 March 1999.
Take the United States. There the private sector invests as much in public benefit nature conservation as the public sector.
Through the Prime Ministers initiative, for the first time donations of property valued at more than $5,000 to any eligible institution, including environmental organisations, will be tax deductible, no matter when the property was purchased.
The Prime Minister also announced gifts donated as part of a deceased estate will be exempt from capital gains tax.
These initiatives build on the $80 million Landcare Tax Rebate introduced through the Natural Heritage Trust and are designed to encourage greater philanthropic investment in the future of Australia's natural heritage.
Revolving Funds
The Commonwealth is committed to the introduction of new revolving funds,  in cooperation with other governments and non-government organisations to enable the purchase of land with high wildlife habitat values and its subsequent resale to buyers committed to management for conservation.
The conservation values of purchased properties will be secured in perpetuity by the placement of a covenant on the title of the land. Resale of the land will enable the capital invested through the Natural Heritage Trust to be revolved to fund further purchases. With appropriate enabling legislation to minimise transaction costs, revolving funds are an innovative, efficient, market-based 
 mechanism through which to provide greater security for conservation values on private lands, at little ongoing cost to the taxpayer.
This proposal is modelled on the highly successful Trust for Nature Victoria, which has been operating under its own legislation since 1972. The revolving fund operated by the Trust for Nature was enhanced significantly earlier this year with a capital injection of $500,000 from Bushcare. Bushcare will facilitate similar initiatives throughout Australia.
Broader Institutional Reform
The next phase of Bushcare will focus on tackling the wider constraints to better vegetation management, and on investing where we can exert most leverage on the policies and practices of the key players in vegetation management. It is about highlighting, extending and improving best practice, not just in vegetation management, but also in regulatory, planning and incentives frameworks across all tiers of government.
Over the last decade there has been a proliferation of regional and catchment-based structures and processes in natural resource management. Many regional/catchment strategies have been and are still being prepared, and are often used as the basis for allocating public resources such as Natural Heritage Trust funds including devolved grants in particular.
However these strategies are rarely reflected in statutory planning or regulations that have legal force. If they do, it is usually with a narrow focus on a specific issue such as water quality.
Australia needs to dramatically improve the effectiveness and integration of its natural resource management planning systems. There needs to be much better vertical integration cascading through statewide or regional planning, and given effect in local planning, zoning and rating schemes.
We also need to deliver better horizontal integration. The management of rivers, catchments, coastlines, vegetation, wildlife, land use and now carbon needs to be addressed as one and planned accordingly. This is both most feasible and most imperative at the regional or catchment scale.
Now is the time for Governments and communities to work together to create much more effective mechanisms for addressing natural resource and environmental management issues of which native vegetation is a vital element. This must happen in an integrated manner and at a scale which is appropriate to the particular issues being addressed. It must also enable community commitment and participation in discovery and delivery of the solutions.
The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act  commences in mid 2000. It will oblige the Commonwealth to pay close attention to matters which will inevitably be the subject of 
 regional strategies and plans. These include matters of national environmental significance such as nationally threatened species and communities of native wildlife; wetlands of international importance; and migratory species protected under international agreements.
A key objective of the Act is to promote a cooperative approach to protection and management of the environment involving governments, the community and landholders. The Commonwealth looks forward to working nationally to enhance the very frameworks within which we manage Australia's natural resources.
A further field of genuinely exciting opportunity involves the potential synergies to be captured between reducing net greenhouse gas emissions, abating dryland salinity, enhancing water quality and improving biodiversity conservation and wildlife habitat at a landscape scale. Full realisation of these synergies may depend on the development of effective markets for carbon and, perhaps, salinity credits to generate some of the required long-term investments. The Government will be working hard to explore and build upon these opportunities.
Conclusion
The overall goal of Bushcare to achieve a net gain in the quality and extent of Australia's native vegetation is a clear on-ground outcome with environmental and sustainable production dimensions.
The first two years of Bushcare have strongly emphasised direct capital investments from the Trust in on-ground vegetation projects, and also the fundamental role of the community in managing native vegetation.
The community-driven elements of the program are now being complemented with a greater emphasis on strategic investment to deliver on key priorities such as reducing land clearing, securing the habitats of endangered and threatened species, and targeting key land and water degradation problems.
Reforms to institutional arrangements capable of influencing all landholders are also progressing well but need to be taken much further.
The institutional arrangements to most effectively deliver investment in landscapes will fully engage community capacity and innovation, be at a scale at which there can be complete integration across natural resource and environment management objectives and have the strong support and engagement of governments at all levels in the form of resources and authority.
The Government will work cooperatively and strategically to achieve this vision as it continues in its unprecedented efforts through Bushcare and 
 the Natural Heritage Trust to reinvest wisely in Australia's natural capital.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Bushcare</title>,Ministerial Statements,16,1,speech

The document read as follows—
SENATE RURAL AND REGIONAL AFFAIRS AND TRANSPORT REFERENCES COMMITTEE INQUIRY INTO COMMERCIAL UTILISATION OF AUSTRALIAN NATIVE WILDLIFE
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE
Recommendation 1
The Committee recommends that the Federal Government investigate the possibility of an experimental management trial, preferably in the rangelands region of Australia. Such an investiga 
 tion should include discussions with officers from all relevant Federal Government instrumentalities (including Environment Australia, Department of Primary Industries and Energy, Bureau of Resource Sciences and RIRDC), wildlife scientists, state government officials and private landowners. Funding for such trials could come from the Bushcare: National Vegetation Initiative program of the Natural Heritage Trust.
Government response
The Government supports in principle the concept of an experimental management trial and will undertake a feasibility study to ascertain the viability of such a trial, as part of the implementation of the National Principles and Guidelines for Rangeland management.
This feasibility study will aim to gain an understanding of social, environmental and economic factors impacting upon and arising out of native wildlife utilisation in rangelands. Key issues which should be foreshadowed within such a study would include: the species most likely to form the basis of sustainable and profitable industries; the management regimes and codes of practice necessary to ensure long term ecological sustainability and long term economic viability and to minimise animal welfare concerns. Key issues would also include marketing, processing and quality control; the range of incentives available to encourage improvements in natural resource management practices; identification of government and other institutional impediments to such changes and the necessary monitoring and evaluation of the impacts resulting from the changes.
Depending on the outcome of the feasibility study, the Government would work with key stakeholders in one or more rangeland regions to develop a detailed proposal for an on-ground trial in a form suitable for Natural Heritage Trust investment. Diversification of land use is consistent with the draft National Principles and Guidelines for Rangeland Management, and enhanced utilisation of native species, in particular native flora, is potentially one way of diversifying rangeland industries, while promoting ecologically sustainable management of environmental and natural resources.
Commonwealth funding for a feasibility study and trial could be sourced from Bushcare and the National Landcare Program, contingent upon the projects being consistent with the objectives of those programs and funds being available. The most productive result is likely to be obtained if a trial were conducted in partnership with State and Territory governments, landholders (including indigenous landholders) and appropriate community organisations.  

Recommendation 2
The Committee recommends that the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee review the effectiveness of programs related to feral animal control in two years time.
Government response
Noted. The Committee has identified that, aside from habitat loss, one of the greatest threats to biodiversity in Australia is the impact of feral animals. The Government has recognised the threats posed by feral animals, and all other invasive species, and is addressing these through programs under the Natural Heritage Trust. The Government considers that any review should encompass all invasive species control programs and recognises that in two years time, more detailed information will be available on various control options and should enable comprehensive cost effectiveness analyses to be undertaken, including with regard to commercial harvesting of pest species.
Recommendation 3
The Committee recommends that the Government monitor the environmental, social and economic impacts of commercial utilisation of wildlife so that a balance sheet can be constructed to assess the full impact of wildlife industries on the Australian economy.
Government Response
Accept in principle. The use of a balance sheet assessment that incorporates environmental, social, and economic impacts of commercial wildlife use could provide essential information for managing industries that evolve from increased access to wildlife resources.
Indicators would be an essential component of a balance sheet approach and would need to be agreed by stakeholders and be consistent with existing initiatives. Governments are currently undertaking work in a number of areas that would assist the development of such balance sheets. This includes the Australian Bureau of Statistics' natural resource accounts, the National Forest Inventory and reporting against the Montreal Process criteria and indicators for forests, State of the Environment reporting and the development of environmental indicators. Using the work already being undertaken could contribute to the development of management regimes that recognise the commercial values of wildlife use and assist in the management of broader biodiversity values.
Recommendation 4
The Committee recommends that the Federal Government investigate ways in which private sector investment in biodiversity conservation can be supported and encouraged. In particular, the Committee draws attention to the model of sustain 
 able use of wildlife as used in southern Africa, whereby in some areas ownership of wildlife is transferred to local landowners, and recommends that the Government examine the appropriateness of such a model to biodiversity conservation in Australia.
Government Response
Accepted. The investigation of increased private sector investment in biodiversity conservation is strongly supported. Systems of management need to be underpinned by analysis of the species concerned, the local environment, determination of the property rights and incentive regimes to support conservation and sustainable use objectives. These will involve investigation of measures to manage risks such as erosion of the gene pool in remnant populations.
Model systems for private sector investment currently exist in industries based on wildlife use, for example, some fisheries management regimes. The development of an access right regime will enable a market to develop for species of commercial value. This will occur through the incorporation of the necessary conditions to ensure an efficient and effective market for the commercialisation. Flow-on implications for other species will also need to be taken into account. Significant benefits to increased biodiversity conservation values could lead to flow on benefits to other species through habitat improvement, increased availability of funds, improved knowledge and incentive mechanisms for sustainable use.
Recommendation 5
The Committee recommends that State and Federal Governments together review all administrative procedures relating to commercial utilisation of wildlife in Australia with a view to increasing their efficiency so as to ensure that there are no unnecessary hindrances to industry.
Government Response
Accepted. A review of administrative procedures under the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports & Imports) Act 1982 is already underway, with a view to eliminating inefficiencies. This review will include consideration of administrative costs and fees charged to the industries, in line with the Commonwealth's policy on cost recovery.
The Commonwealth will continue to work cooperatively with State Governments to streamline administrative procedures relating to commercial utilisation of wildlife. Through relevant Ministerial Councils, the Commonwealth will seek the cooperation of the States and Territories to develop more integrated and efficient procedures in this area. Statutory obligations may also be reviewed, where appropriate, to remove duplication. 

Recommendation 6
The Committee believes that governments should make greater efforts to recognise the contributions made by amateur biologists. The Committee recommends to Federal and State Governments that they review wildlife regulations with a view to facilitating the work of professional and amateur scientists, so that they can actively contribute to biodiversity conservation.
Government Response
The Government is strongly supportive of, and encourages broad community involvement in, all aspects of biodiversity conservation. Through the Natural Heritage Trust, funding and other support is provided for a broad range of activities which target the full range of environmental and natural resource issues facing Australia. Scientific research can have significant long-term benefits to biodiversity conservation, and the government is keen to ensure that professional and amateur scientists can actively contribute to biodiversity conservation. The Government also acknowledges that indigenous people have considerable traditional ecological expertise and that this knowledge should be respected.
Through the Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council , the Commonwealth Government will encourage the States and Territories to review wildlife regulations and amend any that inhibit legitimate scientists and others in the community from contributing to our knowledge of Australia's biological diversity. However, in undertaking such a review it will be necessary to ensure that biodiversity conservation is maintained, access to biological resources is equitable, and that where access gives rise to private benefit, the community receives an appropriate share of that benefit.
Recommendation 7
The Committee recommends that codes of practice relating to wildlife industries should: (1) be in place prior to approval being given for an industry to commence operations; (2) have a clear connection between licensing conditions and compliance with a code of practice so that failure to comply results in a withdrawal of the licence; (3) be consistent between the states; and (4) where several codes apply to the same industry, be consistent between codes.
Government Response
Accepted. It is noted that this recommendation accords with the general thrust of discussions in the National Consultative Committee on Animal Welfare on this issue. The Government recognises that codes evolve over time and that a code introduced at the time of approval of an industry will need to be reconsidered in light of new knowledge, including that gained as a result of the operation of 
 the industry. Codes must also be broadly based so they do not favour or penalise particular industries. It is also recognised that a number of animal use industries are including animal welfare codes into Quality Assurance Programs. This is an effective mechanism to ensure best practice and compliance with codes of practice and will be encouraged.
Recommendation 8
The Committee believes that these factors point strongly to the conclusion that the current prohibitionist policy does not work to protect wildlife from illegal activities, although the extent to which it does not work, is difficult to ascertain. The Committee notes that the Federal Government is currently undertaking a review of all environmental legislation. The Committee recommends that the Government include in that review consideration of other policy options for Wildlife Protection.
Government Response
Accepted in principle. The Consultation Paper on the Reform of Environment Legislation, released in February 1998, included proposals to amend the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982. However, these proposals were not included in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill, pending the report of this Senate Inquiry. The Government has, in its election platform, made a commitment to amend the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982. The reforms recommended by the Senate Committee, including implementing administrative arrangements that protect wildlife from illegal activities, will be carefully considered in drafting amendments to this legislation.
Recommendation 9
The Committee believes that the Government should act wherever possible to support legitimate small businesses in Australia, and therefore recommends that Environment Australia give priority to resolving problems relating to the sale and export of coral and shells, so as to assist industry.
Government Response
Accepted. The Government is in the process of implementing new arrangements for trade in corals and shells. These arrangements will assist the coral industry to legally harvest and export its product, and will substantially decrease the administrative burden on the shell trade without reducing the level of control of the trade in species of shells vulnerable to overharvesting.
Recommendation 10
The Committee recommends a remote Aboriginal community be invited to carry out a trial survey of the levels of subsistence wildlife use, and its impact on biodiversity, supported by a grant through the Natural Heritage Trust. 

Government Response
Considerable work has already been conducted to investigate subsistence use of wildlife, particularly in northern Australia, primarily focused on the identification of utilisation patterns. What is now needed are strategic studies to set utilisation patterns in an ecological context, including an examination of the long term impacts upon biodiversity of various utilisation patterns, and impacts other than subsistence use by traditional communities. It is also desirable to measure the effects on biodiversity of the absence of traditional use. Studies should include analysis of the full economic benefits, and the cultural importance to society of subsistence use. In addition, any study needs to be undertaken with the full cooperation of the community, respecting their rights, and agreement with the community about use of information gained during a study is essential. Commonwealth assistance through the Natural Heritage Trust could be made available for appropriate studies.
Recommendation 11
The Committee recommends that Aboriginal people should be consulted where commercial opportunities are identified on lands where there are communities that have strong traditional links to the lands.
Government Response
Accepted. On lands owned or managed by indigenous communities it is well accepted that any commercial use should occur only after consultation. The Government considers it important to fully involve indigenous communities in any proposals where commercial opportunities are identified on lands where there are traditional links.
Recommendation 12
The Committee believes that the importance of intellectual property rights of Aboriginal people in relation to the use of wildlife has not received sufficient recognition, and the Committee recommends that the Federal government give greater attention to this issue.
Government Response
Accepted in principle. Traditional knowledge of biodiversity has benefited Australian society and continues to do so, but historically, the value of indigenous peoples traditional knowledge could be perceived as having been largely ignored, with the sources of knowledge often not acknowledged, and rarely benefiting. Current intellectual property rights regimes may not offer sufficient protection to the holders of traditional (indigenous) knowledge because the two concepts are largely incompatible under Australian law. There may also be tension between the publication requirements of statutory intellectual property rights and any desire indigenous communities have to keep knowledge secret. 

The Government supports efforts to engage key stakeholders, including indigenous communities, in widespread discussions aimed at resolving this issue. This may include using the intellectual property system to protect traditional knowledge; eg confidential information, protection and recognition through contract law, and the possibilities of developing a new class of proprietary rights, or new classes of transfer agreement.
Statement by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator the Hon Robert Hill, in relation to the Report of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee on `Commercial Utilisation of Australian Native Wildlife'.
I am pleased to present to the Parliament, the Government's response to the recommendations contained in the Report of Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee Inquiry into Commercial Utilisation of Australian Native Wildlife.
I am indebted to the Committee for their significant efforts in providing a constructive contribution to the consideration of this issue. The Committee received over 340 submissions, and took evidence from over 100 witnesses and groups of witnesses at 14 public hearings around Australia. The submissions and evidence presented to the Committee clearly highlight the wide divergence of views within the Australian community about the ethical desirability of the commercial use of wildlife. Despite this obvious lack of a broad consensus amongst Australians, the Committee has developed a series of recommendations that seek to balance the sometimes-competing demands for conservation and ecologically sustainable use of our wildlife resources. The recommendations also seek to streamline government regulation of these activities to make it more efficient and effective.
Not surprisingly, the Report identifies that the future of biodiversity conservation in Australia now depends very much on finding mechanisms to ensure that natural habitat on private land is preserved and restored. Valuing natural habitat as an economic resource will certainly assist it to be fully respected and conserved. It concludes that, if appropriately managed, commercial utilisation of wildlife may be a mechanism of achieving that respect and conservation. This is consistent with the principles accepted by all Governments in Australia through the adoption of the National Strategy for the Conservation of Australia's Biological Diversity in 1996.
The Report also correctly identifies that the challenge for government agencies, entrepreneurs, and conservation groups is to manage wildlife use so as to minimise the environmental risks and maximise the benefits to biodiversity conservation. It notes that proposals for harvesting and ranching of our 
 wildlife need to be considered on a case-by-case basis, and comprehensive management plans developed which take into account a cost benefit analysis of other land uses, and other mechanisms for preserving habitat. In keeping with the predominant view expressed to the Committee, animal welfare considerations must factor highly in any utilisation regime.
One key area highlighted by the Report as requiring attention is the issue of property or access rights to wildlife. It notes a lack of clarity as to what constitutes rights (including indigenous or Native Title rights) in wildlife, and that these rights are in practice difficult to define and are not consistent across Australia. It suggests that by assigning property or access rights, wildlife would become an asset rather than a liability to the landholder, and that if landholders receive a financial reward for living with wildlife and bearing the cost to society of maintaining natural resources this may encourage conservation. This view is consistent with the draft National Principles and Guidelines for Rangeland Management.
The issue of Native Title rights is of fundamental importance in considerations of wildlife use systems. While the scope of every native title right in Australia has not yet been clarified, the Native Title Act 1993 essentially provides a framework for the recognition and protection of native title rights and interests, rather than replacing the common law with some statutory scheme of rights to land. The Government recognises that access, and knowledge and input to the use of resources on the land is important to native titleholders, and agrees with the Committee's recommendation that indigenous people be consulted and given the opportunity to express their views about certain proposed land use activities.
The Report examines a number of established wildlife industries, such as crocodile and emu farming, kangaroo and wildflower harvesting, aviculture and bush food, and makes a number of constructive proposals for their management. It also alerts Governments to the fact that, if the `user pays' principle is not kept firmly in mind, industries based on commercial utilisation of wildlife have the potential to impact on the public sector in high administrative costs. It notes that mechanisms are needed to ensure that commercial utilisation of wildlife does not result in a net economic loss to society, and that there is a need to fully and publicly monitor all costs.
The Committee has made 12 specific recommendations aimed at streamlining government regulation of the commercial use of wildlife and ensuring ecologically sustainable use of our wildlife resources. The broad thrust of the Committee's recommendations is endorsed by the Government and will be achieved through the responses outlined 
 in this document. Implementation of the recommendations will remain consistent with Australia's international obligations under the Convention on Biological Diversity, and also the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.
The Committee has recognised that regulation of wildlife use lies mostly within the ambit of State government control, and that any implementation of its recommendations can only occur with State government cooperation. Through relevant Ministerial Councils, the Commonwealth will encourage the States and Territories, and work with them to implement those recommendations that require cooperative action.
Some of the Committee's recommendations are already being implemented or can be implemented in the near future while others, because of the extent of the work involved in their development and/or higher priorities requiring more immediate attention, are of a medium to longer term nature.
The improvements that will be gained from the Government's response to this report include improved efficiency and responsiveness of operations under the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act, greater public transparency, and ensuring that world's best practice standards and methods are employed in managing the commercial use of Australia's native fauna and flora. The Government has already given an undertaking to review the Wildlife Protection Act to improve its efficiency and effectiveness. The Senate report provides a well-defined framework within which this review will occur.
Through its response to this Report, the Government has demonstrated that it places a high priority on wildlife conservation and on ensuring that it is addressed in a transparent, responsive, efficient and scientifically rigorous way. It has also demonstrated its commitment to improving administrative efficiency and removing unnecessary hindrances and constraints to legitimate industries.
I am confident that the approach outlined in the Government's response will not only maintain our strong record in protection and conservation of Australia's native wildlife, but will also ensure improved protection for those species into the next century.
In closing, I would like to express my gratitude to the members of the Committee for this comprehensive report, and for the insightful comments and recommendations made in relation to wildlife harvesting and regulation in Australia.
I commend this response to the Parliament.

SENATE RURAL AND REGIONAL AFFAIRS AND TRANSPORT REFERENCES COMMITTEE INQUIRY INTO COMMERCIAL UTILISATION OF AUSTRALIAN NATIVE WILDLIFE
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE
Recommendation 1
The Committee recommends that the Federal Government investigate the possibility of an experimental management trial, preferably in the rangelands region of Australia. Such an investiga 
 tion should include discussions with officers from all relevant Federal Government instrumentalities (including Environment Australia, Department of Primary Industries and Energy, Bureau of Resource Sciences and RIRDC), wildlife scientists, state government officials and private landowners. Funding for such trials could come from the Bushcare: National Vegetation Initiative program of the Natural Heritage Trust.
Government response
The Government supports in principle the concept of an experimental management trial and will undertake a feasibility study to ascertain the viability of such a trial, as part of the implementation of the National Principles and Guidelines for Rangeland management.
This feasibility study will aim to gain an understanding of social, environmental and economic factors impacting upon and arising out of native wildlife utilisation in rangelands. Key issues which should be foreshadowed within such a study would include: the species most likely to form the basis of sustainable and profitable industries; the management regimes and codes of practice necessary to ensure long term ecological sustainability and long term economic viability and to minimise animal welfare concerns. Key issues would also include marketing, processing and quality control; the range of incentives available to encourage improvements in natural resource management practices; identification of government and other institutional impediments to such changes and the necessary monitoring and evaluation of the impacts resulting from the changes.
Depending on the outcome of the feasibility study, the Government would work with key stakeholders in one or more rangeland regions to develop a detailed proposal for an on-ground trial in a form suitable for Natural Heritage Trust investment.

I am confident that the approach outlined in the Government's response will not only maintain our strong record in protection and conservation of Australia's native wildlife, but will also ensure improved protection for those species into the next century.
In closing, I would like to express my gratitude to the members of the Committee for this comprehensive report, and for the insightful comments and recommendations made in relation to wildlife harvesting and regulation in Australia.
I commend this response to the Parliament.

"West, Sen Sue",ALP,1999-12-08,"—by leave—I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Estonia and Sweden, which took place from 24 October to 29 October 1999. In doing so, I would like to pay tribute to the members of the delegation: my deputy, Senator John Watson; Mr Laurie Ferguson, the member for Reid; Mrs De-Anne Kelly, the member for Dawson; Mr Gary Nairn, the member for Eden-Monaro; Senator the Hon. Nick Sherry, a senator for Tasmania; and the parliamentary committee secretary to the delegation, Mr Richard Selth, who is from the Senate committee on the environment. This was a short trip of six days in total to the two countries, but it was a very busy, enjoyable and interesting one. It was only the second delegation from the Australian parliament to actually get in to visit the parliament of Estonia—the first one was led by Mr Stephen Martin about four or five years ago—since the recommencement of independence in 1991 following the with 
 drawal of the former Soviet Union from that country.
This was a country that was left rather impoverished by the former Soviet Union and its regime, but the people there are making great strides in their efforts to catch up. They have applied for entry into the European Union. They are one of five countries that are in a group involved in discussions and negotiations that are taking place that may result in their getting next entry into the European Union. They regard that as a very important milestone. They regard having an economy that enables them to make the choice as to whether they become members of the monetary union or not as very important to them as well.
We were extremely honoured in Estonia to be given an audience with the President of Estonia, Mr Meri, and to hear the stories not just of Mr Meri but of other people who had suffered and been incarcerated and exiled because of their opposition to the Soviet regime and because of their great love of and desire for freedom and democracy. Their stories were almost chilling for us, as we come from a democracy where no blood has been spilt and no hardship has been endured to gain democracy, and where we regard elections as a bit ho-hum and run-of-the-mill. For them, an election is very important. For them, democracy is sacred and of the utmost importance.
We also had the honour to be escorted by the Honorary Consul-General of the Republic of Estonia to Australia, Dr Malle Tohver, who spent the time with us when we were in Estonia. We appreciated her making the effort to come back to Estonia to accompany the delegation. One of the highlights was that, as entertainment on the Monday night, they arranged for us to attend a piano recital by Vladimir Ashkenazy, one of the world's noted pianists. It was really fantastic. We were all 
 rather tired and jet lagged but were kept awake by this beautiful music and wonderful pianist. We certainly appreciated the honour of attending that recital.
With a guide, we were able to explore the old town of Tallinn, which is a medieval city surrounded by all the old buildings from the Soviet time, so there is a huge contrast. The weather was cold but the hospitality and welcome were very warm. We certainly appreciated that.
The contrast between Estonia and Sweden is very marked. Sweden is a democracy—it is a monarchy—and has been for many years. It is one of the original democracies. The political system is established and is very much a consensus style of democracy. They regard their style of consensus as very important. We spent a day at the Riksdag, the parliament of Sweden, and observed proceedings of the parliament, as we had done in Estonia. Also, we were able to meet with a number of the parliamentary committees, of which there are many, and hold discussions with them. The amazing thing about both Estonia and Sweden was the very limited use we made of interpreters. The command of English by all members of the committees was high. I think some of them spoke better English than did the Australian delegation.
We did not spend all of our time in Sweden in Stockholm. We went down to Orebro and were able to inspect a lead and zinc mine, Zinkgruvan, owned by North Limited, which is, of course, an Australian company. It was very interesting to see that mine and, for me, to contrast that with the silver, lead and zinc mine at Broken Hill. It is a huge contrast and was very interesting for us all. We also met the Governor of Orebro and had luncheon with her in her castle, which is quite magnificent. She is also a very interesting lady to talk to.
On the final day, we had a half-day trip up to Uppsala, which is the home town of Birgitta Dahl, who is the Speaker of the Riksdag. It was very interesting to see her home area, to visit the university there—it is the major university in Sweden—and also to visit the library and look at some of the original botanical drawings by Solander, who 
 came with Banks on the Endeavour voyages. It was a very interesting time.
We were accompanied throughout by Stephen Brady, the Australian Ambassador to Sweden; in both Sweden and Estonia by Rick Nimmo, who is the first secretary of the embassy; and also by Andrea Gleason from the embassy, who was very much involved with the program for the spouses in Stockholm and the Swedish side of the visit.
I would like to pay a great tribute to our embassy in Stockholm. It is only small but covers something like six or seven countries in that region. From the reception that our embassy officials were getting, it is quite obvious that they work exceedingly hard. They are on top of all the issues and are making sure that Australia's presence is felt and that Australia's point of view is raised. We were certainly able to hold discussions with the two countries about the commitments of other countries besides Australia in East Timor. We should be very proud of the work of our embassy in Stockholm because it is a very hardworking embassy. I commend the embassy staff for the efforts that they made to make sure our trip was very enjoyable.
The report, I am pleased to say, is out in a speedy fashion. I thank Richard Selth for the many hours he has spent on it. I would also like to pay tribute to the hospitality that was extended to us and arranged by the Speaker of the Riksdag and the Speaker of the Riigikogu in Estonia and to say thank you to them for the efforts they made. It was a very enlightening trip. We learnt a lot more about those countries, and I think they learnt a lot more about us. With those remarks, on behalf of everybody I would say thank you for this timely report to the parliament.",SENATE,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,<title>Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Estonia and Sweden</title>,Delegation Reports,20,1,speech
"Woodley, Sen John",AD,1999-12-08,"—by leave—I wish to return to the report of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee on the commercial utilisation of Australian native wildlife. I missed the call by about 10 seconds. If I had continued my tennis on a Thursday morning, I would have made it. That is life, as they say.
I wanted to speak briefly on this report because it is one where the Democrats welcome very much the government's response in this area. I certainly welcome the way in which the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Robert Hill, and his office have dealt with this report and their positive response to it. It is good to work with the government or with anyone in this place when you get such a positive response and a response that is not necessarily political, al 
 though politics play a part in everything. The Senate report's recommendations were taken at face value and were responded to in terms of what was proposed.
The inquiry was conducted over 18 months and took over 300 written submissions. It reported in June last year. The report called for an overhaul of wildlife protection laws, stronger animal welfare codes of conduct and study of indigenous subsistence use of native wildlife. I chaired the committee and it was, at times, a very controversial committee. The report did not please everybody, but it is an ongoing issue. That is why I am very happy to respond to the government's response to this report.
I believe that Australia's native wildlife populations are our most precious assets, but the laws on native wildlife protection across the various states and between the states and the Commonwealth are a dog's breakfast. That has been recognised. I note that the federal government has accepted eight of the Senate report's 12 recommendations. It has not rejected the other four. This is a real chance to fix the problems which the report highlighted. I am glad to say it is one report that has not gathered dust on the shelf but has been responded to in a very positive way. I would like to highlight three of the issues that were raised to illustrate what I am saying.
One of the recommendations was that the federal government should conduct a feasibility study for a trial of large-scale native wildlife farming to see whether large-scale native wildlife farming could replace domestic species in the Australian rangelands. This was a recommendation from Dr Graham Webb of the Northern Territory. I am glad that the government has proposed a series of steps whereby this could be taken up.
Another one of the recommendations was to encourage private sector investment in biodiversity conservation. Senator Lyn Allison from the Democrats has already visited a number of the sanctuaries run by Dr John Walmsley, specifically Warrawong in Adelaide and Yookamurra in South Australia. This has been with the encouragement of Senator Hill so that we can begin to take up that particular recommendation.
Finally, we recommended that there should be inclusion of indigenous people where commercial opportunities related to wildlife were identified on those lands where indigenous people have strong traditional links to the land and also that there should be a discussion of the intellectual property rights of indigenous people aimed at resolving the flaws in existing legislation. In relation to that, there has been the High Court decision in the case of Murrandoo Yanner about his right to hunt traditional animals on his traditional land. That is a very controversial decision of the High Court which highlights the need for the government to pursue this issue.
I am glad that the government has responded positively. I am very happy to receive the government's response. I will have to study it in much more detail. This is an initial response. If I have any criticisms, I guess there will be an opportunity later on to raise those. But my initial response is a very positive one in terms of what was tabled by the minister today.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee</title>,Committees,21,1,speech

The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT,N/A,1999-12-08,—I table the portfolio additional estimates statement for 1999-2000 for the Joint House Department. Copies of this document will shortly be distributed to interested senators. Additional copies will be available from the Senate Table Office.,SENATE,<title>BUDGET 1999-2000</title>,<title>Additional Estimates</title>,Miscellaneous,22,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-12-08,"—Madam Acting Deputy President, during the lunch time debate on matters of public importance I gave notice that I would be tabling 
 a document on my trip to Tibet. I have not had a response from the government on this matter. I will get another report and give it to the government again, but I do want consideration of that document so that I can, if all parties are willing, table it before the day is out.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Tabling</title>,Documents,23,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-12-08,"—Before the debate was adjourned earlier in the day, I was saying that these are good amendments and ought to be adopted. The Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Robert Hill, has indicated that there are difficulties because of the complexity of costing the amendments, which would, for example, extend tax deductibility to any value lost on a property or reasons of covenanting to protect native vegetation and so on. There is 
 also some assessment to be done with the proposal in amendments coming next that the tax deductibility be allowed to be spread over five years. If a donor of a block of land for environmental purposes values that land at $1 million and the land is of high environmental value, it is logical that they get the same benefits as somebody who donates a painting which is worth $1 million. Under legislation, the person who denotes the painting will be able to spread tax deductibility over five years, obviously gaining benefits from that, but the person who donates the block of land—part of the national heritage—will not get that advantage.
Let me reiterate how important this legislation is and my earlier commendation of Senator Hill for bringing it into this place. It is breakthrough legislation, because for the first time it means that a citizen who donates a block of land—which has rare and endangered species or which is of great heritage amenity to the nation—to an entity like the Australian Bush Heritage Fund or the several trusts in various states set up specifically to look after land in perpetuity, with the purpose of protecting an ecosystem or some feature or living entity—wildlife or plant life—will know that it is going to be protected forever. The idea here, to shorthand it, is to ensure that people who make donations towards private national parks where there is a guarantee that they are going to be protected in perpetuity will get a tax advantage from that. Two days ago we were discussing in here and I was opposing a change in the diesel fuel grant system—
—Well done! He is a fast learner.
—The minister will be pleased. I was opposing a change in that system that gives a tax break if you want to put diesel in your bulldozer and go ripping into the forests. How much more important it is from my point of view that we give a tax break to somebody who wants to protect forests and donates land to an entity like the Australian Bush Heritage Fund. I support the amendments, but I am concerned that this process may lead to us seeing, tomorrow, a rejection of these amendments in the Reps—not because they are not meritorious but 
 because the Treasury has not yet worked out how to do the assessments of what this will cost.
Senator Hill has flagged that he has amendments that next year will cover much of this field. Maybe we could hear a little more about what is intended there so that it is on the record and we have some more concrete reassurance that the excellent measures involved in these Democrat and Green amendments are not simply going to be consigned to oblivion. There it is. On the one hand, I do not want to see the legislation fail. On the other hand, I do not want to see the amendments, which obviously have the majority support in this committee, dismissed and put on the sideboard. I think that in the next 24 hours we have to come to a pretty honest arrangement about that so that all interests are best served and, in particular, this breakthrough legislation is not consigned to oblivion. It is too important for that. Once again—it is rare that I am in the position of being able to do this—I congratulate the minister for bringing the legislation forward.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-12-08,"—Following on from the comments Senator Brown has made, I note that he did challenge the government that Senator Hill amplify and clarify his earlier statement. Could the government indicate whether they intend to do that.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-08,"—I believe this matter was extensively discussed and Senator Hill has made a very comprehensive statement. I do not wish to detain the committee; I think we have got a lot on our plate. Senator Hill, to pick up in a sense the spirit of Senator Brown, said:
We think, as I said, that we have made a historic start along this road of encouraging the disposition of property for conservation purposes, and we are prepared as a government to seriously consider other initiatives during the course of next year.
Senator Hill went on to say:
The government's view is that they should be seriously considered during the course of next year—obviously not surprisingly in relation to the cost as well as the issue of effectiveness—and then the government can make a decision as to which 
 further initiatives, if any, it should take, within the budgetary constraints—
I thought I had said something controversial. You made me a little nervous, Senator Brown, as you charged across the chamber towards me. Nevertheless, let me continue. Senator Hill said:
. . . within the budgetary constraints of the government but also with the objective of getting the most effective outcome in terms of conservation for whatever commitment the government might be prepared to make in relation to revenue forgone.
So Senator Hill has made a statement. We welcome the encouraging comments that Senator Brown has made in the sense that that is a very important start, and certainly that is the government's position.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-12-08,"—Just a couple of other matters of clarification: are the remainder of the amendments that the Democrats were having prepared being completed?
—I do not have any others to move.
—So we are just going to deal with the amendments to this particular schedule.
—We are currently dealing with amendments No. 10 on 1669 and Nos 1 and 2 on 1677, which have been moved together by leave. I am informed that No. 10 has been amended. The question is that the amendments so moved be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-12-08,"—I have a quick question for the minister at the table in relation to charitable trusts. I think this is the appropriate time to do so. On what basis can a charitable trust receive gifts for the purposes of the bill? What aspects of the tax act are involved, or are there any rulings that a charitable trust would have to comply with? I would understand this a bit better if the minister could provide me with that information.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-08,"—I am advised that there is no specific reference to charitable trusts in the bill. A charitable trust would 
 have to satisfy the requirements which are set out in the act.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-12-08,"—I thank the minister for that answer as far as it goes, but my question went to what aspects of the tax act, or other rulings that might be relevant here, a charitable trust has to comply with in relation to this issue of a charitable trust receiving a gift for the purposes of this particular bill. I appreciate what the minister has said, but if he could provide a little bit more information to the committee that might be helpful.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-08,"—The gift provisions have various criteria. There is one which relates to PBIs and there are others as well. I do not know that we can be more specific than that. My advisers tell me that we cannot be more specific than that, that they have to satisfy the various criteria; for example, if it was a PBI, the criteria for being a PBI.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-12-08,"—Thank you again, Minister, but if I can put it in my layman's language I am sure this might assist the minister or his advisers. What I would like to know, Minister, is: can a charitable trust—I am using that terminology deliberately because it is charitable trusts that I am interested in—receive a gift deductible donation from a corporation or a company? That is an important issue that I would like clarified before we move to finalise the matter that is before the chair.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-08,"—If it satisfies the criteria in the law, a charitable trust can receive, from my understanding, a gift deductible donation from a company. But it has to satisfy, for example, criteria in relation to being a PBI.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-12-08,"—It does since you have just indicated to me that this is the case. Could you advise the committee whether a charitable trust has to comply with section 23E of the tax act, which deals with the tax exempt status of 
 charitable trusts? That would be useful information for the committee.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-08,"—The mere fact that it is exempt under section 26E does not give it gift deductible status. We are talking about, for example, whether it is a PBI. I gather that is what you are referring to. I can see that we are not making great progress. Are there any matters that you would like to put on notice? I am slightly concerned as we have some specific advisers here but we may need other specialists in tax law.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-12-08,—I indicate to the minister that I think that is not a satisfactory answer to the point I would like to progress but I am advised—as is often so welcomed—by the clerks at the table that this matter might be better pursued a little later in the committee stage debate. I am very happy to accept that and I might come back to this in a short while after the matter that Senator Brown has been progressing is finalised.,SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1,speech

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-12-08,"—Of course that would assist me except that, Mr Temporary Chairman, as so often happens when we are dealing with such matters, my questions are utterly dependent on the minister's answers. But I will do anything I can to assist the minister—well, perhaps not to assist the minister but certainly to assist the committee—in progressing this matter as quickly as possible.
—We would wish to do the same.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-12-08,"—The government has raised issues of costing. Given the earlier debate, the one prior to lunchtime, does the government have any update on possible costings and what it 
 sees as the problem? We have figures from the CSIRO of an approximate cost—something similar to $2 million to $4 million—and I am just trying to pin down the government a bit more about the detail of its concern.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-08,"—I am not sure that I can at this stage assist you further. I was aware there was some extensive debate, if I remember correctly, with Senator Ian Campbell. I do not wish to traverse that area, but we note your concerns. I am not sure I am able to provide you at this stage with any additional costs.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-12-08,"—You are right: it was Senator Ian Campbell and not you. It is was more to the rant end of the argument level.
—Oh!
—I do not want to be harsh at this time of year but it was getting close to that end of the spectrum as a contribution.
—We are all tired and emotional.
—Yes, that is true. But costings is a very serious issue and I wonder if the minister has thought any more about the issue relating to reporting. That would be providing an annual update about which sectors these philanthropic donations are going to go to—education, health and also, in the case of the amendments that we are considering, various donations of land under various covenants. That is an important issue because the costings on this measure under this legislation are $71 million or $72 million—that is a fair amount of money—and it is a broad new principle that the Prime Minister has personally championed and it is important to be able to identify what the value for money is.
So, from a Labor perspective, it is important that we are able to see that X amount goes to education, X amount goes to health, X amount might go to land conservation and are then able to look at the cost in terms of expenditures in the budget. That would be useful for that reason and, secondly, that 
 would be useful from a historical perspective because it would be interesting to just see how much extra philanthropic activity is encouraged by this legislation.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-08,"—In defence of my esteemed colleague Senator Campbell, I thought he was incredibly helpful in the earlier debate. I felt he was almost too helpful, to be quite frank, but that is the character of the man. That is the measure of the man—he just wants to assist as much as he can. We understand that. He is young and enthusiastic, and why wouldn't he be?
—He wants your job too!
—Lots of people want jobs, Senator. Can I make the point that I do not think we can add any further information. Senator Campbell explained that some private research may have been going on, but we have not got any data on it. I do not think the income tax returns are a big help in disaggregating these matters. We understand your interest, but I am not sure that we can provide any further assistance over and above the great assistance that Senator Campbell has already provided.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-12-08,"—I do not want to get into an argument about whether or not Senator Campbell was helpful. The other issue that I raised this morning—and I had thought we might get some progress on it—concerns being able to identify where moneys are going at the moment in the form of philanthropic—we have all struggled to get around this word in its various forms—activity.
—Phil who?
—Keep the mind on the job, Senator McGauran. This is an important question for the opposition. I raised the issue of what occurs in the United States. When organisations receive some sort of philanthropic contribution, the information is readily accessible. The organisations that have received the donations are required by law, as I understand it, to provide that detail publicly if requests are made. I think that is a reasonable approach. It adds to transparency and to the community's knowledge of where the 
 money is going. I also think it would assist in minimising misuse, evasion or tax minimisation schemes that could possibly emerge as a consequence of this approach. Again, I wonder if the government has thought any more about this issue of greater transparency and access to information. It is related to the issue of the tax office doing some sort of examination from its perspective, from a government perspective, of where the money goes to. We are concerned about this issue, and I hope the government is able to respond in more detail than Senator Campbell was able to this morning.
—The question is that the Democrat amendments be agreed to. Those of that opinion say aye—
—Before we proceed to the vote I would just like to know if Senator Brown is going to vote for this amendment. The opposition will be voting for this amendment.
—Yes.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1,speech

Thank you for your advice. These amendments are to remove the $5,000 barrier on the value of gifts whereby, under the legislation, a gift worth more than $5,000 would be deductible but a gift worth less than $5,000 would not be deductible. You will remember that we had a little debate about that this morning, Mr Temporary Chairman. It is a very complex matter.
As Senator Campbell said, to not have some limit would mean that you could laboriously get an evaluation on the cast-off shirts that you put into the box for St Vinnies and have it deducted. Of course, nobody wants that burden put on the tax office. There would be a lot of paperwork, which would become very costly for trivial matters like that. Nevertheless, I think that $5,000 barrier is too high. I understand the complexities, and I think these are less important amendments than the next lot coming up and the ones that we have just dealt with.

Therefore, given what has passed, the Labor opposition will not be supporting these amendments. I am a little surprised that Senator Brown is continuing with them, given the concerns he expressed when we debated the last set of amendments that were moved 
 by the Democrats. I am somewhat surprised that he is going on with them at this stage, given the concerns that he expressed.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-12-08,"—If I can now address the issue that I was progressing before, I think it might be more appropriate to do it here, and I thank again the clerks for their advice on this particular matter. As I understand it, the minister has said that, for the purposes of this act, a charitable trust can receive a tax deductible donation under certain criteria. I assume the certain criteria are those that are set out in section 2 on pages 69 and 70 of the explanatory memorandum. I do not want to put words into the minister's mouth, but I think that was what he indicated previously. I seek confirmation on that.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1,speech

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-12-08,"—I thank the minister for that. That is helpful. I was not clear on whether he was relating this to deductions for gifts to private funds or making this broader. The reason I raise the question, Minister, is that the notorious Greenfields Foundation has been described as a charitable trust by one of the trustees, Mr Bandle. In fact, in a leading Australian newspaper on 23 July 1998, he said:
We are set up as a charitable trust and we have written cheques of approximately $80,000 to charities so far. 

Here we have what is effectively a fundraising arm of the Liberal Party that has established itself as a charitable trust. Obviously, as far as the opposition is concerned, this has some great relevance to section 2. Could I ask the minister in relation to section 2, paragraph 5.29 of the explanatory memorandum—
—Would you mind going back a couple of steps. I was talking to my advisers.
—I was drawing your attention to paragraph 5.29 on page 69 of the explanatory memorandum which talks about prescribed private funds. It says:
Prescribed private fund  is defined in subsection 995-1(1) to be a fund that is prescribed by the Income Tax Assessment Regulations but does not include a fund that is declared in writing by the Treasurer not to be a prescribed fund.
To get some clarity in relation to the Income Tax Assessment Regulations: are they regulations that will be made by you, as the Assistant Treasurer, or will they be made by the Treasurer?",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1,speech

—That advice is being provided. We could move on if there were some other matters that you wish to raise.
—Could you let us know what the advice is?
—As soon as I get it, I will give it to you.
—So you haven't received it?
—We can proceed with these 
 particular amendments and this matter can be further followed while the minister is getting advice.

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-08,"—When Senator Faulkner speaks in these low, hushed and sincere tones in the chamber, we always know that there will be some attack coming. Of course, he has launched an attack, as he always does. I am not an expert on the Greenfields Foundation. I have no particular knowledge of this body, nor of its legal structure. I know that it obsesses you, but it does not obsess me. I am not sure if my advisers have any particular knowledge on it. I think you can stand up and make allegations, because you are fairly good at that. You always come in the chamber and make allegations, not in the sense of ever proving anything of substance but certainly in making attacks and smears. You are probably the world champion in the chamber at that. That is the truth. I just would not like, because we pass through matters, to leave these things on the record.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-12-08,"—That was a most unfortunate contribution from Senator Kemp, wasn't it, Mr Temporary Chairman! That he should respond in that way to some serious questions being raised by a senator in the chamber!
Senator Sherry interjecting—
—I was disappointed, Senator Sherry, to see that he responded in the way he did—not surprised, but disappointed. This is a very important issue, given that the minister has now indicated that the making of these regulations is a matter for either the Treasurer or the Assistant Treasurer, and given that we have a situation where the trustees of the Greenfields Foundation have 
 made absolutely clear in their public comments that the Greenfields Foundation was set up as a charitable trust and also that the Greenfields Foundation has written cheques, at least to the value of $80,000, to charities.
I want to be absolutely assured that the Greenfields Foundation will not be a prescribed fund for the purposes of the act. In other words, I want to be absolutely assured that we do not have donations or gifts provided to the Greenfields Foundation, which is a charitable trust, whereby those donors receive a tax deductibility for those donations and whereby at some time those donations, which are not disclosed, go to the benefit of the Liberal Party. That is my concern. It is my only concern. Senator Kemp, if you can give this assurance in the Senate now, the issue is over as far as I am concerned. I seek a categorical commitment from you, on behalf of the government, that the Greenfields Foundation will not be a prescribed private fund for the purposes of this act.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1,speech

—Order!
—I am not in a position to provide advice about this particular body to the chamber. It would be quite improper of me. You have made some allegations. I do not know the current legal status of the fund. It may be what some people describe as an ancillary fund. For gifts to be tax deductible, an ancillary fund must disburse funds to an entity that in itself is a tax deductible entity. As I have no particular knowledge of this body, and my advisers have no particular knowledge of this body—it does not obsess us the way it obsesses you—I am not able to provide any particular comments on it.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-12-08,"—I am afraid that that is simply not good enough, Minister. The Greenfields Foundation describe themselves as a charitable trust. I am not actually making any 
 allegations. The minister does not understand that there are no allegations being made, but because of the reprehensible behaviour that the Liberal Party and the Greenfields Foundation have entered into over a number of years, I want some assurances from this minister in the chamber today as we debate this bill. If the minister is willing to give those categorical assurances, I have indicated that the matter is finished.
Perhaps the Treasurer could write a letter and make this absolutely clear. I think very many Australians would be concerned if today we find that we are dealing with important legislation in  Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 1999  which leaves another loophole through which the Liberal Party or the Greenfields Foundation—for that matter, perhaps any political party—could do this. Unfortunately it is the Liberal Party that has the form on this. It is the Liberal Party that has used a vehicle known as the Greenfields Foundation. Wouldn't it be a most appalling development in Australian public life if, in the name of philanthropy, the Liberal Party exploited this provision? All I want is to be assured that that is not going to happen.
If you can give that assurance now, Senator Kemp, as the responsible minister at the table in this debate, the matter is finished. That is all I want—an assurance that we are not going to have the Greenfields Foundation, which is a charitable trust, exploit the provisions in the bill in the way that I have outlined. It is very possible, because you have said that a charitable trust can receive a tax deductible donation. That is what you indicated clearly to the chamber. You have told us that; I accept that.
We also know that the Greenfields Foundation is a charitable trust, and I want to be assured that, under the terms of this legislation, the Greenfields Foundation will not be a prescribed fund for the purposes of this act. The reason I want to be assured is that I do not want individuals or corporations donating money or gifts to the Greenfields Foundation and receiving tax deductibility for that, and for this to be effectively a money laundering exercise for the Liberal Party. This would mean that not only would these entities not be 
 disclosed—which of course is the intention and purpose for the establishment of the Greenfields Foundation in the first instance—although they should be if you are interested in defending the integrity of the Electoral Act and of the electoral law in this country, but also the donors would receive tax deductibility.
This is an important issue and I hope that other senators in the chamber share my concerns. I know that in the past Senator Bartlett, on behalf of the Australian Democrats, and Senator Brown have shared the concerns that have been expressed by the opposition. All you have to do is give us an assurance, Senator Kemp. That is all I want: an assurance. If you cannot give it, then I want you to get the assurance from the Treasurer, Mr Costello. If we receive that assurance, I think that will put many minds in the community at rest.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-08,"—This is a fantastic proposition. I am being asked to stand up in this chamber and make comments about an organisation of which I have no knowledge and of which my advisers have no particular knowledge. It would be a very unusual thing for a person to be able stand up and say, regarding this particular object of spleen by Senator Faulkner, that we can give detailed advice. The measures we are considering are important measures. This is an excellent bill.
I have always said that the Labor Party judges the Liberal Party by the Labor Party's own standards. Therefore, people like Senator Faulkner go around seeing great plots and conspiracies—which certainly exist in his own party, particularly in the New South Wales division, which has a singularly unlovely record—and immediately attribute ill motives to the coalition. We just do not accept that, Senator. We do not behave like you do. We are a party that does not go around behaving in the fashion which you constantly try to portray. We are not the Labor Party.
You have concocted all of this, and I do not even know whether this body is a charitable trust or not. It would be a very brave minister who would take your word on these things. Having experienced many selective quotes 
 from you in the past, I can say that it would be a very brave minister who would take anything you say on face value without doing a lot of careful checking; and that is exactly what I would always do with anything you said. But the advice I have is that a trust that donates to a political body is currently limited to $100. That is under the current law. That is the advice I have got.
Senator Faulkner interjecting—
—Yes, but the huge scenario you have concocted is that people will be receiving considerable tax deductions and that this particular body can then make large donations to the Liberal Party. I am just pointing out to you that the advice I have from my advisers is that such a donation would be limited to $100.
—What about loans?
—Senator, you want to waste the Senate's time. Senator Faulkner, you have this obsession because you think that we are like you. We are not; we are quite different. We actually act in an ethical fashion.
With this whole scenario that you have built—all these questions and all these points of attack on the Greenfields Foundation—a trust is limited to a donation to a political party of $100. That is an exciting scenario, and that is the advice I have from my tax experts.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-12-08,"—Let us be charitable. Let us assume that Senator Kemp—because of incompetence, not deliberately—fails to understand the significance of this issue. I am actually not making any allegations here. All I want is a commitment from Senator Kemp, and if I receive the commitment we can close the book. But, you see, in the Financial Review  of 23 July 1998 Mr Bandle, one of the Greenfields Foundation trustees, said:
We are set up as a charitable trust and we have written cheques of approximately $80,000 to charities so far.
They have been described as a self-confessed charitable organisation for some time.
What I am interested in progressing is the question of donations to the Greenfields Foundation itself. It is the minister who said that a charitable trust like the Greenfields Foundation can receive a tax deductible donation or gift. It is the minister who said that to the committee. I am not making this up. If he is wrong, just correct the record and that is fine; we will get on with it. Let me read again what 5.29 says in the explanatory memorandum:
Prescribed private fund is defined in subsection 995-1(1) to be a fund that is prescribed by the Income Tax Assessment Regulations but does not include a fund that is declared in writing by the Treasurer not to be a prescribed fund.
That is all Mr Costello has to do, and perhaps, if he would leave such an important task to Senator Kemp, Senator Kemp would have to do it on his behalf. It says:
. . . does not include a fund that is declared in writing by the Treasurer not to be a prescribed fund.
If the commitment is given that the Treasurer will make this matter clear, that is all the committee needs to hear. That is the assurance that I want—either a categorical assurance from the minister in the terms that I have asked for it  previously or an assurance that such a document in writing will be forthcoming from the Treasurer in relation to the Greenfields Foundation. If that is received or that assurance is given, then I am sure the committee will be satisfied, at least on this point.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-08,"—Senator Faulkner, I do not wish you to keep on perhaps giving a misleading approach to the Senate. I said a charitable trust which satisfies the gift provisions. I think that is somewhat distinct from the comments you made to the committee. Let me just quote from the EM. It says on page 69:
Schedule 5 to this Bill amends section 30-15 of the ITAA 1997 to allow deductions for gifts made to specified private funds from 1 July 1999. This is achieved by extending the application of item 2 in the table to prescribed private funds [items 6 and 26]. Item 2 of the table deals with gifts to public funds established and maintained under a will or trust . . . for: 

the purpose of providing money, property or benefits to a fund, authority or institution covered by Subdivision 30-B;
This goes to the nub. If a political party is a body, how much money can be given to such a body? The advice that I have been given is that it is limited to $100—and this is causing such huge angst for you, Senator Faulkner. If you have alternative advice, let's share it.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-12-08,"—I do not want to take up a lot of time, as I would like to at least progress through this legislation today, but I thought it might assist perhaps both sides of this if I made a brief contribution to try to avoid us getting into an escalating war between the two large parties in this place about who is the most unethical in their behaviour in fundraising, et cetera and get back to the question that is being raised, which I think is a reasonable one for Senator Faulkner to raise. As I see it, the issue is not so much about how much tax deductibility a particular foundation might be able to get if they give money to a political party but that people who give money to that foundation may be able to claim substantial tax deductions.
Perhaps we could move away from the Greenfields Foundation and Senator Kemp could think of it in the context of perhaps the Labor Party being back in office and having the `Redfields Foundation' established and using it in ways that he might be concerned about. If that foundation is able to be a prescribed foundation and receive donations of property or whatever from the public, then those people who give those donations will be able to claim tax deductions for it. If I understand it correctly, that seems to be the concern that Senator Faulkner is raising. The concern is that this may provide—forget about the Greenfields Foundation—a foundation that is deliberately set up as a front to channel donations to any political party, if they can be prescribed as a private fund under regulations, a publicly subsidised opportunity for increased donations to that foundation.
—And the donations aren't disclosed either, Senator.
—There are flow-on problems of non-disclosure or adequate 
 disclosure of donations, but that is perhaps a matter for electoral law. What I would be interested in the minister addressing is whether or not any foundation that achieves the status of `prescribed private fund' can then operate in that way.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-08,"—It has to disburse its funds to organisations listed in 30-B.
—How?
—In order to retain its status it has to distribute funds to organisations listed in 30-B. My advice is that political parties are listed in 30-B but the maximum deduction is $100. If your advice is different to that, Senator Faulkner, you should stand up and say that the advice that you have is different. If your advice is the same, your whole argument is seen to be a nonsense. What we need you to do is provide your advice. That is the advice that I am receiving from the tax office. It is not a matter of setting up fronts or anything else; it is a matter of being an organisation listed under 30-B. That lists a whole host of organisations and there are particular criteria applied, and to political parties it is $100. If Senator Faulkner thinks that is not correct, I think he should stand up and say it. That is the advice that I am getting from my people.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-12-08,"—The best thing I can do to try to assist the Assistant Treasurer, who desperately needs it, is to seek leave in a moment to table a couple of documents that might assist him. The first one comes under the letterhead of the Greenfields Foundation. It is signed for the trustees by Mr Tony Bandle.
—Are you going to deal with this bill and the $100 issue?
—I have dealt with that a number of times, and I will come back to it to try to explain it to you.
—You have not dealt with it; you have not dealt with it once.
—Let me just quote one sentence:
The Foundation has not and cannot make payments to political parties—this is prohibited by its deed. 

So do not start talking about $100 donations or any other form of donation. The Greenfields Foundation claims—take my word for it—let me quote again:
The Foundation has not and cannot make payments to political parties—this is prohibited by its deed.
Those are their words. I will be seeking leave to table that in a moment. Recently the Greenfields Foundation—on its letterhead, C/- Post Office Box 52, Deakin West, ACT—under the signature of Mr Anthony J. Bandle for the trustees, wrote another letter to the Australian Electoral Commissioner. They are getting into deeper water here all the time. Senator Kemp might not know that but I think a lot of other Australians do. They wrote this letter to the Electoral Commissioner, and one of the paragraphs said:
Your letter appears to assume—
this is from the Greenfields Foundation to the Australian Electoral Commissioner, `your letter' being the Electoral Commissioner's—
that the obligations of associated entities extend to the Trustees of the Foundation. However, that assumption is based on a misconception as to the purposes of the Foundation. The Foundation is a Trust Fund, established for charitable purposes, administered by the Trustees.
That is what they claim to be—a charitable trust: `A trust fund established for charitable purposes administered by the trustees.' These are not my words; these are the words of Mr Bandle for the trustees. So what we are dealing with here, to try to explain this to you, Senator Kemp, is a foundation called the Greenfields Foundation which, to get around the disclosure provisions in the Electoral Act, has loaned to the Liberal Party on the most generous of commercial arrangements a very large amount of money. It has also donated to charities a very small amount of money. So it is not making direct donations—as you and I would understand the dictionary definition of `donations'—it is loaning massive amounts of money to the Liberal Party. That is the way it tried to get around the disclosure provisions of the act. That is why what you are saying is a total and absolute nonsense. Perhaps you might now understand that particular point.
But let us go on. What I am concerned about is the capacity for either a private individual or a corporation to provide a donation or a gift to the Greenfields Foundation and for that organisation or private individual to be able to benefit under these provisions as a prescribed private fund not only to cover up the fact that it has made the donation but to actually receive tax deductibility for the donation. That is the issue. The more I hear Senator Kemp respond, the more I become worried that there is something here to cover up. First of all, what I came in here to do, you would be interested to know, Mr Temporary Chairman, was to get an assurance from this minister. But, of course, it has not been forthcoming. It is hard to believe the minister could be as dopey as he is, trying to pretend to the committee that he does not understand either the bill that he is responsible for shepherding through the committee today or the electoral law in this country.
That is the issue. It is on that issue that I want to receive a commitment from the minister at the table because the Greenfields Foundation says it is a charitable trust, and that means—and the minister made it absolutely clear—that it can receive tax deductible donations. All I want to do is ensure that the Treasurer, who can quite clearly declare in writing the Greenfields Foundation not to be a prescribed fund for the purposes of the act, will do so. All I want to hear is that the Treasurer will do so, so that we do not have a further effort from the Liberal Party of Australia or any of these shonky, dodgy front organisations, like the Greenfields Foundation, to subvert the disclosure provisions of the Electoral Act. It is easily done. 
The Treasurer can declare in writing in relation to the Greenfields Foundation that it is not to be a prescribed fund. That is all that has to happen. If the minister at the table will give that commitment and if we see that from Treasurer, it will certainly satisfy me. And from the spirit of what I heard from Senator Bartlett, who is engaged in the debate, I assume it would satisfy him also, who nods. That is all you have to do, Minister. If you can do that, we can get on with it.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-08,"—We have just had another pathetic rant from the discredited Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. Senator Faulkner reflected, I regret to say, on my intelligence. This is the former environment minister who single-handedly lost the environment vote in 1996—and I say this advisedly because there are people in the chamber who would know that what I say is correct. Senator Faulkner was such a political genius that, as the Labor environment minister, he single-handedly lost the environment vote. There is no other environment minister, I believe, who can claim such a record. This is the person who reflects on the intelligence of others. It is an extraordinary story. One of his responsibilities as a minister was the forest debate. You would remember the farce in this chamber—
—Order, Minister. What you are saying is not really relevant.
—I will just make the point that he did such a terrific job on forests that he was removed by the Prime Minister. He was not to deal with forests.
—On a point of order, Mr Temporary Chairman: you did point out to Senator Kemp that his comments about forestry were not relevant. Clearly, they are not and you were spot on. Then he continued to wilfully ignore your ruling.
—Senator Sherry, you should not make a statement. Do you have a point of order?
—The point of order is relevance.
—You do have a point of order.
—The minister should get back to the issue and stop wasting time.
—We are seeing another massive waste of time, and I hope that tomorrow in the debate we will not get the Labor Party talking about how restricted the debating time is for all these bills, because you have wasted most of the afternoon. This has been another big Labor effort to waste most of the afternoon by a failed minister who was 
 removed from a central part of his job by Mr Keating. For a minister who single-handedly lost the environment vote to stand up and reflect on others is quite appalling, in my view. I do not accept that at all.
I have received some very marginally revised advice from my advisers that in fact political parties are not subdivision 30-B funds. A private fund could not even donate $100. I hope that clarifies the record. My understanding is that, in relation to any prescribed agency, this will require a regulation which is tabled in this parliament and subject to disallowance by this chamber. We have had this huge rant and rave and the usual effort by Senator Faulkner to slander people. He is truly the limbo champion of the Senate: no-one can go lower than Senator Faulkner, in my view. Let us construct this huge hypothesis that Senator Faulkner has marched into the chamber and said that this is so critically important we have to delay the committee for an hour. Will you provide, in writing, information about an agency of which I have no particular knowledge and nor do my advisers? The central fact which Senator Faulkner did not understand was that for the Greenfields Foundation or for any other body to become a prescribed agency will require a regulation and this can be disallowed by the Senate.
We have wasted the time of this chamber. No-one—and above all you, Senator Faulkner—when we are rushing to get through bills tomorrow should dare to complain about delays in this chamber. You have wasted an afternoon.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1,speech

—No-one more than you!
—I think we all know what we are dealing with, Senator Kemp. The minister has now caught up with the play and understands that this requires a 
 regulation. Can we have clarification from the minister: will the regulation name individual private prescribed funds or will it have categories of private prescribed funds? Could you provide that information for us?",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-08,—I have checked with my advisers. The Hansard  will show whether you mentioned that they will require regulation. I don't think people can remember it on this side. You may have said it; you may not have said it. We will all check the Hansard  to see whether this is another effort by Senator Faulkner to mislead the Senate—it may not be. I am a reasonable man. He has had such a record of misleading the chamber that nothing would surprise me.

—No, I am not taking a point of order. I am asking a question. But I will not question him further, because he will get distracted.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1,speech

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-12-08,"—I thank the minister for providing that advice and the advisers for informing the minister what the process would be. Does this mean that there will be—I expect this to be the case—a range of prescribed private funds all contained in the one regulation, or would there be separate regulations in relation to prescribed private funds? I can see a way around this. If the minister is willing to give this commitment, again, we can move on.
Is the minister willing to give a commitment to the Senate here that the Greenfields Foundation, if it is to be a prescribed private fund, will be regulated for separately out of 
 a category of other prescribed private funds? I assume that there would be one regulation; that is why I ask the question. Is there to be a separate regulation in relation to the Greenfields Foundation? If that is dealt with separately, it obviously gives the Senate the capacity to disallow such a regulation without affecting other prescribed private funds.
Is the minister willing to give that assurance now? I do not know what the Treasurer intends to do in relation to the Greenfields Foundation. That is the point I have been trying to make now for quite some time; it appears to have fallen on deaf ears. Can the minister assure the Senate that a separate regulation will be brought down for the Greenfields Foundation? Is there to be such a regulation for the Greenfields Foundation? In other words, is the Greenfields Foundation to be prescribed by the income tax assessment regulations?
If it is a separate regulation, that gives the Senate the capacity to deal with it. Obviously Senator Bartlett and perhaps Senator Brown might have a view on this. That seems to me to be a sensible way of proceeding in the circumstances. If the minister is willing to give that assurance, we can move on. Again, one tries to find ways to assist the minister and the government in this. That is probably the best I can do.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-08,"—That is the best that Senator Faulkner can do by trying so hard. Let us summarise where the debate is at. A regulation is required. The regulation is disallowable by the Senate. I am not in a position to describe how the regulations will be brought in. I am also not prepared to discuss a particular fund. I know nothing about this fund. I also do not accept the innuendo with which Senator Faulkner so freely and fulsomely litters his arguments. If the Senate does not like a  prescribed agency, it has the capacity to disallow the regulation.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-12-08,"—That is a very disappointing response from the minister. I will try to explain the situation that we face here. The minister has indicated that a charitable trust can receive a 
 tax deductible donation. In order to assist, I seek leave to table a letter from the Greenfields Foundation.
Leave not granted.
—This minister appears to be either unwilling or unable to assist the committee make some progress in this matter. The minister does not want a letter tabled for his benefit which goes to the point that I have been outlining about the Greenfields Foundation's description of its own activities. These are not my words about the Greenfields Foundation; these are its own words. I quote from this letter directly:
The foundation is a trust fund established for charitable purposes administered by the trustees.
That is what the trustees themselves say on their own letterhead in a letter dated 15 January 1998 and sent to the Electoral Commissioner.
That has been reinforced in a range of other publicly available documents by the trustees of the foundation. It has also been a matter about which the trustees have speculated publicly. One trustee, Mr Bandle, is quoted as saying that the Greenfields Foundation is set up as a charitable trust. That is one reason why this organisation has raised so many concerns in the public arena.
We know that the Greenfields Foundation is a charitable trust; it says so itself. We know that there is now a capacity, if this bill is passed unamended, for a prescribed private fund to be prescribed by the income tax assessment regulations. This will mean that there will be tax deductibility for donations and gifts for such organisations. I am concerned about that. It offends a number of very important principles that I think are matters of great concern for the chamber.
I have sought a categorical commitment from the minister to try and get over this problem. I have sought a categorical commitment from the minister that the Greenfields Foundation will not be a prescribed fund for the purposes of this act. I have sought confirmation from the minister in those terms—he would not give it. I have tried to seek confirmation from the minister, given that we are aware that either the Treasurer or the Assist 
 ant Treasurer would have to regulate. I asked him a question about that, though he claims I did not raise the issue of regulation. I asked him who would regulate and he indicated to us that either the Treasurer or the Assistant Treasurer would make the regulations in this regard. He has forgotten that, but that is all right. We know he is a bit off the ball on some of this stuff.
We also know that the Treasurer can declare in writing that a fund like the Greenfields Foundation not be a prescribed fund for the purposes of the act. If we got that commitment, we could move on. The Assistant Treasurer would not give that commitment. We made it clear to the Assistant Treasurer, eventually, after some time behind the play on the bill—and I think it was understood—that the prescribed funds, the charitable trusts in this instance, would be identified by name in a regulation. I suggested we have a separate regulation for the Greenfields Foundation so that if it was regulated under the Income Tax Assessment Act regulations, then that could be disallowed by the Senate. Again, it was just another way of moving on.
How many times do you have to offer the Assistant Treasurer a bit of help? How can you help someone who appears unable to help himself? These offers have been made. The Assistant Treasurer, on behalf of the government, is willing to accept none of them. It is very difficult to come to any other conclusion than that the government's intention is to try and shonk its way through in relation to the Greenfields Foundation and to allow a vehicle for either private individuals or major corporations or companies to provide donations to a shonky organisation like the Greenfields Foundation. The donors themselves receive tax deductibility and, of course, there is no public transparency in this. There is no disclosure of those donations and the donors get tax deductibility. That is not good enough. No-one who would defend the integrity of either our electoral laws or our tax laws could accept such a situation.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-08,"—I do not want to detain this stage of the committee any longer. 
 Senator Faulkner has already wasted most of the afternoon building this enormous construct over some particular angst he has with regard to a particular body. The comments he made were, as usual, laced with errors, as we have come to expect with Senator Faulkner. We all know that his political judgment, when it comes to the count, has always been rather poor. That is the reason he is in opposition. That is the reason key responsibilities were removed from him when he was environment minister. That is the reason he lost the environment vote. The truth of that matter is that this guy has got form.
Let me get a couple of things on the record so that Senator Faulkner and maybe his advisers can be assisted. The mere fact that a trust calls itself a charitable trust means nothing in terms of whether gifts to the trust are tax deductible. It must satisfy the gift provisions in division 30. I understand that Senator Faulkner, having wasted our afternoon, has decided to walk out of the chamber. Why wouldn't he? Tomorrow he has to build the argument that somehow we have not got time to consider the legislation which is coming through.
He has wasted this whole afternoon on a total nonsense about a particular body which may well call itself a charitable trust. Just to repeat myself: a body calling itself a charitable trust means nothing in terms of whether the gifts to the trust are tax deductible. I know nothing about this particular body. I have no information on it. We have had a total waste of time this afternoon. If Senator Faulkner was so worried about it, the truth is that to determine a prescribed agency requires a regulation to be brought in, and a regulation can be disallowed.
We have wasted all of this afternoon. Let us say that the paranoia of Senator Faulkner has some particular merit in the sense that perhaps someone will try to prescribe an agency which he does not like. The facts of the matter are that it comes before this chamber in a regulation and it can be disallowed. That is what we had all of this big debate about this afternoon. We had time wasting and an attempt to table documents. It was a total construct and a total farce. It shows you 
 why the Labor Party is so hopeless. It is so hopeless that rather than Senator Faulkner getting down to do some decent policy work, the man cannot climb out of the gutter. That is the problem. The man cannot rise from the gutter. We have just seen another example of the way Senator Faulkner goes on in this chamber.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-12-08,"—There are a couple of points that should be made about Senator Kemp's contribution. It was the opposition's hope that we could have finished this legislation some time ago. Senator Faulkner, my colleague and leader, raised a legitimate concern about the possible misuse to which this particular piece of legislation can be put.
It is not just a concern about Greenfields, it is a concern about any political party that could set up an organisation like Greenfields and then use the provisions of the act. It is not a matter of Greenfields or any organisation like Greenfields simply making donations to a political party. The matter is—and in the case of Greenfields we know that loans were made—that we do not believe that these sorts of contrived arrangements are appropriate, and it is not appropriate that they are being rewarded as a result of this piece of legislation, which is purportedly to encourage philanthropy. That is one of the points that Senator Faulkner was making. I do not believe Senator Kemp knows anything about Greenfields or Greenfields-type operations. I accept his word at face value on that.
—You are just wasting time.
—Senator Kemp, you know you should not interject except from your chair.
—Here is the minister, arrogantly making contributions while he is walking across the chamber—totally disorderly. Minister, we want—
—Please direct your comments to the chair.
—Mr Temporary Chairman, we want assurances from the minister and the government that this sort of operation cannot occur within the ambit of this legisla 
 tion. The minister has claimed he knows nothing about the Greenfields-type operation. I accept that at face value. He claims his advisers know nothing about the Greenfields-type operation. If they do not know anything about it—and I accept that at face value—go away and find out. We will have time to deal with this issue; we are not going to conclude it tonight, that is obvious, because you cannot give us the assurances we require—
—Just wasting time.
—We need to know that this legislation is not going to be misused, and you have failed to give us those assurances.
On the issue of regulation, the Labor Party is not going to be placed in a position where we have a list of organisations that are subject to disallowance with us having to disallow all of them in order to disallow one. That would obviously place us in an invidious position—and why should we be placed in that position? We want the Senate to have the capacity to disallow one of the organisations if we believe that it does not fit the stated aims and intentions of encouraging philanthropy. This is a very important issue.
I would suggest that the minister, the advisers and the Treasurer turn their attention to this matter overnight so that it can be resolved, because we do not want to hold up the committee stage. But this is a concern we have that the minister has failed to satisfy us on. We should not be seeing, in the guise of philanthropy, fancy ways of obtaining significant deductions at public expense in order to pass it through to political parties. That is not the intention of this legislation. I am confident that we can come up with a solution to this particular problem. Perhaps the Assistant Treasurer could have suggested we adjourn our consideration of these particular amendments, and we might have been able to work out some solution to the logjam that we are now faced with.
In concluding, Senator Faulkner was not raising allegations. He was drawing to the attention of the Senate and the government a legitimate concern about what is clearly now a subterfuge—a contrived entity to avoid the electoral laws by Greenfields. Senator Kemp 
 might not want to recognise that this has occurred, but it has occurred—the Australian Electoral Office has investigated the matter and has said that it has occurred. We are not making allegations about members of the Liberal Party or of this legislation being used to subvert the electoral law, but we want assurances that this cannot happen.
Our reading of the legislation, as it is presented to the Senate, is that there is a significant possibility that a subterfuge can be entered into with respect to Greenfields-type organisations. Labor believes that no political party—the Liberal Party, the Labor Party, the Democrats, the Greens—should be able to enter into those sorts of contrived arrangements in the name of philanthropy. This legislation is all about encouraging philanthropy in areas such as health, education and, with the passing of the earlier amendments in respect of encouraging environmental protection through various mechanisms, environmental protection for land in this country. That is what philanthropy is about.
It seems to me that, if the government is fair dinkum about its approach, it would be very happy to give us the assurances we have been seeking and to agree, if it cannot give the assurances, to get the appropriate advice and to agree to an amendment to assure us that the type of scenario that Senator Faulkner has outlined cannot occur. I am sure that Senator Kemp's approach and that of the advisers with him is that they do not intend operations like Greenfields to come within the ambit of this legislation. I am not so sure about some of the other people in the Liberal Party hierarchy. But this is our major concern. It is an issue that has come to light in the course of this debate, and these matters should be addressed. This is what the Senate is for; it is for looking at these sorts of issues and dealing with them.
As I say, it is regrettable that the minister has not been able to satisfy our concerns about what is a very fundamental issue: attempts to circumvent the electoral laws of this country. It is perfectly legitimate and I believe in the public interest for Senator Faulkner to be raising concerns of this type. The last thing I think the Prime Minister 
 would want, with his stated goal of encouraging greater philanthropy, is this bill and the outcome of this bill getting caught up in some sort of controversy over political donations. I really cannot understand why, if the minister cannot give us the assurances, we could not have moved on. He could have obtained some advice and we could have resolved this behind the scenes and not wasted a great deal of time, instead using the time more effectively and efficiently in dealing with other provisions of this bill or other pieces of legislation. I believe that our concerns should be satisfied. They have not been satisfied to date, for the reasons that Senator Faulkner and I have briefly outlined. These concerns should be satisfied.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 8) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Quirke, Sen John",ALP,1999-12-08,"—Mr Temporary Chairman—
—What a waste of time.
—Well may you laugh, Minister. I think it should be said here quite clearly at the outset that what is emerging in this debate is something of considerable importance.
—The amendment is not ready. You are wasting time.
—You say it is a waste of time. Let me tell you that there has been a lot of wasted time around this place, a lot of it over the Greenfields federation or whatever it is called, that has filled your coffers with money and got your people elected to this place. You have gone in there and you have taken money in some of the worst rorts that this place has seen, and you have resisted every effort to clean them up. What is happening now is that this is being exposed. We will process this either when we get answers to our questions or when this bill is amended in such a way that we will not have to deal with it.
—Look serious.
—I am very serious, because in fact what happened with that whole Greenfields rort that you people over there were so fond of was that millions of dollars went into the coffers of the coalition and that money was used for electoral purposes. It was an utter disgrace the way that 
 got around the electoral laws in this country. This afternoon we are seeing in this bill the provision for the same stuff all over again. When we are assured, when we have answers to our questions or when this is suitably amended so that we do not see these sorts of provisions again, we will proceed with it. But we are not going to see this go through so that more Greenfields foundations can mushroom up around the countryside and can launder money for the coalition. In this chamber we have repeatedly tried to do something about that.
The fact of the matter is that the electoral laws have not, as I understand it, totally closed up that loophole, and what we are likely to see here is a loophole so big that one of Senator Ian Macdonald's large trucks can go through it. We want to make sure that is not going to happen. So, Minister, what we would like from you is a categorical assurance here, not `We don't know' or `We don't understand where this is going' or `We will give you an answer in the fullness of time'. There are enough advisers over there who ought to be up to looking at this matter. Or you can do what happened earlier today. As I understand it, all of a sudden the superannuation bill just disappeared out of here; it just went. All of a sudden we were on other legislation because the government wanted to sort something out. Well, you can do exactly the same on this. Through you, Mr Temporary Chairman: we make it crystal clear to the government that we want answers to this. Either that or we will try and see that this is amended to make it a decent and workable proposition. Minister, instead of your walking around the place like a cat on a hot tin roof, we would like some answers.
—Update: the amendment has been withdrawn.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-12-08,"—I understand that there is some commonsense emerging—
—Except with Senator Kemp. 
—Exactly. That is the point I was going to go on to make. While Senator Kemp has been parading around the chamber making various accusations, I understand there is some arrangement being worked out that will enable us to try and deal constructively with other business whilst this matter can be examined more fully.
—Like superannuation.
—That is right.
—Superannuation is not the business before the chair at the moment.
—That is right, and I hope we can move on to it shortly. But it is an indication of the difficulties the government program has encountered when we could have finished that bill this morning but could not go on, regrettably, because Senator Kemp had to pull the legislation off. But I do understand that the Manager of Government Business, Senator Ian Campbell, is dealing with the matter. I hope he is dealing with it effectively so that we can positively use our time over the next half an hour or so, whatever the parliamentary secretary as Manager of Government Business has in mind. Certainly the Labor Party is willing and happy to go on to other business and squeeze a little more time out of the evening to deal with other legislation, if that is the intention of the Manager of Government Business.
What has occurred is unfortunate. We have endeavoured to be as cooperative as we can in dealing with matters as expeditiously as we can. Unfortunately, we could not get clear, precise, concrete assurances from the minister and apparently from his advisers. That is regrettable, but I am sure we can deal positively with some elements of legislation remaining in the time available tonight to maximise utilisation.

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-08,"—I will make a few observations on the debate on Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1999 . 
 Senator Bartlett, your voice was a little bit quiet but I assume that you have withdrawn your second reading amendment.
—Yes.
—Thank you. There have been a number of contributions from senators. The new superannuation investment rules were announced in the 1998-99 budget. The investment rules are designed to reduce risk to superannuation savings and to ensure that superannuation is preserved for retirement. The bill will ensure that the fundamental principle that superannuation funds cannot borrow is maintained. This serves to limit the risk to superannuation savings from geared investments and will also ensure that superannuation savings are used for retirement purposes. In doing so, the bill will benefit the community as a whole by ensuring that billions of dollars of superannuation tax concessions provided each year are used for their intended purpose, thereby reducing the burden on future age pension outlays.
An important aspect of the bill will be to enhance the ability of small business owners to use their superannuation savings to invest in their own premises by allowing a small superannuation fund to invest up to 100 per cent of its assets in business premises that are leased to members or to the employer sponsor of the fund. The bill contains a number of transitional arrangements to assist superannuation funds in adapting to the new arrangements. The government has consulted with key industry and professional groups on the bill. The bill was referred to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services, which reported on 25 November 1999. After careful examination of the report, the government has decided to respond to some of the issues which have been raised.
Firstly, on non-geared trusts: a number of groups such as ASPA have argued that, while the broad thrust of SLAB4 is appropriate, there should be some scope for investments in non-geared related trusts. For instance, it has been argued that this is a means of jointly owning property with a related party as an alternative to a tenants-in-common relationship. To meet this requirement, the government will move an amendment to create a 
 power to make a regulation to exempt particular classes of assets from being in-house assets. The exception will apply only to a superannuation fund with fewer than five members that invests in a company or trust which meets specified requirements.
These requirements include that the company or trust does not borrow; it does not invest in or loan money to individuals or other entities other than deposits with financial institutions; it does not acquire assets from a related party of the superannuation fund other than business real property; it does not lease assets to related parties or enter into lease arrangements other than a legally binding lease of business or real property to a related property on an arms length basis; and it conducts all other transactions on an arms length basis. The government will consult with accounting and other industry bodies in developing a definition of non-geared company or trust that meets these requirements.
As to the start date, concerns were expressed about the lapse of time since the original announcement on 12 May 1998. In response the government will move an amendment to ensure that the change to the in-house provisions will apply only from the date of introduction of the legislation—11 August 1998. The change to allow a small superannuation fund to use 100 per cent of its assets to acquire business real property from a related party will continue to apply from 12 May 1999.
Let me say in conclusion that, by limiting the risk to superannuation savings and ensuring that superannuation is used for the intended purpose of retirement income, the bill will set a sound framework for superannuation savings for decades to come. As I have already mentioned, some government amendments will be moved at the committee stage. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,1999-12-08,"—The United States magazine George  is essentially representative of the mainstream of politics. It is American, previously edited by the late John F. Kennedy Jr, and has both Democrat and Republican columnists. So if you read an article in George  about the impact of the Internet on politics, you know that IT has moved beyond the realm of specialised interest and into the mainstream.
In fact, a casual browse of the Net demonstrates how seriously those involved in US politics take the power of the web. From George Bush Jr's presidential campaign to Hillary Clinton's run for the Senate to Donald Trump's campaign for the Reform Party nomination, American politicians are delving into this medium with unbridled enthusiasm. Even the Stop Hillary campaign gets a guernsey here and there. Each of these has a significant presence on the web—providing information, soliciting support and donations, and giving browsers the opportunity to ask questions or make comments. I can only imagine that, as the US presidential race heats up early next year, web presence will become increasingly important.
As important as IT is in US politics, so too is it in the Australian environment. The 1990s explosion of the Internet has already had enormous implications for political communication. The use of the World Wide Web, email, bulletin boards and other means of Internet based communication has increased enormously in what is really a relatively short period of time. After all, the Internet as we know it effectively only came into existence in recent decades. Whilst Her Majesty is said to have sent the first royal email in 1976, the advances of contemporary browsers, online 
 shopping and audio are really developments of the 1990s.
As politicians, political parties, lobbyists, community organisations and individuals have all started to use these techniques, the impact that the new form of communication will have on politics, on communities and on the way we interact has also been considered. There are some very significant issues at the heart of this—issues like availability, access, skill renewal, and of course the impact on politics and politicians. Perhaps the most fundamental question for us is whether new technologies will somehow change the way that we interact with our constituencies. Some people believe that communication facilitated by IT between politicians and the community can introduce a more equitable relationship, allowing politicians and citizens to contribute equally.
Lawrence K. Grossman, former President of America's NBC News, says that new forms of communication based on IT will change contemporary politics. He said:
Gutenberg made everybody a reader, Xerox made everybody a publisher, and interactive telecommunications is making everybody a lobbyist.
That is a compelling proposition for anyone interested in engaging more people in the process of politics. But studies conducted in the United States indicate that whilst the new mediums of exchange on the Internet and email will have a great impact on political communication, they are in fact more likely to reinforce the existing structure of American politics than to change it. So whether the Net and email actually change the way people think about politics and politicians remains to be seen. Certainly there are differences between the American and Australian scenarios.
As most members and senators could attest—some more positively than others—the introduction of email facilities for members of this parliament has been greeted enthusiastically by our constituents. Certainly over recent times I, like all senators, have been on the receiving end of a number of email campaigns, from Jabiluka, to Internet censorship to, more recently, the situation in East Timor. The number of people using email to contact parliamentarians is increasing. What is undeniable is that devices like email and 
 Internet sites are important tools for politicians and their constituents alike—and therein perhaps lies the difference with some of the historical comparisons I have made.
Perhaps the real test of this method of exchange will be how we as parliamentarians choose to respond to emails. The delivery of a message via electronic means does not change the validity of the message or make it more or less important than a letter or a fax, but it might actually change the expectations of the person who sends the message. The issue of how to respond to email messages is being considered right across international politics. People who email the US President get an email confirmation of their message and, if it is appropriate, a letter in response. The Prime Minister encourages members of the public to leave comments on his web site but to pursue detailed matters through other means, like contacting their local member or senator.
An ongoing challenge is dealing with the global nature of the Internet. As senators who represent a particular state, or members who represent an even more specific constituency in the lower house, the way in which the Net and email open up access to people from all over the world is a challenge that I suspect will be met in different ways by different members. Some might just hit `delete' whilst others might view email as they would a letter or a telephone inquiry from someone outside their constituency. The most important thing in all of this is that members and senators do not ignore the opportunity that the Internet and email create for us, and that constituent contact generated through new technologies is embraced enthusiastically.
In the Australian context, both federal and state parliamentarians have taken up the IT challenge with enthusiasm. Many members of this chamber have a Net presence, and many others are following suit. I think it is fair to say that members of the coalition are leading in many ways in the trend. To provide a central registry of all individual coalition members' home pages, I have published a directory that profiles the personal home pages of my coalition colleagues from the New South Wales and Commonwealth parlia 
 ments. It is called Insite and a copy has been provided to the Parliamentary Library. It was launched recently at an event I organised in Sydney to celebrate both the growth of the IT industry and the important role of Australian women in this growth.
Two speakers addressed the launch of Insite. The first speaker was Barry O'Farrell, the New South Wales state member who is Deputy Leader of the Opposition and shadow minister for information technology. His portfolio passion is IT innovation in New South Wales and the potential boost for our state. He is a keen follower of a range of IT issues, including Internet content, Y2K challenges and IT training.
The second speaker that we enjoyed hearing from was Ruby Blessing. She has seen the average web browser go from a simple, text based interface with grey backgrounds and no animation to a fully integrated multimedia delivery tool. She is one of the world's leading web designers and has been a regular recipient of awards for her work. Acknowledged as the most prolific female web designer in the world, she has designed more than 100 corporate, institution and cultural web sites. Inducted into the Australian Business Women's Hall of Fame in 1999, she now operates a consultancy for businesses and cultural institutions wanting to take full advantage of the Internet and all forms of IT.
Ms Blessing shared a number of her experiences and thoughts in this area and, when remarking on the launch of Insite, said:
Browsing through . . . Insite  I was impressed by the number of members embracing the Internet to inform and communicate with their electorates. Most were extremely up to date with a diverse range of content and features. Regardless of political persuasion, it's hard not to get excited about this sort of dynamic use of the Internet.
For politics in 1999 and beyond, the Internet and personal home pages offer a huge range of opportunities and advantages for parliamentarians, and Insite  seeks to harness the growing involvement of members of the coalition in that area. I was pleased to see, for example, in putting it all together, that many Senate colleagues are keenly involved in leading the charge in engagement on the Net. Senators Boswell, Calvert, Gibson, Knowles, 
 Troeth and Tambling and many of our lower house colleagues have extremely impressive sites. Since the publication of Insite  even more have been raised with me or are under construction, and they will be in there as well. In commenting on the publication of Insite , the Prime Minister said that this initiative might act as a tool to `grow and encourage our colleagues to use online tools to keep in touch with our customers, the Australian public'. Hopefully, that is an opportunity everybody will take up.
At the same time as I launched Insite, I also took the opportunity to launch a new redeveloped web site of my own—easily found at www.marisepayne.com. It has already seen huge amounts of new traffic and I am very pleased with its progress. It is particularly interesting to hear from the people who are logging on—ranging from young people at school to professionals and retired workers from New South Wales, Australia and internationally. There is a huge diversity of interest, and that diversity is something I think we should encourage and facilitate.
Even my political party—the Liberal Party of New South Wales—is engaged in a major redevelopment and review of its web site. Under the guidance of Country Vice-President Robyn Parker it has been completely overhauled. Now if you log on you get information on the party, its parliamentary representations, regular publications and different parts of the organisation. The New South Wales Young Liberal Movement has gone through a similar process and has a very dynamic site that I think makes it comparable to any other youth political organisation in Australia.
Most importantly, though, in this whole process, the coalition and I, in particular, recognise the importance of  utilising the new technologies to maximise our community interaction—to maximise our contact with our constituents in the most advanced and technologically progressive way. I can say with great assurance this evening that the coalition—in the parliament and in the states and territories—is taking up huge opportunities offered through the Internet, which is very commendable indeed. I think it is a fundamental part of our jobs as senators, and as 
 members in the other place, to maintain an active interest and an active presence in this regard. I look forward to continuing to do that and to hearing from a lot more young people in particular through my web site.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Information Technology: Politics</title>,Adjournment,31,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-12-08," asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Trade, upon notice, on 2 November 1999:
(1) What has been the total cost to the department, and each agency in the portfolio, of legal advice obtained from the Attorney-General's Department in the 1998-99 financial year.
(2) What has been the total cost to the department, and each agency in the portfolio, in the 1998-99 financial year of legal advice obtained by the department from other sources.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade: Cost of Legal Advice from the Attorney-General's Department</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,33,1,question
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1999-12-08,"—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
According to the Department's financial records, as well as of agencies in the portfolio, the total expenditure in the 1998-99 financial year on legal matters (including cost of obtaining legal advice) was as follows:
(1) $1,083,465.13 paid to the Attorney-General's Department.
(2) $949,933.82 paid to other sources.
These figures include compensation and other payments, as well as the cost of purchasing legal services. It would be very difficult, and would require an unreasonable diversion of resources, to identify only those payments made for legal advice.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade: Cost of Legal Advice from the Attorney-General's Department</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,33,1,answer
