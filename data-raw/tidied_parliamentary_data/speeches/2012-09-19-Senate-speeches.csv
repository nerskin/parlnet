Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (09:31):  I seek leave to move Greens amendments on sheet 7282 and 7280 together.


Leave granted.




Senator SIEWERT:
  These amendments relate to the sunset clause I talked about earlier in my second reading contribution, removing the sunset clause and restoring the social and economic impacts and consideration of those to the bill, and also banning a vessel over 2,000 tonnes and reversing the onus of proof, all of which I articulated in my second reading contribution.

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (09:33):  Just to go back to where we were last night, I asked Senator Ludwig a series of questions in relation to the confidence of the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Mr Burke, and the investigations that he might have taken to satisfy his uncertainty in relation to the science. I just wonder whether Minister Ludwig has had a chance to get any information on those matters overnight since he did take those on notice last night.

I was really interested to know whether we do have any information as to who he actually consulted with—I did name a number of entities last night—in what he did himself to satisfy his uncertainty. As you would be aware, there is some question around that. 


Minister, I acknowledge that we are debating an EPBC Act amending bill but there is an obvious role for you as the minister for fisheries in this particular matter regarding your certainty around the science. Who did you actually consult with during your discussions on this particular matter and do you actually have certainty in the science?

I am not a scientist, clearly. I take advice. I take advice from DAFF. I take advice from AFMA. And where I do have a role then that would be factually based decision making, evidence based decision making, on the available information that is provided to me.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2012-09-19,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (09:42):  There are a couple of areas that I would like to explore in relation to the aspects of this bill. Minister, could you please explain to me how on Monday of last week you were fulsome in your defence, if I might say, of the Abel Tasman and of the people who, as a result of the encouragement by your predecessor as fisheries minister, Mr Burke, brought this big fishing vessel to Tasmania? On Monday, 10 September, in the Senate in answer to a question from Senator Whish-Wilson you were fulsome in your praise of the big fishing vessel. Quite rightly, you indicated that this had been looked at for some time—in fact, I think you mentioned that it had been since 2004, without the date. The scientists and those people whom you appointed to assess the reports of the scientists came to the conclusion that this was a productive, efficient and environmentally friendly way of fishing. Minister, if you are looking for your answer from Monday, I can give it to you if you do not have it in front of you and do not recall what you said. But, clearly, you were right on the message.


My first question is what happened on the night of Monday, 10 September, in an issue of proper fisheries management—I am not interested in the politics of it, Minister. I do not care if Kevin Rudd was about to roll Julia Gillard as Prime Minister. I am not interested in those sorts of things. I would hope that ministers in the government of my country would be making decisions on the basis of science and on the basis of what is good for the fishery. Clearly, on Monday, 10 September you were confident—in fact I think your words were that you 'need to give confidence that the food impacts of the small pelagic fishery on predators and on small pelagic fishery species themselves, including through localised depletion, are unlikely'—that is, any adverse impact. I am not a scientist but may I say, with respect, that that has always been my understanding. So I want to know, if you could please tell the Senate, what it was, as a responsible minister in charge of Australia's fisheries and the sustainability of Australia's fisheries, that happened on Monday night that caused you to change your mind completely.


I would also like to know, Minister, if you would be so good, which of the AFMA commission that you have appointed you do not have confidence in or respect for. The chairman is the Hon. Michael Egan, a former Labor treasurer of New South Wales, as I recall. There is Dr James Findlay, the CEO, a man whose scientific credentials are impeccable. If you ever wanted anyone in the world, I can confidently say, to give you good advice on fisheries and fisheries management it would be Dr Findlay. You have appointed a deputy chairman, Mr Richard Stevens, who I am delighted to say has been on the predecessor of the AFMA commission since I was minister. I know firsthand that Mr Stevens is an exceptional administrator when it comes to the science of fisheries management. There is Mr Ian Cartwright, who I know has been involved in fisheries management for years. You and I, Minister, have been involved in fisheries management in different periods of time in the flick of an eye in our history. Mr Cartwright has been there for years: a qualified, exceptional fisheries management person. You clearly agree with me, Minister—that is why you appointed him.


I do not know Dr Glaister, Ms Jennifer Goddard, Ms Elizabeth Montano or Ms Denise North. Perhaps I have met them, but I do not know a lot about them. But, again, Minister, I am confident that, if you appointed them on advice from your department, on advice from the fisheries industry and from those people who know, they would be good people. The final member of the commission is Professor Keith Sainsbury, who I do know. Again, whilst you and I are involved in a blip in history, Professor Sainsbury has been around for a long time. And he is good! That is why you, Minister, appointed him to the commission. I would really like to know why you, Minister, having appointed these nine exceptionally well-qualified experts as commission members—I know half of them, and I know they are good fisheries management people—have decided that their advice is wrong. It is not as if they woke up one morning and said, 'Let's have a look at this small pelagic fishery.'


As you mentioned very generously in your answer to the question on 10 September, you would know that since 2004 these people and all of the best fisheries scientists and managers have been looking at the small pelagic fishery. They and you came to the conclusion, Minister, as did your predecessor, that getting a big trawler to get the same quantity of fish out of the same quota—no more fish being caught; exactly the same quota—was a good way to go. Your predecessor, Mr Burke, as fisheries minister, encouraged Tasmanian fishermen to do exactly what was being done. Minister, ask your advisers all you like, but the record is there of what Mr Burke said and how he did encourage these people to do exactly what they did.


Mr Burke, in that instance, was correct. He knows as much about fisheries management as you or I do but he clearly took advice from the experts that he had appointed, not experts that have any political persuasion at all but experts in the business of fisheries management and that is why Mr Burke appointed them. Mr Burke took their advice, as well he should, and you took their advice. I refer you again to your answer to Senator Whish-Wilson's question on Monday, 10 September, where you took the advice, you appropriately referred the questioner to the science and you defended the action that your predecessor, Mr Burke, had taken as the fisheries minister.


Suddenly, on the night, I assume, of Monday, 10 September something happened. I know that one of your Western Australian colleagues of the left faction had indicated they were going to move a private member's bill, which the Greens naturally would have supported because they want to shut down any resource industry in Australia and it does not matter what it is.




Senator Johnston:
  All of them.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Yes, all of them. So it would have got support from Mr Bandt in the other house and a couple of your left-wing colleagues if the Prime Minister had not had the fortitude to pull them into line. But it would not have mattered as that in itself was a blimp. Then suddenly Mr Kevin Rudd indicates publicly that he is going to support the private member's bill—oops, Mr Rudd is going to support Ms Parke's private member's bill and that brings a whole new complexity to the issue. Can you just see Mr Rudd and Ms Parke moving the motion sitting on one side of the green chamber over there and all of their colleagues sitting on the other side! That was never going to happen, was it, Minister? That was never going to happen. A Prime Minister who had some intestinal fortitude and who was a leader would have told her backbench members, Ms Parke and Mr Rudd, to toe the line, rely on the science and do what was right and do what Minister Burke had encouraged to happen when he was fisheries minister—and this would have gone through.


I have to say, Minister, that several months ago people rang me and said, 'We're seeking support.' I said, 'Well, don't come to me. I rely on the scientists. They have clearly said it's right. What's more, I know that the Labor Party is right behind you in your venture. So thanks for calling me but you need not waste your time or mine as it will go through. We know the Greens will be opposed to it.' The Labor Party, for once in their life, I suspect—although not once, as you have been right a couple of times—were firm on this. I said to the people who rang me: 'Just have a look at what Mr Burke said as fisheries minister. He encouraged you to do it. There's no way in the world the Labor Party would backflip on this. They've backflipped on the carbon tax and on the mining tax—you name it—but they won't backflip on this, because science is on your side. You have a senior minister, Mr Burke, encouraging you to come there, so don't worry about it. You'll be right.' And they were right, and I was delighted, Minister, to hear your answer just last Monday, when you defended them appropriately on advice from the scientists and from the commission that your predecessor appointed.


So, Minister, my question in this committee stage of the bill is: what actually happened on Monday night? Forget the politics—I do not want to go into internal Labor Party factional deals—but what happened in a scientific fisheries management way on Monday night that caused you, on Tuesday morning, to have a completely different view to the view you expressed in this chamber on Monday at 2.20 pm? That is my first question: what happened? The second question is: which of those eminent scientists and fisheries managers that you or your predecessor as minister for fisheries appointed to the AFMA commission do you now not have confidence in? Which of those people are so incapable or ignorant that you no longer take the advice they have given you? They are two fairly simple questions.


Unfortunately, my time has run out. I do have another question. I will be much briefer on that, but I will just forewarn you on that so your advisers might be able to assist by getting some information. I want to briefly question you about the role of the ombudsman in this issue, but I will leave that to my next question if I may. But my first two questions are: what changed on Monday night and which members of that commission do you not have confidence in?

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (09:57):  So nothing happened on Monday night?




Senator Ludwig:
  Nothing out of the ordinary.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  A challenge by Mr Rudd to Ms Gillard is nothing out of the ordinary; I accept that. But, Minister, you say nothing happened on Monday night. So please tell me what it was that occurred to make you do a complete 180-degree turn on an issue. Please tell it. There are some Australians listening to this. I see we are on broadcast today. I am sure they would want to know what changed your mind between 2.20 on Monday afternoon and when you held your press conference at 11 o'clock the next day. Something must have happened. As I say, I am not interested in the fact that Kevin Rudd was going to challenge Ms Gillard for the Prime Ministership. I am not interested in that. I want to know how you can look yourself in the mirror every morning and say—




Senator Ludwig:
  A lot more easily than you would be able to.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Minister, you must have woken up on Tuesday morning, looked yourself in the face and said: 'I was right yesterday. I took the advice of all the scientists. I took the advice of these very highly qualified people I appointed. I was right.' But suddenly, for what you are trying to pass off as good fisheries management, you had a change of mind. I repeat: forget the challenge of Mr Rudd to Ms Gillard. But, Minister, you as a minister of the Crown and of our nation must be able to explain what happened overnight. You say in your answer to my question that you have full confidence in the board of the commission. Why don't you take their advice? With respect to you, Minister, and with respect to me as a former fisheries minister, we do not know much. We try, but we are not the experts.


You have appointed the best qualified scientists in the world, I would go so far as to say, to your commission, to give you advice. They gave you advice. On Monday you accepted it. Suddenly on Tuesday you did not. So please, Minister, do not treat me as fool—well, treat me as a fool; I accept that, but please do not treat the rest of your colleagues as fools. Please do not treat this chamber like that. There has to be a reason you ignored the advice of your expert.


I also read Mr Egan's letter to the ombudsman, and that disturbs me. This is the same ombudsman, I understand, who wrote questions at estimates for the Greens political party. I think it is the same ombudsman. Certainly Mr Egan thought that in his letter to the ombudsman. I think Mr Egan, former Labor Treasurer of New South Wales, was indicating that the ombudsman had sort of shown his colours. I do not know what the ombudsman's politics are, but, clearly, writing questions for the Greens at estimates gives an indication of where his political allegiances might lie. 


The allegation that Mr Egan raised in his letter to the ombudsman is a very serious one. I would like, Minister, for you to tell us whether you and your government still have confidence in an ombudsman who would make a decision—as I understand Mr Egan's letter says—without even bothering to lift up the phone and ask the people who are being accused whether they have a view on it. He was not going to necessarily take their advice, but you would think that, if you go to an ombudsman and say 'Ian Macdonald is corrupt', natural justice would mean that the first thing the ombudsman would do is ring Ian Macdonald and say—sorry, I am using a bad analogy here; there is an Ian Macdonald who was a politician who is alleged to have been corrupt. He is a nice fellow. I used to know the other Ian Macdonald. He was also a fisheries minister. Perhaps my analogy, talking about an Ian Macdonald who is corrupt, is wrong, because that is the allegation. He was a Labor minister, you might remember; yet another Labor minister who is in trouble with corruption allegations.


Let me use a different scenario. If someone complains to the ombudsman that Ian Macdonald is drawing his salary but not coming to parliament, the first thing the ombudsman would do is ring me and say, 'Senator, I have had a complaint that you are taking your pay but you do not come to parliament.' There are one or two members on the other side—a member from up my way in North Queensland—who rarely go to parliament. The first thing the ombudsman would do is ring up and say: 'Senator Macdonald, it has been alleged that you do not attend parliament. Could you give me your side of the story? I am not going to say I believe you. But what do you say?' But the ombudsman in this instance apparently did not bother to even pick up the phone; he just took the complaint of the Greens political party at face value and, with his record in writing questions, you could understand that.


But my question is twofold. You have answered my previous one; you said nothing happened Monday night. I am sorry, but nobody believes you about that. I know your leader, Ms Gillard, is prone to telling lies. One day she promised there would be no carbon tax and a week later she introduced it. I know that is a bit of a thing in the Labor Party, but surely you cannot expect us to believe that on Monday night nothing happened to make you change your mind. I am challenging your answer and asking you to, please, give us a truthful answer. know your leader does not understand truthfulness and does not require ministers to be honest, but please, Minister: I have known you for a while. You are an old Boonah schoolboy, so you must be good. Please give us the truth. What happened Monday night that caused you to change your mind?


The other question is: does the government still have confidence in the Ombudsman who dealt with this issue in such a cavalier way that lacks any semblance of natural justice?

 (Northern Territory—Deputy Leader of The Nationals) (10:05):  Minister, I would like to ask you about one specific thing. I know you appear to have some amnesia over the issues around the celebrated Monday night but I am sure you will have no difficulty with this question. This is a fundamental question about how well we manage our fisheries. It was very interesting to listen to Senator Macdonald; I think he diminished himself a little bit by saying he knows no more than other fisheries ministers. I can recall when he was the fisheries minister, and he was very good. We were not always on the same side of the debate, but he won most of them because he simply knew so much about it. I can recall him saying, 'Look, Nigel, this is how it operates,' and giving me a lecture—whilst it was quite unnecessary—on the fact that we had moved forward from the dinosaur age of input controls.


For those who do not understand the difference between input and output controls, it is the fundamental difference in two fisheries practices. Input controls probably were still the flavour of the month 30 to 35 years ago, and that was how we did it. We basically managed fisheries through inefficiency. We said, 'We think you're catching too many fish, so you're only allowed to use half your nets.' If we thought that was a bit difficult, we said, 'Make the holes in your nets bigger.' If you looked like you were pulling the boats too fast, we'd lower your horsepower. If you had a very smart skipper, we'd make sure he only had an IQ of five. There were a spectrum of efficiencies you could put on a boat and they were called input controls. We controlled the size of the boat and the net, we might say you could only fish for two days of the year and all those sorts of things.


But after a while we thought about that, and there are linkages in that system that people can get around. 'We'll make a certain horsepower motor, but we can do things to gearboxes to make the propeller turn faster and make the boat go harder.' So, to make sure all of those were out, we went back and said, 'What's our motivation?' Our motivation is to control the number of fish that are caught, so why don't we just do that? We will just say you can only catch this number of fish. So modelling happened, people developed, we all grew and the world knew then that output control fisheries were the way to go. At about the same time—25 years ago—people started output control fisheries, and slowly we have gone from input control fisheries in Australia to primarily output. Certainly the Commonwealth fisheries have a policy of going to output control. It is the best way to manage a fishery. It basically does not matter if you want to throw rotten socks in the water and kill fish. It does not matter how you go about doing it as long as you do it in a way that only kills or takes this many fish, and primarily for human consumption. They say, 'Go and do that.'


So we have had a bit of a change. We had a huge amount of confidence that that was the very best way to manage our fishery, but we seem to have sent a bit of a signal. The only issue about this boat that is different from the other boats that exist in the fishery is its size—in fact, its freezer capacity. It is not towing bigger gear. We have established it is not killing more fish than the other ones. It is not doing anything different in that regard apart from it being bigger because it has a huge freezer capacity to process stuff at sea. In effect, what we have said is that we are going to prohibit this vessel from being here because it is more efficient. That is an input control. That is the first input control I have seen introduced into Commonwealth fisheries management in the 35-odd years that I have been involved and had an interest in Australian fisheries.


Minister, I wonder if you could indicate whether this new decision to provide an inefficiency in a fishery to ensure that that vessel is unable to fish in Australian waters is a new direction for Australian fisheries management.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (10:11):  Minister, I would just like to ask about the use of the word 'uncertainty' which is on page 7 of the bill under Subdivision C—Final Declaration. It has been discussed a lot in the chamber in the last few weeks. Senator Brandis and Senator Abetz discussed that 'uncertainty' is a very broad term that has no legal meaning and should not find its way into a bill. I wanted to ask you whether the definition of that word related to the statistical definition of 'uncertainty'. My understanding of 'uncertainty' is that it is technically something that cannot be quantified as against probability being applied to a value, which is what we use to measure risks. If something is uncertain and it cannot be quantified at this point in time, is it a relevant word to use for such activities or such issues as local depletion? They have not been scientifically quantified, particularly in the way that the concerns have been allayed by local fishermen and discussed by conservation groups. Is it possible for us to calculate? Do we have the data to calculate things such as bycatch from an operation such as this supertrawler, particularly with a seal-exclusion device that has not been tested on this vessel?


In terms of the word 'uncertainty' which has been focused on in this bill: is it an appropriate word on its statistical definition, because it relates directly to something that is not able to be calculated versus risk which is very specifically able to be calculated by assigning of probability and an expected value? We can talk about managing risks to the fishery. But what if something is certain, statistically speaking? It cannot be calculated, or has not been calculated, which is the case with local depletion, for example. We have discussed the lack of scientific work in areas such as movement of the small pelagic fish species and our lack of understanding of impacts in local areas. Is it an appropriate word from a statistical point of view?

In order for the Abel Tasman to be nominated against a fishing concession it must be registered by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority as an Australian flagged vessel. This process was completed on 5 September 2012 when the Australian Maritime Safety Authority registered the FV Abel Tasman as an Australian flagged vessel under the Shipping Registration Act. It is currently, as I understand it, waiting final advice from the Australian Fisheries Management Authority about its request to use the FV Abel Tasman in the small pelagic fishery. I will take that on notice in case that has been updated between yesterday and today.

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2012-09-19,"



Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (10:32):  There is one final matter that I do need to deal with in relation to this because it has become part of the debate. It is around the setting of the quota. The Greens were quite delighted that a new paper came out from IMAS last week, and I indicated that I would go back and have a look at that. One of the key things is that the science and the discussion around the science is very important and, unfortunately, as I have indicated in my previous contributions on this piece of legislation, there have been some very disappointing attempts to smear the scientists who are involved in this process. I understand there has been quite a reluctance by some of our institutions to allow those scientists to defend themselves. I have to say that that is quite disappointing because the naysaying comment effectively stands and there is very little opportunity for these people to actually make a comment.


The Greens and some media publications were declaring victory because at IMAS there had been some recalculations of the DEPM, the egg survey that is used as one of the elements of establishing the quota in the fishery. The fact that the scientists at IMAS had rerun the calculations using a number of different methods has brought, so it has been suggested, a result that means the quota should be very different. Dr Wadsley made the claim in the first place that the quota setting was wrong because, as he refers to it, he could not reproduce the calculations, he could not reproduce the numbers that were set by IMAS. One of the problems was that he was using the wrong method. In fact, he was not actually using a recognised method in the first place. He was using an Excel spreadsheet, and that is nothing like any of the recognised methods for doing the calculations that are required to establish the biomass. But unfortunately, instead of ringing up the scientists who had done the calculations to understand what the inputs were and what the decision-making process was around the selection of the method of calculation, Dr Wadsley, as Senator Whish-Wilson said yesterday, put it on a blog. So rather than science by peer review, which is what happened with the science that was done out of the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies, we now have a process where we have science via blog and that is the peer review process—by blog. Quite frankly, I do not think that has any credibility at all, and I do not think that Dr Wadsley's analysis has any credibility at all.


Not only that, but the person who is acknowledged as the expert on the DEPM process does not believe it has any credibility either. Nancy Lo, from the National Marine Fisheries Service in California, completely unsolicited—not asked by anybody—did a critique of Dr Wadsley's criticism. In other words, this is somebody who knows about this versus somebody who works as a geologist in the oil and gas sector and a mathematician. So, as I said when quoting the Chief Scientist, it is a bit like getting a dentist to give you advice on heart surgery. What did Nancy Lo say? She acknowledged that he had made 'some constructive comments' but said he had 'missed some major points'. The terminologies used by Dr Wadsley were too strong and some of them were not correct for the paper. As I said earlier, Dr Wadsley used Microsoft Excel to do the regression analysis. Most researchers use more sophisticated methods. While an undergraduate may know how to use these statistical packages, to understand the theory behind the estimation procedure requires a statistician or quantitative biologist with a higher academic degree. So, unsolicited, Dr Wadsley's criticism of the work done by IMAS has been rejected by Nancy Lo, who is the acknowledged expert in this particular matter regarding the calculations around the egg survey.


Of course, because Dr Wadsley was not a part of the process that decided the method of calculation, he understandably would not be aware of why a particular method was decided upon. So, within the assessment panel that looked at which method would be used—not within IMAS but within the resource assessment group—there was a decision made as to which method should be used. So IMAS used the method that was recommended to them by the resource assessment group. Not only that, but he is not privy to the base information. So he comes from outside, completely cold, and makes an analysis using a very simplistic method—one that does not have the sophistication of the models that are used more broadly in doing these calculations—but he does not even do the common courtesy of ringing the scientists to find out why he could not reproduce their results. He has since changed his story. It is not that he could not reproduce the results; it is now that they used the wrong method. So his credibility is sinking even further.


Interestingly, though—and, I think, showing him a lot more courtesy than many would—AFMA have invited Dr Wadsley to attend one of their meetings. I think that is a decent approach. As I said, many would not give him that courtesy, but they are giving him courtesy that he has not provided to any of them. In a press release yesterday, AFMA have invited Dr Wadsley to make a submission to the Small Pelagic Fishery Resource Assessment Group. They said, 'We also invite Dr Wadsley to contact Dr Tim Ward, the chair of that group, regarding his attention or participation in the future expert work of this group.'


It would be nice to see Dr Wadsley inform himself rather than just go public, make a criticism and allege that the quota is set at too low a level without understanding what happens behind it. I think that is a reasonable process to occur because that work of Dr Wadsley has been used in this debate against IMAS, and in particular against some people within IMAS. What has been forgotten in this process is that that work has been peer reviewed by SARDI in South Australia, and there is also a very, very sound body of work done by CSIRO. My understanding is that CSIRO has rerun all its calculations for the biomass in this fishery and that that work indicates the biomass is between 100,000 and 200,000 tonnes. The assessment of the resource assessment group and IMAS is that the biomass was at 140,000 tonnes, which was the basis for the setting of the quota.


The work by CSIRO was done using the Atlantis ecosystem model, something I referred to last night, and it has been rated the best in the world by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations—not by us; this was an external recognition. So, in respect of the certainty around the science for the quota, let us just put that to bed because there are a number of calculations, not just one, and the AFMA commission, as the minister has actually indicated on a number of occasions, does not just take the advice of the resource assessment group or the MAC, it takes advice from its own scientists and other sources. Here we have a very credible source, the CSIRO, that has made an assessment of this biomass as being between 100,000 and 200,000 tonnes.


So Dr Wadsley is now very much alone in his criticism. He was not aware of the inputs. He has taken one graph, tried to recalculate the calculations using Microsoft Excel rather than the modelling tools that are available to the industry and to the scientists, and could not reproduce it. He did not provide the common courtesy of going back and discussing it with the scientists who did the calculations to find out what was behind it and why; he just posted to a blog.


So, chair, I think that does deal with this issue. There has been much excitement. It is a 'gotcha' moment for the Greens and some of the people opposing the vessel but, as I have indicated, there are a number of other sources. I think it is appropriate that we do go back to the science to discuss this in order to have a good understanding. The important thing about the Atlantis model—and I am not sure whether Minister Ludwig is aware of it, because he has not said that he is aware of it, or Minister Burke—is that it actually modelled the whole biosystem. So the issue of interactions and impacts on marine mammals and other marine species are actually modelled as part of the CSIRO work. As I indicated, it is rated the best in the world by the Food and Agriculture Organization.


Let us put all that stuff aside. My understanding is that the reworked modelling from the CSIRO has not yet been released. I would be interested to know whether the minister has asked for it. I have, but I have not been able to get hold of it yet. I will be very interested to read it. I would recommend it to Minister Burke, because it might do something about his uncertainty.


I have one other final point on Dr Wadsley. I had a bit of a look at his qualifications and, as I said in my presentation, he is eminently well qualified in his fields, and I make no comment around that at all. But this is not the first time he has intervened in one of these environmental debates, so he actually has form.


He came out during the pulp mill debate in Tasmania to join an anti-pulp-mill panel, so here we have a second occasion where Dr Wadsley is opposing an investment in my home state of Tasmania and I just wonder whether or not there might be some philosophical perspective behind his comments, particularly given that he did not give the common courtesies that I mentioned before as part of his engagement with this particular issue. It is very disappointing that he did not do that but, as we now know, it is not the first time he has intervened in one of these types of issues. So I think it is important that I address where we were because the Greens seemed to be in a situation where they were really happy that the scientists that had done the research were now seemingly saying that their research was wrong. That is not what they were doing. They ran a number of calculations, they remained confident in the numbers that they put out and they remained confident in the reasons they put out, but there was not only that: their work was verified by other fisheries scientists in Australia and, importantly, it was reinforced by a completely separate model run by the CSIRO. That CSIRO work does not just deal with the biomass in this fishery; it actually deals with broader ecosystem issues and is regarded as the best in the world. It is something that we ought to be proud of, that we have an institution like CSIRO that can produce that sort of work.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2012-09-19,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (10:46):  I would like to make a statement and get a few things on the record in relation to what Senator Colbeck just discussed. There were no triumphant statements from the Greens about recent additions to the debate between Dr Wadsley and other unnamed people on blog sites. We simply highlighted that a report had been put on the AFMA website, incorrectly put up under the August media releases rather than under the September media releases, which did express a difference of opinion on estimation methods. We said that that, if converted using statistical methods, could show a difference in the total allowable catch for jack mackerel.


This debate between Dr Wadsley and other scientists—well, we suspect they are scientists based on the level of their understanding expressed on blog sites—has been going on for months. I mentioned a few days ago we have never pushed Dr Wadsley out there as a fisheries scientist nor have we highlighted his work in Hansard, in our media releases or at forums, although I did attend a recreational fisheries forum in Campbelltown where Dr Wadsley spoke.


I would like to take the opportunity to defend him here today in terms of his integrity, which I think Senator Colbeck has tried to tear down. I am not aware of his politics. He is a petroleum scientist. He works in the oil and gas industry. He would not be what I would classify as a green, in the sense that that is his career. I have done a fisheries modelling course myself at the University of Tasmania and I am aware of the differences in predictive power between Microsoft Excel and other packages which I have also used, although not as well as some of my colleagues, I must admit, and I actually think it is a very simplistic analysis. Microsoft Excel is used by Dr Wadsley in his risk consulting business for things such as the oil and gas industry.


Senator Colbeck mentioned earlier his participation in the pulp mill debate. He came out and did an analysis of the level of dioxin that was going to be put into Bass Strait and said that the official scientific reports, based on the work of a number of scientists, were incorrect. I cannot remember exactly what it was but it was a factor of billions, so one to the power of 10. In the end, after fighting a very similar campaign to have his analysis taken seriously, it was proven to be correct and we had a retraction in a statement about the potential level of dioxin in Bass Strait and in the fishery. That was thanks to his dogged determination—and I would not say it was about his philosophy on pulp mills but rather the science in this instance and especially the statistics. What he has focused on here is simply statistics. It is about the difference in estimation methods.


Scientific models are very complex and the amount of data that they use is enormous, particularly the ecosystem model. I was very fortunate to have a chat last night to the CSIRO scientist who is the champion of the ecosystem model in Hobart, and I am well aware of the complexities of models. I have myself used information from models that are some of the most complex mathematical models in the world in terms of trying to predict the linkages between financial variables, for example. There are literally potentially millions of variables involved in these models, so I know the difference between risk and uncertainty and how they function, and everybody does the best they can. 


I want to highlight what this issue is to me in terms of scrutiny versus attacking the scientists. The Liberals have run a very consistent line both in the house and against me personally that by scrutinising science we are somehow attacking the scientists. This is from the editorial today in the Mercury, obviously one of the key newspapers in the south of Tasmania where a lot of these scientists are based. I will quote a small section of it. It is talking about scrutiny in terms of the science of the quota setting, localised depletion and the ombudsman's investigation:


This type of scrutiny is rare for an organisation like AFMA, which generally operates behind a veil and in its own domain. It is king, judge, jury and all powerful. Suddenly, its authority is being questioned and issues have been identified to suggest its processes and science need review. This is healthy democracy at work. It does not necessarily mean the scientists and public servants at AFMA are bad people or that they have consciously been deceitful or negligent or even failed in their duties.


It does, however, mean they must be accountable, transparent and above board. They must explain, in laymen's terms, their decisions. They must accept public scrutiny.


In terms of Dr Wadsley, who my statement refers to, I see this as an ongoing debate and I am very pleased that he has been brought into the tent and he is talking with AFMA. I mentioned the other day that I have made attempts to try and get him to talk directly with scientists at various organisations so that they can sort this out behind closed doors. I can guarantee to the house today that that is exactly what Dr Wadsley has wanted. I am very pleased that it has got to the stage where his analysis is being taken seriously. I saw a post on the same blog site that Senator Colbeck was referring to this morning where Dr Wadsley is still insistent that his analysis is correct. It is also worth pointing out that he did recently put out a research report which was peer reviewed and has been submitted for an article publication. So this is not just typing up rats and mice on a blog site; he has actually now published his work, his full statistical analysis of the whole chain of events that have led to this analysis. 


My point I want to get on the record is that this is still ongoing and it is healthy that citizens in our community take an interest in this and that these things are scrutinised. I say sorry to the fishery scientists if they believe this has not been conducted the right way. It is unfortunate, as Senator Colbeck pointed out, that this was not done differently in the beginning, but at the end of the day Dr Wadsley feels very much attacked as well personally and very much under the pump. I am looking forward to seeing the end result of this work because I do believe that scrutiny is important and that should be taken into account.

 (Tasmania) (09:33):  Just to go back to where we were last night, I asked Senator Ludwig a series of questions in relation to the confidence of the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Mr Burke, and the investigations that he might have taken to satisfy his uncertainty in relation to the science.

I was really interested to know whether we do have any information as to who he actually consulted with—I did name a number of entities last night—in what he did himself to satisfy his uncertainty. As you would be aware, there is some question around that. 


Minister, I acknowledge that we are debating an EPBC Act amending bill but there is an obvious role for you as the minister for fisheries in this particular matter regarding your certainty around the science. Who did you actually consult with during your discussions on this particular matter and do you actually have certainty in the science?

I am not a scientist, clearly. I take advice. I take advice from DAFF. I take advice from AFMA.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2012-09-19,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (09:42):  There are a couple of areas that I would like to explore in relation to the aspects of this bill. Minister, could you please explain to me how on Monday of last week you were fulsome in your defence, if I might say, of the Abel Tasman and of the people who, as a result of the encouragement by your predecessor as fisheries minister, Mr Burke, brought this big fishing vessel to Tasmania? On Monday, 10 September, in the Senate in answer to a question from Senator Whish-Wilson you were fulsome in your praise of the big fishing vessel. Quite rightly, you indicated that this had been looked at for some time—in fact, I think you mentioned that it had been since 2004, without the date. The scientists and those people whom you appointed to assess the reports of the scientists came to the conclusion that this was a productive, efficient and environmentally friendly way of fishing. Minister, if you are looking for your answer from Monday, I can give it to you if you do not have it in front of you and do not recall what you said. But, clearly, you were right on the message.


My first question is what happened on the night of Monday, 10 September, in an issue of proper fisheries management—I am not interested in the politics of it, Minister. I do not care if Kevin Rudd was about to roll Julia Gillard as Prime Minister. I am not interested in those sorts of things. I would hope that ministers in the government of my country would be making decisions on the basis of science and on the basis of what is good for the fishery. Clearly, on Monday, 10 September you were confident—in fact I think your words were that you 'need to give confidence that the food impacts of the small pelagic fishery on predators and on small pelagic fishery species themselves, including through localised depletion, are unlikely'—that is, any adverse impact. I am not a scientist but may I say, with respect, that that has always been my understanding. So I want to know, if you could please tell the Senate, what it was, as a responsible minister in charge of Australia's fisheries and the sustainability of Australia's fisheries, that happened on Monday night that caused you to change your mind completely.


I would also like to know, Minister, if you would be so good, which of the AFMA commission that you have appointed you do not have confidence in or respect for. The chairman is the Hon. Michael Egan, a former Labor treasurer of New South Wales, as I recall. There is Dr James Findlay, the CEO, a man whose scientific credentials are impeccable. If you ever wanted anyone in the world, I can confidently say, to give you good advice on fisheries and fisheries management it would be Dr Findlay. You have appointed a deputy chairman, Mr Richard Stevens, who I am delighted to say has been on the predecessor of the AFMA commission since I was minister. I know firsthand that Mr Stevens is an exceptional administrator when it comes to the science of fisheries management. There is Mr Ian Cartwright, who I know has been involved in fisheries management for years. You and I, Minister, have been involved in fisheries management in different periods of time in the flick of an eye in our history. Mr Cartwright has been there for years: a qualified, exceptional fisheries management person. You clearly agree with me, Minister—that is why you appointed him.


I do not know Dr Glaister, Ms Jennifer Goddard, Ms Elizabeth Montano or Ms Denise North. Perhaps I have met them, but I do not know a lot about them. But, again, Minister, I am confident that, if you appointed them on advice from your department, on advice from the fisheries industry and from those people who know, they would be good people. The final member of the commission is Professor Keith Sainsbury, who I do know. Again, whilst you and I are involved in a blip in history, Professor Sainsbury has been around for a long time. And he is good! That is why you, Minister, appointed him to the commission. I would really like to know why you, Minister, having appointed these nine exceptionally well-qualified experts as commission members—I know half of them, and I know they are good fisheries management people—have decided that their advice is wrong. It is not as if they woke up one morning and said, 'Let's have a look at this small pelagic fishery.'


As you mentioned very generously in your answer to the question on 10 September, you would know that since 2004 these people and all of the best fisheries scientists and managers have been looking at the small pelagic fishery. They and you came to the conclusion, Minister, as did your predecessor, that getting a big trawler to get the same quantity of fish out of the same quota—no more fish being caught; exactly the same quota—was a good way to go. Your predecessor, Mr Burke, as fisheries minister, encouraged Tasmanian fishermen to do exactly what was being done. Minister, ask your advisers all you like, but the record is there of what Mr Burke said and how he did encourage these people to do exactly what they did.


Mr Burke, in that instance, was correct. He knows as much about fisheries management as you or I do but he clearly took advice from the experts that he had appointed, not experts that have any political persuasion at all but experts in the business of fisheries management and that is why Mr Burke appointed them. Mr Burke took their advice, as well he should, and you took their advice. I refer you again to your answer to Senator Whish-Wilson's question on Monday, 10 September, where you took the advice, you appropriately referred the questioner to the science and you defended the action that your predecessor, Mr Burke, had taken as the fisheries minister.


Suddenly, on the night, I assume, of Monday, 10 September something happened. I know that one of your Western Australian colleagues of the left faction had indicated they were going to move a private member's bill, which the Greens naturally would have supported because they want to shut down any resource industry in Australia and it does not matter what it is.




Senator Johnston:
  All of them.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Yes, all of them. So it would have got support from Mr Bandt in the other house and a couple of your left-wing colleagues if the Prime Minister had not had the fortitude to pull them into line. But it would not have mattered as that in itself was a blimp. Then suddenly Mr Kevin Rudd indicates publicly that he is going to support the private member's bill—oops, Mr Rudd is going to support Ms Parke's private member's bill and that brings a whole new complexity to the issue. Can you just see Mr Rudd and Ms Parke moving the motion sitting on one side of the green chamber over there and all of their colleagues sitting on the other side! That was never going to happen, was it, Minister? That was never going to happen. A Prime Minister who had some intestinal fortitude and who was a leader would have told her backbench members, Ms Parke and Mr Rudd, to toe the line, rely on the science and do what was right and do what Minister Burke had encouraged to happen when he was fisheries minister—and this would have gone through.


I have to say, Minister, that several months ago people rang me and said, 'We're seeking support.' I said, 'Well, don't come to me. I rely on the scientists. They have clearly said it's right. What's more, I know that the Labor Party is right behind you in your venture. So thanks for calling me but you need not waste your time or mine as it will go through. We know the Greens will be opposed to it.' The Labor Party, for once in their life, I suspect—although not once, as you have been right a couple of times—were firm on this. I said to the people who rang me: 'Just have a look at what Mr Burke said as fisheries minister. He encouraged you to do it. There's no way in the world the Labor Party would backflip on this. They've backflipped on the carbon tax and on the mining tax—you name it—but they won't backflip on this, because science is on your side. You have a senior minister, Mr Burke, encouraging you to come there, so don't worry about it. You'll be right.' And they were right, and I was delighted, Minister, to hear your answer just last Monday, when you defended them appropriately on advice from the scientists and from the commission that your predecessor appointed.


So, Minister, my question in this committee stage of the bill is: what actually happened on Monday night? Forget the politics—I do not want to go into internal Labor Party factional deals—but what happened in a scientific fisheries management way on Monday night that caused you, on Tuesday morning, to have a completely different view to the view you expressed in this chamber on Monday at 2.20 pm? That is my first question: what happened? The second question is: which of those eminent scientists and fisheries managers that you or your predecessor as minister for fisheries appointed to the AFMA commission do you now not have confidence in? Which of those people are so incapable or ignorant that you no longer take the advice they have given you? They are two fairly simple questions.


Unfortunately, my time has run out. I do have another question. I will be much briefer on that, but I will just forewarn you on that so your advisers might be able to assist by getting some information. I want to briefly question you about the role of the ombudsman in this issue, but I will leave that to my next question if I may. But my first two questions are: what changed on Monday night and which members of that commission do you not have confidence in?

 (Queensland) (09:57):  So nothing happened on Monday night?




Senator Ludwig:
  Nothing out of the ordinary.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  A challenge by Mr Rudd to Ms Gillard is nothing out of the ordinary; I accept that. But, Minister, you say nothing happened on Monday night. So please tell me what it was that occurred to make you do a complete 180-degree turn on an issue. Please tell it. There are some Australians listening to this. I see we are on broadcast today. I am sure they would want to know what changed your mind between 2.20 on Monday afternoon and when you held your press conference at 11 o'clock the next day. Something must have happened. As I say, I am not interested in the fact that Kevin Rudd was going to challenge Ms Gillard for the Prime Ministership. I am not interested in that. I want to know how you can look yourself in the mirror every morning and say—




Senator Ludwig:
  A lot more easily than you would be able to.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Minister, you must have woken up on Tuesday morning, looked yourself in the face and said: 'I was right yesterday. I took the advice of all the scientists. I took the advice of these very highly qualified people I appointed. I was right.' But suddenly, for what you are trying to pass off as good fisheries management, you had a change of mind. I repeat: forget the challenge of Mr Rudd to Ms Gillard. But, Minister, you as a minister of the Crown and of our nation must be able to explain what happened overnight. You say in your answer to my question that you have full confidence in the board of the commission. Why don't you take their advice? With respect to you, Minister, and with respect to me as a former fisheries minister, we do not know much. We try, but we are not the experts.


You have appointed the best qualified scientists in the world, I would go so far as to say, to your commission, to give you advice. They gave you advice. On Monday you accepted it. Suddenly on Tuesday you did not. So please, Minister, do not treat me as fool—well, treat me as a fool; I accept that, but please do not treat the rest of your colleagues as fools. Please do not treat this chamber like that. There has to be a reason you ignored the advice of your expert.


I also read Mr Egan's letter to the ombudsman, and that disturbs me. This is the same ombudsman, I understand, who wrote questions at estimates for the Greens political party. I think it is the same ombudsman. Certainly Mr Egan thought that in his letter to the ombudsman. I think Mr Egan, former Labor Treasurer of New South Wales, was indicating that the ombudsman had sort of shown his colours. I do not know what the ombudsman's politics are, but, clearly, writing questions for the Greens at estimates gives an indication of where his political allegiances might lie. 


The allegation that Mr Egan raised in his letter to the ombudsman is a very serious one. I would like, Minister, for you to tell us whether you and your government still have confidence in an ombudsman who would make a decision—as I understand Mr Egan's letter says—without even bothering to lift up the phone and ask the people who are being accused whether they have a view on it. He was not going to necessarily take their advice, but you would think that, if you go to an ombudsman and say 'Ian Macdonald is corrupt', natural justice would mean that the first thing the ombudsman would do is ring Ian Macdonald and say—sorry, I am using a bad analogy here; there is an Ian Macdonald who was a politician who is alleged to have been corrupt. He is a nice fellow. I used to know the other Ian Macdonald. He was also a fisheries minister. Perhaps my analogy, talking about an Ian Macdonald who is corrupt, is wrong, because that is the allegation. He was a Labor minister, you might remember; yet another Labor minister who is in trouble with corruption allegations.


Let me use a different scenario. If someone complains to the ombudsman that Ian Macdonald is drawing his salary but not coming to parliament, the first thing the ombudsman would do is ring me and say, 'Senator, I have had a complaint that you are taking your pay but you do not come to parliament.' There are one or two members on the other side—a member from up my way in North Queensland—who rarely go to parliament. The first thing the ombudsman would do is ring up and say: 'Senator Macdonald, it has been alleged that you do not attend parliament. Could you give me your side of the story? I am not going to say I believe you. But what do you say?' But the ombudsman in this instance apparently did not bother to even pick up the phone; he just took the complaint of the Greens political party at face value and, with his record in writing questions, you could understand that.


But my question is twofold. You have answered my previous one; you said nothing happened Monday night. I am sorry, but nobody believes you about that. I know your leader, Ms Gillard, is prone to telling lies. One day she promised there would be no carbon tax and a week later she introduced it. I know that is a bit of a thing in the Labor Party, but surely you cannot expect us to believe that on Monday night nothing happened to make you change your mind. I am challenging your answer and asking you to, please, give us a truthful answer. know your leader does not understand truthfulness and does not require ministers to be honest, but please, Minister: I have known you for a while. You are an old Boonah schoolboy, so you must be good. Please give us the truth. What happened Monday night that caused you to change your mind?


The other question is: does the government still have confidence in the Ombudsman who dealt with this issue in such a cavalier way that lacks any semblance of natural justice?

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Deputy Leader of The Nationals) (10:05):  Minister, I would like to ask you about one specific thing. I know you appear to have some amnesia over the issues around the celebrated Monday night but I am sure you will have no difficulty with this question. This is a fundamental question about how well we manage our fisheries. It was very interesting to listen to Senator Macdonald; I think he diminished himself a little bit by saying he knows no more than other fisheries ministers. I can recall when he was the fisheries minister, and he was very good. We were not always on the same side of the debate, but he won most of them because he simply knew so much about it. I can recall him saying, 'Look, Nigel, this is how it operates,' and giving me a lecture—whilst it was quite unnecessary—on the fact that we had moved forward from the dinosaur age of input controls.


For those who do not understand the difference between input and output controls, it is the fundamental difference in two fisheries practices. Input controls probably were still the flavour of the month 30 to 35 years ago, and that was how we did it. We basically managed fisheries through inefficiency. We said, 'We think you're catching too many fish, so you're only allowed to use half your nets.' If we thought that was a bit difficult, we said, 'Make the holes in your nets bigger.' If you looked like you were pulling the boats too fast, we'd lower your horsepower. If you had a very smart skipper, we'd make sure he only had an IQ of five. There were a spectrum of efficiencies you could put on a boat and they were called input controls. We controlled the size of the boat and the net, we might say you could only fish for two days of the year and all those sorts of things.


But after a while we thought about that, and there are linkages in that system that people can get around. 'We'll make a certain horsepower motor, but we can do things to gearboxes to make the propeller turn faster and make the boat go harder.' So, to make sure all of those were out, we went back and said, 'What's our motivation?' Our motivation is to control the number of fish that are caught, so why don't we just do that? We will just say you can only catch this number of fish. So modelling happened, people developed, we all grew and the world knew then that output control fisheries were the way to go. At about the same time—25 years ago—people started output control fisheries, and slowly we have gone from input control fisheries in Australia to primarily output. Certainly the Commonwealth fisheries have a policy of going to output control. It is the best way to manage a fishery. It basically does not matter if you want to throw rotten socks in the water and kill fish. It does not matter how you go about doing it as long as you do it in a way that only kills or takes this many fish, and primarily for human consumption. They say, 'Go and do that.'


So we have had a bit of a change. We had a huge amount of confidence that that was the very best way to manage our fishery, but we seem to have sent a bit of a signal. The only issue about this boat that is different from the other boats that exist in the fishery is its size—in fact, its freezer capacity. It is not towing bigger gear. We have established it is not killing more fish than the other ones. It is not doing anything different in that regard apart from it being bigger because it has a huge freezer capacity to process stuff at sea. In effect, what we have said is that we are going to prohibit this vessel from being here because it is more efficient. That is an input control. That is the first input control I have seen introduced into Commonwealth fisheries management in the 35-odd years that I have been involved and had an interest in Australian fisheries.


Minister, I wonder if you could indicate whether this new decision to provide an inefficiency in a fishery to ensure that that vessel is unable to fish in Australian waters is a new direction for Australian fisheries management.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (10:11):  Minister, I would just like to ask about the use of the word 'uncertainty' which is on page 7 of the bill under Subdivision C—Final Declaration. It has been discussed a lot in the chamber in the last few weeks. Senator Brandis and Senator Abetz discussed that 'uncertainty' is a very broad term that has no legal meaning and should not find its way into a bill. I wanted to ask you whether the definition of that word related to the statistical definition of 'uncertainty'. My understanding of 'uncertainty' is that it is technically something that cannot be quantified as against probability being applied to a value, which is what we use to measure risks. If something is uncertain and it cannot be quantified at this point in time, is it a relevant word to use for such activities or such issues as local depletion? They have not been scientifically quantified, particularly in the way that the concerns have been allayed by local fishermen and discussed by conservation groups. Is it possible for us to calculate? Do we have the data to calculate things such as bycatch from an operation such as this supertrawler, particularly with a seal-exclusion device that has not been tested on this vessel?


In terms of the word 'uncertainty' which has been focused on in this bill: is it an appropriate word on its statistical definition, because it relates directly to something that is not able to be calculated versus risk which is very specifically able to be calculated by assigning of probability and an expected value? We can talk about managing risks to the fishery. But what if something is certain, statistically speaking? It cannot be calculated, or has not been calculated, which is the case with local depletion, for example. We have discussed the lack of scientific work in areas such as movement of the small pelagic fish species and our lack of understanding of impacts in local areas. Is it an appropriate word from a statistical point of view?

 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (10:14):  It is a matter for AFMA to make those decisions. As I am advised, AFMA has received a nomination fee of the Abel Tasman to fish in the small pelagic fishery. In order for the Abel Tasman to be nominated against a fishing concession it must be registered by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority as an Australian flagged vessel. This process was completed on 5 September 2012 when the Australian Maritime Safety Authority registered the FV Abel Tasman as an Australian flagged vessel under the Shipping Registration Act. It is currently, as I understand it, waiting final advice from the Australian Fisheries Management Authority about its request to use the FV Abel Tasman in the small pelagic fishery. I will take that on notice in case that has been updated between yesterday and today.

I suppose the question comes back to the statement that Minister Burke made that he had no powers to do anything and therefore this legislation was necessary.

That is entirely a matter for Minister Burke. Then we have this piece of legislation, and they are completely unrelated.

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2012-09-19,"



Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (10:32):  There is one final matter that I do need to deal with in relation to this because it has become part of the debate. It is around the setting of the quota. The Greens were quite delighted that a new paper came out from IMAS last week, and I indicated that I would go back and have a look at that. One of the key things is that the science and the discussion around the science is very important and, unfortunately, as I have indicated in my previous contributions on this piece of legislation, there have been some very disappointing attempts to smear the scientists who are involved in this process. I understand there has been quite a reluctance by some of our institutions to allow those scientists to defend themselves. I have to say that that is quite disappointing because the naysaying comment effectively stands and there is very little opportunity for these people to actually make a comment.


The Greens and some media publications were declaring victory because at IMAS there had been some recalculations of the DEPM, the egg survey that is used as one of the elements of establishing the quota in the fishery. The fact that the scientists at IMAS had rerun the calculations using a number of different methods has brought, so it has been suggested, a result that means the quota should be very different. Dr Wadsley made the claim in the first place that the quota setting was wrong because, as he refers to it, he could not reproduce the calculations, he could not reproduce the numbers that were set by IMAS. One of the problems was that he was using the wrong method. In fact, he was not actually using a recognised method in the first place. He was using an Excel spreadsheet, and that is nothing like any of the recognised methods for doing the calculations that are required to establish the biomass. But unfortunately, instead of ringing up the scientists who had done the calculations to understand what the inputs were and what the decision-making process was around the selection of the method of calculation, Dr Wadsley, as Senator Whish-Wilson said yesterday, put it on a blog. So rather than science by peer review, which is what happened with the science that was done out of the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies, we now have a process where we have science via blog and that is the peer review process—by blog. Quite frankly, I do not think that has any credibility at all, and I do not think that Dr Wadsley's analysis has any credibility at all.


Not only that, but the person who is acknowledged as the expert on the DEPM process does not believe it has any credibility either. Nancy Lo, from the National Marine Fisheries Service in California, completely unsolicited—not asked by anybody—did a critique of Dr Wadsley's criticism. In other words, this is somebody who knows about this versus somebody who works as a geologist in the oil and gas sector and a mathematician. So, as I said when quoting the Chief Scientist, it is a bit like getting a dentist to give you advice on heart surgery. What did Nancy Lo say? She acknowledged that he had made 'some constructive comments' but said he had 'missed some major points'. The terminologies used by Dr Wadsley were too strong and some of them were not correct for the paper. As I said earlier, Dr Wadsley used Microsoft Excel to do the regression analysis. Most researchers use more sophisticated methods. While an undergraduate may know how to use these statistical packages, to understand the theory behind the estimation procedure requires a statistician or quantitative biologist with a higher academic degree. So, unsolicited, Dr Wadsley's criticism of the work done by IMAS has been rejected by Nancy Lo, who is the acknowledged expert in this particular matter regarding the calculations around the egg survey.


Of course, because Dr Wadsley was not a part of the process that decided the method of calculation, he understandably would not be aware of why a particular method was decided upon. So, within the assessment panel that looked at which method would be used—not within IMAS but within the resource assessment group—there was a decision made as to which method should be used. So IMAS used the method that was recommended to them by the resource assessment group. Not only that, but he is not privy to the base information. So he comes from outside, completely cold, and makes an analysis using a very simplistic method—one that does not have the sophistication of the models that are used more broadly in doing these calculations—but he does not even do the common courtesy of ringing the scientists to find out why he could not reproduce their results. He has since changed his story. It is not that he could not reproduce the results; it is now that they used the wrong method. So his credibility is sinking even further.


Interestingly, though—and, I think, showing him a lot more courtesy than many would—AFMA have invited Dr Wadsley to attend one of their meetings. I think that is a decent approach. As I said, many would not give him that courtesy, but they are giving him courtesy that he has not provided to any of them. In a press release yesterday, AFMA have invited Dr Wadsley to make a submission to the Small Pelagic Fishery Resource Assessment Group. They said, 'We also invite Dr Wadsley to contact Dr Tim Ward, the chair of that group, regarding his attention or participation in the future expert work of this group.'


It would be nice to see Dr Wadsley inform himself rather than just go public, make a criticism and allege that the quota is set at too low a level without understanding what happens behind it. I think that is a reasonable process to occur because that work of Dr Wadsley has been used in this debate against IMAS, and in particular against some people within IMAS. What has been forgotten in this process is that that work has been peer reviewed by SARDI in South Australia, and there is also a very, very sound body of work done by CSIRO. My understanding is that CSIRO has rerun all its calculations for the biomass in this fishery and that that work indicates the biomass is between 100,000 and 200,000 tonnes. The assessment of the resource assessment group and IMAS is that the biomass was at 140,000 tonnes, which was the basis for the setting of the quota.


The work by CSIRO was done using the Atlantis ecosystem model, something I referred to last night, and it has been rated the best in the world by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations—not by us; this was an external recognition. So, in respect of the certainty around the science for the quota, let us just put that to bed because there are a number of calculations, not just one, and the AFMA commission, as the minister has actually indicated on a number of occasions, does not just take the advice of the resource assessment group or the MAC, it takes advice from its own scientists and other sources. Here we have a very credible source, the CSIRO, that has made an assessment of this biomass as being between 100,000 and 200,000 tonnes.


So Dr Wadsley is now very much alone in his criticism. He was not aware of the inputs. He has taken one graph, tried to recalculate the calculations using Microsoft Excel rather than the modelling tools that are available to the industry and to the scientists, and could not reproduce it. He did not provide the common courtesy of going back and discussing it with the scientists who did the calculations to find out what was behind it and why; he just posted to a blog.


So, chair, I think that does deal with this issue. There has been much excitement. It is a 'gotcha' moment for the Greens and some of the people opposing the vessel but, as I have indicated, there are a number of other sources. I think it is appropriate that we do go back to the science to discuss this in order to have a good understanding. The important thing about the Atlantis model—and I am not sure whether Minister Ludwig is aware of it, because he has not said that he is aware of it, or Minister Burke—is that it actually modelled the whole biosystem. So the issue of interactions and impacts on marine mammals and other marine species are actually modelled as part of the CSIRO work. As I indicated, it is rated the best in the world by the Food and Agriculture Organization.


Let us put all that stuff aside. My understanding is that the reworked modelling from the CSIRO has not yet been released. I would be interested to know whether the minister has asked for it. I have, but I have not been able to get hold of it yet. I will be very interested to read it. I would recommend it to Minister Burke, because it might do something about his uncertainty.


I have one other final point on Dr Wadsley. I had a bit of a look at his qualifications and, as I said in my presentation, he is eminently well qualified in his fields, and I make no comment around that at all. But this is not the first time he has intervened in one of these environmental debates, so he actually has form.


He came out during the pulp mill debate in Tasmania to join an anti-pulp-mill panel, so here we have a second occasion where Dr Wadsley is opposing an investment in my home state of Tasmania and I just wonder whether or not there might be some philosophical perspective behind his comments, particularly given that he did not give the common courtesies that I mentioned before as part of his engagement with this particular issue. It is very disappointing that he did not do that but, as we now know, it is not the first time he has intervened in one of these types of issues. So I think it is important that I address where we were because the Greens seemed to be in a situation where they were really happy that the scientists that had done the research were now seemingly saying that their research was wrong. That is not what they were doing. They ran a number of calculations, they remained confident in the numbers that they put out and they remained confident in the reasons they put out, but there was not only that: their work was verified by other fisheries scientists in Australia and, importantly, it was reinforced by a completely separate model run by the CSIRO. That CSIRO work does not just deal with the biomass in this fishery; it actually deals with broader ecosystem issues and is regarded as the best in the world. It is something that we ought to be proud of, that we have an institution like CSIRO that can produce that sort of work.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2012-09-19,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (10:46):  I would like to make a statement and get a few things on the record in relation to what Senator Colbeck just discussed. There were no triumphant statements from the Greens about recent additions to the debate between Dr Wadsley and other unnamed people on blog sites. We simply highlighted that a report had been put on the AFMA website, incorrectly put up under the August media releases rather than under the September media releases, which did express a difference of opinion on estimation methods. We said that that, if converted using statistical methods, could show a difference in the total allowable catch for jack mackerel.


This debate between Dr Wadsley and other scientists—well, we suspect they are scientists based on the level of their understanding expressed on blog sites—has been going on for months. I mentioned a few days ago we have never pushed Dr Wadsley out there as a fisheries scientist nor have we highlighted his work in Hansard, in our media releases or at forums, although I did attend a recreational fisheries forum in Campbelltown where Dr Wadsley spoke.


I would like to take the opportunity to defend him here today in terms of his integrity, which I think Senator Colbeck has tried to tear down. I am not aware of his politics. He is a petroleum scientist. He works in the oil and gas industry. He would not be what I would classify as a green, in the sense that that is his career. I have done a fisheries modelling course myself at the University of Tasmania and I am aware of the differences in predictive power between Microsoft Excel and other packages which I have also used, although not as well as some of my colleagues, I must admit, and I actually think it is a very simplistic analysis. Microsoft Excel is used by Dr Wadsley in his risk consulting business for things such as the oil and gas industry.


Senator Colbeck mentioned earlier his participation in the pulp mill debate. He came out and did an analysis of the level of dioxin that was going to be put into Bass Strait and said that the official scientific reports, based on the work of a number of scientists, were incorrect. I cannot remember exactly what it was but it was a factor of billions, so one to the power of 10. In the end, after fighting a very similar campaign to have his analysis taken seriously, it was proven to be correct and we had a retraction in a statement about the potential level of dioxin in Bass Strait and in the fishery. That was thanks to his dogged determination—and I would not say it was about his philosophy on pulp mills but rather the science in this instance and especially the statistics. What he has focused on here is simply statistics. It is about the difference in estimation methods.


Scientific models are very complex and the amount of data that they use is enormous, particularly the ecosystem model. I was very fortunate to have a chat last night to the CSIRO scientist who is the champion of the ecosystem model in Hobart, and I am well aware of the complexities of models. I have myself used information from models that are some of the most complex mathematical models in the world in terms of trying to predict the linkages between financial variables, for example. There are literally potentially millions of variables involved in these models, so I know the difference between risk and uncertainty and how they function, and everybody does the best they can. 


I want to highlight what this issue is to me in terms of scrutiny versus attacking the scientists. The Liberals have run a very consistent line both in the house and against me personally that by scrutinising science we are somehow attacking the scientists. This is from the editorial today in the Mercury, obviously one of the key newspapers in the south of Tasmania where a lot of these scientists are based. I will quote a small section of it. It is talking about scrutiny in terms of the science of the quota setting, localised depletion and the ombudsman's investigation:


This type of scrutiny is rare for an organisation like AFMA, which generally operates behind a veil and in its own domain. It is king, judge, jury and all powerful. Suddenly, its authority is being questioned and issues have been identified to suggest its processes and science need review. This is healthy democracy at work. It does not necessarily mean the scientists and public servants at AFMA are bad people or that they have consciously been deceitful or negligent or even failed in their duties.


It does, however, mean they must be accountable, transparent and above board. They must explain, in laymen's terms, their decisions. They must accept public scrutiny.


In terms of Dr Wadsley, who my statement refers to, I see this as an ongoing debate and I am very pleased that he has been brought into the tent and he is talking with AFMA. I mentioned the other day that I have made attempts to try and get him to talk directly with scientists at various organisations so that they can sort this out behind closed doors. I can guarantee to the house today that that is exactly what Dr Wadsley has wanted. I am very pleased that it has got to the stage where his analysis is being taken seriously. I saw a post on the same blog site that Senator Colbeck was referring to this morning where Dr Wadsley is still insistent that his analysis is correct. It is also worth pointing out that he did recently put out a research report which was peer reviewed and has been submitted for an article publication. So this is not just typing up rats and mice on a blog site; he has actually now published his work, his full statistical analysis of the whole chain of events that have led to this analysis. 


My point I want to get on the record is that this is still ongoing and it is healthy that citizens in our community take an interest in this and that these things are scrutinised. I say sorry to the fishery scientists if they believe this has not been conducted the right way. It is unfortunate, as Senator Colbeck pointed out, that this was not done differently in the beginning, but at the end of the day Dr Wadsley feels very much attacked as well personally and very much under the pump. I am looking forward to seeing the end result of this work because I do believe that scrutiny is important and that should be taken into account.

Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (12:45):  I rise today to speak on the matter of public interest and wish to make a contribution about the distribution of GST revenues to the states and territories. The Australian government raises the lion's share of revenue in our federation and a great deal of what is spent by the states and territories to meet their responsibilities is allocated from Commonwealth revenue. At the moment this is the proceeds of the goods and services tax but, long before the GST was introduced, decisions about the distribution of revenues to the states and territories had been made at arms-length by a body called the Commonwealth Grants Commission. The CGC was established in 1933 and still operates to this day. The decisions about how much funding to allocate to each state and territory are based on the principle known as horizontal fiscal equalisation, or HFE.


I will quote the website of the Commonwealth Grants Commission to explain what the term 'horizontal fiscal equalisation' means. It says:


Fiscal equalisation involves the transfer of payments or grants across jurisdictions with the aim of offsetting differences between a jurisdiction's revenue raising capacity and expenditure needs.


It can address both vertical fiscal imbalance and horizontal fiscal imbalance.


   …   …   …



Horizontal fiscal imbalance refers to the situation where the States have differing abilities to provide comparable levels of services through the imposition of comparable tax burdens, because of demographic and economic disparities between them.


Tasmania is at a distinct disadvantage when it comes to raising its own revenue. We have a relatively low share of mining activity in comparison with other states and, as stated in the CGC report for 2012, we have a high proportion of small businesses, lower wages and lower property values. This limits Tasmania's ability to raise payroll tax, land tax, stamp duty, mining revenue and insurance tax.


Tasmania is also disadvantaged when it comes to delivering services. Not only are we Australia's only island state but we have the most dispersed population as the only state or territory in Australia where most people live outside the capital city. Our population is relatively older and has greater health and welfare needs because of socioeconomic disadvantage. So the principle of HFE is of vital importance to Tasmania when it comes to delivering services to our population equivalent to those of other states and territories. However, coalition premiers in the larger states of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia have been arguing strongly for a per capita distribution of GST revenue.


Colin Barnett, Premier of Western Australia, kick-started the argument. In December 2012, he said: 'This sort of convoluted process of trying to assess needs and revenue capacities between states, I think that time has gone by. I would prefer a simple sharing of the GST on a per capita basis, with maybe some margin, maybe 10 per cent, which the Commonwealth can distribute to support lower-growth states.' In their submission to the GST review, Victorian Premier, Ted Baillieu, and Treasurer, Kim Wells, agreed, arguing: 'The GST should be distributed on an equal per capita basis, with particular policy challenges dealt with separately through targeted and accountable means.' Victoria and Western Australia were supported in their arguments at the July meeting of COAG by Queensland Premier, Campbell Newman, and New South Wales Premier, Barry O'Farrell. But this is what the Premier of South Australia, Jay Weatherill, had to say in response to the coalition premiers' attack on HFE:


… this is one nation. It was established as a commonwealth, and those words mean something … the wealth of the nation should be shared equitably, not according to some notion of the rich states taking the resources and keeping them for themselves.


Federally, the commitment to HFE has been a bipartisan position, at least until recently. It was a bipartisan position until the federal Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, joined in this attack on 1 May this year. On his visit to Western Australia, Mr Abbott said to the media:


What ought to be very seriously considered by the Government right now is the proposal that all the Liberal states have put up, that the GST revenue should be distributed on what is closer to a per capita arrangement ... 


Of course, when Mr Abbott visited Tasmania the following day, he was justifiably asked to clarify his position. Speaking to the media in Tasmania, Mr Abbott said:


… the Coalition will always support a fair deal, a square deal for Tasmania.


However, when offered the opportunity to rule out a per capita distribution of GST, Mr Abbott said:


Let’s see what the Greiner group comes up with and then the Coalition will have more to say.


The 'Greiner group' that Mr Abbott referred to was the panel overseeing the review of distribution of GST to the states and territories. In Mr Abbott's comments, there was no clarification of what a 'fair deal' or a 'square deal' for Tasmania meant. So was Mr Abbott saying one thing in Western Australia and another in Tasmania? After all, Mr Abbott makes a regular habit of saying different things to different audiences. I am not sure that matters.


What matters, what is important, is that Mr Abbott has not made the coalition's policy on GST distribution clear and to this day he has not ruled out a per capita distribution of GST to the states and territories. He said that a per capita distribution should be seriously considered and he has not retracted that statement. The prospect that a per capita distribution of GST revenue could become coalition policy—and at the moment we do not know what coalition policy is—should send a shudder through the spines of millions of Australians who rely on HFE to ensure that they have the same opportunity to health care, the same opportunity to education and the same access to transport and emergency services.


The states and territories which would lose out under this arrangement are South Australia, Tasmania, the ACT and the Northern Territory. In fact the Northern Territory would be hit especially hard as they receive over five times as much GST revenue as they would under a per capita distribution. As I explained before, this situation exists because the needs of the Northern Territory are far greater than that of any other state or territory. The cost of delivering services is greater and their capacity to raise revenue to deliver those services themselves is much smaller.


In the 2011-12 financial year, the Northern Territory needed $5.35 in revenue from the Commonwealth Grants Commission for every dollar in GST revenue collected to deliver equivalent services to their population as Western Australia or New South Wales deliver to theirs. In Tasmania, this amount was $1.60. In fact, if Mr Abbott's suggestion were implemented, Tasmania's budget revenue would fall by $700 million a year. This equates to a $5,000 cut to services for every Tasmanian.


Tasmania's Premier, Lara Giddings, put this in context across the state when she pointed out that a per capita distribution of GST would cost Tasmania 800 doctors, 3,000 nurses, 500 allied health professionals and over 100 child protection staff every year. My Tasmanian Labor colleague, the member for Franklin and minister, Julie Collins, has been very vocal on this issue. Unlike Mr Abbott and the coalition she has been genuinely standing up for the people of Tasmania and arguing for a fair deal. She has the support of the Tasmanian Labor caucus in doing so. Ms Collins has launched a petition calling on Mr Abbott to commit to a genuine fair deal and all the federal Tasmanian Labor members and senators support her. At the Tasmanian Labor state conference, the Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer, Wayne Swan, backed up Ms Collins' comments about the damage that Mr Abbott's proposal would cause to services in Tasmania.


Mr Abbott says he will argue for a fair deal but he has not clarified what that means. He has not retracted or repudiated his comments about per capita GST distribution and has not unequivocally committed to HFE. So what are Mr Abbott's Tasmanian Liberal colleagues doing about this attack on Tasmania's GST revenue? After Mr Abbott's comments in Tasmania back in May the Tasmanian Leader of the Opposition, Will Hodgman, said that Mr Abbott had left him in no doubt that a coalition government would not short-change Tasmania. Did Mr Abbott give Mr Hodgman a private commitment to HFE or is Mr Hodgman just not strong enough to stand up to him? Either way, he should. Like the Tasmanian Premier, Lara Giddings, he should be calling on Mr Abbott to give an unequivocal public comment on HFE, not just making vague, meaningless statements about a fair deal. It really makes you wonder where Mr Hodgman's loyalties lie. Is he really representing the interests of Tasmanians or is he just kowtowing to his federal leader?


As for Mr Abbott's Tasmanian Liberal colleagues in this place, why are they not calling on their leader to clarify his stance? You heard Senator Abetz say in this place on 23 August that the coalition supports HFE. But how can we believe him if his party's leader says that a per capita distribution should be seriously considered? How can we believe him when we do not hear it from Mr Abbott's mouth? If Senator Abetz and his colleagues—Senator Colbeck, Senator Bushby and Senator Parry—are truly committed to HFE, why do they not call on their leader to commit to it as well? Are they too afraid to stand up to him? Given the outrage I have heard from Tasmanians right across the state on this issue, I am astounded at the absolutely deafening silence coming from that side of the Senate when it comes to Mr Abbott's stance. All Mr Abbott has to do to stop this anger and remove any doubt is to say five simple words: 'I support horizontal fiscal equalisation.' Until he does this, Tasmanians will be trembling in fear of the devastation a coalition government will cause to basic services in Tasmania.


Tony Abbott's $700 million razor would slash through the jobs of thousands of Tasmanians—teachers, doctors, nurses, police, firefighters and paramedics—and Mr Abbott's $700 million hit would only be the start of the damage he would do to Tasmania if elected. We know he would scrap the minerals resource rent tax and a price on carbon. Without the MRRT there is no mechanism to fund the Schoolkids Bonus; the increase in the superannuation guarantee to 12 per cent—something that is badly needed by Tasmanian workers in a state that has a large population of retirees—or business tax concessions. Mr Abbott is also putting 800 Tasmanian jobs and a whole range of social and economic benefits at risk through his instructions to Malcolm Turnbull to demolish the National Broadband Network. Then there are the savage cuts to the public service that Mr Abbott needs to make to plug his $70 billion black hole.


But of all the damage the coalition proposes to inflict on my home state of Tasmania—the home state also of Senator Urquhart, who I notice is now in the chamber—the distribution of GST on a per capita basis is by far the most damaging. For any Tasmanians who are listening to this broadcast, watching from the gallery or reading Hansard, let me remind you again what Mr Abbott said on 1 May:


I think what ought to be very seriously considered by the government right now is the proposal that … the GST revenue should be distributed on what is closer to a per capita arrangement.


If Mr Abbott is not seriously considering this proposal—if he is not seriously considering a $700 million a year hit to Tasmania's budget—then why, after a whole 4½ months, has he not retracted this statement? I urge Mr Abbott's Tasmanian colleagues to grow a backbone, stand up to your leader and call on him to guarantee a fair share of GST revenue for Tasmania.

"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2012-09-19,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (15:07):  Mr Deputy President, I rise to move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation (Senator Wong) to questions without notice asked by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Abetz) and Senators Cormann and Sinodinos today relating to the Budget.


Although it was sorely tempting to take note of answers given by Senator Ludwig to non-questions asked by Senator Sterle, I did have to resist temptation!


Senator Wong's answers do deserve to be taken very careful note of, in particular answers given by her to questions in relation to Labor's $120 billion budget black hole. When that proposition—the $120 billion black hole—was put to Senator Wong, she cited a laundry list of previous Labor policy commitments that have been implemented and that have been in the budget. Her justification for not providing an answer to funding for the $120 billion worth of unfunded commitments was: 'Well, look at our previous commitments.' She said that they have all been funded and they have all been accounted for.


Now, she is technically correct. There are appropriated dollars for all of those previous Labor commitments. The question is, how were they funded? The senator gave the impression that, if these have been funded and have been provided for in the budget, it must be as a result of savings measures. That is the impression she sought to leave—but it is not the case. The bulk of the previous Labor commitments which she cited have been funded by borrowing. They have been funded by debt and have led directly to successive Labor deficit budgets. And that is the point that we are making here: you can fund anything—you can fund any commitment. It is not a problem for a government to provide in a budget for every single commitment that it makes—that is easy. The Commonwealth has the power of taxation. That is not what we are questioning.


What we are questioning is where that money will come from—and we know where the money for the $120 billion will come from, should Labor get re-elected, and should they implement those commitments. Every dollar of it, just about, would come from borrowing. Every dollar would come from borrowing that is additional to the $100 billion-plus  of net borrowings that this government currently has. That is our point, Mr Deputy President. Any government can make provision, but it is how you make provision. Senator Wong has often made reference to the savings that this government has identified, but the bulk of those savings have been tax increases.


There are two great untruths at the heart of Labor's fiscal story. The first is that the budget has been in deficit, year after year, because of bad luck. And how does bad luck manifest itself? It manifests itself in declining revenues. Yes, there have been declining revenues and, yes, this government has had a lot of bad luck, most of it of its own making. The fact is that the reason why the budget is in deficit under this government, year after year, is policy decisions—that means decisions by government to spend. That is why the budget is in deficit. You cannot blame revenue write-downs, you cannot blame the global economy; it is because of spending decisions by this government. That is why the budget has been in deficit, year after year.


The other great fallacy of Labor's fiscal story is the contention that they have made savings, and that they have funded their commitments from savings. As I said before, that is not the case—these senators opposite count tax increases as savings. So you will understand, Mr Deputy President, why we are more than a little cynical about the $120 billion of unfunded commitments.


If Labor were successful at the next election, we know that the way those commitments would be funded would be through more borrowing and more debt, and we would see further deficit budgets. The government needs to live within its means. It needs to cut its cloth according to the circumstances. This government has never done that, not for one budget. It has never delivered a budget surplus.


I predict that, for so long as the Australian Labor Party is in government, they will never, ever deliver a single budget surplus because they cannot. They lack the will and they lack the strength of character to make the decisions to prioritise what is important above what is merely desirable.

"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2012-09-19,"



Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (15:13):  I rise to take note of answers as referred to by Senator Fifield. Senator Fifield speaks of untruths sustaining a fiscal story. On that, no-one can doubt the credentials of the coalition. In fact, Senator Fifield raises the spectre: what happens if Labor is re-elected? I can tell you that one of the first things we will do, Senator Fifield, is thank you, because it is the political strategy crafted by you and your colleagues which I am sure will be a critical enabler to that glorious day, should it ever come.


The coalition come to this conversation, and come to this political debate, sitting on top of a policy edifice which could not possibly look weaker and which could not possibly look more ramshackle. A $70 billion black hole underpins the political proposition of those opposite—a $70 billion black hole which those opposite are determined to avoid and refuse to accept acknowledgement for—and now they have the temerity to attack the policy and the fiscal position of this government.


As Senator Wong made clear in her answer, the government that holds the record for having the highest level of spending as a percentage of GDP is the Howard government, at 24.2 per cent of GDP. While that number had fallen to 23.7 per cent by 2007, that is still far greater than it is today. In fact, the difference is some $24 billion per annum. So, in fact, rather than the Labor government, those opposite have the record of pulling more money out of this economy through taxation regulation. But, of course, you would never know that if you were to listen to the opposition—and there are a lot of other things you would not know as well. You would not know that those opposite propose to axe the carbon tax at a cost of $27 billion to the budget and that $3.2 billion of that is required to fund chairman Abbott's action plan.




Senator Abetz:
  The Leader of the Opposition.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Feeney—




Senator FEENEY:
  The Leader of the Opposition and his action plan—the action man with the action plan. While those opposite might rail against a carbon tax, that $3.2 billion action plan is in effect the coalition's very own carbon tax. The $24 billion is required to refund big polluters for carbon permits. While those opposite like to spruik about sovereign risk, we find them roaming the highways and byways of this great country of ours telling business not to buy permits and not to participate in this scheme.


There are $11.1 billion of unfunded promises from those opposite, because they have resolved to hand back moneys raised through the minerals resource rent tax. And, to make this position of theirs even more farcical, they are determined to keep the benefits that flow from that taxation but have resolved to give up the revenue. They have resolved to give up the revenue so that they can hand it back to the likes of Gina Rinehart and Clive Palmer—although one must speculate that those opposite must be regretting the idea of handing Clive a cheque this week at least. To add insult to injury, while those opposite are determined to hand back $11.1 billion to the mining industry by disposing of this tax, we see in Western Australia and Queensland state coalition governments raising royalties on those very same commodities—thus making an absolute mockery of the coalition's claim to be the friend and defender of these industries.


We also see $8 billion in pledged tax cuts from those opposite. And, not content with a $70 billion black hole, we see those opposite peddling false hope in defence spending. Today we saw Senator Johnston have the temerity to ask a question about defence cuts compromising our national security—an outrageous assertion he could not make out. But where are the coalition's promises on defence spending? Where are the coalition's commitments to restoring defence spending to the level they say is appropriate? Of course, there is no such commitment; we just have weasel words from an opposition that cannot put before the Australian people a proposition that adds up or makes sense. Instead we see a coalition that are determined to walk both sides of the street, to peddle fear and to peddle false hope to various constituencies.


This week we heard that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition begged and beseeched Senator Joyce to stop helping. One might invite her to make the same request of all of those in her Senate team because, right here and right now, those opposite do not have a proposition before the Australian people that makes political sense or economic sense—and your political future will be destroyed as a consequence.

"Bushby, Sen David",LP,2012-09-19,"



Senator BUSHBY
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:18):  I rise also to take note of answers given by Senator Wong to questions asked by Senators Abetz, Cormann and Sinodinos. I note Senator Feeney was referring to allegations that the Howard government was the highest spending government as a percentage of taxation over GDP—something which Senator Wong also referred to in her answers to questions. But this of course is not the best way of actually determining whether a government is a wastefully spending government. What you really need to look at is a combination of both tax and borrowings, because borrowings is of course deferred taxation. If you only look at the taxation as a percentage of GDP you are not getting the full picture, you are not getting the full understanding of how much money a government of the day is actually spending as a percentage of the overall economy. The truth requires that you look at both tax and borrowings and then look at that percentage. A better indicator would be spending as a percentage of GDP rather than taxation.




Senator Wong:
  On the 24 per cent—first time since the 1980s; 40 years. I'll take that.




Senator BUSHBY:
  Senator Wong was interjecting there, but the reality is that spending gives you a much better idea, particularly if you take into account those things that are off budget, like the NBN—another spending which this government is incurring which formed part of its $120 billion budget black hole.


So let us have a look at the $120 billion budget black hole that this government is facing. It is now presenting Australians with this black hole, and it is growing by the day. A lot of the spending that is being added to this black hole is occurring because the government is desperate. It is looking to make promises—to solve problems all over the place—but there is no money to back it up. The government thinks that it can promise the world and it will worry about how it will pay for it later. The budget bottom line has already been hit by Labor's multibillion dollar blowout on border protection, as an example. Labor's budget will be further hit by massive unfunded commitments in disability services, defence, education, dental and maybe even now childcare payments to private sector employees.


Australians are entitled to ask where the money is coming from. We asked Minister Wong that question today, but the minister's answers were certainly deficient and the only option she had when asked those questions was the classic Labor Party tactic of divert and attack and to try to turn it all around and attack the opposition, using the spurious lines that it uses against us. Labor does not know where the money is going to come from. It has no idea. It is just going out and making promises, with no ability to actually back up those spending commitments with real dollars. In doing so, it is raising the hopes of Australians that a lot of these very serious issues—things that actually do need consideration—are going to be dealt with by this government, when the reality is that the money just is not there to be able to do that. The government continues to make heroic promises and there is no detail of where the money is coming from.


Let us look at what that $120 billion budget black hole is comprised of. It is important to remember that this $120 billion budget black hole is not actually included in the budget. This is all over and above the money that the government has indicated that it is going to spend in the budget. So what have we got? We have got the National Disability Insurance Scheme, which represents about $10½ billion a year once fully operational from 2018-19 and the many billions that are needed to be spent to get the thing up and running between now and 2018-19. In aged care, the government has promised a further $3.7 billion in new money over the next five years. For low-paid workers, there is an extra $1 billion government contribution to Fair Work Australia for the pay rise for social and community sector workers—taking the total commitment to $3 billion to 2021.


For offshore processing, there is $2.1 billion for reopening Nauru and Manus Island, on top of the cost blow-out that has already occurred as a result of the huge increase in numbers of people arriving by boat. The increase in the refugee intake to 20,000 is estimated to cost an extra $1.4 billion over the forward estimates. In defence, there is $36 billion for submarines and $16 billion for joint strike fighters—all unaccounted for. The Greens dental care scheme that they have been pushed into—a $4 billion package which was announced on 29 August 2012—is unfunded. There is $6.5 billion a year for implementation of the Gonski education reforms. But the Prime Minister has tried to hide the true cost by placing it outside the forward estimates.


Then there are Labor's off-budget commitments of $50 billion for the NBN and the $10 billion for the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. I could go further but, with $120 billion unfunded, where is the money coming from?

"Thistlethwaite, Sen Matt",ALP,2012-09-19,"



Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales) (15:23):  Senator Fifield pontificated that the position of the Australian economy at the moment is a direct result of decisions made by this government. By George, I agree with him! The position of the Australian economy at the moment is in fact directly related to decisions made by this government. Let us look at the position of the Australian economy. Unemployment, at 5.1 per cent, is almost half that of Europe and the United States. Interest rates in this country, at 3.5 per cent, are lower than they ever were under the Howard government, and inflation is under three per cent. Since this government came to office in 2007, 800,000 jobs have been created. More people are in work in Australia than ever before. Our debt levels are eight per cent of GDP, which is lower than most averages throughout Europe and, of course, the United States. How many businesses in this country have a level of debt less than 10 per cent? How many households have a level of debt less than 10 per cent? Not too many. This government gets a big tick when it comes to management of the debt situation.


Spending as a proportion of GDP is lower than it ever was under the Howard government. We managed to be one of the very few economies to avoid recession during the global financial crisis. So when Senator Fifield talks about the decisions of this government and their bearing on the economy, we are proud to stand on our record of economic management. But do not take it from me; take it from the independent experts. Today, yet again, Standard & Poors have reaffirmed this nation's AAA credit rating—a rolled-gold tick of approval for this government's management of our economy, the strength of our economy, the low levels of debt, the strong budgetary position and the Gillard government's strong management of our economy.


I find it highly hypocritical for those opposite to come into this chamber today and criticise the government for its budgetary position, particularly given that they refused to announce many of their election promises and have them costed. They refused to take part in the independent process of verification of election costings that was set up under the former Howard government by Treasurer Costello and is now overseen by the independent Parliamentary Budget Office. So they are completely hypocritical in coming into this chamber and criticising this government for its fiscal position and management of our nation's budget.


There is also the issue of who the government manages the economy for, and we see this in many of the government's decisions, such as introducing a minerals resource rent tax to ensure that the benefits of the mining boom are spread evenly amongst our economy and workers. The private health insurance rebate has been made much fairer under Labor. We are working towards the provision of a national disability insurance scheme and we are delivering increases in funding to education. These measures are completely opposed by the coalition.


We can see, in the management of the states, how the coalition would approach budgets should they come to government federally. The Newman government in Queensland cut 14,000 jobs from the public service. And these are not back-of-house jobs but important front-line jobs: nurses, teachers, doctors, palliative care workers and firefighters have all been cut because of the Newman government's decisions relating to their budget. 


In New South Wales they have cut $1.7 billion from education, with every student in every school to be affected; and they have cut $3 billion from health. In Victoria, they have taken an axe to the TAFE system and vocational education and training. And they come into this chamber and lecture this government, which has just had its management of the economy and our nation's budgetary position reaffirmed with a AAA credit rating. They criticise this government's fiscal management and fiscal rectitude—and this is from the mob whose accountants at the last election ended up being fined, who get a catering company to do their costings and who will not commit to the Charter of Budget Honesty.

"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2012-09-19,"



Senator BOYCE
 (Queensland) (15:28):  I also take note of answers by Senator Wong to questions asked by Senators Abetz, Cormann and Sinodinos. The Labor government currently have two choices. They are going to have to increase taxes or they are going to have to fold at the next election. From the way they are currently conducting their business, it seems pretty clear that they are promising to spend up big while they think they still have the opportunity to make promises, but they have no way whatsoever of knowing how those promises are going to be funded when—if—they ever return to government.


It is pretty clear that there is a real move within this Labor government to increase taxes. Of course, that is the sort of thing you expect from a Labor government: get yourself into extreme debt and then try to wiggle your way out of it by increasing taxes. The major newspaper in my own state, the Courier-Mail, quotes Senator Doug Cameron as saying:


'When you see what is happening in Queensland and New South Wales … of course we can't criticise these other governments if we are doing the same thing ourselves. If the tax base doesn't increase, my concern is we will end up losing jobs and import-ant programs.


That is going to be the outcome. They are going to have to cut jobs, increase taxes or simply fold up their tent and let the party that is the party of good economic management clean up their mess yet again.


It has been interesting to watch Treasurer Swan and Prime Minister Gillard attempt to somehow suggest that the issues in Queensland and New South Wales have been curtain-raisers for the way an Abbott government would behave. An Abbott government will not behave like that, but the one thing an Abbott government will have in common with the Queensland and New South Wales governments is the fact that we are left to clean up the mess created in budgetary terms by a Labor government—typical yet again. They can spend and spend and never feel that they have to be accountable for that, because they go off on their little ideological trips and forget about what needs to happen.


It is extraordinary when we look at the extent of the unfunded proposals put up by this government. The National Disability Insurance Scheme is something very dear to my heart, but it is something that will break the hearts of thousands and thousands of people with disabilities and their families if it does not come to fruition. But there is nothing that this government has done to suggest that it will have the money needed in the next budget and the other budgets up until 2015 to progress the National Disability Insurance Scheme unless it increases taxes and cut jobs. There is nothing to show that they will have the funds to undertake their airy-fairy election-winning—hopefully, I think, for them—promises with regard to the Gonski education reforms. 


Then of course we have the cruellest joke of all, which is the unfunded dental scheme which would be extended from children between 12 and 18 to children between two and 18. This would completely replace what has been a very successful chronic disease dental scheme that was developed under the then health minister, Tony Abbott. What Labor forgets to mention is that for the 19 months between when they closed down the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme and start their own scheme, there will be no funding of any sort from the Commonwealth government for dental. I continue to be bemused by the fact that the Greens could have gone along with this unfunded scheme that is on the never-never like so many of the other bubbles of pretend policy that come out of this government.

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2012-09-19,"



Senator JOHNSTON
 (Western Australia) (15:53):  I want to deal with a very important issue in terms of Australia's national security that has evolved—particularly over the last three years but more broadly over the last four—since Labor was elected to government in 2007.


Labor has cut $25 billion from the Defence budget since the Defence white paper of May 2009. In the latest budget cut they cut spending by 10.5 per cent, reducing the share of GDP spent on defence to 1.56 per cent. That is the lowest level in 74 years. Next year, 2013-14, will see that share of the vote for defence go to 1.49 per cent. That is the lowest share of the national budget since 1937. This government is taking us back more than 70 years in defence funding. In 2009 the Labor Party boldly put forward a plan of three per cent real growth, indexed at 2.5 per cent out to 2017-18 and at 2.2 per cent thereafter to 2030. They also put forward a strategic reform program and a very bold defence capability plan. Not for one second has this government funded that plan. They put on the table a very significant plan for Australia's national security and defence funding—a plan which the opposition supported. Then we see, four days prior to this year's May budget, the Minister for Defence announcing a $5.5 billion cut from the Defence budget into the forward estimates. Coupled with these cuts, deferrals and delays, there has been a total of $25 billion taken out of Defence since the release of the 2009 white paper. The minister seeks to insult our intelligence by telling us that this will have no effect on front-line capability. We have young men and women in forward operating bases in Tarin Kot, Al Minhad, Kandahar and Kabul who are fighting the war against terrorism for all of us. It is an insult to our intelligence to think that budget cuts of these magnitudes will not affect their training and their equipment—and their training with new combat equipment. This is delusional.


I want to draw the Senate's attention to the words of Dr Mark Thomson, a very esteemed and respected commentator from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. In the latest budget analysis he said:


The plans set out in 2009 are in disarray; investment is badly stalled, and the defence budget is an unsustainable mess.


That is what the defence minister has delivered to Australia: an unsustainable mess in defence funding. So inept are this minister and this government that they actually returned to general revenue $1.5 billion they were unable to spend last year. This is a scandal.


This week we have seen a further incident. A very highly respected, esteemed and experienced man was transferred from his post as Secretary of the Department of Defence—a man laden with corporate knowledge, former Major General Duncan Lewis, the former Special Operations Commander and Australia's National Security Adviser. This very esteemed, knowledgeable secretary had a five-year contract. One year into that contract he was taken from Defence and moved sideways. This is a significant negative event for Defence on top of these budget cuts. Why did this happen? What is it all about? Looking back through what has gone before in recent weeks, I see that former Major General Lewis told an ASPI dinner recently:


As things stand I don’t think we are structured or postured appropriately to meet our likely strategic circumstances in future.


He then went on to say:


We have come a long way since Mr Tange harangued the services in 1973, but if we don’t go further—much further—we run the risk of becoming irrelevant.


These are not words this minister could possibly wish to hear.


Can I say that one of the reasons why the opposition is so concerned about Defence funding is that this government's budget plans for a surplus—a notional surplus; a mythical, Walt Disney surplus—are in complete and utter disarray? They are founded upon a carbon tax that this government has decided not to go forward with in the technical sense that it was designed. This budget surplus is founded upon a mining tax that has had the guts cut out of it by the states increasing their royalties and by declining coal and iron ore prices. This has left the government with nowhere to go and a massive black hole in financing.


What really worries me is that the next round—the midyear financial economic statements—is going to take further money from the Defence portfolio. This minister and this government treat Defence as nothing more or less than an ATM. When they ring up the numbers on their calculator and they do not come in as they would like, they reach into Defence and pull out billions of dollars. This must have—logically and with common sense—a very significant impact and effect.


Can I very briefly talk about Navy? We have recently had two very damning and significant reports. The Rizzo report says that in terms of engineering all of our Navy ships are in a very poor state of repair. Then we have Mr Coles telling us about submarines. Both reports detail gross technical and cultural failures. I pause to say that Mr Coles's second instalment is due as of now. I have it on reasonable authority that his second report is so damning and so condemning of the administration of this government and this minister that it will be restricted. The report will not be released for public consumption.


The minister himself has been critical of Defence when he found he had no amphibious capability in the face of Cyclone Yasi in Queensland in 2011. We have seen vessels that have fallen into complete disrepair and which have had to be cashiered long before they were expected to be:Manoora and Kanimbla, two of our most significant amphibious assault ships. They are tied up in Sydney and are to be put down, if you like. The Choules was purchased at great expense—$100 million. The first time we took it out of the Heads in Sydney we burned out a transformer and it is out of action for six months.


Can I tell you that Success is in urgent need of being replaced? We have spent approximately $100 million on Success and it will not go sailing ever again. It has instability problems and the whole of the second skinning of it has been a failure. It is everything that you look at in terms of Navy's management: I think we really only have three surface capital ships that do not have some form of major engineering or mechanical fault. And what is the minister doing about all of this? While there is massive investment in the maritime on the North-West shelf of Western Australia, we are a trading nation. What is this government doing? What is this minister doing? Nothing more or less than cutting the Defence budget.


We have had 25,000 people coming to our shores in unauthorised fashion this year, and this government cuts Defence— (Time expired)

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2012-09-19,"



Senator CROSSIN
 (Northern Territory) (16:03):  Just at the start of my contribution to this matter of public importance, I rise to say to the coalition opposite me that this afternoon's debate really is a facade. It is on because there are members of the Defence Force in this building as part of the Parliamentary Defence Program.


In fact, if the opposition were really serious about having a debate about Defence they would not have struggled to get their five members on their feet to support this. If I go to section 75 of the standing orders, it says:


… in order to proceed the proposal must be supported by 4 senators, not including the proposer, rising in their places.




Senator Brandis:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I know that latitude is given on these debates on the issue of relevance, but I would submit to you that, given that the Senate standing orders requirement has been satisfied, and it is not suggested that it has not been satisfied; and given that we are now embarked on this debate, it is necessary, in order to be relevant—even in the most extended understanding of that term—for the senator to address the topic before the chair.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I will remind Senator Crossin of the debate, even though the context of the standing orders relates to the debate. But I draw her attention to the debate at hand.




Senator CROSSIN:
  Mr Deputy President, they have been caught out, flapping around like a fish out of water. This is what happened: they decided today that they would put up an MPI about Defence and the budget. But what happened? Senator Johnston proposes it and gets to his feet. That is all fine. And their whip, Senator Kroger, gets to her feet. That is all fine. And the manager of the opposition, Senator Fifield, gets to his feet. That is all fine. But Senator Back and Senator Ruston get to their feet and they are not in their places. The standing orders specifically say:


… supported by 4 senators … rising in their places




Senator Brandis:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Your indication to the Senator is now being openly defied.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I know that we can link Senator Crossin's comments back to the debate because she is referencing the debate in relation to the standing orders that govern the debate. But, Senator Crossin, in the spirit of the debate I would ask that you address the matter concerning the debate.




Senator CROSSIN:
  That is right, and we are talking about an MPI that relates to Defence and the budget.


Finally, when you in the chair, Mr Deputy President, suggest that perhaps the matter was supported, Senator Boyce jumps to her feet because she realises that she needs to be the fifth person.


The point I am getting at here is that if the opposition were really serious about what is happening in Defence and the state of the defence budget they would be all lined up, sitting in their places and ready to jump up like a jack-in-the-box to prove they are serious about a debate on defence. They would not be scratching around like a crow looking for a worm, trying to find at least five of their members who could support this MPI. It was not the case that they were all lined up; they had to scratch around to find five. Occasionally when you look you think it is supported because there are a whole lot of people standing up, but in fact they were not in their right places. They do not know what to do and they do not have a strategy.




Senator Brandis:
  Mr Deputy President, on a point of order, seriously: the senator is now a quarter of the way through her time and has not addressed the topic at all. Her colleague Senator Mark Bishop, who does know something about defence, has come into the chamber and is visibly embarrassed by Senator Crossin. I ask you to insist that Senator Crossin address the topic of the MPI.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Mr Deputy President, on the point of order: the senator is addressing the topic. In reflecting on the level of support in this chamber from Senator Johnston's colleagues she is directly relevant to the topic. Senator Brandis is making much of nothing, for the third time.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Crossin, I indicated earlier that you are technically correct by referring to the standing orders that govern the debate, but the spirit of this particular aspect has been that we discuss the matters and the subject topic before the chamber. I would ask that senators undertake that spirit of the discussion in relation to this matter of public importance. Also, Senator Crossin, you need to be careful not to reflect on the chair. I called that in order as the matter was proposed. You have the call.




Senator CROSSIN:
  Thank you, Mr Deputy President, and you are right, you did call it in order after a few minutes of grappling around trying to find five people who were going to support it. And Senator Brandis, if I have significantly got up your nose and upset you, I am really pleased about that. Perhaps what I could do again is highlight to the people who might be listening on broadcast that there is not sufficient support across the other side of this chamber for a decent debate on defence.


If we are going to put a discussion about the defence budget in perspective, in 2009-10 the Labor government, for the first time, budgeted over $100 billion for defence across the forward estimates. That was the first time that had been done, and it took a Labor government to do that. In this 2012-13 budget the government has budgeted $103.3 billion for defence across the four-year forward estimates period. This level of funding will maintain Australia's status in the top 15 nations in terms of world defence expenditure, along with Canada either 13th or 14th on that list.


The global fiscal environment has affected the funding that many governments are devoting to defence. Countries such as the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom have all recently announced reductions to their defence spending. On a per capita basis, Australia continues to be second on the list of military expenditure in the G7 countries. Senator Brandis, put that figure your head as you walk out: we are second on the list of military expenditure by G7 countries. In real dollar terms, we spend a far greater amount than any of our regional neighbours.


As part of the 2012-13 budget, there has also been a significant reprioritisation of $2.9 billion to ensure that funding is directed to high-priority areas including a range of new—that is new—cost pressures across the portfolio, including the following priority areas for investment. So let us have a look at exactly what they are: $700 million additional investment in Collins class submarine sustainment; $550 million for information technology remediation activities across Defence; $400 million for improved housing for Australian Defence Force personnel; $330 million for relocation of defence units from Moorebank to Holsworthy to allow development of the intermodal transport hub; $270 million in additional funding for Navy fleet sustainment; $220 million for investment in maintenance and upgrade of the defence estate; $160 million for fringe benefits tax liabilities; $150 million for enhanced garrison support services; and, finally, $70 million for further investment in international engagement under the Defence Cooperation Program. These are some of the areas that we have had to resource. We have had to look at the defence budget recommendations to work out how we meet these and to ensure we have minimum impact on the delivery of core defence capabilities. We are doing this.


But what does the budget review actually mean for our troops? As a senator for the Northern Territory and living in Darwin, I know that we have had thousands of members of the defence forces who have been on operations for our country in recent years. The 1st Brigade is once again preparing some of these troops for operations in Afghanistan, and I want to use this opportunity put on the record my strong and unwavering commitment to our troops in Afghanistan. The protection of our forces over there is, and has always been, our highest priority. Our government has committed to force protection initiatives worth $1.6 billion following the Force Protection Review initiated by former defence minister Senator Faulkner. The improvements delivered so far include new lighter body armour, upgraded combat helmets, longer range machine guns and upgraded Bushmaster vehicles.


As many of you would know, the insurgents in Uruzgan province use IEDs, improvised explosive devices, to hit our troops and our troops were suffering from some of the heavy injuries they sustained, including loss of limbs and in some cases loss of life. So, on 12 December last year, the Minister for Defence, Minister Smith, and the Minister for Defence Materiel, Minister Clare, announced the purchase of four route clearance systems that will be used by Australian Army engineers to detect and clear explosive hazards, creating a safer pathway for troops as they patrol Uruzgan province.


At that time our ministers also announced that we will upgrade around 200 Bushmaster vehicles to provide troops with an even higher level of protection against IEDs. The upgrades are occurring and include energy-absorbing seats and stronger welding to reduce further the probability of lower limb and spinal injury occurring from an explosion.


Bushmasters have saved Australian lives in Afghanistan. The vehicles have proven to be very effective, providing Australian troops with mobility and protection, particularly against these damaging IEDs. I recently represented my colleague Minister Warren Snowdon at the Australian Industry and Defence Network-Northern Territory gala awards dinner in Darwin and I had the privilege of having a look at the static display of the Bushmaster and other hardened vehicles that were there with, of course, their professional and knowledgeable crews from the Australian Defence Force on hand to guide us through this new upgrade. I had a look in a Bushmaster. It was quite impressive as to the reinforcements, the length and now the capability of this vehicle.


On 12 July this year, Minister Smith and Minister Clare announced the proposed acquisition of a further 214 Bushmaster Protected Mobility Vehicles for the ADF. This announcement is in addition to the purchase of 101 Bushmasters announced by the government in May last year. So we are listening. We have reversed recommended budget measures in relation to airfares for single people. We have a defence community that deserves the best support, a defence community that will, as we know, ensure that our country is posturing efficiently, effectively and intelligently into the future. This government recognises this by the way in which we fund our Defence Force, by the way in which we support our groups on the ground out in the field in Afghanistan. As I said at the beginning of my speech, this is a government that has, for the first time in many years, provided an increase in this budget over the forward estimates. (Time expired)

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2012-09-19,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (16:16):  I am glad that the coalition have brought forward this MPI motion this afternoon. I think that much too often this hour is a total waste of oxygen and I tend to avoid it, but this particular subject does deserve further scrutiny. I listened carefully to Senator Johnston's remarks and I found myself in agreement with some of them, particularly where he refers to the direction taken by the 2009 Defence white paper but then the decisions taken subsequently to avoid grappling with some of the priorities that it set out. I think in essence what we have done is set the Australian Defence Force and the Defence Materiel Organisation an impossible task. I was hoping for a contribution from Senator Crossin that would maybe take us back to first principles. Maybe Senator Bishop or Senator Feeney, who do know a fair bit about this area, can help answer some of the questions that I am going to put this afternoon about why we write white papers in the first place and even go back to first principles as to why we maintain the degree of defence spending that we do. Minister Smith put forward, at an Australian Strategic Policy Institute event, fairly recently the standard, which I think would be acceptable and understood by most Australians as to their expectation, that the purpose and the reason why we do this is for 'the defence of Australia against a direct armed attack'. However, the 2009 white paper significantly confuses this. The traditional and most clearly understood explanation of the reason that we maintain the defence forces that we do is for 'the defence of Australia against a direct armed attack'. Actually it is not the direct experience of the deployments in the post-war era, which are obviously a very significant marker and a way to define the period. That is not at all what the Australian Defence Force has been doing. I want to quote an article by Hugh White in the September issue of The Monthly. He is somebody who does an enormous amount of thinking about these issues. He says:


… few people in government or Defence think that Australia faces any credible risk of major military attack, and fewer still believe we could defend ourselves if we did … Of course, apart from defending our shores, the ADF has always had something to do—peacekeeping in the Middle East,—


I suspect he uses that term euphemistically, if the invasion of two countries on the other side of the world could be described as peacekeeping, but we will let that go— 


nation-building in East Timor, tsunami relief in Indonesia or fighting bushfires in Victoria—but these aren't reasons enough to have a defence force.


It is an extremely thought-provoking article. To my mind, it goes to an enormous degree to how the 2009 Defence white paper set an impossible range of strategic goals. Since then, as Senator Johnston quite ably demonstrated, the Australian government has failed to provide the resources needed. In effect, that might be a good thing because I think in fact some of the positions taken in the Defence white paper of 2009 are significantly flawed. The procurement decisions that go back several decades and the force structure that prevails at the moment are significantly confused and do not pay regard to the idea that this is about 'the defence of Australia against a direct armed attack'. In fact, what we are kitting ourselves out for is providing force elements to expeditionary invasions by the United States government on the far side of the world or the more prosaic, but to my mind far more important, interventions in our regions where in many instances the ADF were welcomed or, for that matter, those domestic interventions, such as after the floods in Queensland or the Victorian bushfires, where in many instances the first boots on the ground are those of the Australian Defence Force. But the white paper sets us on a path of building 12 gigantic submarines and sets us on a path of procuring joint strike fighters at the cost of billions and billions of dollars. We have kitted out main battle tanks apparently for fighting battles of World War II. There are the air warfare destroyers that appear to be aimed at giving us significant offensive capabilities in the region. But, to my mind, that goes directly against defence minister Smith's observations at the ASPI event. I think there is substantial confusion at the very headwaters, if you like, that then leads to all the ongoing procurement decisions and debacles that we have seen in recent years as to what kinds of security challenges and genuine security threats, of the century that we are now in the second decade of, look like and therefore how we should kit ourselves out particularly, in a more narrow sense, for the role that we want the ADF to play.


There is one issue that I would like to raise and I suppose senators will understand why I raise it. I am going to quote the Lowy Institute, who pointed out as long ago as in 2006:


Climate change is fast emerging as the security issue of the 21st century, overshadowing terrorism and even the spread of weapons of mass destruction as the threat most likely to cause mega-death and contribute to state failure, forced population movements, food and water scarcity and the spread of infectious diseases …


I was reading from a document so I could not tell whether there was eye-rolling around the chamber over the fact that a Greens senator would seek to link climate change as a genuine security threat, because in fact the 2009 white paper reduces that issue to a footnote and suggests that we do not need to worry about climate change as impact on national security until the 2030s, which I think is absolutely delusional and quite dangerous. If you look at the literature you see that a large number of situations around the world at the moment in various trouble spots and regions of great political and military instability already have the fingerprints of climate change on them. This is not something abstract about parts per million of CO2 in the atmosphere; it is about water resources disappearing. It is about changes in the ability of given regions to produce food, which can then have direct impacts on political stability.


I understand this from a book which I would thoroughly recommend—I would table 76 copies of it if I had them with me—called Tropic of Chaos, which goes through trouble spots around the world and identifies the fingerprints of climate change. It does not matter whether or not you believe it is human induced. I will come to that in a moment. The ADF apparently developed a classified report in 2007 identifying the threat of climate security, but the white paper, for reasons I cannot fathom, said that it should be dealt with in 2030. The attorney for US Army Environmental Command states:


For the military, whether the warming is caused by man, is naturally occurring, or is some combination of the two is immaterial. The military cannot wait for the science to be perfected to begin planning for the potential effects of global climate change.


We know that budgets are tight and resources are not endless, but I am extremely concerned that we are nonetheless posturing our defence forces for the wrong kinds of conflict. Of course we have to be prepared for direct armed attack, but I believe we have to be prepared for the kind of low-intensity conflicts that are already arising around the world as a result of instability brought on in fragile states by climate change. It is something that I do not believe can be ignored any further.


I do not believe the traditional state-to-state war scenario should be the sole focus of defence spending, particularly in the context of the kind of situations that we are already sending the ADF into, in which some of the gigantic procurement decisions made by this government will be utterly useless. While we are spending money on things like a gigantic fleet of submarines to put us into the South China Sea, air warfare destroyers or Joint Strike Fighters, the enormous opportunity costs of those spending decisions mean that we cannot do certain things. I think that, in fact, directly undermines our defence capabilities. The lack of a consistent, coherent, honest and independent national security strategy is seriously a threat to us at the moment. Defence spending without that national security strategy really undermines our security.


With greatest respect to Senator Johnston, simply quoting defence spending as a ratio of GDP is utterly valueless. Who cares? Are we getting value for money? Are we getting the kind of capabilities that we are going to need to confront the security challenges of this century? Those are the things that I want to know. The financial metrics that Senator Johnston is putting before the chamber I dismiss as completely irrelevant. What matters, I think, is whether we are going to be properly positioned to face up to the genuine security threats, what our strategy is for meeting and responding to those threats, mitigating those that we can, adapting to those that we cannot mitigate and only then coming to the decision of what role we want the ADF to play. The opposition have declared themselves not competent, because the senior leadership team is infested with climate change deniers. Can you imagine if you took into national security debates denial of the most significant security threat of the 21st century and simply pretended that it was not happening?



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator LUDLAM:
  I notice some of the senators are acting up, and this will be hard to hear. You are pretending that the most significant security threat facing the world's nations in this century does not exist. How lovely for you! How nice that must be!


I look forward to the development of the next white paper. I hope it is not a wasted or missed opportunity. But one thing I want to underline is that we cannot wait until the 2030s to confront these questions. (Time expired)

"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2012-09-19,"



Senator HUMPHRIES
 (Australian Capital Territory) (16:26):  Another wacky, off-the-wall, largely irrelevant contribution from the Greens. I do not quite know what Senator Ludlam was saying in all of that but I do know that the Greens have fairly consistently said that they do not support a well-resourced Defence Force. They would cut Defence very sharply, so as far as this debate is concerned they fall very much on the side of the government even though they have taken a little trouble today to pretend that they have a difference of view with them.


What we have today is a government with, effectively, no policy on defence. The government came to office talking the talk about wanting to have a strong Defence Force. The then Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, brought forward in 2009 an ambitious scheme for resourcing and building a strong Defence Force with a very impressive shopping list of kit for the Defence Force over the next 20 years, leading to a new, refreshed, re-equipped Defence Force in 2030. We can argue about whether or not it was a good vision, but it was at least a vision.


The problem with this vision was that, almost from the first day it hit the deck, it began to crumble. It began to disappear. Bits and pieces were pulled out here and there until, eventually, in this year's budget the government took the 2009 white paper quietly out the back and shot it. It is not around anymore. It is gone. It is dead in the water. This white paper was hard to believe to begin with and became positively incredible by the time it was put to sleep.


So we have now a situation where the government has systematically withdrawn the resources from the Defence Force—and particularly Defence acquisition—which would have been necessary to build either the 2009 white paper that Mr Rudd postulated or, indeed, any other kind of credible Australian Defence Force for the challenges of the 21st century. It is impossible to imagine that what this government is doing is anything other than treating the Defence budget as a gigantic cash cow to raid at will as it finds itself running seriously short of cash and needing to find some way of supporting the increasingly improbable, razor-thin budget surplus of 2012-13. And it is not just me who has said that; it is every expert in this area. Every person who is a serious commentator on the defence scene in this country and beyond who has bothered to comment on this has made very much the same kind of conclusion. There is nothing to support this government's plan.


Senator Crossin's rather thinly disguised ignorance in this area demonstrated how bad the government is at engaging with this question. She talked about how the government has notched up $100 billion in spending on defence, but that is over four years. It is an easy claim to make over four years. The reality is that the defence spending in the budget is not going up. It is going down, and amalgamating the figures over four years does not alter that fact.


Senator Crossin talked about the extra spending in the portfolio and she talked about $700 million being spent on the Collins replacement project. There is not a person in Australia who has even the slightest interest in Collins and our submarine capability who does not know that that $700 million is about papering over the reality that the government does not have a plan to build a new submarine. It needed to have made the decision two or three years ago on the new submarine. It cannot make that decision. It is stymied. It is paralysed by fear. It is a rabbit caught in the headlights on the question of the submarine and, as a result, is commissioning more interim studies to bide the time until somebody else takes the reins, preferably a party of a different persuasion, and makes the big decision for them. Nothing is happening with this, and pretending that there is somehow a commitment to spending in the defence sector is just laughable.


I have said that this is an absolutely deplorable situation but what do other people think about this? Professor Alan Dupont, from the University of New South Wales, has made devastating comments about the way in which the defence budget has been handled and about the decline in defence spending. Peter Cosgrove, a former Defence chief, said:


I do worry that we are developing some gaps in our defence structure that will be very tough to claw back later on. I may not be as pessimistic as (others), but I would applaud the day when we can restore a high level of funding for defence.


Peter Cosgrove is a very credible figure in this landscape. Peter Leahy, a former Chief of Army and now professor at the University of Canberra, said:


The 2009 white paper is dead on the floor, butchered by the withdrawal of funds. There's no way they can deliver it. On current funding levels, there will need to be dramatic changes.


Mark Thomson, from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said:


… in the last budget there were savings methods across the decade of $2.9bn in increased efficiencies, and efficiency dividend of $400 million, and that brings us to $12bn.


He is referring to the so-called savings there. He said further:


You have to look back to the draw-down from Korea in 1953 to see anything like this.


Hugh White, who has already been quoted in this debate, said:


WE SHOULD thank Julia Gillard and Wayne Swan. Their budget cuts have destroyed the defence policy of the 2009 white paper, and that is a good thing because it was a bad policy.


He went on to say:


We pretend to be a middle power and we say we're a middle power but we have the defence capability of a small power.


That is a very disturbing comment for him to make, because it reflects what most people think, that under this government we have seen a draw-down capability.




Senator Feeney:
  So is Hugh White's strategic vision one you are signing up to?




Senator HUMPHRIES:
  You will get your turn in a minute, Senator Feeney. For the Minister for Foreign Affairs to say in the Senate last week that 'there will be no adverse impact on operations—they are all fully funded' is ridiculous. It is like saying: 'We're sending the Australian Olympic team to London. When they're there they'll have all the resources that they need but when they get back to Australia there will be no money for training. There will be no money for recruiting and there will be no money for the things that drive our level of excellence in sport.' It is preposterous to suggest that we can make the kinds of cuts, $25 billion worth of cuts, in the defence budget that this government is making and pretend that they do not affect frontline operations of the Australian Defence Force. Of course they do and only, with respect, fools would maintain that somehow these cuts are not affecting the frontline of Australia's defence, particularly in operations like Afghanistan. We have the midyear economic statement to come in which we can expect more of the same. You need more money, you have to make big cuts to get your mythical surplus back into some kind of pretend reality and there will be more cuts to come in this budget. It is an absolutely deplorable situation. The men and women in uniform know that as well. Senator Bishop, I challenge you to cite a single authority that has endorsed your approach to the defence cuts in this budget.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2012-09-19,"



Senator MARK BISHOP
 (Western Australia) (16:34):  In some respects, the motion really is most unfortunate. It represents—




Senator Humphries:
  It's not a motion.




Senator MARK BISHOP:
  The motion before the chair.




Senator Humphries:
  It's not a motion; it’s a matter of public importance.




Senator MARK BISHOP:
  The motion before the chair is in some respects most unfortunate. It misrepresents the factual situation in a very deliberate and partisan way. It is as though the opposition believes or seeks to assert that two years of the Gillard government is totally responsible for the aggregation of problems that bedevil Defence and challenge government ministers of either persuasion. Let me acknowledge two matters at the outset: first, I readily concede that there are significant ongoing structural problems facing Defence, the defence community and what is commonly known as the defence family; second, I assert that the only way to permanently and properly address those matters is primarily through a bipartisan approach of the major parties likely to hold the Defence portfolio in government. So at the outset I do criticise the opposition for bringing in an overtly partisan motion on defence to the Senate yet I proffer a solution in my remarks that is, at its heart, structurally non-partisan.


Let me say also that our government brings good form to this debate, a considered approach and a set of significant achievements over its four years in government. Let me outline our form in one respect only to put it on the public record. The then opposition in the period from 2000 to 2007 spent an inordinate amount of time getting on top of important issues in defence, with inquiries, parliamentary committees, committees of review, relationship building with Department of Defence officials and, critically at the time, strong support to Howard government proposals for acquisition or reform. That work resulted in the white paper 2007-08. That critically resulted in the development of a strategic reform plan, worked out in conjunction with the service chiefs. It was agreed we needed to find $20 billion in savings over a 10-year period. That agreed level of savings was done by negotiation with the service chiefs and through engagement with industry. The key decision was to plough all of those savings back into Defence budgets.


The first two years of the strategic reform plan worked well. Savings targets were achieved. Moneys were ploughed back into Defence budgets. Capability acquisitions were fully funded—in fact, so overfunded that some funds were returned to government. The net of that two or three years work is that the strategic reform plan instituted and implemented by this government has been working well. But I do not say for one minute that it is enough. It is only a start and can only be a start.


Why do I then say we need to have a revised, renewed and reinvigorated bipartisan approach to Defence matters? I say that because in the last two weeks the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee has tabled a major report into Defence procurement, which is at the heart of the defence budget—the subject matter of the MPI before the chair today. That references committee, as we all know, is chaired by an opposition senator. There are three or four opposition members, only two government senators and one Greens or Independent senator. It spent 18 months on its inquiry and delivered a unanimous report with a unanimous set of findings and a unanimous set of recommendations. Major budget and account issues were discussed between the members and agreed between the members and they offered a considered way forward to a promised land of achievement and satisfaction in Defence.


Everyone in the Defence community knows the principal problems in Defence procurement are cost blow-outs, schedule and time delays, and flawed risk analysis. In any project that has gone overboard in the last 20 years, any one or all three of these problems were the cause. Why does that continue to occur year in year out under successive governments, successive ministers, successive chiefs of defence, successive service chiefs and successive departmental secretaries? Only this week we saw the appointment of a new departmental secretary—roughly the 4,000th in the last 16 years. It is really just not good enough when soldiers are dying at the other end of the world.


Let me put on the public record a potential solution which, if faithfully implemented, might overcome this recurring, useless, tired set of problems which seem apparently intractable but which are not. I suggest we adopt four principles for Defence budgeting, Defence accounting and Defence management: accountability, transparency, responsibility and empowerment. Apply these four principles across the board to the military arms, the civilian workforce and the DMO within the wider Defence community. In practice, it means organisational change and significant streamlining. Firstly, empower each service chief, not a committee, with full responsibility for all facets of project delivery post second-pass decision by government. Secondly, restructure the DMO so it becomes a specialist acquisition agency, independent of CDF and reporting to the minister, that is properly a centre of excellence in a critical world. Thirdly, provide for a targeted, yet limited, strategic role for the Capability Development Group. Fourthly, eliminate the competition between sectors of the Defence community for technical and engineering capability.


What we have at the moment between each of the services, the DMO and the Capability Development Group is the most useless, senseless, worthless and expensive form of competition for recruitment of highly skilled labour in engineering and technical capacities. You could not manufacture a greater waste of time than the Navy, DMO and the Capability Development Group competing to attract and retain the same group of highly skilled technical and engineering people. The net result has been that the DMO has hundreds and hundreds of vacant positions on the engineering side of its organisation. The Capability Development Group needs to take advice from Navy. But guess what? The Rizzo review and the other report that came down revealed in considerable detail that Navy has just about zero engineering capability. It has been run down and run down over the last 15 or 20 years—really since the 1988-89 period. It is inconceivable when you think about trying to run the most technically advanced warships in the world, which at their heart are nothing other than floating electronic factories, that the Navy has vacancies in the hundreds and hundreds for engineers and like classifications.


The fifth thing that should occur is that we should inject real contestability into decision making and guarantee that whichever government—our government or the coalition's government—is provided with independent advice from key agencies. That is sound, thought-out, thorough and independent advice from the DMO, the DSTO and technical experts, because all the floating set of committees we currently endure do is sieve out and reduce to very senseless and basic propositions very complex issues that do not get the attention of government. That is one of the root causes of why projects go bad, remain bad and continue to get worse for five, seven or nine years until all of a sudden some minister gets a file on his desk 10 years after the project commenced and has to do a presser and cancel $1.6 billion—just write it off—because the platform will not fly or sail or anything it was designed to do. With any problem or set of problems there is always a solution, and the solution is at hand. (Time expired)

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2012-09-19,"



Senator RONALDSON
 (Victoria) (16:44):  Senator Bishop started by indicating that the Labor government had form in relation to defence.




Senator Mark Bishop:
  Good form!




Senator RONALDSON:
  Good form? Well, that just makes it even worse if you said 'good form'—form most certainly yes; good form most certainly no. In relation to that matter, it is a real pity that Senator Bishop was not making these sorts of comments and suggestions when his preferred prime ministerial candidate was actually running the show. I think if you listen to what Senator Bishop said, implicit in that was his view that in the last two years, under the present Prime Minister, we have seen slippage in relation to the defence budget. I will just go through what the form is, so that there is no doubt in anyone's mind about what the form is. Dennis Richardson is the fourth Secretary of Defence in the last four years under this government. That is form number one. Twenty-five billion dollars has been slashed from the defence budget since the Australian Labor Party came into power. That is form number two. Good form, Senator Bishop calls it; bad form, I call it. Spending in GDP terms is at 1937 levels—1.49 per cent next year. Good form? I do not think so. Bad form—most definitely!


I now want to refer to some of the comments made by other commentators in this area in relation to this crisis facing the Department of Defence—a crisis in a funding sense and the ensuing crisis of confidence amongst those who are serving this nation. I think it was Senator Humphries, and maybe Senator Johnston as well, who referred to Lieutenant General Peter Leahy, a former Chief of Army, who said that the current round of cuts, these cumulative cuts, will undoubtedly lead to personnel reductions and a crisis of confidence in the defence forces. I want to read a comment from Dr Mark Thomson in his 2012 ASPI defence budget analysis. He said: 


The plans set out in 2009 are in disarray; investment is badly stalled, and the Defence budget is an unsustainable mess.


We all know that the former defence secretary, Duncan Lewis, who was an ex-special forces commander and National Security Adviser, has had a frosty relationship with Minister Smith for some time. Lewis recently stated at an ASPI dinner:


As things stand I don’t think we are structured or postured appropriately to meet our likely strategic circumstances in future.


So that is five bits of bad form, not good form, as Senator Bishop said at the start of his contribution. That is five bits of really bad form.


What is the outcome of this bad form? The outcome, as we know from media reports today, is that the cadets are now the next ones in the gun. They are the next ones whose funding will undoubtedly be cut. I could stand here for two hours and talk about the benefits of the Australian Defence Force Cadets. I will not do so and I would be bitterly disappointed if there was anyone in this place who does not support cadets.


The other outcome, just one that I can think of straight off the top of my head, in relation to these five points of bad form was the stripping in the federal budget of recreation leave travel entitlement for single ADF members aged 21 and over. It has been changed. The fact that it was even contemplated is an absolute reflection on this government, a complete and utter reflection on this government. It was only changed because the ex-services community and others said this was completely and utterly untenable.


Why are we in this position? We are in this position because this current Prime Minister, in a desperate attempt to get herself through to November of this year, when Kevin Rudd can no longer contest the prime ministership because we will be in an election year next year, is spending like a drunken sailor to maintain her position in the polls and within her party, all of which is unsustainable. We are now confronted with a $120 billion black hole. We are seeing a government lurch from financial crisis to financial crisis. Treasurer Swan at question time today refused to rule out any raid on the Future Fund—the last bit that the Australian Labor Party has not been able to get its grubby mitts on has been the Future Fund. This is a Prime Minister who is spending purely to keep her job. She has no concern for the job of anyone else in this country and she certainly has no concern for the Australian Defence Force and the personnel who are serving this country so well.

"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2012-09-19,"



Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (16:51):  We are a government committed to delivering a surplus on time and as promised. The 2012-13 budget delivered by Treasurer Wayne Swan ensures that we will achieve this before any other major economy. In contemplating the importance of that, I am reminded of a quote from a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States military forces who said, 'The greatest single strategic threat faced by the United States is its national debt.'


A surplus is part of our strategy to ensure the strength of our economy and the future economic security of our nation. A strong economy is good for all Australians. However, the fiscal reality of the global situation means that there are very clear implications for Defence, as there have been for all government departments and agencies. But what the opposition has failed to appreciate and sought to politicise in its own flamboyant and hysterical terms is that Australian Defence Force operations will not be adversely affected by budgetary restraint. There will be no adverse impacts on operations in Afghanistan, East Timor or the Solomon Islands. There will be no reduction in the number of military personnel in any of our three services—Navy, Army or Air Force. There will be no implications for the equipment of forces about to be deployed or their deployment. There will be no reduction in conditions or entitlements for service personnel other than those being considered as part of the ongoing strategic reform program. 


There will be a minimum impact on the delivery of core defence capabilities, and from a strategic perspective there has been no fundamental change to our defence budget. There has been no fundamental change because when one sets aside the hysteria and hyperbole from those opposite, we can come to the cold, hard facts—and cold, hard facts which generally escape those opposite. We saw the claim being made that the defence budget had been cut by $25 billion—what errant nonsense; what dangerous and destructive nonsense. When well conducted, a defence debate should be bipartisan. Instead, it is now in the hands of the hysterics and crisis mongers opposite and not receiving the cold analysis that defence matters require.


In fact, the reality is that defence spending has been cut across the forward estimates from $109 billion to around $104 billion. For people who are passionate about defence, and I am one, those savings measures have been difficult and they involve difficult choices. But please do not let the people of Australia or any of those in the defence family who are listening to this debate imagine for a moment that the defence department is facing the kind of wholesale crisis those opposite dearly wish was the case. When one considers the level of defence spending in this country, let us just bring a little fact and reason to the debate, however uncomfortable the opposition are with those that. For the first time ever in this nation's history, this government has budgeted over $100 billion for this nation's defence across the forward estimates. That is to say, notwithstanding these cuts, we are still spending more on the defence of this nation today than those opposite ever did. 


Further, let us take a moment and look at the various miscellany of quotes those opposite have flung at us. They have flung quotes at us from various characters inside the defence debate who are at odds, some of whom do not agree with one another let alone the opposition. Dr Mark Thomson from ASPI is a classic case in point—a highly credentialled gentleman, a person whose utterances in the defence debate are always taken very seriously, a man who believes the defence budget as it presently exists is open to further cuts and that a smaller force would be justified. I am sure that if those opposite had a clue about what it is that they are discussing, they might have neglected to quote him in the terms that they did. 


We see when we look at the opposition and their conduct in these matters that while they are always keen to add hysteria and crisis to the debate, they do not come to this conversation with a commitment. They do not come to this conversation with anything like an undertaking to the defence family. In fact, their undertaking is as follows:


The Coalition will commit to restoring the funding of Defence to 3% real growth out to 2017/18 as soon as we can afford it.


'As soon as we can afford it'—that means never. That means that, God forbid, if those opposite should ever form a government, we will see on day one various Liberal characters roll out to the front and say: 'Oh my goodness, we cannot afford it. There's no money for defence. It's someone else's fault.' We know the game that is being played but, most critically, so do the men and women of our defence forces, and so do the loyal people who staff and work so assiduously in the Department of Defence. 


The Liberal Party is not coming over the hill to save the defence department from Labor Party cuts; rather this is a $70 billion black hole operation that is going to try to roll into government and then blame every failed commitment— (Time expired)

Senator CHRIS EVANS
 (Western Australia—Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (17:23):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



INDUSTRIAL CHEMICALS (NOTIFICATION AND ASSESSMENT) AMENDMENT BILL 2012


I am pleased to introduce the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Amendment Bill 2012 which amends the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989 (also known as the ICNA Act).  


In summary the act establishes a system of notification and assessment of industrial chemicals to protect human health and the environment.  The Department of Health and Ageing, through the National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme (NICNAS), administers the Act.  The activities of NICNAS underpin essential services across government agencies which collectively make up Australia’s regulatory system for industrial chemicals.  


NICNAS activities are cost recovered through a combination of fees and charges levied on those persons or companies that introduce industrial chemicals into Australia through import or manufacture.  For example, service fees apply to the assessment of new industrial chemicals introduced into Australia, an annual registration fee applies to all importers and manufacturers of relevant industrial chemicals, and an annual registration charge applies to all persons who introduce relevant industrial chemicals above a certain threshold value – these persons are known as “chargeable persons”. The annual registration charge funds the majority of NICNAS’s activities, including assessment of chemicals on the national inventory, compliance activities and stakeholder education and outreach.


NICNAS has reviewed its cost recovery arrangements in accordance with the Australian Government guidelines, utilising a highly consultative process.  Industry, community and government stakeholders were consulted through a range of mechanisms including public meetings, an online survey and two rounds of written submissions. 


The resulting Cost Recovery Impact Statement (CRIS) was agreed by Government.  This bill amends the Act to give effect to several outcomes from the NICNAS CRIS.  


The first set of amendments relates to annual registration charges. 


As foreshadowed in the NICNAS CRIS, the bill changes the threshold and tier structure for annual registration charges in order to provide a more equitable charging structure for business by better aligning the charge payable with the value of relevant industrial chemicals introduced. 


The number of registration tiers will be increased from three to four, and the threshold above which registrants pay a registration charge will be reduced from $500,000 to $100,000. This change will enable more than 2,500 low value introducers to pay a lower registration amount from 2013-14.  Only a small number of higher value introducers (less than 400) will pay a higher registration amount.


This amendment supports the very important work being done to assess the large number of unassessed chemicals that can legally be on the Australian market. 


Currently there are approximately 38,000 chemicals in the market which have not been assessed for health or environmental impacts. This is why in our 2011 Platform we made a commitment to the efficient and timely assessment of all chemicals in order to provide the highest level of protection to the community.  


Recently I welcomed the launch of a framework which will provide a faster, more flexible and transparent approach to assess these chemicals.


This framework will be applied in a staged manner to determine the impact of these unassessed chemicals. Stage One began on 1 July this year which sees the assessment of 3000 chemicals over the next four years.  A review to be undertaken in the fourth year is expected to make recommendations on the most efficient and effective approach to the assessment of the remainder of the unassessed chemicals on the national inventory.  


The second set of amendments introduces a new fee to recover the cost of processing applications for authorisation to import or export certain hazardous chemicals listed under the Rotterdam Convention (to which Australia is a signatory).  This new fee for service arrangement will ensure that costs are recovered directly from those using the service, rather than being levied across all chargeable persons, as is currently the case. The proposed fee is small and the number of companies accessing this service is low, therefore the impact on business is expected to be low.  


The last CRIS-related measure in the bill amends the Act to remove a redundant fee for certain applications relating to the listing of chemicals on the Australian Inventory of Chemical Substances made under transitional arrangements in 1997 only.  This service is no longer operational. 


The bill also makes a minor amendment to the Act to improve clarity and consistency with other regulations.  This is a consequential technical amendment arising from the new model work health and safety laws which commenced in the Commonwealth and some Australian states and territories on 1 January this year.  Under those model laws, ‘Material Safety Data Sheets’ are now termed ‘Safety Data Sheets’.  The amendment does not change the substance of the definition of what is a “Material Safety Data Sheet”.  For consistency, the bill also makes a corresponding amendment to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Act 1994, which currently cross-references the ICNA Act.  These minor technical amendments do not place any additional requirements on the industrial chemicals industry.  They simply improve regulatory consistency.


I am very pleased to report that these amendments have been developed in close consultation with industry, government and the community.  The proposed amendments enable NICNAS to provide more equitable cost recovery arrangements for business.  The bill does this while maintaining existing levels of worker safety, public health and environmental standards.  


These amendments therefore represent an important step in ensuring equity in regulatory charges and consistency across regulatory sectors.  They reflect the Government’s commitment to ensure the most efficient regulatory system is in place for industrial chemicals.


Debate adjourned.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (18:36):  I intend to make very limited remarks in this debate on the Marriage Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2012. I hope to avoid the misrepresentation of my remarks that has occurred in a previous debate about marriage.


I remain unconvinced that it is unjust discrimination to foster stable, biological parenting as a social norm. That said, gender diversity and other forms of parenting should be acknowledged and respected. Like Mr Turnbull in the other place, I regret that in this debate as it stands today common ground—that is, common ground to progress broader relationship recognition—has been foregone. Like Mr Turnbull I also note that in Europe instances where recognising what we would call gay marriage have not been a problem in the main because they have a tradition of distinguishing between the role of the state and the role of the church in recognising the union, whereas those functions have in large measure been fused in our tradition. That said, my comments about gender diversity also acknowledge that the tradition we share here in Australia should be respected, too.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:38):  The Marriage Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2012, which intends to legalise same-sex marriage, is not an easy issue for me to speak on. Unlike a number of my colleagues, who have held longstanding, definite if not definitive views on whether or not same-sex marriage should be legal in Australia, I have not been deeply involved in this debate. I have been working on a whole range of other issues. This does not mean, however, as one member of the House of Representatives suggested, that this is an eleventh-hour issue.


I know that many in the community have passionate, strongly held views as to whether same-sex marriage should be legalised. Insofar as those views are considered and respectful, I believe it is important in a great democracy such as Australia's to carefully take those views into account before making a decision on this bill. It is my job—indeed, my duty—to do my best to understand both those who support and those who oppose this change to the Marriage Act, and to do so in a way that is not judgemental but both fair-minded and mindful of those who will support and of those who will reject the position I take.


Unlike other members of parliament whose party had a policy at the last election to not support such changes to the Marriage Act, as an Independent I am not constrained by any party room decision. So, like every other vote I exercise in this place, this is a conscience vote for me, one that is especially significant because of the competing arguments and principles at stake. This bill raises fundamental issues of whether same-sex couples should be afforded the same rights as heterosexual couples. It of necessity raises questions about the way homosexuals are treated in our society, and we have seen the changes to our laws at state and federal levels since the early 1970s.


In 1976, I was a first year law student at the University of Adelaide. To this day, I remember well how a number of my lecturers were still grieving and campaigning for justice over the death of their fellow lecturer, Dr George Duncan, who died on 10 May 1972. Dr Duncan was a brilliant academic, respected by his peers and students alike. He was walking along the banks of the River Torrens near the university when he was set upon and viciously assaulted by at least three men, and thrown into the river. This occurred late at night. He drowned. Dr Duncan was homosexual at a time when being a homosexual could carry a jail term.


After a subsequent inquiry, it was found that the area where Dr Duncan was set upon was a so-called 'gay beat', where other homosexual men would illicitly meet, and the assault was part of the victimisation by those who derided, if not hated, those men by virtue of their sexuality. In the days, weeks and months following Dr Duncan's death, and after a grossly compromised and botched police investigation, nothing happened to the perpetrators. It was not until many years later that three men were charged with manslaughter, but they were acquitted in 1988. No-one has ever been held accountable for his death. Dr Duncan's death was a tragic, criminal consequence of discrimination.


As a result of the public outrage and media attention, the Hon. Murray Hill, a Liberal member of the Legislative Council of South Australia, introduced a bill into the South Australian parliament on 26 July 1972. The bill sought to amend the criminal law in South Australia that made homosexuality illegal. That bill, in an amended form, was assented to on 9 November 1972. It was the beginning of legislative moves across the nation to remove discrimination against homosexuals. The most recent significant reforms at a Commonwealth level occurred only a few years ago as a result of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's recommendations that equality of treatment should be extended to same-sex couples.


Those pieces of legislation, which form the Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth Laws—General Law Reform) Act 2008, effectively recognise same-sex couples in respect of many rights and obligations, including superannuation. In essence, the rights and obligations that heterosexual couples have now also apply to same-sex couples. That significant, landmark legislation was passed with bipartisan support. However, the proponents of same-sex marriage consider the 2008 bills as unfinished business, and for the opponents that was the end of the road for reform.


At its heart, this issue, this debate, revolves around whether the definition of marriage should be confined to heterosexual couples. Those who oppose changing the law say that to legalise same-sex marriage would undermine the traditional definition of marriage, and that it would also affect children. Let us deal fairly with those two arguments.


I find myself substantially in agreement with the considered speech that the member for Wentworth, the Hon. Malcolm Turnbull, recently gave at the Southern Cross University on the Gold Coast in honour of former High Court Justice Michael Kirby. Like Mr Turnbull, I cannot see how allowing a same-sex couple to marry would somehow affect the sanctity and strength of a marriage between a heterosexual couple. As for children, as Mr Turnbull pointed out, unfortunately, some biological parents are neither loving nor wise. What is important is that a child is brought up in a safe and loving environment. The reality is that this bill does not change the right of same-sex couples to raise children. That was in part dealt with at a federal level several years ago, with bipartisan support. Nor does this bill change state laws about adoption or IVF. But, this bill would give recognition to the inherent commitment that marriage brings with it.


It was my preference, until I considered the issues in this debate, to legislate immediately for civil unions for same-sex couples as, in a sense, a transitional measure before legislating for same-sex marriage. But I can see the argument that, while that measure would be a further reform to reduce discrimination, it would not remove it. In the event this bill does not pass, I would urge the senators and members who oppose same-sex marriage to consider supporting a new bill that would at least allow civil unions.


To date, 11 other countries have legalised same-sex marriage: Argentina, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Iceland, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, South Africa, Spain and Sweden. This is proof that our traditions are continuing to evolve. A thousand, a hundred, even 30 years ago, marriage did not mean what it does today. This evolution is important. Our traditions are valued because they are still relevant, because they still mean something to us today. But this bill will not in fact change the tradition of marriage within our churches. Ministers of religion will be free to continue to abide by their beliefs on their definition of marriage.


This debate has seen an intense degree of lobbying by various churches—as they are entitled to do in our democracy. I regard the right of a person to hold their religious beliefs as fundamental in a free society. But beyond religion and religious beliefs, I also believe in the law. And I believe our laws should apply equally to all. Aristotle said: 'The law is reason, free from passion.' This is a debate that raises passions more than almost every other issue. But if we remove the passion from this debate, we are looking at a simple fact: this bill rectifies discrimination in our law. As elected representatives and law makers, we have a duty to make the best laws we possibly can. And as to a law that excludes people from such a significant cultural institution just because of who they are—well, it is time that changed.


Much of this debate has focused on apparent so-called conservative values, such as marriage and the family unit, although I think it is unfair to suggest those values only belong to conservatives in some political or partisan sense. I am a strong supporter of these principles, but I believe they are reasons for, not against, marriage equality. British Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron said, on this very issue:


Yes, it's about equality, but it's also about something else: commitment. Conservatives believe in the ties that bind us; that society is stronger when we make vows to each other and support each other.


So I don't support gay marriage despite being a Conservative. I support gay marriage because I'm a Conservative.


There are so many problems facing our society today. Anything that encourages people to commit to each other ultimately can only be a good thing. That is why I support this bill.

Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland—Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers and Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (18:47):  The purpose of the Marriage Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2012 is to amend the Marriage Act 1961 by replacing the current definition of marriage with these words: 'Marriage means the union of two people, to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life'. Further, it makes it clear that a minister of religion or a marriage celebrant is not under any obligation to marry people who are of the same sex.


As we have heard, there have been strongly held views here in the Senate and also in the community about removing discrimination against gay and lesbian people in the Marriage Act. But it is true to say that, more and more, community opinion is moving our way. I will be supporting this bill, because marriage should be about love and family, about shared values and futures, about goals and about dreams. It should not be about gender, and our laws should reflect this. It is about human rights, it is about equality, inclusion and respect—values that we all should hold dear.


I do not want to make light of this, but in reality it is pretty straightforward to me. I am sad that this bill will not be carried in this chamber. It is unfortunate that those in the opposition very loudly proclaim, and have done for years, that they are not bound in their vote, unlike we in the Labor Party. They proudly talk of the number of times they cross the floor—except in this bill. The hypocrisy is evident to me and to many others. I am confident, though, that in the future we will again attain equality in marriage, and I believe that it will be at the next time we have this debate. I am confident, and I say to those who have argued and pushed for so many years that this is a step forward. This is a way forward, and they should take confidence from the progress that we have made both in the chambers and in the community.

I believe Australia, as a developed nation, has a responsibility to do all we can to help pull African nations and their peoples out of poverty and put them on the path to prosperity.


Article 2 of the agreement to establish the African Development Fund states:


The purpose of the Fund shall be to assist the Bank in making an increasing effective contribution to the economic and social development of the Bank's members and to the promotion of co-operation (including regional and subregional co-operation) and increased international trade, particularly among such members. It shall provide finance on concessional terms for the purposes which are of primary importance for such development.


The African Development Fund and the African Development Bank promote sustainable economic growth and reduce poverty in their regional member countries. They do so by providing finance on concessional terms to member states so that states can stimulate their economies and build infrastructure projects, such as the Bujagali Dam in Uganda or the Dakar-Diamniadio Toll Highway in Senegal. The bank and the fund also provide technical assistance to members for the establishment of legal and social structures.


As I said in the adjournment debate last night, accountability in development projects is critical to maintaining donor trust—and this is absolutely essential when the donor is a nation state thousands of kilometres away. I note the 2011 Australian Multilateral Aid Review stated in relation to the African Development Bank:


AfDB programs deliver strong tangible results at country-level and in support of regional integration.


…   …   …


AfDB’s level of experience and on-the-ground presence in African countries makes it a valuable partner for Australia given Australia’s limited presence in Africa.


In 2004, the AfDB adopted an independent review mechanism which allows claims to be made where there are concerns the bank has failed to comply with its own policies. For example, the bank's resettlement policy provides:


… that when people must be displaced they are treated equitably, and that they share in the benefits of the project that involves their resettlement.


This means that when the building of a new road, dam, bridge or other bank-financed project displaces people the bank must treat equitably anyone that is displaced. This mechanism ensures that these displaced people have a voice, and it is a good example of a critically important and necessary accountability mechanism.


I fully support Australia bolstering its efforts to reduce poverty and stimulate economic and social growth in Africa. I support Australia's involvement in the AfDB.


Debate adjourned.

Senator CROSSIN
 (Northern Territory) (18:57):  I rise tonight to talk about a range of Indigenous education matters. It is a subject that I am pretty passionate about and have a strong personal commitment to. In the last week, three reports have been handed down that should not go unnoticed or without comment.


I welcome the release this week by FaHCSIA of the Footprints in time: Longitudinal study of indigenous children. The Footprints in time study provides a picture of the early lives of children through the lenses of health, education, parenting, and social and demographic circumstances across remote, regional and urban Australia. Under the guidance of Professor Mick Dodson, FaHCSIA's research aims to improve the understanding of and the policy response to these diverse circumstances faced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, their families and their communities. The data that is available is rich and valuable.



Footprints in 
t
ime has confirmed just how important education is in helping to give children a strong start in life. The findings detail improvements in outcomes for Indigenous children, reflecting the government's unprecedented investment in early childhood education. For example, nearly 90 per cent of children find going to school enjoyable and this means that these children are attending school—and we all know that school attendance is vital for any long-term success. The Footprints in time study also shows that children who participate in preschool programs or formal education programs, say through their childcare centre, have more developed reading and writing skills and are better prepared for learning in the classroom.


The mothers and the carers who were surveyed see education as an essential ingredient for getting the best possible start in life. They said in the survey that they want their children to finish high school and to go into further education and training or employment.


The release of this report is certainly important. It is an indicator and confirms for us the importance of retention funding and giving support to families, particularly with children of very young years. In the early lives of children, it can have an amazing impact on the journey for them for the rest of their lives. I congratulate FaHCSIA on this research and I welcome the continued longitudinal study and the outcomes that we will see in years to come.


The second report that I want to talk about tonight is the report handed down by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. The report is entitled Our land our languages. It was tabled on Monday in the House of Representatives. I think it contributes significantly to building a complete picture of what constitutes Indigenous languages in this country, what makes Indigenous education highly accessible and what makes Indigenous education successful by delivering the best possible outcomes for students.


I have had a chance to read through the report and I think it encapsulates where Indigenous languages are in this country. It covers the fact that many years ago we had so many, that they are now diminishing in number and that not enough is being done across a wide range of particularly government programs to maintain and keep those languages. The report provides a very good snapshot of what is happening and what ought to happen in our country.


As I read through the report I see many names that I recognise, particularly those people in the Northern Territory who provided submissions and evidence to that inquiry. They are people I have worked with, people I know and people I respect—the Michael Christies of the world and the Brian Devlins of the world and Indigenous people right throughout the Territory who would have passionately given evidence to the inquiry about the importance of language and the maintenance of their language.


I am disappointed, though, that the member for Solomon, Natasha Griggs, was a member of that inquiry and attended only one public hearing in Darwin. I notice that there are no dissenting comments in the report, so I hope that, in supporting all of the recommendations of that report—including the recommendation to support, resource and encourage bilingual education—she takes that commitment to the current and newly elected Northern Territory Country Liberal government and puts that view very strongly.


The committee found that language is inseparable from culture, kinship, land and family and that language is the foundation upon which the capacity to learn, interact and to shape identity is built. The report heard that there was devastation in communities when their language was lost and that the key to developing competency in standard Australian English is for the child to be taught bilingually, with the child's first language to be used as the basis for learning in their earliest years.


I have stood in this place and championed the benefits of a curriculum that supports bilingual education and I have spoken of the cognitive development that is necessary for a child to learn how to read and write in their first language, and I was very encouraged to find that the outcome and the recommendations of that House of Representatives report endorsed my views and sentiments about the benefits of bilingual education.


The report went further to say that what we ought to do is totally relook at the NAPLAN tests in this country and either create a test for year 5 and year 7 children in their own language or in fact exempt children in years 3 and 5 from the NAPLAN test. I would urge Minister Garrett and DEEWR to look very closely at the reasons and rationale in that report for those recommendations. What are we really testing in years 3 and 5 with NAPLAN? We are not really testing the child's knowledge of English; we are testing whether or not they have the cognitive skills to read and comprehend what they are reading. I have always believed that bilingual schools should be exempt from those tests until year 7 or that those tests should in some way be translated into a context that truly reflects what we are trying to test and mark as we put those children through the NAPLAN process.


I commend that report for people who are champions of Indigenous language and particularly champions of bilingual education.


Finally, the third most significant report that was released this week goes to the other end of the spectrum—that is, Indigenous access to higher education. This report was commissioned by my colleague Senator Evans and was of course spearheaded by the work of Professor Larissa Behrendt. The review focused on barriers that are preventing Indigenous people from achieving their full potential in higher education. It recommends actions that will result in parity. Some of the barriers identified are not limited to Indigenous students only, and I think Professor Behrendt makes that very clear in an article that is in today's Australian. Only 1.4 per cent of enrolments in universities around this country are from people who identify as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and only one per cent of full-time equivalent staff in universities are Indigenous. I notice that Dr Steve Larkin, from the Charles Darwin University and a fine member of the Indigenous Higher Education Advisory Council, played a pivotal role in this report.


The report says a number of things that I think are worthwhile for people to have a clear and concise look at. It says that we should be building a new generation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander professionals through our university system—and I think people should reflect on that. The fact that we are getting more and more people through with a degree is great, but we need to actually build that community of professionals. Universities are the ones that have to make this difference. Universities have to embrace the outcomes and recommendations of this report and make the change. Governments can back them and support them all the way, but universities have to sign up to making a difference, to making access to higher education easier for Indigenous people, to supporting them on their journey and to then offering them a place as a professional and a staff person in their universities for years to come.
