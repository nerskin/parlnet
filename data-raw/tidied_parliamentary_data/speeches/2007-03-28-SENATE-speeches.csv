"Abetz, Sen Eric (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",LP,2007-03-28,"—I move government business notice of motion No. 1:
That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (8) of standing order 111 not apply to the Migration Amendment (Border Integrity) Bill 2006, allowing it to be considered during this period of sittings.
That the bill may be taken together for its remaining stages with the Migration Amendment (Review Provisions) Bill 2006 [2007].",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,0,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2007-03-28,"—The Australian Greens oppose this motion for a number of reasons that I will briefly outline to the Senate. This motion deals with two pieces of migration legislation. One is the Migration Amendment (Border Integrity) Bill 2006. The primary component of this motion is to exempt it from the cut-off. The border integrity bill is a piece of legislation that brings in biometric facial recognition technology for use in Customs. There are questions about the capacity of that technology and the error rates associated with it which the Australian Greens believe should be explored through a Senate inquiry to ensure that we understand what the error rates are. A recent Senate inquiry looked at the issue around the access card, and the same problems with biometric technology were raised there. We would like to be able to explore that issue in a Senate inquiry.
When this legislation was debated just last night in the House of Representatives, concerns were raised about legislative creep. As it currently stands this legislation has some restrictions in it in terms of keeping information—biometric photographs of people. That information cannot be kept now, which is good, but we have not had the opportunity to get from the government the assurances that there will not be legislative creep with this legislation. So those are the concerns that the Greens have.
We are in a position to be able to support the bill but we want to be able to ask questions about that process, and this exemption from the cut-off does not allow us to do that. Clearly, if this motion proceeds and the government does force the Senate to restrict its opportunity for debate on this legislation and not hear from experts, not hear from the public, not hear from the people who know about the error rates in biometric facial technology—I do not reckon everyone here is an expert on it—then the only option left open to us will be to discuss that in the committee stage of this bill, which we will do.
We are quite happy to support this kind of legislation bringing in these proposals, but we want to hear more about how it would be implemented, what kinds of assurances there would be and what kinds of error rates we have got with the technology. That is why we would like to have the opportunity to have that discussion and debate. If the government proposes to do it this way then we will have to have that discussion in the committee stage. We are not all experts in biometric facial recognition technology and we believe that hearing from experts would be helpful to the Senate debate.
The other part of this motion is that the border integrity bill be taken together with the Migration Amendment (Review Provisions) Bill 2006 [2007]. This is one bill on which there has been a Senate inquiry and there have been recommendations out of that inquiry—in particular, in relation to the Refugee Review Tribunal taking oral evidence. Those are recommendations which the government-dominated Senate inquiry supported and which the Greens supported and would like to see implemented.
For us the difficulty is created in the government seeking to move these two bills together, because we are supportive of the border integrity bill, but we have amendments which were put forward in recommendations from the Senate committee that we want to see implemented, and to date we have had no indication from the government that they will be supporting those amendments. That makes a difference for us in terms of how we deal with that piece of legislation. If the government does not accept its own government-dominated Senate inquiry recommendations around that issue then we will be in a position of wanting to support one piece of legislation and not the other. Therefore, we do not want the two bills to be taken together.
We are actually prepared to have the debate at the same time but, if we hear from the government a refusal to accept its own committee’s recommendations, we may want to vote differently on these two bills. Perhaps the Clerk or the chair or the minister can inform us on this. We do not mind the debate occurring on the two bills together, but we want to be able to have the vote separately, because if the government does not accept the recommendations then we may need to do that.
Those are the two issues of concern that we have. One is that we want to hear from technical experts about the biometric facial recognition technology, and we have not had the opportunity to do that. The other is that we may well have differing positions if the government does not accept its own Senate inquiry’s recommendations. Therefore, whilst we are prepared to have debate on the bills together, we want to ensure that we can have the vote separately.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,0,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",LP,2007-03-28,"—Unfortunately, this is another opportunistic attempt by the Greens to suggest to the Australian public that due process is not being followed in relation to some important legislation that is coming before this place. There are two pieces of legislation. To start with the last matter first, the simple fact is that when you deal with two bills together, of course it is possible to put the two bills to a vote separately, and we would be putting the two bills separately. There would be separate votes. I think most of the senators would have known that and I would have thought a very brief phone call to the Clerk’s office would have revealed that—rather than trying to make suggestions in this place that a separate vote would somehow be denied.
In relation to the bill that the Greens tell us they support but want to have an inquiry into, can I just remind honourable senators that this bill has been floating around for about five months. It was introduced late last year and there was a report by the Selection of Bills Committee—and the Greens have a representative on that committee. The report of that committee was tabled and adopted on 19 October last year, and do you know what the recommendation was? That there be no report or inquiry into the bill. That is what the Greens agreed to. That was tabled and reported to this place on 19 October last year. Here we are on 28 March, being broadcast, and as a result the Greens are trying to say that they are here trying to rescue the Senate from the evils of the Howard government. Well, the Howard government has had this legislation on the table for nearly a full half-year. The Greens did not want an inquiry into this bill. Now, all of a sudden, when we are about to debate it, they do.
What I say to the honourable senator is that if she has any questions about this bill they can be raised during the committee stages. We will be going through the normal committee stages, the normal processes of the Senate, but we think that from an expediency point of view it makes good sense to debate two bills that relate to matters of immigration together. If there are any specific problems or concerns—genuine problems—that the senator has, I wonder whether she has actually rung the minister’s office and inquired as to whether or not she might be given the benefit of certain advice from advisers of that office? I just have a hunch that, like with the Selection of Bills Committee, no such request was made, but the Greens come in here in a flurry suggesting that they are genuinely interested in the legislative process and in informing themselves as to the detail.
The simple facts are that these bills will be voted on separately and there will be a committee stage where these matters can be explored. I am sure that my colleague the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship would be more than willing to provide advice to the honourable senator so that she can be even better informed when the debate commences.
—Senator Brown, you are on your feet, but Senator Abetz has concluded the debate. No-one stood before he did.
—I seek leave to make a comment.
Leave not granted.
—Is Senator Abetz not giving leave?
—No.
—That will be noted.
—The question is that the motion be agreed to.
Question put.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,0,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-03-28,"—I know everyone has been waiting with bated breath for the answer to the question that I asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. To remind people who were not here yesterday, I let the Senate know about a series of questions I asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services about the Perth brickworks. The minister has ended up as the de facto regulator for the brickworks. The answer I got to these questions was that the airports branch of the aviation and airports division of the Department of Transport and Regional Services will monitor compliance with all conditions of approval.
With all due respect to the people who work at DOTARS, this branch has not been set up to evaluate matters such as Aboriginal heritage values on airport land, nor was it established to safeguard the biodiversity values of this area, nor does it have the ability to analyse airshed modelling to protect residents from acid gas fallout. None of these things is in its purview and I would say that there are other agencies, particularly state ones, that are much better qualified to do this. Nor do I believe that it has the necessary planning expertise to ensure that these developments are compatible with surrounding land uses. Again, it is not what the department was set up to do.
This bill continues a trend of allowing incompatible land uses on important areas of urban and peri-urban bushland—areas that I remind you are in very short supply in most of our capital cities these days. Without the kind of regulatory oversight that state governments have spent years struggling to develop—and this oversight is absolutely necessary for these areas of bushland—this bill will make a bad situation worse.
The Greens will be moving an amendment. Senator Milne has already highlighted that she will be moving an amendment that allows better state evaluation of these important bushlands and the developments that affect them. We commend that amendment to the Senate to enable these important areas of bushland in our capital cities to be protected. As I highlighted yesterday, in some instances these are part of the last remnants of important biodiversity in our capital cities. The Perth airport bushland contains values that are found nowhere else on the Swan coastal plain. They should be protected and they should not be subjected to the ad hoc developments that are being allowed to occur at present. We would have liked to have seen this bill deal with this by tightening up these sorts of controls so that development on these areas can be either properly controlled or not allowed in cases where they are incompatible with the biodiversity of these areas or with the flight paths—which is what I thought airports were there for in the first place.",SENATE,<title>AIRPORTS AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2007-03-28,"—I would like to make a few comments about the Airports Amendment Bill 2006. This bill and the Senate inquiry into the bill have given senators and members and other interested parties the opportunity to once again canvass a number of contentious issues that have arisen since some 22 of Australia’s airports were leased to private companies—a process that commenced more than 10 years ago. The initial decision to privatise airport leases was a contentious one and continues to be so. However, in hindsight—and noting the huge expansion in air travel in this country and our reliance on air travel as a nation—the only way we were going to be able to fund continuous improvements and build the infrastructure needed to deliver the required air transport services was to invite private investment. Otherwise, taxpayers would have had an unbearable burden and it is unlikely that air transport services and infrastructure would have kept pace with our nation’s growth and with the demand for modern transport systems.
However, privatisation of any government services brings with it the usual difficult problem of balancing the need for the private provider to make a profit in a way that does not override the rights and reasonable demands of citizens. Privatisation also puts distance between the ability of a government to control the delivery of services and the ability of the people to hold their government accountable when things go wrong. Privatisation makes it easier for government to abrogate its responsibility for service provision and makes it easier for government to blame everyone else for problems that may arise. These familiar things and tensions have also arisen in the ongoing debate about our privatised airports.
Particularly controversial and ongoing issues that have arisen since the passage of the original act in 1996 include the fees charged by airport lease owners for airport users; the increasing aircraft noise from expanded or varied aircraft operations; and, possibly the most contentious of all, the expansion of non-aviation uses, including large retail and commercial office developments, on airport sites.
While privatisation of airports has brought many different interest groups into the debate—including investment banks, business representatives, airport lessee companies, state and local governments, residents groups, developers, airlines, freight companies and environment groups; the list goes on—ultimately it is the federal government that has oversight of significant legislation dealing with aviation, airports, transport and transport safety. The buck stops well and truly with the federal government and no amount of blame shifting by the federal government can change that fact. The Australian people expect their federal government to have ultimate responsibility for what happens at airports and on airport land that the government leases to private companies. Airports are not just transport hubs, they are the first port of call for most tourists to this country and they are, unfortunately, places where we must be ever-vigilant about security. They are also places where there is a very real potential for accidental incidents that cause enormous damage.
The scope and complexity of federal government responsibility for aviation and airport related matters is not going to diminish. Statistics provided by the Bureau of Transport and Regional Economics show that, Australia-wide, passenger movements on domestic routes have increased by an annual average of 4.6 per cent since 1995-96 and that on international routes the average annual increase is 5.2 per cent. Regional airline passenger activity has increased by an average of 3.2 per cent each year since the same date.
At Adelaide Airport in my state, for example, that translates into revenue passenger movements increasing in number from 3,740,000 in 1995-96 to 5,760,000 in 2005-06. For a relatively small city, that is a very big increase. There is no reason to believe that the number of passenger and freight movements through Australia’s airports will reduce. The nation needs to be prepared to meet increasing demand.
Capital city airport precincts these days are major employment and service delivery centres. For example, Adelaide Airport precinct employs in the vicinity of 3,000 to 4,000 people. Whereas in the past a capital city airport precinct might have comprised a terminal and a few retail shops within it, a car park, airline and freight company offices, maybe some government offices, emergency services and possibly a petrol station, now an airport precinct is like a small city within a city. At Adelaide Airport precinct, in addition to all the things I mentioned earlier, we also have a childcare centre, restaurants, logistics companies, extensive government and private offices, and the ubiquitous and controversial large retail developments.
Like other airports, Adelaide also has a newish airport terminal—and I doubt that anyone who travels frequently to Adelaide would dispute that it is high time for South Australians to have a real, grown-up airport that has airbridges and an international terminal better than a tin shed. That airport was built with private investment. However, along with the positive developments in airports and aviation in Australia, many in our community—while they understand that modern aviation infrastructure and services are essential for Australia and acknowledge the role that private investment plays in delivering those objectives—believe their legitimate interests, rights and complaints have been ignored or not adequately dealt with under the current legislation. They look to the federal government for support.
There is no doubt that the federal government has been reluctant to acknowledge that all was not right with the legislation governing airport development. Public confidence in the ability of the government to genuinely take into account community concerns about inappropriate, non-aeronautical development was undermined when the minister gave the green light for the Perth brickworks site—an inappropriate use if ever there was one, and I am sure we will hear more about that shortly. Labor has moved a second reading amendment which condemns the government for undermining public confidence in the Airports Act through bad planning approvals like the Perth Airport one and the siting of the Essendon Direct Factory Outlets.
As a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport that inquired into this bill, I would like to express my appreciation to all the persons and organisations who made submissions to the inquiry and who attended the public hearing.
I also note the abiding interest of the member for Hindmarsh, Mr Steve Georganas, in all things to do with the Adelaide Airport in particular, which is in the middle of his electorate. Well before he became a member, Mr Georganas was active in his support for residents of Adelaide’s western suburbs, who watched as the airport grew to the enormous transport hub that it is today. As a member of parliament, he has introduced a private member’s bill to create the position of airport ombudsman, an initiative designed to give residents an independent person to whom they can take their complaints and issues about the airport.
I also acknowledge the hard work and commitment that Mayor John Trainer of the City of West Torrens Council puts into his role as a community representative and advocate for the businesses and organisations in his area that are aggrieved by what is happening at Adelaide Airport. Mr Trainer and his CEO, Mr Trevor Starr, travelled to Canberra to put their views on behalf of not only the residents of West Torrens but also all South Australian local councils.
The Senate committee also received submissions from the City of Salisbury, under the leadership of Mayor Tony Zappia, and from residents near Parafield Airport in Adelaide’s north, who view the increased usage of that airport—including the establishment of flying schools and on-airport land developments—as not always compatible with the right of local residents to a safe and habitable environment.
Similarly, I would like to acknowledge the written and verbal submissions of Mr Phil Baker and Mr John McArdle of Adelaide Airport Ltd. The issues between West Torrens council in my state and Adelaide Airport Ltd are not unfamiliar to other participants in this debate. Looking at the submissions to the Senate inquiry into this bill, I believe many will not be convinced that the proposed new legislation will do much to alleviate their concerns.
Tensions between airport operators and surrounding communities, over both aeronautical and non-aeronautical developments on airport land, occur on a number of fronts. Some of these concerns are dealt with to some extent in this bill, but some concerns of local communities are not dealt with and will no doubt continue to cause friction between all levels of government, airport developers, residents groups and individuals.
Broadly, this bill does the following things. It provides for making regulations that will allow airports specified in regulations, but not core regulated airports, to be exempt from the current prohibition on airlines owning more than five per cent of a company that is an airport operator company. The bill amends the act to take account of a 2005 Federal Court decision regarding non-aeronautical development on airport land, and adds that substantial trading or financial business must also be consistent with the relevant airport master plan. The bill inserts a new subsection that goes some way to clarifying the purposes of airport master plans, a deficiency in the current act that needs to be remedied.
The bill includes an amendment that will mean an airport master plan must contain reference to an Australian noise exposure forecast and to future flight paths, in accordance with any regulations for the purpose of this section of the act; however, we have not yet seen these regulations. The bill also provides for a draft or final master plan to include ANEF information that extends beyond the 20-year planning period, a measure introduced to give some additional certainty given the future anticipated increase in aviation usage in this country. A new master plan must be developed if a new ANEF is endorsed for the relevant airport.
The more controversial aspects of the amendments go to changes to the time allowed for public comment on drafts of master plans and major development plans and environment strategies. One of the most contentious aspects of modern airport usage is that developments on airport lands are not subject to the same state government and local council planning regimes as developments on off-airport land.
There is a sense in the community—rightly or wrongly—that airport developers can do whatever they like, without regard to what the impact may be on local roads, local residents, the environment, other businesses nearby and on people who, even if they are not using the airport or its non-aeronautical developments, must use roads in and around airports to travel from one part of a city to another. This sentiment, that the airport developers are allowed to get away with it, has been exacerbated by consultation and approval processes that have been criticised by local government, business representatives and residents groups who either do not have the opportunity to participate in consultation processes or do not believe their concerns are taken into account when they do participate. They do not know if their concerns actually make it beyond the airport operator company and are brought to the attention of the department and the minister as part of the approval process. The sentiment in the community that airport developers are allowed to get away with it has also been exacerbated by the fact that the minister had not refused any major development plans until the recent disallowance of the plan for Sydney airport.
Changes proposed by the government as part of this bill to shorten consultation periods fed into the disquiet felt by local councils and residents groups in particular, so much so that the government is amending its own amendment bill to increase the consultation period for draft plans from 45 days to 60 days. Labor does not support reduced consultation times, and it remains to be seen whether the government-proposed shortened time lines for consultation periods will prove adequate to quell disquiet about airport developments.
It is hoped the changes to the way interested parties are informed about developments will go some way to generating confidence in the planning, consultation and approval processes. Those changes include that, in addition to current requirements to publish information about plans and variations in local newspapers, the airport lessee company must publish advice on its website that the plan is to be made available for comment, a copy of the plan must be made available free of charge on the website throughout the consultation period and the airport lessee company must demonstrate how the company has had due regard to comments provided by the public, as opposed to simply stating it gave due regard to comments.
In addition, a new ‘stop the clock’ provision is proposed, whereby the minister may request that the airport lessee company provide specific information relevant to a decision-making process and, if that happens, the stated approval time for the minister will cease while this information is requested and provided.
The Senate committee report into the bill made some additional recommendations, including that the airport lessee companies be required to directly advise state, territory and local governments about commencement of the public consultation processes. This is intended to overcome the complaint that unless local authorities and other interested parties kept a watchful eye on advertisements in newspapers they would not know a consultation process was underway.
The Senate committee also recommended that any submissions that the airport lessee company received arising from the public consultation process be forwarded to the minister. These recommendations from the Senate committee reflect the unanimous view of the committee that there are indeed flaws in the current process of consultation and approval, and of course Labor supports these recommendations.
Labor believes there should be other changes to the bill to strengthen ministerial accountability and to build public confidence in what is happening at our airports. Labor believes we should remove the deeming provision in the current legislation which means a development is automatically approved if the minister fails to make an explicit decision within the appropriate time frames of the act. Labor also proposes a requirement of the minister to provide a statement of reasons if he or she overrides the recommendations from state or local government authorities. Further, Labor proposes that the department be required to have qualified town planners involved in the assessment of airport development plans. Apart from ensuring that expertise is always part of the approval process, it would go some way to assuring the public that persons qualified to contemplate the outcomes of a particular development plan are part of the process.
Other changes in this bill include lifting the threshold for a major development from $10 million to $20 million and allowing the minister to determine that the combined cost of consecutive or concurrent projects or extensions be included when deciding whether the cost of a proposal exceeds the threshold for major development projects. Whether or not airport lessee companies have in the past manipulated the current $10 million barrier and whether they would manipulate the new, higher barrier were matters of some interest at the Senate inquiry. Labor understands that the rationale for increasing the limit is based on increases in building costs since the original act was framed more than a decade ago. We take on board, however, the concerns raised by people who made submissions to the inquiry and believe the minister should not have the discretion to determine the combined cost but be required to determine it.
Whenever private developments on airport land are in the public arena, local governments rightly raise the issue of whether or not their ratepayers are getting a fair deal from the rate equivalent contribution regime that applies to airport lessee companies. At the Senate committee inquiry and at previous inquiries and reviews, local governments in particular have put the view that, while on-airport development is not subject to the usual local government planning and rating regimes, the impact on surrounding infrastructure such as roads, on off-airport businesses and on residential development is borne by local governments and their ratepayers. That is an argument that is unlikely to go away, but Labor acknowledges this and believes that the minister, when considering approval conditions for a proposal, should be required to take into account whether an agreement or a revised agreement should be negotiated between the airport lessee company and the local and state authorities. That should be an agreement that really does reflect the additional burden on local communities of on-airport development.
There are other amendments proposed in this bill which I have not dealt with but which were of interest to the Senate committee, particularly those relating to Canberra airport, the issue of gambling on airport land and the intention to allow persons or organisations approved by CASA to supply air traffic, fire and rescue services, which are currently supplied solely by Airservices Australia.
In conclusion, airport and airport land developments will continue to be controversial. Senators only need to see the expansion of office, retail and industrial developments near Canberra airport and the problems of traffic flow around that airport at peak times on inadequate roads surrounding the airport to realise that this issue will continue to occupy not only our attention but the attention of many in the community. It is unlikely that the legislation we are debating today will satisfy all the criticisms of the current system of planning and approval of developments on airport land. It is, in the scheme of things, a modest package of reforms and, while Labor supports the thrust of the bill, we believe the government has wasted an opportunity to do more to alleviate the ongoing and legitimate concerns of local government, residents groups and citizens about the issue of balancing community interests with commercial interests in and around airports.",SENATE,<title>AIRPORTS AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2007-03-28,"—I rise to speak on the Airports Amendment Bill 2006. There a number of issues I want to explore, but I will concentrate my remarks on the experience of communities in the north-eastern suburbs of Perth and their interaction with Perth airport because the sorry saga of the building of a brickworks on Perth airport land goes a long way towards illustrating what is wrong with the current regime governing airports leased from the Commonwealth.
The significance of building a brickworks under a flight path in a residential area cannot for one moment be underestimated. With that at the forefront of my mind, it is a very short calculation indeed to reach the conclusion that the Howard government has been grossly incompetent in the management of airport leases. I have serious doubts as to whether these amendments will go very far towards righting what is wrong with the management of airports. Why is that the case? Because the chorus of disenchantment is coming from the government’s own party room. Nothing goes further in illustrating the current problems with the Howard government than this. The now well-reported examples of sniping and backbiting among colleagues are starting to take hold like tinea on the floor of a gymnasium shower.
We need only look at two speeches made in the other place by Western Australian Liberal members of parliament on this bill—interestingly, members for electorates around the Perth Airport. It is not often we have members of the same party criticising one another in parliament, but that is what we had. I am talking about the member for Hasluck, Mr Stuart Henry, and the member for Canning, Mr Don Randall. I think it is worth drawing the attention of the Senate to what happened between these two.
During debate on this bill in the other place, the member for Hasluck, Mr Henry, almost in despair at his own hopelessness and lack of influence bewailed what had happened with the planning process at Perth Airport in relation to the construction of a brickworks on the airport site. Remember that it is land leased from the Commonwealth government. He said that when he first heard of the brickworks proposal he sought an urgent meeting with BGC, who are the proponents, and Westralia Airports Corporation in the hope that he could have, he said, ‘encouraged both parties to effectively engage the community and discuss and confirm their plans’.
But the member for Hasluck went on to say, ‘This did not happen.’ I repeat: ‘This did not happen.’ It goes to show that his claimed ‘strong voice for Hasluck’ does not even rate as a whisper in Canberra. This is despite more than 5,000 local residents, who are also voters, putting their names to a petition objecting to the construction of a brickworks in their backyard. These are the residents of the suburbs of Hazelmere, Forrestfield, High Wycombe, South Guildford and Maida Vale.
In a further admission of his own inadequacy, the member for Hasluck explained what he did next. He wrote a letter. It reminds me of a scene from the fantastic and great Australian movieThe Castle in which the Kerrigans are all sitting around the table—except for Wayne; he is in jail—and there is the proud announcement: ‘Dale dug a hole.’ Well, it was actually Mr Henry who dug the hole. By the time he had got his letter out, the hole was getting deeper and deeper. He said he raised specific concerns in his letter that a brickworks fell outside the stated aims of the Perth Airport Master Plan 2004. Surprise, surprise—once again the member for Hasluck’s specific concerns fell on deaf ears. How do we know this? Because there seems to be no stopping the brickworks, no matter how incompatible it might be with the proper functioning of an airport, no matter how many local residents are up in arms and no matter how many letters were written or protests made by the ineffectual member for Hasluck.
Being ineffectual, whom does the member for Hasluck blame? The state government of course, even though the state government did all it could, I understand, to try to have the brickworks located on a more appropriate site, given the heavy, noxious industry that it is. Alternative sites named by the government of Western Australia as more suitable included areas in Forrestdale and Neerabup. The local residents know who to blame for this appalling decision. They know the airport is on Commonwealth government land, and they know who ultimately allowed the brickworks to be built on this land; it was the Howard government, aided and abetted by the former minister for transport, Mr Truss, and the former minister for the environment, Senator Ian Campbell—no less than a Western Australian colleague of Mr Henry.
Speaking of the former environment minister, because of his so-called compassion for the environment I found it strange that the brickworks went ahead with no fight from him. I honestly feel he was compromised. I do not think he felt all that comfortable with the idea of a brickworks, but for some reason he let it go ahead. He let it go ahead in the sense that he was so prepared to save the orange-bellied parrot and yet he did not show the same concern for the residents of suburbs around Perth Airport.
But back to the member for Hasluck. What was his last resort, having failed the Hasluck community and been shown to be so ineffectual? He dug another hole. The member for Hasluck set up a community consultative committee. I have absolutely nothing against the good members of the local community who have agreed to be part of this committee—good luck to them; they will need it—but it is all too late. It is all too late for the local community because the brickworks are going ahead thanks to the Howard government. It would have meant a great deal more if the consultation had occurred when it was needed, before this government agreed to allow brickworks to be built on the Perth Airport site.
Late last year during estimates hearings into this matter I asked questions of an official from the Department of Transport and Regional Services. I asked him whether BGC would put this community group together. Mr Doherty from DOTARS replied:
That is correct. With the Westralia Airports Corporation as the airport lessee.
So we know who is really behind, who is really supporting, this so-called community consultative committee; it is the proponents of the brickworks. Mr Henry dug a hole all right—BGC and Westralia Airports Corporation, hand in glove, listening to the concerns of the community! They will listen all right, but do you know what they will hear? They will hear nothing. It will be just like the member for Hasluck’s voice in Canberra. I say good luck to the members of that committee.
This whole Perth Airport episode had a very different outcome when compared to what happened at Sydney Airport. In Sydney, Minister Vaile decided to take the axe to the proposed shopping centre at the airport, which was far too sensitive, no doubt, this close to an election. I would cheerfully swap two shopping centres for a brickworks, as would the people of Hasluck, I am sure. But there were no qualms about a brickworks at Perth Airport. You can just hear the considerations: ‘High Wycombe? Hazelmere? Never heard of them. Mr Henry, the local member? Never heard of him either’—most likely—‘Do not worry about him; he will do just as he is told.’ So much for the member for Hasluck’s attempts to represent his constituency.
Let us turn to the other Liberal member of parliament from Western Australia I referred to earlier—the Member for Canning, Don Randall—and his contribution to the debate on this bill. He entirely contradicts the member for Hasluck on the suitability of Perth Airport for a brickworks. The member for Canning said:
... in my opinion this is an entirely suitable use of Perth Airport.
‘Entirely suitable,’ said the member for Canning. That is contrary to what was said by the member for Hasluck, who told the other place:
... I was disappointed at the decision to place the brickworks on this land.
The member for Canning was once the member for Swan, until the electors there saw the error of their ways, and the electorate of Swan borders Perth Airport, unlike the seat of Canning. So one cannot help wondering what Mr Randall might have had to say if the brickworks had been proposed back in the bad old days when he held the seat of Swan. Would he have been so comfortable with the use of airport land for a brickworks? Would he have been so dismissive of the views of local residents and voters? Would he have supported the brickworks then? Who knows. But perhaps we should make the current member for Canning the judge on all these issues across the country, because obviously he is quite confident in expressing an opinion on what works best for voters in electorates other than the one he is in parliament to represent.
Why stop there? Now that the Howard government wants to roll out nuclear reactors across Australia, who better than the current member for Canning to decide where they should go? He takes such a detached, objective view and obviously gives no favours to his Liberal Party colleagues, if his treatment of the member for Hasluck is anything to go by. So when the time comes to site a reactor in Perth, no doubt the member for Canning will call for, or rather demand, it be placed on the Perth Airport site in the electorate of his colleague the member for Hasluck. This is not as silly as it sounds. The member for Hasluck did not like the idea of a brickworks, he knew it would be electoral poison for him, but he could do nothing about it and he was not assisted by his so-called colleagues in Western Australia—neither the former minister for the environment nor the member for Canning, who thinks the brickworks site is ‘entirely suitable’. Let us hope that the electors in both Hasluck and Canning keep that in mind later this year when they decide who should represent them in the federal parliament.
It is noteworthy that the member for Canning also described me as a disgrace for my criticism of the brickworks proposal. That was rather cutting. I say to the member for Canning: is it a disgrace to stick up for the rights and community interests of residents in the surrounding suburbs of Forrestfield, Maida Vaile, Hazelmere, High Wycombe and South Guildford? These residents have every right and justification to be concerned about the Howard government’s decision to allow this plan to go ahead. These residents have every right to be concerned about the apparent inability of their Liberal members of parliament to represent them and their interests. Am I a disgrace for being concerned about the health impact on local schoolchildren at Dawson Park Primary, Edney Primary, Woodlupine Primary, Forrestfield Primary, Forrestfield Senior High School, High Wycombe Primary, Maida Vale Primary and the private schools in those suburbs with total enrolments of no fewer than 3,495 students this year? Am I a disgrace for raising concerns about the effect that heavy truck traffic will have on road safety and traffic congestion for local residents when the brickworks is built? If I am a disgrace for sticking up for the local community then maybe we need more disgraceful conduct in our parliament. It says more about the member for Canning than it does about me that he feels sticking up for local people amounts to a disgrace.
I shall leave the expose on the ineffectuality of those Western Australian Liberals there. I only highlighted their behaviour in relation to the brickworks on Perth Airport land to illustrate how some of the provisions in this bill will fall short of alleviating the concerns of local residents when it comes to management of Australia’s airports. I shall now move to some of the broader concerns about this bill.
This bill seeks to reduce the time allowed for public comment on draft master plans for federally leased airports from 90 calendar days to 60 business days, effectively shortening the time for public comment. According to the explanatory memorandum attached to the bill, this is to bring the time period more into line with state and territory planning systems. That might be so, but I view anything that would shorten the amount of time available for community consultation with concern, especially given the experience of local communities with the brickworks proposal for Perth Airport. This is particularly worrying when the bill also moves to codify the right of the airport lessee to conduct types of business that are non-aeronautical in nature. Put together, shortening the time for community consultation along with codifying non-aeronautical business could, I fear, be disastrous. How will the views of local residents about the types of business and industry that will be allowed on airport land be accommodated into the future? Put simply: how will the community be protected from more brickworks or even a nuclear power plant? Where does the government’s priority really lie? How can restricting public opinion improve things for local communities who have to live with major airport development plans not for 60 or 90 days but for decades? I repeat: it will be for decades.
In airport planning and approvals the Howard government has its own version of Guantanamo Bay where, on an airport site, whatever laws the Commonwealth decides to create will apply. Commonwealth airport sites have become, in effect, jurisdictional islands where the will of the rest of the community can be excluded. It is about time this government faced up to its responsibility to seriously represent and promote the community interest and not simply be constantly falling over itself to smooth the way for its mates regardless of the long-term consequences.
There are elements in this bill that I welcome. In particular, I welcome the provisions that will require lessees to set out how they have responded to submissions from the community on planning as well as the requirement that information from the lessees on planning issues be more readily and freely available to the community. I would like to conclude my comments on this bill by thanking the shadow minister for transport and roads, the member for Batman, and his staff for the work they have done in examining this bill and assisting Labor to arrive at a sensible and balanced position.",SENATE,<title>AIRPORTS AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2007-03-28,"—My colleagues have done a very good job of pointing out the problems that have arisen in the planning and development stage of airport development. State governments are unhappy about aspects of it, as are local governments. My colleagues have outlined very well the instances of that occurring right around Australia. It is certainly a large problem. In my home state of South Australia, it has been no less a problem.
The Premier of South Australia, Mike Rann, took a lead through the Council for the Australian Federation. As chair of that council, he wrote a letter to the Prime Minister asking for concerns about master-planning issues to be addressed. It highlights the fact that once again we have the federal government not seriously consulting with state governments. The federal government say they recognise state government issues; they say they recognise that state governments should have an input and yet it appears, as these problems have developed over the past years, that they have not really sat down and talked to them. Mike Rann’s letter states:
In 1997 the Council of Australian Governments signed a Heads of Agreement on Commonwealth/State Roles and Responsibilities for the Environment. The Agreement provides that tenants and persons undertaking activities on Commonwealth land would be subject to State environment and planning laws. Under the terms of the Agreement the only exception, in relation to airports, is aviation airspace management and on-ground airport management. The Council for the Australian Federation maintains that the Australian Government has not regulated the planning of non-aviation airport developments in a manner consistent with State Government planning regimes as required by the COAG Agreement. Departure from the Agreement has potential consequences for the States and Territories.
Once again, we see this problem between the federal government’s understanding of an agreement and the collective state governments’ understanding of an agreement. There is slippage between the federal government and the Commonwealth. There has been an understanding that there is a good reason for the Commonwealth government to have some control of what happens at our national airports, but it has been in the implementation—in the way that the federal government has handled representation—that problems have arisen.
Of course, it is not only about planning and development issues; there is also concern by state governments that the development of non-aviation uses in airports in the future may limit aviation uses. I know that this is one of the concerns in South Australia. If you are crowded in by non-aviation uses of airports then, when airports and airlines want to expand for aviation uses, there is no room left and no capacity within the airport. At an airport such as Adelaide airport this is a problem because it is a city airport surrounded by suburbs, crowded in by the development which exists currently, with very little room for expansion. Sydney would have exactly the same kind of problem.
The state government is very concerned that, if its tourism or freight opportunities expand to any extent, airport users may find themselves limited by other lessees. I happen to think that there has been some justification for greater use of airport land where that is appropriate. Where you have large tracts of land, and many of our airports are located within valuable city property, there is some justification for the use of that land for commercial and retail purposes. I have no great difficulty with that but it must be with the caveat that it is important that local and state governments should be reasonably comfortable with that development and that it should not impinge on future aviation uses of that airport.
Probably the third major problem that has arisen since privatisation of the airports has been pricing issues. These have been a matter of great concern in the past for users of airports, and the ACCC regularly monitors and reports on them. A report was done by the Productivity Commission on fees charged by airport lease owners for airport users. It was completed in December 2006 but has not yet been publicly released by the government. While not an issue for the Airports Amendment Bill 2006, pricing may be a matter of future concern.
There are two issues here. One is that airport owners now derive a significant part of their income from non-airport related activities—that is, from leasing and developing their land assets. As we further have the situation where the airport lessees derive a great deal of income from non-aviation uses, it is going to be harder and harder to achieve changes if there have been any decisions that non-aviation usage should be limited or reduced. The tourism industry, for example, is reportedly very happy with the latest results of privatisation in terms of the usage numbers being up and so on but again expresses concerns about non-aviation related uses.
Those three issues illustrate very well one of the problems of privatisation. It may well be justified but then we have the issue of how much control of these essential services government retains or loses versus how much certainty a business would have in leasing that business. The current lessees of those airports signed the contract under a certain number of conditions with a reasonable expectation of being able to go into the future with those conditions and to develop their business as they saw fit. If parliament is constantly making changes to their operating conditions then that becomes a severe problem for them, and one that would not have been envisaged under the privatisation process. I do not imagine that when the government privatised the airports it quite imagined the airport lessees would be as innovative and entrepreneurial in the leasing of the land as they have in fact been.
There is a lot of discussion about whether regulation should be heavy-handed or light-handed. In fact, I think it is much more easily perceived as complicated regulation versus clear regulation. Every time we come back into this parliament and pass another bill which puts on another layer of regulation or modifies regulation, it becomes a much more complicated form of regulation rather than clear regulation that is logical, consistent and persistent.
This is one of the clear problems of privatisation and one of the reasons the Labor Party at least enter into it very warily. It is not only for ideological reasons but because we see exactly these sorts of problems arising time after time. The government’s specifications do not always clearly see well into the future and lessees might develop more competition and innovation. There might be great advantages on the business side of the equation but there are things not envisaged by the government in the privatisation which need to be redressed. Then we run into this issue of how much the government should be interfering in the running of a business by a company which took out a contract at the time of the privatisation.
Certainly, we cannot talk about competition here because, as has been pointed out in previous speeches, most of the airports are monopolies. This may be another factor that is driving this debate. State governments, local governments and business competitors see this as a monopoly in terms of both the business that runs it and Commonwealth control. Therefore there is a perception that there is very little ability to influence the way the business operates.
I am fairly certain that the government’s amendments will not see the end of this criticism of planning and development regulations, noise issues and non-aviation development issues. That is a great pity because it means that the lessees of those airports will not have certainty in their businesses in the future. We may well come back into the parliament on this. Certainly, the state government bodies, as demonstrated by the letter from the Chair of the Council for the Australian Federation, Mike Rann, have some very clear concerns about problems into the future, and we have not seen the end of non-aviation airport development. Clearly, airports are crucial infrastructure in our country and it is important that the government get it right this time. Unfortunately, it appears that they have not found the solution to it in this instance.",SENATE,<title>AIRPORTS AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2007-03-28,"—In summing up, I thank senators for their contributions to the debate on the Airports Amendment Bill 2006, which forms the keystone of the government’s regulatory regime for the 22 leased federal airports. The privatisation of these airports has fostered a vibrant industry that has enabled airports to grow as commercial businesses with minimal government intervention. The network provided by the leased federal airports regulated under the Airports Act forms the backbone of the country’s aviation and transport infrastructure. Coming from Western Australia as I do, I can say that this is a very vital part of the day-to-day commercial operation of the whole of our state.
The bill preserves and enhances the open and transparent regulatory regime for land use planning, protection of the environment and control of on-airport building activity provided for by the Airports Act. However, the government acknowledges that a number of concerns have been raised during debate on this bill and by the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport following its inquiry into the bill. The government welcomes this scrutiny and will be responding to a number of these issues with amendments to the original bill. I will outline these amendments and speak on them briefly now with a view to minimising the amount of time taken to process the government’s amendments. I will also seek to speak to some of the opposition amendments.
I turn briefly to the key reform elements within the bill. The bill seeks to reaffirm the clear intention of the government to provide for non-aeronautical development on airports provided that such development is consistent with the airport lease and approved master plan. It proposes to exclude the Canberra Airport from the operation of the National Capital Plan, as approved by cabinet in March 2006. The proposed amendment will see Canberra Airport having to meet the same land use development and planning regimes as other leased federal airports.
The bill will provide a stop-the-clock provision, which allows the minister to seek additional information and research on airport major development proposals. This will enable the minister to better deal with any major development proposals where they consider that further information is required to assess the proposal. Currently the minister can only approve or reject a development proposal within a 90-day period or the project is deemed to be approved. This provision in the bill will encourage airports to provide more comprehensive planning documents in order to benefit from a streamlined assessment process—and I may have more to say about that in addressing some of the amendments of the opposition.
The bill also seeks to streamline the public comment and assessment periods for master plans, major development plans and environmental strategies. This will reduce the public comment period for master plans and major development plans from 90 calendar days—which is effectively 65 business days—to 60 business days. The bill requires better access to key planning and development proposals to be provided to the community by airports through requiring proposals to be readily available free of charge on a website. This will ensure that the public have ready access to associated documents in electronic form, free of charge, to assist in their providing comment on land use proposals within their communities. The bill will increase the dollar threshold for triggering major development plan requirements from $10 million to $20 million to reflect the increased cost of construction. This will not affect the requirement that all proposals which have environmental impact must be assessed under a major development plan.
The bill inaugurates a requirement that master plans provide better information for communities on flight paths and the noise exposure contours for an airport. This will require improved information regarding aircraft noise exposure levels and indicative flight paths. Also, it requires that, where a proposed major development has been approved, construction must be substantially completed within five years of the approval being given or else approval will lapse. It requires an airport lessee company to demonstrate to the minister how it had due regard to all public comment when preparing its draft master plans and major development plans. Currently the airport company need only state that it had due regard, and need not explain or describe how such regard was obtained. Further to this, the bill makes provision for allowing for non-aeronautical projects which are staged over a finite period and individually do not trigger the dollar threshold provided for in the Airports Act to be viewed as a single major airport development which must be progressed in accordance with the act. This removes the scope for airports to break up projects to avoid lodging plans for major development approval.
The bill also makes land clearing on airport sites a notifiable building activity requiring approval. This strengthens the ability to regulate land clearing on airport sites. It also includes purpose and objective statements relating to airport master plans in line with that recommendation from the June 2000 Senate committee inquiry into the Brisbane Airport master plan. Complementary changes are proposed with regard to airport environment strategies and airport major development plans. The bill also allows for an airport master plan to include forecasts and other matters that extend beyond the 20-year planning period, enabling state and territory land use planning agencies to implement long-term planning goals that are compatible with all airports’ proposed aeronautical operations in the future.
The bill also requires an airport lessee company to prepare a new draft master plan should, since the current master plan was approved, a more recent aircraft noise forecast for the airport be enclosed. Also, it provides for regulations to be made which will facilitate the timely update of airside vehicle control handbooks published by airport operator companies. It will enhance the controls over gambling activities presently provided for by regulation. And it requires all providers of air traffic control and rescue firefighting services to obtain appropriate approvals from the Civil Aviation Safety Authority.
With respect to the government’s amendments, I reaffirm that we recognise the number of issues and concerns raised in the debate on this bill in both chambers and through the Senate committee process. The Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport supported passage of the bill with two amendments: firstly, that airport lessee companies be required to provide notice to relevant state and local government organisations when key planning documents are released for public comment and, secondly, that the airport lessee companies be required to provide copies of all public submissions when lodging these documents for approval under the Airports Act 1996. The government fully supports these two key recommendations, and the amendments being moved will give effect to them. These changes, which require the airport operator to advise local planning authorities of proposed developments on airports and provide the Minister for Transport and Regional Services with copies of all public documents, will add greater transparency to the airport planning process.
The government does not, however, support the secondary recommendation from the committee report which included reversing the current deemed approval provision, requiring all consecutive or concurrent projects to be considered as a single development and having all social, economic and environmental impact studies and assessments made available to the public. The removal of the current deemed approval provision and certainty of decision making that this provision provides was a theme repeated in the opposition’s amendments that were moved and subsequently defeated in the House of Representatives. Such an amendment could only serve to generate uncertainty with regard to future major airport developments. The opposition would seek to add to this uncertainty by requiring the Department of Transport and Regional Services to employ town planners. The department does employ some town planners. However, the assessment of a major airport development requires a myriad of skills, including a comprehensive understanding of the aviation industry and the environment. The department obtains information and expertise from a range of portfolio and external sources on relevant issues such as security, safety, town planning et cetera, as required, in assessing those developments.
Uncertainty in planning and burdensome regulation, as promoted by the opposition in their amendments, would stifle the development of key national transport infrastructure, a situation which one can observe internationally in some other countries with privatised airports. Impediments of this nature to airport development would be exacerbated by the recent calls from state premiers to hand over planning jurisdiction for non-aeronautical development at the leased federal airports. Such a move would expose the development of these key national transport infrastructure assets to the uncertain, unpredictable and often unending planning regimes of state and local government, a move which is not supported by the government nor, I would suggest, by the public. Indeed, may I pause here in my comments on the bill to say that in Western Australia we have seen an enormous number of problems with a moribund and highly technical bureaucratic planning process. What this has yielded is a government of largesse and patronage wherein two people—and we all know who they are—have benefited greatly from offering to business a rite of passage through the planning and environmental procedures of my home state in circumstances where the Crime and Corruption Commission has carried out extensive investigations with respect to how that has occurred. This government seeks to avoid that type of network and web of bureaucratic red and green tape at all costs.
I note in this regard that the Greens have sought to move an amendment to have all major development plans of a non-aeronautical nature be subject to local and state planning laws and payment of rates. Firstly, with respect to the payment of rates, all non-aeronautical developments on airports are already required to pay rates through the ex gratia rates clause, which I believe, from memory, is clause 24 in the airport lease agreements. Secondly, and further to my comments above on the calls by the state premiers to regulate non-aeronautical developments, this amendment would create a legal and planning minefield. According to the Greens, their amendment attempts to subject non-aeronautical developers to state and territory local planning laws, but it does not achieve this result. Major development under section 89(1)(e), for example, could include an aircraft maintenance facility on the airport and would, under this amendment, be subject to state and territory and local planning laws.
This highlights how difficult it would be in practice to determine what a non-aeronautical development is. For example, is an air freight distribution centre established on the airport for sound logistical and freight requirements an aeronautical development or a non-aeronautical development? The recent decision by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services on the Sydney major development plan highlights the need for the Commonwealth to retain planning control. This complex decision involved consideration both of aviation and safety issues and of off-airport impacts on the road network. In line with this commitment to transparent airport planning, as indicated in the media release by the Minister for Transport and Regional Services on 13 February 2007, the government is also moving an amendment in response to specific concerns of the proposed reduction in the time for public consultation on airport master plans, major development plans and environmental strategies.
This amendment will alter the original reduction in consultation from 90 calendar days to 45 business days to allow for a public consultation period of 60 business days. In contrast, the opposition amendments attempt to increase the public comment period to 90 business days—in other words, some 126 calendar days, which is over four months. In line with what we have seen in the states in terms of planning, this is moribund; it puts weight on the hose; it is a ‘standing on the hose’ exercise which business cannot tolerate, particularly when airports operate to tight time frames and schedules. This is going too far in terms of balancing the committee’s needs versus a timely development of application process. The government amendment ensures that the benchmark for public consultation in the development of statutory planning documents—at the least, federal airport sites—is one of the longest when compared with other state and territory government planning regimes. To be perfectly clear, the government encourages consultation between airports and their communities, but equally important is the need to have a timely development application process which is simple and cost efficient.
In addition, the government’s airport consultation guidelines released in December 2006 set out the government’s expectations with regard to reports such as economic impact statements and road traffic studies. Further amendments to the bill sought by the opposition are also not supported by the government. In particular the opposition seeks to place an obligation upon the minister to provide to relevant state and territory planning agencies or local government authorities a statement of reasons for a decision if a minister’s decision is not in accordance with their submissions.
The government notes that there are already established processes under section 242 of the Airports Act 1996. A person whose interest is affected by the decision is able to obtain a written statement of reasons from the minister and may appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to review the decision upon its merits. In addition, judicial review is available from the Federal Court under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. Accordingly, the government sees no need to provide an additional requirement to provide reasons for a decision.
The opposition also seeks to remove the current deemed approval provisions under the Airports Act 1996. I have already made the government’s position on this clear. However, the proposed amendment goes further and has the effect of removing the time frame for the minister to consider a development. Therefore, there would be no obligation on a minister to make any decision within a specified time period, something more akin to the state and territory and local government planning processes, which I have already said are a bit of a dog’s breakfast.
While noting that there have been no deemed approvals under the act since its inception in 1996, the government further notes that the introduction of the stop-the-clock provisions will ensure that the minister is able to make an informed decision to approve or reject a development within the statutory period. The government’s view is that the current provisions provide an appropriate balance with the incentive for the minister to resolve the issue without unnecessary delay.
Finally, the opposition seeks to impose upon airports a requirement that they negotiate in good faith with the state and territory governments and/or local authorities on infrastructure requirements for off-airport impacts associated with the development. This would likely lead to a plethora of claims by the respective governments and authorities, many of which may not be directly related to the development or should be properly funded by governments or authorities. The government considers that this issue is best addressed on a case-by-case basis. There are a number of recent examples where there have been conditions placed on a number of approved developments. For example, traffic mitigation measures and infrastructure contributions have been required in respect of the Essendon Airport Outlet Centre, the Sydney airport international terminal precinct works and the brickworks at Perth airport. In addition there are examples of the airports and state and territory and local governments voluntarily reaching separate agreements on off-airport infrastructure costs directly associated with the development. Under the lease agreements airport lessee companies are required to make rate equivalent payments to their local governments, which is only fair. But the opposition’s amendment would provide unscrupulous governments with the opportunity to demand payment for services they should be providing. This legislation is not about helping governments to cost shift. Having addressed the opposition’s amendments and having dealt with government amendments, I commend the bill to the Senate.
Question negatived.
Original question agreed to.
Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>AIRPORTS AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2007-03-28,"—I rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 1) Bill 2007 and the Tax Laws Amendment (2006 Measures No. 7) Bill 2006. I say at the outset that Labor will be supporting both bills. Labor welcomes the government backflip in removing schedule 2 of the Tax Laws Amendment (2006 Measures No. 7) Bill 2006, which was the subject of an inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Economics. I note that the government has taken up Labor’s recommendation that schedule 2 be removed from the bill. Schedule 2 proposed amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to supposedly clarify the types of financial instruments which are eligible for the exemption from withholding tax. Tax is withheld from the payment of interest to nonresidents, subject to some exemptions. The exemptions exist to reduce the cost of Australian companies obtaining capital. Schedule 2 proposed to restrict the range of debt interest eligible for this withholding tax exemption. Schedule 2 proposed to introduce a regulation-giving power to sections to allow the minister to specify which instruments would qualify for the exemptions and which would not. Labor was certainly concerned that this change was more than a clarification and would change what could be claimed as an exemption in a substantive and substantial way and impede the ability of Australian companies to raise cost-effective finance.
Schedule 2 of the bill was referred to the committee at the insistence of Labor. In his summing up speech in the House of Representatives, the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer stated that he would not refer the bill to a committee—but we witnessed a backflip on that, with the bill referred the very next day. As evidenced by the submissions to the committee, there were concerns that the amendments might particularly affect the ability of Australian firms to participate in syndicated loans, for example. As noted in the submission by the Australian Bankers Association:
... the Bill will unreasonably impede access by borrowers to international debt markets ... the proposed amendments will prejudice the ability of Australian firms to participate in the syndicated loan market ...
Labor was also very concerned about the lack of consultation that had gone into framing this schedule. The economics committee report demonstrated Minister Dutton’s total failure to properly consult with key stakeholders on changes to tax laws, resulting in what really was substandard legislation. The ABA’s submission noted:
... a breakdown occurred in the consultation process in relation to the proposed IWT amendments.
This comes after Minister Dutton’s failure to consult with affected industries over the taxation treatment of non-forestry managed investment schemes. It is incredible that we had to insist that this schedule be referred to a Senate committee to conduct the consultations that the government should have conducted itself. As a result of Minister Dutton’s failure to consult, flawed legislation was brought to the parliament. It was thanks to Labor’s insistence that it was referred to the Senate committee and that key stakeholders had the opportunity to express their concerns with the legislation.
The committee heard that the government’s proposed changes could cause widespread damage and uncertainty to the loan market, impacting on the ability of Australian companies to raise finance. The committee also heard that the proposed legislation would have imposed high compliance costs on business—this from a government that claims to cut red tape and be pro business. The inquiry also highlighted that the bill might have a retrospective application. ABA’s submission stated:
... the Bill will be retrospective and will effectively impose cost (via interest withholding tax “gross up” clauses) on Australian borrowers who negotiated loan arrangements in good faith based on current law.
I will go to the report of the committee. The uncertainty that was demonstrated by the witnesses who appeared before the committee was based on the fact that the regulations that the government was going to rely upon were not available, even in draft form. So it was very unclear as to what debenture and debt interests were going to be excluded from and entitled to the interest withholding tax exemption.
This was a very frustrating process and the Australian Financial Markets Association argued that such a scenario would create uncertainty and generate additional compliance costs, which, contrary to the statement in the explanatory memorandum, would not be negligible. That was a very serious point of debate during the committee hearings. As a result, Labor members of the economics committee recommended with the support of Senator Murray that the Assistant Treasurer withdraw this schedule from the bill. The government members of the committee recommended that the Senate pass the bill. Today we see an amendment put to the Senate to remove schedule 2 of the bill—effectively agreeing with Labor’s position. Thank heavens that the Assistant Treasurer has actually seen some sense, after listening properly to affected parties, but it should have been done before the legislation was introduced.
I will now turn to the schedules of the bill that remain. Schedule 1 deals with an expansion of the small business exemptions for capital gains. These largely arise out of the Board of Taxation review of 2005, and are supported by the opposition. These recommended changes show that the process of having the Board of Taxation review elements of the tax act is a worthwhile process. Item 39 of the bill proposes to replace the current controlling individual 50 per cent test with a new significant individual 20 per cent test. That is to say, an individual will no longer have to own 50 per cent of the enterprise to gain the capital gains tax concession but will now only need to own 20 per cent of the enterprise. The 20 per cent participation percentage does not need to be entirely direct holdings but can include indirect holdings. These changes will certainly increase the availability of the small business concessions. The new significant individual test would enable up to eight taxpayers to access the small business capital gains concessions. More people with a substantial interest in a small business will be eligible for the concessions, which is good for the small business sector.
The bill also proposes changes to the maximum net asset value test to determine eligibility for the small business concessions. This test is satisfied if the sum of the net value of all capital gains tax assets of the taxpayer, an entity connected with that taxpayer, any small business capital gains tax affiliate of that taxpayer or entities connected with that person’s small business capital gains tax affiliates does not exceed $5 million. The proposed amendments to the maximum net value test would allow more small businesses to become eligible for the concessions by allowing more liabilities to be included in calculating whether the business breaches the $5 million threshold.
There are other changes which make it easier to gain the small business tax concession included in this bill. The definition of an active asset is clarified and the restrictions on the ownership of an asset for which a 15-year exemption is claimed are eased. In respect of the small business rollover concession, which allows a taxpayer to defer the making of a capital gain from a capital gains tax event happening in relation to a small business asset if the taxpayer acquires replacement assets, the proposed changes will abolish some of the current prerequisites for the rollover to make the rules to access this concession clearer and extend this concession to more taxpayers.
Proposed section 152-80 will make rules for the treatment of the capital gains tax assets that are part of the estate of a deceased person. Currently no rules exist. A legal personal representative of the beneficiary will now be allowed to access the same concessions that would have been available to the deceased. These are measures which improve the availability of the small business capital gains tax exemption, and Labor supports them all.
Of course, small business is deserving of the support of parliament and the treatment of small businesses when they are sold for either retirement or to be rolled over into new small businesses is an integral part of that support. Accordingly the Labor Party has no hesitation in supporting these changes.
Schedule 3 proposes amendments to remove the requirement for certain deductible gift recipients to maintain a gift fund. It also aims to standardise and improve integrity arrangements for deductible gift recipients. Further, Schedule 3 proposes changes to provisions in the Tax Administration Act 1953 to enhance the DGR integrity arrangements. Proposed changes will provide the Commissioner of Taxation with the power to request information from both endorsed and listed DGRs, thus aligning the integrity arrangements applicable to both types of DGR. Currently, the commissioner can only review endorsed DGRs to determine if they continue to meet the requirements for holding DGR status. Listed DGRs cannot be reviewed. These are sensible changes, which both reduce the compliance burden on charitable organisations and improve the integrity measures available to the ATO. Labor is happy to support these measures too.
Schedule 4 proposes amendments to extend the periods during which deductions will be permitted to certain DGRs. These include the Dunn and Lewis Youth Development Foundation, the Rotary Leadership Victoria Australian Embassy for Timor-Leste Fund, the St George’s Cathedral Restoration Fund and the St Michael’s Church Restoration Fund. Labor supports these measures and wishes these bodies well.
Schedule 5 proposes amendments to insert a statutory cap of 6⅔ years for tractors and harvesters used in the primary production sector. The commissioner is currently reviewing the effective life of assets in the primary production sector and, therefore, may increase the current safe harbour effective life of tractors and harvesters, which would be disadvantageous to taxpayers claiming the decline in the value of these assets for a deduction. By adding a statutory cap for tractors and harvesters, taxpayers who choose to have the effective life of these assets determined by the commissioner will be limited to an effective life of 6⅔ years.
I note that this measure is inconsistent with the recommendations of the Ralph Review of Business Taxation, which abolished accelerated depreciation. We do not oppose this measure. Farmers deserve all the support and certainty that they can get in this difficult time. However, it does need to be noted that this measure is contrary to the recommendations of the Ralph review and, if the government does go on making changes to the effective life regime in an ad hoc way, it will be undermining the integrity of the Ralph reforms and will add complexity to the tax law by treating certain assets differently.
The bill proposes to make changes to the Farm Management Deposits scheme to increase farmers’ eligibility for this scheme. The bill proposes to increase the threshold of non-primary production income from $50,000 to $65,000 and increase the deposit limit from $300,000 to $400,000. The FMD scheme allows primary producers to, in effect, shift income from good to bad years in order to deal with adverse economic events and seasonal fluctuations. The scheme allows primary producers to claim a deduction for farm management deposits made in the year of deposit, and to reduce their PAYG instalment income accordingly. When the farm management deposit is withdrawn, the amount of deduction previously allowed is included in both their PAYG instalment income and their assessable income in the repayment year. Labor supports the proposal to allow more primary producers to become eligible for the FMD scheme to assist in times of drought. The income threshold and deposit limit have not been increased since 1999.
The final schedule in this bill relates to capital protected borrowings. The changes would prevent a taxpayer from claiming a deduction for the part of the expense of a capital protected borrowing that is attributed to capital protection. Capital protected borrowings allow people to borrow money to buy shares and then, in effect, sell the shares back to the lender at a price no lower than what they paid for them should the price of the shares fall. The lender charges a premium on the interest rate to deal with this transfer of risk.
The ATO has previously taken the view that interest payable on capital protected borrowings used to purchase shares is not allowable to the extent that it exceeds the amount of the benchmark interest rates set out on the ATO website—that is, that the premium charged for risk transfer is not deductible. This view was successfully challenged in the case of the Commissioner of Taxation v Firth in 2002. The government announced that it would make changes to override the Firth case in April 2003. The interim methodology was announced by the then Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer in May 2003.
It is extraordinary that the government could announce legislative changes in 2003 and yet it is 2007 before we are debating them. It is true that the government flagged these changes and that the ATO warned people that the government would be legislating retrospectively, but for the government to wait four years before providing certainty and introducing this legislation is gross incompetence. This government has taken legislation by press release to a new level. It is simply not good enough. Labor will be supporting this measure, which comes much too late but which should be supported. The amendments provide certainty about the tax treatment of CPBs, and for that reason and because this is an integrity measure Labor supports the amendments.
Labor support the bill. We are not happy with the government’s performance on schedule 2 but we will not be standing in the way of the significant benefits which will flow to small business in this bill, and we will support it. However, the government will need to account for any adverse effects on the ability to raise capital that flow from these changes.
Labor is also supporting the second bill before us, the Tax Laws Amendment (2006 Measures No. 7) Bill 2006. Schedule 1 makes amendments to the secrecy and disclosure provisions of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 to allow the Commissioner of Taxation to disclose taxpayer information to Operation Wickenby task force officers and to officers of future compliance operations.
Operation Wickenby is a multi-agency crackdown on offshore tax fraud. It was established in 2004 and is led by the ATO. Other agencies involved are the Australian Crime Commission, the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. Allowing the commissioner to share information with other government agencies involved in Operation Wickenby should help compliance task forces investigate tax evasion and enforce the law. The amendments will allow the commissioner to disclose information to officers of Operation Wickenby task force agencies for any purpose related to the task force; allow the commissioner to disclose information to officers of the agencies of any future prescribed task forces established to protect Australia’s revenue; and allow an officer of any task force agency who receives such information to disclose the information to other task force officers and legal counsel. A sunset clause restricts the ATO from disclosing information to the agencies of the Operation Wickenby task force after 30 June 2012 as this is when funding for the task force runs out. Labor supports Operation Wickenby and other efforts by the ATO to address tax avoidance and evasion to increase fairness in the tax system and protect revenue.
The government has made a significant financial commitment to Operation Wickenby. Over $300 million has been allocated to the project over seven years. The 2006-07 budget estimates increased revenue as a result of the operation to $323 million over four years. I note that taxation commissioner Mr D’Ascenzo stated in additional estimates two weeks ago that he is confident the $323 million figure will be reached through increased compliance as a result of the operation. Labor hopes this is the case.
Schedule 2 of the bill proposes amendments to the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 to enable the Commissioner of Taxation or an ATO officer to provide information to an employee in response to a superannuation guarantee complaint against their employer. The secrecy provisions of the superannuation guarantee act prohibit the disclosure of information about the progress of any action in relation to any person. This prevents the ATO from providing information to employees on the progress of their superannuation guarantee complaints. The amendments will allow the ATO to provide information to an employee in response to the employee’s complaint that their employer has not complied with its superannuation guarantee obligations. The information the ATO may provide under the amendments is: steps taken to investigate the complaint, actions taken in relation to the complaint, and steps taken to recover any superannuation guarantee charge from the employer. Labor supports the proposal.
Schedule 3 of the bill proposes amendments to a number of tax acts to extend employee share schemes and related capital gains tax treatment to stapled securities. The amendments allow the ESS concessions to apply to stapled securities and rights to acquire stapled securities that include an ordinary share listed on the ASX. The capital gains provisions that refer to ESS shares and rights will apply to stapled securities. Fringe benefit tax treatment of stapled securities provided under ESS will also be made consistent with the treatment of ESS shares and rights. Labor recognises that these are two important financial pieces of legislation that, having been amended, are deserving of support in the interests of good fiscal management and transparency of taxation arrangements. Mr Dutton has saved himself and many stakeholders a great deal of angst. I certainly look forward to considering what will come before us again as amended schedule 2 in a new form when it is finally recommitted to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2007 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-03-28,"—The Tax Laws Amendment (2006 Measures No. 7) Bill 2006 and the Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 1) Bill 2007 propose changes to the 1936 and the 1997 Income Tax Assessment Act, the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997 and the Taxation Administration Act 1953. Additionally, the Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 1) Bill 2007 proposes legislative amendments to the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act, the Freedom of Information Act, the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act, the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act and A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999.
The measures proposed by the Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 1) Bill 2007 are contained within three schedules. Schedule 1 pertains to Project Wickenby. Schedule 2 addresses disclosure of information relating to superannuation guarantee complaints. Schedule 3 proposes changes to employee share schemes and stapled securities.
Schedule 1 amends secrecy and disclosure provisions to enable the Commissioner of Taxation to lawfully make disclosures of taxpayer information to Project Wickenby task force officers and in so doing empowers the task force to undertake their investigative duties to their full capacity. Many millions of honest, hardworking Australians pay their taxes and in so doing fulfil their social responsibility to the state and its people. Many millions of taxpayers means that the overwhelming majority of Australians affected by tax law are lower and middle-income earners. Whilst I am sure that paying taxes is not everyone’s favourite pastime, it is done and we all pay them because it is a universal experience. When it comes to the payment of taxes, ‘we are in it together’—just as, when it comes to deriving the benefits of taxation, all Australians enjoy them together.
Wickenby targets those high-income earners, those lucky few Australians, who can actually afford to pay their taxes and still be left with plenty in the bank but see themselves as above and beyond this universal experience. Many wealthy Australians expend vast amounts of energy and resources in an attempt to limit the amount of taxation they have to pay, and sometimes this activity turns out to be unlawful. Investigating tax avoidance and evasion involving the use of offshore entities by a number of high-income earners in Australia has been the focus of Project Wickenby. Project Wickenby has my full support, and I hope that the outcome of this endeavour is a timely reminder to those affluent Australians who do this sort of thing that amassing a fortune does not separate and isolate oneself from the crowd to the extent that one is above other Australians and therefore exempt from taxation.
Schedule 2 is a non-contentious amendment to the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 that, similar to schedule 1 of this bill, proposes changes to taxation disclosure laws to enable the Commissioner of Taxation to update employees about the progress of superannuation guarantee complaints. This is a much needed new responsive service, and I am grateful to the government for doing this.
Schedule 3 proposes extending extant taxation and capital gains tax provisions that apply to employee share schemes to stapled securities. Employee share schemes are an excellent means of encouraging Australian employees to invest, save and participate in the ownership and therefore the wealth of the companies for whom they work. It is a proposal that has the Democrats’ support.
The Tax Laws Amendment (2006 Measures No 7) Bill 2006 is a conglomeration of amendments arranged into seven schedules. Schedule 1 deals with amendments to small business capital gains tax concessions and compliance costs. Schedule 2 proposes changes to interest withholding tax exemptions, while schedules 3 and 4 update the status of deductible gift recipients and their associated compliance requirements. Changes to depreciation rules and farm management deposits of primary producers are contained in schedules 5 and 6 respectively. Finally, a clarifying amendment to capital protected borrowings is included in this bill as schedule 7. A genuine omnibus bill, in other words.
Schedule 1 proposes amending the 1936 Income Tax Assessment Act, the 1997 Income Tax Assessment Act and the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997 in order to increase the availability of certain capital gains tax concessions and to reduce compliance costs of small businesses. Specifically, the bill proposes reducing the business ownership test from 50 per cent to 20 per cent, thereby increasing the number of small business owners who can validly take advantage of this tax concession. This proposition represents a further concession to a number of small business owners who will therefore be able to avoid capital gains tax on the sale of the business or sale of capital invested in the business, assuming that the maximum net asset threshold of $5 million is not exceeded. As with the original concession, the question that remains is whether this provision is equitable and appropriate, giving, as it does, a number of individuals a generous provision with its associated cost to our tax revenue base. According to the explanatory memorandum, the financial impact of these amendments will be a cost to revenue of $303 million during the period 2007-08 to 2009-10, but I would suggest that this is a very conservative figure. It is a high cost.
Considering the window of opportunity that is about to open with the assent to the government’s simplified superannuation legislation, whereby superannuation investors are able to invest up to $1 million into their super funds before 1 July 2007, I would not be surprised to see a large number of existing business owners trying to cash in on this short-lived potential windfall. While I have always been supportive of measures that ensure small business owners do not bear an unfair tax burden and are properly incentivised, I do not automatically support large windfalls for a small section of the community because of circumstances knowingly designed by the government of the day, for it does fall upon the remainder to carry the cost.
In a broader context, this change to the small business CGT percentage ownership test is part of the government’s $52 billion mixed bag of tax concessions that have been announced and which in part are designed to shore up support in various sections of the community. Looking at the age demographic that ultimately stands to gain from a number of these concessions—that is, older and wealthy Australians of or around retirement age—it is upon the backs of younger Australians that the burden of any cost to tax revenue will often fall.
One of the greatest challenges facing future governments will be how to sustain their revenue base. I would hope that future governments do review the merit of each and every tax concession on a periodic and regular basis. Broadening the base does have the merit that you can then lower rate. That is why I will hesitate to automatically support measures that establish tax concessions as it is this form of legislation that we will have to revisit as parliamentarians whenever we have to rectify unforeseen leakages. In my view it is not the specific legislation that is ever the problem but, rather, the underlying policy and extent supporting the multitude of tax concessions that now exist throughout our taxation system.
For more than a decade the Democrats have argued that welfare for the wealthy must end—that is a large part of what broadening the base means. The Democrats’ five-pillar structural income tax reform plan consists of raising the tax-free threshold significantly, indexing the rates, broadening the base and reforming the tax/welfare intersects, and only after that is done considering issues such as raising the top tax threshold.
Schedule 2 of this bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to clarify sections 128F and 128FA, which both relate to interest withholding tax exemptions. These amendments will ensure that financial instruments eligible for interest withholding tax exemption status are correctly classified as a debenture for the purposes of the 1936 act. These measures were intended to protect the integrity of the tax system, which the government believes is open to some abuse through the liberal interpretation of what constitutes a debenture.
Thankfully, this schedule was the subject of a Senate committee hearing. It was here I was persuaded that schedule 2 may negatively affect Australian firms’ ability to participate in syndicated loans and impede access by borrowers to international debt markets. The submissions also raised concerns that significant compliance costs would be imposed on business as a result of uncertainty, producing risk pricing. The Labor senators and I said that schedule 2 should be pulled and reintroduced once the issues raised in the committee were resolved. The government senators rather recklessly said: ‘Pass the bill.’ The Treasurer was smarter than that and has pulled the schedule. Well done, Treasurer; well done, Treasury.
Schedules 3 and 4 of the bill pertain to the regulation and status of deductible gift recipients respectively. Schedule 3 amends both the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 and the Taxation Administration Act 1953 in order to streamline the regulatory arrangements of deductible gift recipients and thereby reduce their compliance costs. The ITAA 1997 amendments will remove the requirements for entities that are DGRs to operate a separate gift fund. Entities that only operate as DGRs will still be required to operate a separate gift fund but they will be allowed to consolidate multiple funds into a single gift fund.
Administratively this legislative amendment is a positive step since excessive red tape can be an onerous duty and an added expense for any DGRs. However it should be noted that DGRs and the not-for-profit sector in general are poorly regulated and open to serious abuse by unscrupulous organisations. The whole area of charities, not-for-profits and so on is unfinished business and I hope that the next government will tackle this area with some comprehensive plan.
The trade-off inherent in this schedule, as it applies to DGRs, is a reduction in onerous administrative duties but it does represent an increased risk of a misuse of funds. Since the organisation that functions exclusively as a DGR will only be required to maintain a single fund but may operate several contemporaneous and discrete not-for-profit activities each receiving donations via DGR status, funds received on the premise of being used in one particular project may still be misappropriated for another unrelated project. When people make donations to organisations they assume that the money given will be used for the purpose it is donated. If it is donated to build wells in Africa, then most people would prefer to know that it is actually used for that purpose rather than to rent offices in the CBD of a large Australian city. Research by the organisation Giving Australia supports the contention that most people like to know where their money is going and preferably how it is going to be used when they donate it. Some people take it as a matter of faith that the money will be used to support a specific cause. They do not assume it will go to ancillary services provided by a DGR.
However, DGRs in general are not legally required to provide such financial information—and I will draw the attention of the chamber to a very good report last September by the Institute of Chartered Accountants, which tried to lift the standards with respect to financial statements by DGRs and charities. For every organisation that provides relevant financial information there are many that do not, so Australia has a lightly regulated not-for-profit system where some organisations take their financial responsibilities and reporting to donors and grantors seriously while others fall in the middle and still others take for granted their donors’ faith that their money is being used appropriately and do not report as they should. Donors to DGRs must know where their money is going. Whether it is going to produce CDs or build a church, provide water to African people who are in difficulty or lobby for change to free trade agreements to protect a section of rainforest—or even if it is dedicated to electing a member of parliament—donors must know where their money is going.
Currently there are few ways for a donor to find out how their money is used and no way to assess whether the organisation to which they donate uses it more or less effectively than another organisation doing the same type of work—in other words, there is no benchmarking. This needs to change. Freeing up DGRs from the regulatory burden of maintaining independent gift funds is a positive move as it reduces administrative expenses, but I must reiterate that in isolation this move just compounds the general difficulty with the not-for-profit sector, which in general requires much improved, much more consistent and much simplified regulatory controls.
Bearing this thought in mind, I acknowledge the amendments to the TAA 1953 proposed by this schedule, which expand the powers of the Commissioner of Taxation to review the activity of DGRs. More specifically, the Commissioner of Taxation will be able to review all DGRs, as opposed to only ‘endorsed DGRs’ as is presently the case, to determine if they continue to meet the requirements for holding DGR status. In other words, it is a move to try to keep them honest. Similarly, schedule 3 also contains amendments requiring all DGRs to maintain adequate accounting records, and in that respect I remind the chamber that the Australian Accounting Standards Board is currently looking at an accounting standard which will be specific to not-for-profits. This is a welcome amendment which, in conjunction with the relaxed regulatory environment, sends a positive message to DGRs, which is that, in return for providing greater flexibility, these increased powers will be used to check on DGRs that do not play by the rules.
As I have stated, schedule 4 also relates to DGRs. It amends the ITAA 1997 to extend the period for which deductions are allowed for gifts to a number of specific funds that have time-limited DGR status. They include the following named ones: Dunn and Lewis Youth Development Foundation Ltd, Rotary Leadership Victoria Australian Embassy for Timor-Leste Fund Ltd, St George’s Cathedral Restoration Fund and St Michael’s Church Restoration Fund. While I am not a strong adherent to religion, nevertheless I do very much enjoy the results of the funds invested in restoring these magnificent buildings. They are great assets to many cities. The extension of time to operate with DGR status will enable these organisations to complete their work. According to the explanatory memorandum, the financial impact will be a cost to revenue of $4.3 million over the years 2007-08 to 2009-10. There are not any expected compliance costs.
Schedules 5 and 6 are concessions to farmers affected by drought. On an equity basis, other small businesses have not received the same level of financial support as farmers even though they are in the same regions but, considering the exceptional circumstances created by drought, these measures may indeed be warranted. Australia will continue to be prone to drought. Very few people begrudge exceptional, emergency or shorter term aid to these regions and their farmers, but many ask whether taxpayers should continue to support that minority of marginal farmers and businesses in the longer term in this way.
Schedule 5 amends the ITAA 1997 by applying a capped effective life of six years and eight months to tractors and harvesters used in the primary production sector. This amendment preserves the current period over which tractors and harvesters used in the primary production sector are depreciated.
Schedule 6 amends the ITAA 1936 to increase the non primary production income threshold from $50,000 to $65,000 per income year and the total amount a primary producer can hold in a farm management deposit from $300,000 to $400,000. The explanatory memorandum says that the financial impact of schedule 6 will be a cost to revenue of $72 million for the years 2006-07 to 2010-11 and that there will be ‘small transitional costs’—for the Australian tax office, tax agents and software developers—‘but no increase in ongoing compliance costs’.
Schedule 7 amends the ITAA 1997 in relation to the taxation of capital protected borrowings, or CPBs. Currently, a borrower with a CPB that does not have a separately identifiable capital protection feature is able to gain an income tax deduction for what might actually be a capital cost. The amendments seek to implement equivalent tax treatment of capital protection on a CPB whether or not the capital protection is explicitly or implicitly provided for. To do this, schedule 7 also includes methodologies to determine the amount reasonably attributable to the cost of capital protection. The explanatory memorandum says that the financial impact is nil and that the compliance cost impact should see a reduction in compliance costs for both issuers and borrowers of CPBs. The clarifying amendment ensures that certain capital protected borrowing costs, a form of equity investment with a guaranteed downside protection, that are not expenses and are of a capital cost nature cannot be claimed as a tax deduction. This closes a potential tax loophole and has my and the Democrats’ support. In conclusion, I indicate that with both these bills you should take into account the note of caution I have outlined, given my concerns as to unfinished business and some wariness about the costs of these measures. Nevertheless, the Democrats will support these bills.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2007 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2007-03-28,"—I want to thank Senator Stephens and Senator Murray for their hard work on this piece of legislation and for their contributions in the Senate today. These two measures involve a number of alterations to the tax legislation, none of which are opposed, so on that basis I will take the opportunity to be brief.
Firstly, the Tax Laws Amendment (2006 Measures No. 7) Bill 2006 amends the capital gains tax legislation so that small business concessions are increased, to make them available to more small businesses and to reduce compliance costs. I foreshadow, as has been acknowledged by senators, that the government will be moving amendments such that schedule 2 will be removed from the bill. Whilst the interest withholding tax measure has been developed in close consultation with industry stakeholders and that consultation has gone on for a long time, further issues have been brought to the government’s attention following the introduction of the bill to parliament. The government would like more time to more fully consider those issues before implementing this measure.
The bill also gives effect to the government’s budget announcement that it will enhance philanthropy in Australia by streamlining the integrity rules and reducing the compliance costs applying to deductible gift recipients, or DGRs. Additionally, the bill amends the list of deductible gift recipients in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 by extending the time period for which four particular entities can receive tax deductible donations. Extending their deductible gift recipient status will assist those organisations to continue to attract public support for their very worthwhile activities, as mentioned by Senator Murray.
With the drought affecting farmers and their families across Australia, the last thing they need is a change in the tax treatment of their valuable farm equipment. That is why the government has implemented a statutory cap which will mean no change to the income tax treatment of harvesters and tractors. The bill also amends the Farm Management Deposits scheme to increase the non primary production income threshold from $50,000 to $65,000 and the total deposit limit from $300,000 to $400,000. Increasing these thresholds will assist primary producers to cope in this time of hardship.
The bill also provides certainty in the tax treatment of capital protected borrowings. Under a typical capital protected product, the investor is protected from a fall in the price of the shares as the loan facility includes a capital protection feature that gives the investor the right to transfer the shares back to the lender for the amount outstanding on the loan. These amendments will ensure that part of the expense on a capital protected product is attributed to the cost of the capital protection feature and that it is not interest and is not deductible where the cost is capital in nature.
I turn to the second of the bills, the Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 1) Bill 2007. As set out by senators, schedule 1 of this bill amends taxation secrecy laws to assist in the coordinated enforcement of Australia’s laws by Project Wickenby and future similar task forces. These amendments preserve the general protection of taxpayer privacy. They speak for themselves. Obviously, the very worthwhile and important work of the ACC and the Australian Taxation Office through Project Wickenby needs the assistance of these amendments.
Schedule 3 amends the tax law to extend the employee share scheme tax concessions to certain stapled securities. Currently it is difficult for employers with stapled securities on issues to provide their employees with access to the employee share scheme concessions. For obvious reasons, these amendments are welcomed by senators on all sides of the chamber. I commend the bills to the Senate.

"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2007-03-28,"—Senator O’Brien was very keen to make a comprehensive contribution on this bill and in normal circumstances he would be the first speaker for the opposition. But, given that there are only moments to go before this debate ends, I thought I might take the opportunity to make a few brief but concise and valuable remarks about this legislation—and I notice that the crowd on the government side of the chamber is building in anticipation of the remarks that I am about to make! The Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2007, as I understand it, amends the Farm Household Support Act 1992, the Social Security Act 1991 and the Age Discrimination Act 2004 to allow agriculturally dependent small businesses—

"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2007-03-28,"—It goes with saying that, in commencing my final speech to the Senate today, I do so with some regrets. All politicians, either actual or aspiring, know Enoch Powell’s famous maxim about our inevitable end point. It will suffice to say that both the time and the manner of my parliamentary ending leave me with a sense of unfinished business. However, it is not my intention this afternoon to dwell on the negative or to wax lyrical about what might have been had things been different—nor, senators will be pleased to know, am I taking this opportunity to lecture the Senate on what I have achieved in my time as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland or the Australian Senate, or as a minister in each. I believe it is important to make the point that I am proud of the contribution that I have made to Queensland and Australian politics. I have been honoured to serve Queenslanders both at home and in Canberra, and regard it as a privilege to have worked constantly for the people and the interests of my home state.
I have also been particularly honoured and gratified by the opportunity to serve as Minister for Ageing and to assist in building the later life social infrastructure for those who built our nation. It is my intention to carry my overriding commitment for the public good of the Queensland people and the Australian people, including ageing Australians, through to the next chapter of my life outside this place by pursuing the same values which have motivated me to this point.
What I want to do in this last speech is to address three matters: first, my firm belief that a political career is a worthy, significant and honourable ambition; second, my view that the principles on which this nation was built, namely its Judaeo-Christian traditions, and the conservative instinct which they inform should continue to guide the parliament; and, third, the need for Australia to maintain good government through the coalition and in the person of Prime Minister Howard.
To begin, I think it is a fair observation that the art or profession of politics is not currently held in the highest regard by the community. One need look no further than the recent New South Wales election for evidence of a culture where elections can be considered in the public mind, or at least the media’s mind, as a damnable choice between two uninspiring options. For those of us at the coalface, it remains self-evident and not a little frustrating that the wrong questions are being asked. Anyone with an ounce of regard for the future of this nation will wince at the thinly camouflaged demand of the media for a beauty contest rather than a battle of philosophy, priorities and capability to govern. I remain of the view that good politics and good policy will out from both sides, though I am aware that some of my colleagues, particularly at this point, may regard me as a starry-eyed optimist.
Around 18 months ago, a previous opposition leader made a speech at the University of Melbourne where he told young Australians with political ambition that they should not even think of ‘going there’. In that speech, Mr Latham cited some of the costs of political life, which none of us could deny, including the loss of privacy and the constant separation from family. He also cited as a critical negative what he said were two party-specific versions of the politics of personal destruction. I suspect that I am not the first to note that there may be elements of hypocritical sanctimony in those criticisms, and I do not intend to repeat them here today. I might, however, be the first to suggest that the focus on the personal is not of necessity an undesirable characteristic of contemporary politics. It certainly makes the game robust—and of course I speak from somewhat recent experience—and at times it will cause each of us to question why we walk this stage. The scrutiny is constant and it is certainly intrusive.
Let me suggest that the rigorous testing which prospective candidates experience on their way through the parties has two clear positives. The first is that it is a comprehensive audition for the reality TV that is modern politics. There is no point pretending that the media cycle will get shorter, one’s personal life will remain private or one’s financial activities will remain unexamined. Second, and a consequence of the first, is that this all promotes personal integrity, and integrity—not the clever phrase or the careful public posture—is the lifeblood of successful long-term candidates. If anyone doubts that, consider what has allowed our current Prime Minister to transcend the flighty fashions of three decades of federal politics. Integrity never goes out of style, and it is integrity which will allow an aspirant to survive the constant examination they experience in political life.
My own position is that I am proud to say that, while my compliance may have had some well documented omissions, my integrity remains intact. Ultimately, the fact that integrity still matters means that young people considering politics should view it as a noble profession for those who are willing to commit to nobility as their watchword. Taking part in the government of the state or the nation, whether as a leader, minister or simple member of parliament, is an intellectual challenge and an emotional contest and is ultimately rewarding. At its heart is the question of contending ethical, philosophical and managerial competence, and I continue to regard it as a most compelling contest. I commend it to all Australians, particularly younger Australians, who feel they can contribute and who feel the outcome is worth the inevitable sacrifices. I would note that this recommendation is to people at both ends of the political-philosophical spectrum. We need constant revitalisation of the whole polity, though I remain sufficiently partisan to hope that those who emerge on our side will continue to hold an edge.
That is the process; but what about the substance? When we started our magazine the conservative in 2006, one of the first issue’s articles was from Indiana Republican Congressman Mike Pence and included what was for me a most memorable phrase:
 ... I am a Christian, a Conservative and a Republican in that order …
I think I am probably recognised as a little too tribal in my party loyalties to credibly repeat that hierarchy with the word ‘Liberal’ in place of ‘Republican’, but it remains for me a profound statement. It is a proposition which got me thinking about what it is that sits at the centre of our society and our nation, and what it is that makes Australia so successful.
Whether it is the private success of Australian families, the innovation of our universities and our businesses or the unique and awe-inspiring reserve of our troops in Afghanistan, Iraq and other international theatres, there are myriad responses to this question. The one which has informed much of my thinking over my political career and which drives many in this building whom I admire is that our society is built on an inheritance of Judaeo-Christian beliefs, traditions and values. Those include the belief that life is inviolable, that the family is the building block of a successful nation and that the institution and sacrament of marriage, which creates families, should remain an unassailable part of our social state. I am well aware that these are not necessarily the most popular views, but the popular path is generally just the easy path. What is right is, perhaps paradoxically, rarely easy.
We in the Liberal Party are unashamedly the party of the traditional family. We regard it as a memory of our past and the custodian of our future. Throughout history no society has succeeded which has sought to build political structures which denigrate marriage, family or the private nurturing of children. Those societies break and fail, as we can see from the Soviet Union, through to Cambodia and into the current ravages of sub-Saharan Africa. This is a lesson we should never forget. No government should resile from protecting either these traditions or the faiths which sit at their foundation. It is a fact that, while one may now be able to claim that we can identify our social structures without reference to the faiths which formed their crucible, we tread a very dangerous path if we seek to separate the two. The religious traditions on which this nation is built are more than a vague preference of an ordered society. They provide clear delineation between good and its opposite, and without them we will quickly find ourselves adrift.
I have been in the profession of politics long enough to know that only respect for our traditions and our institutions—both temporal and spiritual—will stem the tide against those who would reinvent a society based on convenience and desire, rather than on long-term social sustainability. That is an option open to both sides of Australian politics. I draw comfort from the fact that neither side has abandoned it.
I am confident that those who stand for traditional values, rather than transient political fashions, will remain in the ascendant. I am proud to have stood by those of you who agree with this proposal—including many of those on the other side of the Senate—who have stood up for the rights of marriage, the family, the child and the unborn. I commend you to continue that battle to ensure that Australia retains an unchallengeable claim to being the good society that it is.
On the subject of which, it did not pass my notice that in churches throughout the world last Sunday the Gospel text—and the homily upon it—was John chapter 8, where Christ says:
He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone ...
I took the opportunity to reflect on this lesson—as one does—and to compare it to current circumstances. Let me say to all of you honourable senators that, in drawing this comparison, I do not seek to identify myself with the victim. Rather, I can recognise myself within that crowd; perhaps not the first to leave the scene but, I hope, not the last.
I spoke earlier of the need for integrity and ability in this profession. I recognise that, far too often, we are all quick to point out the failings of others, not the least to distract attention from our own. Perhaps a pause for reflection is needed on that.
Continuing in an unbroken line from the Judaeo-Christian traditions, I come to my particular philosophical views, which centre around the principle of conservatism—that unlikely but remarkably complementary twin of liberalism. The inseparable blend of these principles is the foundation upon which Australia’s most successful party was built. I believe conservatism is a political philosophy with many definitions. It is also one which is sometimes pejoratively dismissed as simply a philosophy of tolerable imperfection. But I believe it is much more than that. I read in last week’s Spectator magazine one of the most succinct and, to my thinking, one of the most correct and engaging definitions of conservatism that I have ever encountered. On the theme of taxation settings, the columnist Charles Moore wrote:
The most basic rule for any Conservative considering the structure of taxes should be — identify with the interest of the rising class and support it. Help the people who may not have much money now, but have the energy to try to get on in the world and give their children opportunities which they lacked.
This is the principle which, at the microcosmic family level, guided my parents in their emigration from Sicily over 40 years ago, though they would never have used the terminology that I have. It provided the support which offered me the opportunity to develop from an immigrant child, without his first word of English, to a senator and a minister in our nation’s government. It is a principle which I think is more than good; it is instinctive. It reflects the fundamental concept of subsidiarity, which comes to us via Aquinas and which defines the significance of the family as a decision maker to be fostered rather than guided or governed. It is an instinct which I would hold is only deniable in a cause of bitterness and opportunism.
I am not so self-indulgent that I would seek to identify an individual legacy from my time in Australian public life. I recognise that, from the top down, we are all replaceable. But I hope that my constancy in supporting and promoting our traditions, both the fundamental and enduring values of our faith and the derived principles of modern conservatism, means that my time here has been well spent.
Finally I want to confirm that, despite my separation from it, my support for this government and its achievements—past and future—will never waver. I retain my confidence that maximum employment, the highest ever participation in the markets which hold this nation’s wealth, low interest rates and an internationally applauded record of national security will provide continuing public appeal and an enduring legacy.
To close, I want to say a few brief thankyous. First and most importantly, I thank my family—my wife, Letitia, and my two sons, who have stood by me when they have unnecessarily been made part of my political trials. It is probably considered trite and formulaic these days to say how much the rock of the family provides support in both the good and the difficult times, but in my case it happens to be entirely true, and I am utterly grateful for that.
I would like to again say thank you particularly to those ever loyal and close friends who have encouraged me during all of my time in politics and who mentored me. I mentioned many by name in my first speech in 2002 and, without repeating the list, I would like to thank them again and the many other friends that I have made and who have supported me since then. Without that support I would not have served either in the Queensland parliament or in the Senate. And to the Liberal Party, my most sincere thanks. I will now go back to being a simple party member, but it will always be my first political home.
I would also like to thank the officers and staff of the Senate, who have always given me professional and courteous assistance. Many others remain to be thanked, not the least the many individual personal staff and party supporters who have kept me motivated and able to do my job in both the party and the parliament. For the benefit of time I will simply make that a collective thanks, although one name must be mentioned and that is that of Desley Wharton, my personal assistant, who has seen me through two parliaments and the spaces in between and whose support and trust has never foundered. Thank you to those in this place and the other who have served with me, guided me and listened to me over the last five years. I look forward now with genuine optimism to the next phase of my life and I wish all of you and your loved ones the very best of good health and happiness.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2007-03-28,"—Yesterday Senator McLucas asked me a number of questions about aged-care places. I undertook to provide to the Senate any further detail that I could. I can report the Minister for Ageing tabled a report in the House of Representatives yesterday which exonerates the former Minister for Ageing, Senator Santo Santoro, of any wrongdoing. Furthermore, Varsity Aged Care’s application was assessed with all applications in the 2006 aged-care approvals round. The allocation of aged-care places to Varsity Aged Care was not made until the department undertook all necessary checks including those necessary to approve its application to be an approved provider of aged care. This has recently been completed. The decisions to grant approved provider status to Varsity Aged Care and to allocate it places were made by the Department of Health and Ageing.
Varsity Aged Care is a separate legal entity to the McKenzie Aged Care Group, the approved provider who operates Armitage Manor. The department was aware, when it took its decision to grant approved provider status and allocate places to Varsity, that there are key personnel in common with another provider, the McKenzie Aged Care Group. The McKenzie Aged Care Group operates the manor. The department took into account all relevant facts, in accordance with the legislative requirements of the Aged Care Act 1997, in making its decisions, including the compliance history of the McKenzie Aged Care Group. The department noted that past problems in relation to Armitage Manor have been successfully resolved and the home currently has three-year accreditation.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Aged Care</title>,Questions Without Notice: Additional Answers,9,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2007-03-28,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by Senators Abetz and Minchin to questions without notice asked today, relating to climate change.
Every week we hear something a little more arrogant and a little more sanctimonious from the Howard government on climate change. How fascinating it was today to see Senator Abetz and Senator Minchin effectively throw up their hands and say, ‘Well, what do you want us to do—shut down the whole economy?’ This shows that this government has no idea of the seriousness of this issue and it is choosing to make that kind of ridiculous and, I think, quite immature statement about the economic and social challenge ahead of us on climate change. What we now know, and this was reinforced today by Sir Nicholas Stern’s speech at the National Press Club, is that there is a chronic market failure. We know that climate change will cost the global economy—according to Sir Nicholas Stern, more than both world wars and the Great Depression combined. Unless, he says, the world acts to reduce carbon emissions, the global economy could be cut by up to 20 per cent. Therefore, the reasonable conclusion is that early action on climate change is critical to protecting our future prosperity.
But we have none of that from the Howard government, despite the auspicious source of these statements being today at the National Press Club in Canberra, the national capital of Australia. They persist in making excuses saying what they are doing is enough. Well, it is not enough. We know that the Howard government is full of climate sceptics and that they are busy trying to talk their way through growing community pressure and growing political pressure, certainly from the Labor Party and others here in the federal parliament but also from right around the world, to take decisive action.
Labor are conducting a national climate change summit this Saturday, coinciding with Earth Day, because we are focused on the sorts of solutions and consensus that we need to try to find amongst the stakeholders in the Australian economy and community. That will bring together scientists, business leaders, union leaders, community stakeholders and of course the Labor Party to hear what they have to say about the urgent necessity to address climate change in Australia. That is on top of Labor’s commitment to ratify the Kyoto protocol and other initiatives that I will go through shortly.
Firstly, I want to make a point about ratifying the Kyoto protocol. Many people have now seen the movie An Inconvenient Truth and it grates so appallingly on many of those people when the US and Australia are identified as the only two countries holding out on ratifying the Kyoto protocol. It is clearly there as a symbol of not only the Howard government’s neglect of climate change but their subservience to the administration of George W Bush in America and his anti-climate change stance that this government is happy to mimic, to be a puppet to, at the expense of all of us, not least the climate change refugees whom we may well have on our own doorstep with the islands in the Torres Strait predicted to be affected by global warming through rising sea levels. So it is an issue that is very close to home, one that is so in a very tangible and practical way for those people.
Today Labor announced another policy to add to our growing suite of very specific policies to tackle climate change. Labor’s leader, Mr Rudd, and our environment spokesperson, Mr Garrett, announced a plan to provide $50 million to help subsidise the installation of solar power in homes and community buildings around the country. This will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 16,800 tonnes a year, the equivalent of taking 4,000 cars off the road for a full year. This is another policy, joining our policies on green cars and clean coal, that a Labor government will put in place if elected. Another critical issue is that we will substantially increase the mandatory renewable energy target and set up a national emissions trading scheme, with the overall goal of cutting Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions by 60 per cent by 2050. All of these things stand in stark contrast with a lazy, sceptical government that is incapable of, and unwilling to, take climate change seriously. (Time expired)

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2007-03-28,"—The trouble with the Labor Party’s credibility on this issue is that they have parroted a very lazy greenhouse policy for the past 11 years that they have been in opposition. They have three-word policies and two-word policies, one of which is, ‘Sign Kyoto’. We happen to know that signing Kyoto will do absolutely nothing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Australia or globally. We also happen to know that most of the countries that have ratified Kyoto—you can count the exceptions on one hand—will go massively over their targets. Eighteen months ago, during an election campaign in Canada, Australia was being lectured by the former Prime Minister of Canada, Paul Martin, because we and the United States had not ratified Kyoto. Paul Martin was kicked out, probably because most Canadians understood that, while he was lecturing his cousins in the United States and his friends in Australia on greenhouse gas emissions, Canada had gone 30 per cent over its Kyoto target, leaving the incoming government of Stephen Harper with a massive problem. Of course, Mr Martin’s credibility was nil. The Labor Party’s other policy is the three-word policy of a ‘national emissions trading scheme’.

Senator Kemp interjecting—

—Yes, that is four words, Senator Kemp. For 11 years they have been saying the four words ‘national emissions trading scheme’, but they are no closer to telling us what it is.
We know that if you have a trading scheme you will have a price on carbon. The last time we heard from the Labor Party about a price on carbon was when they were in power. The then environment minister, Senator John Faulkner, now sits, a lonely figure, on the back bench with the coffee plunger he inherited from Cheryl Kernot and the scars he inherited from his flirtation with Mark Latham. The only thing he has left in terms of his failed policies, let alone his failed allegiances with Kernot and Latham, is his carbon tax. He came into this place just over 11 years ago—he sat where Senator Abetz now sits—and proposed a carbon tax. Of course, the political flak flew within hours of him proposing a carbon tax. He had come back from a climate change conference in Bonn. He had decided that a carbon tax was the answer. He came back from Bonn all brave—having sat in the first-class section of an aeroplane—and said: ‘Let’s have a carbon tax for Australia. We’ll lead the world.’ Of course, greater minds and greater political thinkers than Senator Faulkner—and there are a lot of those around the place—said, ‘You’d better go quiet on the carbon price.’
You at least have to give credit where it is due. Senator Faulkner had the guts to say, ‘We need a carbon tax and a carbon price.’ But that was the last time Labor said anything specific. Ever since then, for 11 long years in opposition—not long enough, I say—they have been talking about a national emissions trading scheme. The closest we got to that came not from the lazy sods opposite who call themselves an opposition but from Roger Wilkins, the former head of the Cabinet Office in New South Wales under the Labor government of Mr Carr. To his credit, Roger Wilkins worked away with his state comrades for a number of months and they came up with a design for a national emissions trading scheme. Labor have not signed on to it federally; they have not done any work like this.
Roger Wilkins got the states together and they launched this scheme. You will recall, Mr Deputy President, that the Premier of Queensland, your home state, said: ‘We’re not going to be part of Roger Wilkins’s New South Wales policy. We’re out.’ They were out by, I think, lunchtime. Then Alan Carpenter figured that it would be very bad for Western Australia because it would kill jobs in WA—just as Mr Beattie had figured that it was going to kill jobs in Queensland—and he pulled out. So, at the state level, the best the Labor Party has been able to come up with in terms of a trading scheme is a document that the two big resource-rich states pulled out of within 12 hours. We are yet to see Mr Rudd come up with a policy. What is the best thing he can offer the Australian people after 11 years of lazy opposition? What are they going to do this weekend? ‘Let’s have a summit. Let’s have a meeting.’ Talk about lazy!
I would just like to correct the record in relation to the US not ratifying the Kyoto protocol. There was a vote by the United States Senate on what was called the Byrd-Hagel amendment. It was a vote on Mr Gore’s proposal to ratify the Kyoto protocol, and it went down 95 votes to nil. Do you know who were the great President Bush supporters who voted against ratifying the Kyoto protocol? Senator Edward Kennedy, Senator Joe Lieberman, Senator John Kerry—all those people. It was not some sort of Bush conspiracy. The Democratic Party of the United States knew that signing the Kyoto protocol would be bad for the jobs of United States citizens, just as our government recognised it would be bad for our citizens.

"Wortley, Sen Dana",ALP,2007-03-28,"—I also rise to take note of the answers provided by Senator Abetz and Senator Minchin on the issue of climate change. Climate change is a serious issue with serious consequences. It is only now that we are in an election year that the issue has made the gigantic leap from being way off the government’s action radar for nearly 11 years to being on the government’s election agenda—an agenda that places greater importance on removing the working conditions and job security of thousands of hardworking Australians, with Work Choices, than on addressing climate change and our national water crisis.
The Howard government cannot be trusted on the environment. It has wasted a decade denying the existence of climate change. The government has failed to adequately address environmental challenges. It has failed to deliver a real action plan policy addressing climate change. It has failed to deliver to the Australian people on the environment for our children and for future generations. Labor has a policy of ratifying Kyoto; the government does not. Labor has a policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 60 per cent by 2050; the government does not. Labor has a half-a-billion-dollar national clean coal initiative; the government does not. Labor has a $500 million green car innovation fund; the government does not.
Today, federal Labor announced that a Rudd Labor government would encourage the installation of solar panels across Australia to slash greenhouse gas emissions. Federal Labor’s solar home power plan will invest $50 million over four years to install solar power in our homes, schools and community buildings. This will provide up to $4,000 a household—about 25 per cent of the cost of a typical domestic solar power system as a rebate available to homeowners.
The Howard government has had numerous opportunities to pass legislation to deal with the effect of climate change on our environment, but it has refused to do so. Why shouldn’t the people of Australia be cynical? As recently as November last year, we witnessed this government rushing legislation through in the form of the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill—another lost opportunity to improve on existing legislation and address the very real challenges we are facing in Australia and around the world. Not only did the government fail to take up the opportunity to improve on the legislation but, through the changes, it effectively weakened existing legislation. It weakened the protection that the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 provided for Australia’s biodiversity and heritage.
That is why the people of Australia will not take this government seriously when it comes to the environment. We have seen nearly 11 years of inaction by the Howard government in the face of Australia’s greatest challenge. The government cannot be excused, it cannot be forgiven and it cannot be trusted with the environment. The Australian people have a right to climate change policies that will be effective, that will give our children and generations following a real future. Australian business and farmers cannot afford indecision and scepticism; they are already hurting. This government has failed to adequately address environmental challenges. It has failed to deliver. In the face of overwhelming evidence that warming temperatures and associated changes in rainfall and sea levels will have consequences for both the world’s environment and economy, they have been sceptical—and it appears from comments made by those opposite that some are still in denial.
Inaction on and denial of climate change and our water crisis have already resulted in Australian business facing billions of dollars in lost opportunities, and Australian businesses and jobs being forced offshore. It has resulted in Australia’s electricity generators being reluctant to invest in clean coal technology while the government refuses to commit to a carbon trading scheme. It has resulted in Australia’s wind industry being left with $13 billion worth of projects stalled on their books, while at the same time the global wind industry has experienced another record year of expansion.
The Howard government lacks good policy and strong leadership. It is out of touch when it comes to protecting the planet for future generations. Federal Labor believe that climate change is one of our greatest threats and is determined to tackle it. (Time expired)

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2007-03-28,"—If climate change is our greatest problem, as Senator Wortley concluded in her remarks, why is the Labor Party policy so completely vacuous? It is astonishing. I listened as Senator Wortley remarked on the Labor Party’s policy. We note that after 11 years, in order to develop your policy, you have to have a summit. When in doubt, have a summit—that is exactly what happens with the Labor Party. After 11 years, it has no idea what to do.
For Senator Wortley and Senator Lundy to lecture the government on policy in here today is quite astonishing. It was a very weak effort. I noticed that this time Senator Wortley steered clear of the coal industry because the Labor Party is so divided over that particular issue. Many workers are employed in the coal industry and they are very anxious to hear what the Labor Party policy is in relation to their industry. Yes, you have a clean coal policy, but it is our policy that you have grabbed. We have been talking about clean coal now for years and, suddenly, the Labor Party has decided it has a clean coal policy. There was an announcement today by Mr Rudd about solar power which is merely a continuation of the policy that we have in place. Talk about trying to create light and sparks! The truth of the matter is that the Labor Party policy is extraordinarily vacuous and has huge holes in it that need to be filled.
Senator Wortley talked about the policy to cut greenhouse emissions by some 60 per cent by 2050—and I would be very interested to hear what Senator Hurley, who is in the chamber, has to say on this, if she is to make a speech. It will be interesting to find out how that target will be reached and what the implications are for major sectors of the Australian economy. Of course, we will have a debate on that. An astonishing feature of your policy is this, Senator Wortley: would we be cutting that without any international agreement at all? Australia supplies about 1.5 per cent, from memory, of world greenhouse gas emissions. Your policy apparently proposes a major cut in these emissions without requiring any matching cuts from other countries. Senator Hurley may be able to explain to us precisely what that means. Would this be a unilateral cut? If so, Senator Hurley, a lot of people in this country would be very upset. It may be part of a multilateral agreement—and we are all for that. However, if that multilateral agreement did not come off, where would that leave your current policy position?
So there is really quite a range of questions which now have to be answered. There are questions from the coal industry about Labor Party policy and whether Mr Garrett in the end will win the day and close down the coal sector. A lot of the government’s supporters are very keen to hear that, of course.
The other thing that I would say is that we are having a debate in this chamber on an extremely important issue, so where are the Greens? Where is Bob Brown? Where is Senator Milne? I must say, you wonder where on earth the Greens are, when they have been trumpeting this issue in this chamber. Here we are having a serious debate on the issue and they are missing in action.
I thought Senator Ian Campbell made a really excellent speech, with excellent remarks, and showed what a quality minister he was. He was able to add some depth and context in his responses to some of the claims that were made by the Labor Party which were, I have to say, unanswered by Senator Wortley. We listened carefully to see whether the remarks that Senator Campbell made on emissions trading would be answered by Senator Wortley, but of course they were not. So what we have is a policy that is vacuous. After 11 years, no real leadership has been given by the Labor Party on this issue. I am afraid that, unless Senator Hurley can win the day, the Labor Party is far behind on a very important issue. (Time expired)

"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2007-03-28,"—I rise too to note the answers that Senator Minchin gave on climate change and also the responses of Senator Ian Campbell and Senator Kemp. They were marked by sarcasm, mockery and an attack on the Labor Party, but there was very little attempt to deal with the actual issues. That is, of course, because the Liberal government have made very little attempt to deal with the issues. They talk about not having targets and not signing Kyoto and say that it will not make any difference. They talk about not having unilateral targets for greenhouse gas emissions and yet they will not participate in the only multilateral forum that is around: Kyoto. They have refused to participate in the one multilateral forum they have. They talk about some other multilateral forum, hoping that it will never eventuate.
The government’s approach is to just hope that it will all go away and they will not have to deal with it in the end. This is in a situation in the Australian economy where more and more businesses—large businesses, medium businesses—are calling for some pricing signals on carbon emissions from the government, and the government have been studiously refusing to deal with this. The end result is that the states have tried to deal with it on their own in a unilateral fashion.
I am very pleased that the South Australian government has been one of the states that have attempted to deal with greenhouse gas emissions by themselves. Senator Ian Campbell made fun of them. He said that they were not successful, that it was too difficult for them, and yet he did not address the central issue, which is the fact that they are trying to deal with emissions themselves because the federal government—the national government, which is the natural government that should be dealing with these kinds of national issues—is missing in action. That is precisely why the state governments have attempted to deal with emissions by themselves. The Howard government is getting increasingly arrogant, increasingly not consultative and increasingly combative with those states in an attempt to salvage its government record and deal with the possibility that it might not win the next election. It is not dealing with the critical issue that we need to deal with. The government lacks the will or the ability to deliver national action on this very important issue.
In the short time that I have left to me, I want to deal with Labor’s response. The Labor opposition is having a climate change summit and is attempting to get policy together on this very critical issue. The government has talked about its Greenhouse Office. The opposition unfortunately does not have access to the kind of money and expertise which a decent greenhouse office might have involved, but it is trying to gather together experts to listen to them on how it will proceed. I have my own views on how to proceed and, indeed, how it might dovetail with another of the key Labor Party platforms, and that is education and the extension of its education focus: research and development. The Labor opposition has the political will to achieve that.
Given that there has been such inaction over a decade and that we are behind in addressing this issue, the question becomes: how will we then achieve it? I think that the neglect of education and research and development by the current government has put us well behind on ways to proceed once we have acknowledged the problem, which the current government has failed to do. I believe that not enough of the proceeds of the resources boom have been invested in research, in innovation and in skills development, because, even if we find a way forward through research and technology, we still need the skills in this country to put it into action. Skills are one of the things which, thanks to government neglect, we are very short of. This is one of the key issues that we will have to address once we have decided to deal with the problem. This whole approach is one— (Time expired)

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2007-03-28,"—I also rise to take note of the answers given by Senators Abetz and Minchin to questions relating to climate change. The answers provided by Senator Abetz to my question, and to those questions put by the ALP today, were consistent. Senator Abetz trots out the tired old answers to this question, saying that we have to look beyond Kyoto, that Kyoto has been a failure, that we need to move on, that we are going to meet our targets anyway but we have to move on. He talks about the emissions trading system in the EU as being a total failure. I understand the Prime Minister also answered questions and said, ‘This is all about job losses; we’re not going to move on anything which would economically damage the community,’ and so on.
The whole point of Sir Nicholas Stern’s message to us today at the National Press Club, and I understand he is meeting with the Prime Minister today as well, is that if we do not take urgent action—not just a bit here or there, a few grants handed out for clean coal, a bit of this and that, a renewable energy target that is less than 0.5 per cent of the total by 2010—if we do not do more than we have done, if we do not make deep structural changes to the way we do business, then we are not going to deliver on the massive cuts that are required. And, moreover, we can do this. We can have massive cuts in greenhouse emissions and still have jobs growth and economic growth, live the lifestyle that we enjoy and have a thriving economy. That is the message that the government seems not to be hearing.
So we have moved away from what might have been called a precautionary principle approach, where the conservationists were on one side and industry was on the other, and they were arguing about this. That has finished now. What we have is economic modelling that shows that if we do not do anything our economy is going to suffer. So this is now a question of how risky this government is being by not addressing climate change.
Of course we had the same old arguments too about Australia generating just over one per cent of global greenhouse emissions—again, a furphy. We are actually the 10th largest emitter—and I am not talking per capita; we all know we are the highest there. The overall emissions from this country are the 10th highest in the world. That is just behind Britain, which has three times our population; 60 million people live in Britain, and their emissions are only just higher than ours.
So the message from Sir Nicholas Stern was: all developed countries need to collaborate, need to be part of this effort, need to sign up to Kyoto. It is an embarrassment that we have not done that. It is late in the piece, but it is not too late. That is my message to the Prime Minister. And I know that is going to be the message that Sir Nicholas Stern will be giving to the Prime Minister himself today.
It is critically important that no countries duck out of this. That is what Australia has done: we have ducked out of Kyoto. We were there for many years, while Senator Hill was our environment minister, but since that time we have found reasons to undermine Kyoto and to step back from it, claiming it is ineffectual. Well, it is not ineffectual; in fact, it is very effectual. The fact that the government thinks it is important to largely stick with the Kyoto commitments indicates that, to my mind. But of course, we are not going to stick with them. By 2012 we will have overshot our Kyoto commitments by about six million tonnes. We never hear about that from Senator Abetz. We keep hearing about how it is a finished process, that it is out the window and we have to look for something else.
Yes, let us look for something else. Let us go beyond 2012. Let us have some targets. Let us have some targets for 2020. And let us make sure that they include the very easy to do targets. For instance, we should be looking for a one per cent energy efficiency target. Let us stop wasting energy. If we can avoid doing that, we can avoid putting in new coal-fired power stations. We would also manage—and I have said this many times in this place—to reduce wholesale electricity costs by 20 per cent. And I point out again that this is the lowest cost-effective greenhouse gas abatement measure that can be undertaken. But we never hear that from Senator Abetz. (Time expired)

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-03-28,"—I move:
That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:
The need for a national affordable housing strategy to be developed, involving all levels of government and all political parties, to address the serious and ongoing crisis in housing affordability.
This is a very urgent and important matter. The crisis in housing affordability in Australia has gone from bad to worse over a number of years. In my view, part of the reason it has gone from bad to worse is neglect, benign or otherwise, from both state and federal governments over that prolonged period of time. There has been too much finger pointing and state and federal governments blaming each other and sitting back, leaving it to the market and hoping it will work itself out. Maybe there is a theoretical argument to say that leaving it to the market could work, but the simple fact is it has not worked. I will not give a dissertation on the distorted nature of the housing market and the issues involved there; the simple reality is that market failure has occurred.
I draw attention to an article by Tim Colebatch in the Age last month which pointed out that for the first time the average household in Australia can no longer afford the average home. That is based on figures released by the Housing Industry Association and the Commonwealth Bank last month. Housing is now more unaffordable than at any time in the 23 years they have been measuring it—going back to the early 1980s. That is an indictment on governments of all persuasions but particularly the current federal government that has been in power for a long period of time. It has allowed that situation to develop.
The situation was sufficiently bad a few years ago that the Treasurer, partly as a way of trying to get the issue off the front pages, called an inquiry, as governments do from time to time to make it look like they are doing something. He got the Productivity Commission to inquire into the cost of home ownership for first home buyers. That produced a report with 10 recommendations, some of which went to state governments and some to the federal government. The response of the federal government and the Treasurer was: ‘No, we’re not going to accept these recommendations; we’re not going to do anything. We’re not going to examine the tax mix and we’re not going to examine the impact of the various interconnected and sometimes totally unrelated and unconnected taxation and financial measures that are impacting on the housing market and housing prices. We’re just going to leave it as is and complain about the states not doing enough.’ I am quite prepared to accept that the states have not done enough in some circumstances—but that is not good enough. It is a national problem and it needs national action.
It is worth pointing out that it is not just a problem of the inability to purchase a home. Because the number of people unable to purchase a home is growing, the number of those forced to rent has swollen and that has made it harder to find properties to rent. That is now having a very dramatic impact on the private rental market, leading in some areas at least to quite rapid rises in private rentals. We have the very strange situation of a rental shortage despite enormous tax breaks for rental investors that have been supported by both major parties over the past 20 years or so.
As Tim Colebatch said, the first step we need to take in this area is to acknowledge that existing policies have failed. We need to put forward wide-ranging initiatives to build more affordable housing. Data released yesterday by a group called Australians for Affordable Housing detailed that on their figures the Commonwealth government spends $24 billion on housing. That is not just the $1 billion for the first home owners grant, which is not targeted; the less than $1 billion on public and community housing; and the $2 billion and growing on private rent assistance, which in many cases is a subsidy for landlords and investors as well. On top of those expenditures there is a great amount on negative gearing—what they estimate to be $13 billion on capital gains tax exemptions and discounts. The vast majority of that money goes to speculators, developers and investors. Only a small minority goes to people who simply want to buy or rent their own home.
I am not saying that people should not be able to invest in housing; I am saying that when you have huge amounts of money—tens of billions of dollars in expenditure or in what is called tax expenditures or forgone revenue—going in various ways to impact on the housing market without any data being collected on what impact it is having, whom it is being applied to and what their financial situation is, then you are not targeting that money most effectively. You are not getting the best value for money. If we are going to provide assistance to people for housing matters, surely we should be ensuring that the majority of it goes to people who are simply trying to get a house to live in before it goes to people who are investing and speculating.
There are a range of other measures out there and I am not going to say that any one of them is going to fix it. There is no one single fix for the problem. But what we need before we can even take that first step is a recognition that it is a national issue, that we need to adopt national affordable housing strategies and that political parties must make it a priority to work together with industry and the community to find solutions that will alleviate what is a major and growing cause of inequality in Australia.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Housing Affordability</title>,Matters of Urgency,24,1
"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2007-03-28,"—I thank Senator Bartlett for raising this issue. It is a national issue because state Labor governments occupy every state and territory government around this country and it is an absolute disgrace what they have been doing to first home buyers and to home buyers in general in this country. I thank Senator Bartlett again for raising this issue because I raised it just a few weeks ago in the Senate. During my speech I talked about what this government has done.
The first thing people need in order to be able to afford to buy a home is a job. We have the lowest unemployment rate in 32 years in this country, provided by a strong economy. That enables people to borrow money to buy a home, and they have done that with confidence under this government. And, talking about what we have done for the first home buyers, 926,000 people have benefited by purchasing a home with the support of a first home buyers grant. It is trite to suggest we have not done anything to help people get into housing. We are helping them with jobs. We are allowing them to confidently plan with a strong economy. We are helping them to get first home buyer assistance. As to rental accommodation, Senator Bartlett said we have done nothing to assist people through the rental process. That is simply not true. The Commonwealth government has committed $4.75 billion over five years under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement to support rental accommodation. This includes approximately $93 million over the last financial year for the Aboriginal Rental Housing Program.
The essence of housing affordability is supported by industry groups and by this government. So it comes back to the robber barons who are running our state governments. They are out there seeing the purses of the hardworking men and women of Australia and saying: ‘Open them up because we’re going to empty them. We’re going to fleece you with stamp duty. We’re going to fleece you by withholding land.’ Instead of releasing land for the purpose of ensuring affordable housing, they are holding land and restricting the supply for the purpose of profit. What they are doing is an absolute disgrace. When someone finally manages to convince a state Labor government that they need to expand development and allow people to go and live in their own home, which is part of the great Australian ideal, what do they do? They say to the developer: ‘Hang on a second. Not only are you going to pay twice as much as we paid for this land just a few years ago; we are going to make you pay all the up-front costs as well.’
The state Labor governments across this country are absolutely remiss. They have proved that they are inept and incompetent, as is Labor generally, about managing resources and finances across this country. They have an absolute windfall of money flowing from the Commonwealth to support them with infrastructure, with the development of land and with all the great needs that exist in every state. And what do they do with it? They think the best thing they can do is employ a few more people in the public service, create a bit more bureaucracy and shuffle the papers and that is going to rebuild the economy. Australians can see through this.
This Labor Party mob over the other side who purport to be an alternative government say, ‘Trust us; we’re different.’ But we do not have to look too far—if we go around the whole country the only things we see are spendthrifts, wastefulness and ridiculous amounts of money being wasted on all sorts of silly schemes. The people hurt by this activity are the people of Australia, and they will see through it. They will say that they cannot understand why the Australian Labor Party purports to support a strong economy and yet has demonstrated something very different. ‘Do as I say, not as I do,’ is the Labor Party’s mantra on this. If you in the Labor Party are seriously going to go down the path of wanting to make housing affordable, you should get onto your state Labor comrades and say, ‘Reduce stamp duty; reduce land tax; encourage investment into private enterprise.’ Or are you going to take us back to the situation under the Keating and Hawke government when you abolished negative gearing and created a rental crisis such as this country had never seen? You want to get onto them about reducing their burdens and overrequirements for development and infrastructure if you want to make housing affordable in this country. This government, as I have said, has already made enormous inroads into that. And part of that is trying to provide relief from the $9.6 billion worth of stamp duty that was fleeced from the poor people of Australia in the last financial year. It is an absolute disgrace.
Homeownership is very important to the social fabric of this country and cannot be underestimated. The benefits are not purely economic. It is not just about people providing for their future, having a nice place to retire or something that they can call their own. It is about community building. And that is what this government has been about—building communities, providing support for families and ensuring that every Australian has a fair go. It is making sure that Australians have jobs. It is making sure they can plan for their futures and that they can look after their children appropriately.
The Labor Party have failed at every turn. They have not only failed to support the policies we have put forward over the last 11 years; they have failed to haul in their comrades at the state level. They are high taxing. They are high spending. They cannot manage a budget—they have never been able to manage a budget. They are absolutely wasteful. Their economic policy is to try and copy ours, but they have not managed to do that at any turn. They keep having internal brawls of the Left, the far Left, the extreme Left, the communist Left—whatever Left they have got going—with their extreme Right, their radical Right, their middle people, their machine factions. Someone has got to kick them into gear. Do you know what? If someone bothered to kick Kevin Rudd in the backside they would not be hurting Kevin Rudd; they would be hurting one of the union stooges who is right behind him, trying to prop him up. This is what is rotten about the Labor Party over there on the other side—they are only relevant to the union movement. They are not concerned at all about the people of Australia and the home buyers of Australia.
This government provides tax relief. We represent fiscal management. We provide help for families. What do Labor governments do at a state level? Nothing. They pass the buck. They are running down services. They are not providing appropriate land releases into development zones. They are not providing stamp duty relief. In fact in South Australia, appallingly, as house prices have gone up they have been increasing stamp duty so that there are no exemptions for people buying the average priced home. If you wanted to encourage people to go to a state where we need workers and where we have a lot of developments going on, you would think you would provide something to attract them to go there. Not the state Labor governments.
The state Labor governments are cut from the same cloth as the purported alternative government on the other side of the chamber, and it is a rotten cloth. It is moth-eaten. It is 1950s socialist dogma hiding behind the cosy smiling face of Mr Rudd. It is very dangerous. The best friend that Australian families and homebuyers have had is this government. Nine hundred and twenty-six thousand families and individuals have benefited from our support for first home buyers. We have cut taxation in order to enable them to afford the wasteful expenditure of the state Labor governments and the Labor administrations. And every single time we have taken a step forward to try to help people, who has opposed us? Has our effort been supported by the other side? No, it has not. We have had to drag them kicking and screaming to every reform that has enabled Australia and the people of Australia to benefit from one of the strongest economies that we have ever seen.
Do you think that we can afford to let the federal Labor opposition squander our prosperity? They will send this country into a near bankrupt state if they continue with the ridiculous policies espoused by the Labor parties across the country. The proof is there for the people of Australia to see. If you want a credible, viable, sustainable economy in this country and you want to see more people being able to afford their own homes, then a coalition government is the only way to go. The proof is in pudding. Look around the states and you will see how high taxing and wasteful they are. (Time expired)

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2007-03-28,"—That was a very lazy contribution, I believe. What we are talking about here is a very serious social and economic problem facing this country rather than a ‘Reds under the bed’ style scare campaign from senators opposite who obviously have not even bothered to research this problem in any depth. We know that housing affordability is a national problem and it is a problem that requires leadership and a consistent response. However, over the past 11 long years under the Howard government we have seen a government that has failed to show leadership. It has failed to provide the leadership necessary to address the ongoing crisis in housing affordability and it has certainly and consistently failed to respond to the increase in this problem.
The problem is this: housing is one of our most basic needs but with rents skyrocketing in all of Australia’s capital cities and homeownership slipping out of reach of many ordinary working Australians, this basic right, this basic need for housing, is eluding many in our community. When asked about the issue of housing affordability, Mr Howard would have us believe that there is a single simple solution—the states should minimise taxes and release more land.
Of course there is no such simple solution. The New South Wales government has already abolished stamp duty for first home buyers purchasing properties for less than $500,000. While this has assisted many first home buyers get into the housing market, it has not changed the ongoing challenge of improving housing affordability generally for everybody else. Blaming the states for these issues is not good enough. There are a whole range of reasons for rental and house prices going up right around the country, and the coalition government’s response is: we will just blame the states again. This blame game is the approach of the Howard government and they make it out to be a solution. The blame game is not a solution; it is an excuse for poor leadership and poor governing of this particular portfolio.
The Australian dream of owning your own home is becoming unattainable for many. Demographia, an international housing affordability survey, found that Australians now pay on average 6.6 times their annual household income on purchasing their homes. Sydney, Perth and Hobart were among the top 20 cities around the world where houses were found to be ‘severely unaffordable’. To even get into the housing market in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth you now need a six-figure salary. In my home city of Canberra you needed an annual income of $43,250 back in 1996 to purchase a median-priced home, but with 11 years under the coalition government this has exploded in 2006 with the average Canberran now needing an annual income of some $106,596 to purchase a median-priced home.
Before you even start anything else, for most people this will mean having two incomes. The implications on child care and working people’s work/life balance are significant, especially if you add the problem of the shortage of child care, particularly in babies’ rooms when children are very young but families cannot afford to do without that dual income to pay the mortgage. Those who do manage to save a deposit while paying their rent, bills, childcare costs and other necessities are then left paying the highest percentage of their income in mortgage interest repayments—higher than ever before.
Adding to this financial pressure are the four interest rate rises since the last election. Yesterday in this place Senator Minchin said that a significant factor in housing affordability is interest rates, and yet we have seen interest rate rises under a coalition government since the last election—a broken Howard government promise. It was a promise that was never his to make but that did not stop this arrogant government or this tricky Prime Minister from making the claim. This is not lost on homeowners and mortgage payers around the country and I doubt that they will be forgiving.
Another group that are really feeling the pinch are renters. Nationally rents have been rising more than twice as fast as inflation. As rental payments chew up a greater proportion of people’s income, saving a deposit to purchase their home is becoming increasingly difficult—and that goes without saying. Low-income renters are particularly vulnerable in the current climate of low vacancy rates and spiralling rents.
Recent statistics from the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that there is an estimated 134,000 shortfall in low-cost rental properties nationally—134,000 families that are doing it tougher than they ought to be. I have heard one example of a mining town in Queensland where the people working in the services sector cannot compete for housing with the people working in the boom sector of mining, with unmet demand pushing up prices till they are out of the reach of those people who work in that services sector of the economy and do not earn the salaries they would receive if they worked in a boom sector. Another example is in Western Australia, where a company ended up buying a hotel in which workers could live because the housing shortages were so drastic. As these examples show, the problem varies between different areas. This means it is important to be able to adapt local solutions to local problems, and as such the Labor Party has committed to work when in government with all levels of government, not just state governments but local governments as well, to help solve housing issues within their jurisdiction.
Even today I read an article in the Canberra Times highlighting the very real and devastating effects that increasing rental prices are having on low-income families. Ms Hazell, an unemployed mother with two young girls, has had to move four times in the last two weeks after leaving her $700 a fortnight rental property. Ms Hazell is concerned about the effect this is having on her two young children. She told the Canberra Times:
My kids are bright, but falling behind in their school work. They’re tired. They’re suffering ...
Obviously that is a serious case of hardship. Access to secure, appropriate and affordable housing is an essential ingredient of quality family life. But this government has not been doing anything to ensure that families such as this one can access appropriate housing.
One of the most respected figures in the Canberra property industry, Mr David Dawes, is going to be heading an implementation team to drive the reforms and initiatives flowing from the soon-to-be-released affordable housing report initiated by the ACT government through the ACT Chief Minister, Mr Stanhope. Mr Stanhope said today:
“There are few more important social imperatives than ensuring that everyone in the community has access to affordable and appropriate housing ...
It is clear that there is no substance to what this government says about states and territories not doing anything. It is not good enough to say, ‘Blame them.’ We need to acknowledge that there are initiatives happening at a state and territory level and that in fact it is the Howard government that has been totally neglectful of its duty to address this growing problem. It has failed to address housing affordability. It has ripped $400 million out of the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement over the last 10 years. In contrast, Labor is committed to making improvements in all areas of housing, including emergency accommodation, public and community housing, private rentals and homeownership.
Unlike the Howard government, Labor have a plan to make these improvements. Firstly, we will have a minister responsible for housing. The minister will be responsible for developing and implementing affordable housing policy. The housing minister will form an essential part of the government’s economic team, working closely with the Treasurer to boost housing affordability. Secondly, as cited in the motion we are currently debating, a Labor government will work with state and territory governments and with local government to address the serious and ongoing crisis in housing affordability. That is the only way; it has got to be addressed with a three-tier approach, not by this ridiculous, shallow, irresponsible blame game that the Howard government perpetuates.
Thirdly, a federal Labor government will negotiate a national affordable housing agreement with these three tiers of government which will replace the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. All elements of federal housing policy will come under this one agreement, including the grants to states for public housing, the first home owners grant and $2 billion in Commonwealth rent assistance. It is critically important that local government be involved in that so that we can tailor local solutions to local problems. They do vary right across the country, and we have to get down to a level of specificity that makes a real difference to families in specific areas. I would like to conclude by saying that a Rudd Labor government is committed to boosting affordable housing— (Time expired)

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-03-28,"—I rise in support of this urgency motion. The Australian Greens have been concerned about access to affordable housing for a considerable period of time. When you look at some of the details, you see that our concern is absolutely justified, as is the concern of the community. In the past decade the median house price in Australia has increased from four times average incomes to six to seven times average incomes. The growth in the private rental market across Australia has been uneven, and there is a shortage of approximately 134,000 properties in the low-cost end of the market.
I know about this from the personal experiences of friends. Only last week one was trying to find a place to rent in Western Australia using the new service of being able to get instant emails when a property comes up. He submitted one saying, ‘Yes, I want the house.’ Not long afterwards the owners rang to say: ‘We’ve had four people apply for this house at $250 a week. How about upping it to $280 and you might have a chance of getting this home?’ He has still not been able to find a rental house in Perth. He has been trying to find one since the beginning of January. I would say his is not an isolated example.
Thirty-five per cent of Commonwealth rent assistance recipients, being families on low incomes, will spend 30 per cent or more of their incomes on housing costs. That is also of concern. It is estimated that 1.1 million people on low to middle incomes are suffering from housing stress. Obviously, this puts stress on the entire family.
I refer to the point that housing is not a Commonwealth government issue. That is a furphy, given that, according to a report released yesterday by Australians for Affordable Housing, the federal government accounts for approximately $24 billion in direct and indirect spending on housing, of which 80 per cent goes into tax breaks for speculators, developers and investors and only 20 per cent is actually directly invested in the needs of ordinary families who are trying to either rent or buy their own home.
I would now like to turn specifically to my home state of Western Australia. Last month I released a report called ‘The boom for whom?’ in which I looked at the impacts of the boom in Western Australia and the benefits for so-called ordinary Western Australians. The report showed that while the economy is being driven by the mining sector, and wages have risen dramatically in the mining sector, unfortunately that has not been reflected in other sectors. For example, average wage rates in the hospitality sector have increased by only 2.4 per cent in the last 12 months, which is less than half the growth rate in the mining and construction industries and lower than the inflation rate.
Housing affordability has become a major issue in Western Australia. Prices are rapidly increasing and they are approaching Sydney levels. The lower median house price in Perth has traditionally been lower than the median house price in other cities. In just over 15 years the median house price in Perth has risen from under $100,000 in 1991 to well over $350,000 now. With the significant increase in the price of housing in Western Australia the $7,000 first home owners grant pales into insignificance. The median house price in Perth is closer than ever to the median house price in the other capital cities. It is difficult for the people of Perth to find the resources to be able to invest in a home of their own. I think it is fair to say that house prices and rents have increased at a much more significant rate in Perth than in other places around Australia.
To address these issues, we believe we need to significantly increase our investment in public and community housing. This could be done in a cost-neutral way. I would argue that there needs to be an increase in funding for housing. But, even if the government did not do that, they could shift the emphasis to more affordable public housing in the community sector in the way they allocate the pie. They could also look at an affordable rent incentive and non-profit shared equity. (Time expired)

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2007-03-28,"—I do not know if Senator Bartlett was here when Senator Lundy was talking. If he was he would be saying, ‘What am I worried about?’ because, according to Senator Lundy, this is easily solved: you have a summit on this and you have a summit in relation to the environment. The way this is going, these people will have a bad dose of ‘summit-itis’, and I suspect that we will probably recommend that there be a summit on why the Labor Party has not actually got any policies. A summit. That is the sum total of a Labor frontbencher’s contribution—no policies, no solution, no acknowledgement.
Today’s motion should be: ‘This Senate condemns the state Labor governments for their failure to give Australian families the opportunity to access affordable housing.’ The notion that the coalition is somehow responsible for increased house prices is about as believable as saying that two per cent of the population can name more than three Labor frontbenchers. It is totally unbelievable. For Senator Lundy to come in here today and talk about a summit and have no policies and try to blame the federal coalition for increasing house prices just shows how totally devoid the Australian Labor Party is of any policy to address any situation and why its members are simply not ready for—nor do they deserve—government.
The reality of the situation is that the federal government have set a number of scenarios to assist potential homeowners, including a real increase in wages, low unemployment and industrial relations changes that have given the small business community of this country the confidence to go out and employ again. Nearly 300,000 new jobs have been created in the workforce in the last 12 months, including 118,000 new jobs for women. But that on its own does not address this issue. The Labor Party should be acutely aware of the contribution we have made to the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement and the money that we are putting into the First Home Owners Scheme. We have now put around $6.9 billion into the scheme since we first introduced it under A New Tax System in 2000. We are giving rent assistance to low-income families and social security recipients. Billions of dollars, quite rightly, are going to where there is effective market failure.
Senator Bartlett, I hope you are not suggesting to the chamber today that you want to unilaterally withdraw negative gearing, because, if you think there is a housing crisis and a rental crisis now, you ain’t seen nothin’ yet. I am sure that is not part of the Australian Democrats’ policy, but, if it is, you stand utterly condemned for your failure to understand what is driving the present situation.
—Those who can afford houses live in them.
—Exactly. I just want to go through the realities of the house price situation. Five years ago, $40,000 would have bought you a reasonable house in a city like Adelaide. The median price was about $135,000; that has now doubled. In just five years, the price of residential land has doubled. Land once represented 25 per cent of the cost of a new house and land package. How much is it now? Fifty per cent. In five years the residential land component of a house and land package has gone from 25 per cent to 50 per cent. In comparison, the actual building costs of a new home have not risen dramatically. The great bulk of this increase has been that land component of house and land packages.
I am taking some of this information from a lecture by Bob Day AO, the national president of the HIA, in a speech that he gave last year, I think it was. He quoted a recent housing affordability study of 88 cities around the world, including Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States. It confirmed that land rationing through government policy is the main cause of increased land prices—those very land prices I referred to before which have seen the land component of house and land packages increase from 25 per cent to 50 per cent.
That study was conducted by a research group called Demographia. It found that housing affordability, rather than being a worldwide problem, as some claim, is largely confined to cities in Australia and on the coast in the United States where governments restrict land supply. Of 30 cities covered in the study that were classified as having affordable housing—which is where the median house price is generally less than three times the median household income—none of those had adopted the policies of state Labor governments in Australia which have driven up land prices for new home buyers.
There has been talk about the blame game today. This situation will not be resolved overnight. The situation will be resolved by state Labor governments doing four things: (1) they must release more land; (2) they must streamline planning approvals; (3) they must cut stamp duty on property transfers; and (4) they must ease the developer and infrastructure levies they charge for developers of new homes. We have to maintain a strong economy to maintain affordability, but it is incumbent upon state Labor governments to do their part, as they have sole responsibility for addressing that 25 per cent increase in the land component of housing and land costs.

"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2007-03-28,"—I welcome this resolution before the Senate today moved by Senator Bartlett. I know he has raised it to get some genuine debate about what is a very important issue and one that is facing more and more Australians. I am sure he is disappointed, as I am, that when the government members speak to this motion the first thing they do is simply absolve themselves of any responsibility and blame the states.
We heard Senator Bernardi welcome this debate in the Senate. He told us how he has a great interest in it and that it is something he has spoken about. He then went on to blame the states and went on with a rant about the ALP, unions and everything else except the issue that we are supposed to be debating. He then had the gall to actually say it was our responsibility—the federal parliamentary Labor Party’s responsibility. I find that rather strange, given that Senator Bernardi should know as well as anyone else that we have been in opposition for 10 years and it is actually the government’s obligation to take a proactive role in this issue. They do not seem to have the capacity to even address that issue. They simply blame the states because it is convenient not to address the issue if you have someone else to constantly blame. Senator Ronaldson’s contribution, while it had a little bit more substance than Senator Bernardi’s, actually went to some of the issues, but, again, the focus was that it was everyone else’s problem but the federal government’s.
I happen to think there is no simple solution and that it requires a complex solution involving all levels of government. I think there is a more proactive role that the states could play with proper federal leadership. It goes to issues of Commonwealth-state funding and where money comes from for infrastructure development and planning issues. There are three levels of government that need to be engaged in that. I am disappointed that government senators have been so dismissive of this instead of engaging in a constructive debate about what we as a federal parliament can do and what the government should be considering to address what is a very important issue for more and more Australians every day.
The need for safe and secure housing is one of the most basic needs of humanity. It is a benchmark of how well a society is performing and looking after its citizens. I was reminded of the importance of this issue with the launch of the new campaign from the Australians for Affordable Housing coalition, a campaign which aims to tackle our current housing crisis. I applaud the work done by the Australians for Affordable Housing coalition, as housing often does not get the attention that other issues in our community do, despite the importance of it in our day-to-day lives. I guess that has been demonstrated quite clearly here today, with the government senators demonstrating the poverty of their position in respect of engaging in this very import debate.
In my own state of Victoria, housing issues are now becoming acute for people living in population centres who do not have the luxury of large incomes. When this is combined with a lack of transport, it means that some in our community are being excluded from a place to live. In Melbourne in particular there have been many community advocates who have worked long and hard to ensure that there is action on housing affordability, and of course I urge them to continue. We should not let this issue fade from the public view.
Many of these individuals and groups are now involved in the Australians for Affordable Housing coalition, and I want to reassure them that Labor welcomes and endorses their campaign. We too share the belief that housing should be affordable for all in our community. This issue is not solely a problem in Victoria; it is nationwide. Across Australia, people who are crucial to our community—students, carers, teachers, police, nurses, electricians, truck drivers, those looking for work—are all discovering that an affordable place to live is getting harder to find, and for some it is impossible. We constantly hear of how wonderful the resource boom is—that it means jobs and wealth. But we do not hear about the people such as hospitality and childcare workers in those communities who suddenly find house prices rising out of their reach. If they are renting they find they have to move out of town, and in some places like Queensland and Western Australia—the centres of the resources boom—they have to move to the next town altogether.
In our larger cities, as more people have realised, the inner city suburbs offer housing near employment and good public transport, schools, hospitals, libraries and other public assets, and housing in these areas has become unaffordable for anyone who does not have a large income or is not in a double-income family. Traditional working-class suburbs, which saw a large cross-section of ordinary workers, students, families and the elderly, are now losing their communities as people are forced out by rising rentals and house prices. Carlton, Collingwood, Fitzroy, North Melbourne; these are all suburbs where you would be lucky to find any workers on low incomes or their families. Aged-care facilities have sold up and moved out. Housing prices are often over a million dollars, and rent prices are now astronomical. Rental inspections may attract up to 100 people, and, to determine who they will rent a property to, some unscrupulous landlords and real estate agents will have an unofficial auction to see who will pay the highest rent. If it was not for public housing in these inner city suburbs, great numbers of our most essential workers, students and a large cross-section of our community would be forced to pull up stumps and look for cheaper accommodation.
The problem of housing affordability is a crisis in some local areas and is a real problem across the nation. It is not only some local communities that have borne the brunt of the lack of housing affordability; many Australians across the nation are feeling the pinch as mortgage repayments and rent chew up greater proportions of their income than ever before. The Australians for Affordable Housing coalition pointed out yesterday that rents have been rising nationally more than twice as fast as inflation. This is not just hurting families looking for a place to live; it is being felt by low-to middle-income earners, first home buyers and single people who are struggling to find and keep affordable housing. As the Australians for Affordable Housing coalition also pointed out, families buying their first home now need a six-figure income just to pay the mortgage on a medium priced home in most capital cities.
Far from delivering greater affordability and the low interest rates that they promised, federal ministers continue to duck questions about housing affordability. It is a debate that needs to be had, and it is a debate that needs to engage all levels of government. It must be remembered that eight interest rate rises on Peter Costello’s watch have added almost $130,000 over the life of a mortgage on a medium priced Melbourne home.
The one positive to come out of the acute local housing crisis has been the willingness of local and state governments to try to tackle the problem. More affordable housing has been built, redevelopments have taken place in conjunction with the private sector and innovative policy responses have been produced. This has been done by state and local governments by themselves, while the federal government continues to simply blame them for the worsening situation. If the federal government took the view to engage and cooperate more with state and local governments, more could be done—and more needs to be done.
There seems to be an ‘all blame and no responsibility’ attitude from this government when something goes wrong. Over on this side of the chamber we are all about ending the blame game, and when it comes to housing affordability that is exactly what we intend to do. There is a great responsibility for the federal government in housing affordability. It has a direct role through funding Commonwealth-state housing agreements, it has a direct role in creating fair taxation and welfare arrangements such as rental assistance and it has a crucial role in the infrastructure needs of our communities: in transport, communications and urban development. There is a greater need for Commonwealth involvement, and simply blaming the states, blaming other tiers of government—and, in fact, blaming the opposition—for the housing affordability crisis is no responsible way for a government to tackle a problem that is being felt more and more acutely by more and more Australians every day, every week and every year.
Labor have repeatedly said that, while there is no simple answer to housing stress, there are a number of things that could and should be done that would ease the crisis. We have committed to assessing all constructive ideas for tackling the lack of affordable housing, and we will start by negotiating a national affordable housing agreement amongst the three tiers of government. We have also committed to looking at shared equity models involving the federal government. We will look at protecting consumers from predatory lenders and we will actively seek ways to leverage private investment in low-income housing. In government, Labor will move to fill the current policy void with a realistic and innovative approach designed to ensure that all Australians have secure, prosperous and healthy places to live.

"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2007-03-28,"—I agree with Senator Marshall that this debate should look at how to improve housing affordability, but I also think it is possible to make this issue more complex than it need be. What this debate requires is a look at the factors that influence a person’s ability to afford a home, and I will start with those areas for which the Commonwealth government is responsible. The first issue to look at is: does someone have a job? It is hard to afford a house if you do not have an income, and the best way to ensure an income is to have a job. Under this government, more Australians are in work than ever before. Unemployment has fallen from its peak of 10.9 per cent under Labor to 4.6 per cent today, and two million jobs have been created since the coalition came to office. The coalition are a friend of the worker because we have created an environment in which more Australians than ever before can have a job—they have the chance to earn an income to be used to purchase a house and to pay off a loan.
The second factor to look at is: are people earning enough to put towards a house? Under this government, real wages have grown by 19.8 per cent. Under Labor, they actually fell by 1.8 per cent. The coalition government has also introduced the first home buyers grant to assist young home buyers.
The third factor to examine when looking at the ability of Australians to afford housing is: can they afford to borrow? The price of borrowing, as we know, is the interest rate. Under Labor, interest rates peaked at 17 per cent and they averaged 12.5 per cent. Our government has run surplus budgets, we have paid off Labor’s $96 billion debt and we have established the Future Fund. All else being equal, if the government is saving, as opposed to borrowing, it puts downward pressure on interest rates; and that is what has happened. The current rate for the standard variable loan is 8.05 per cent. It is still a historically low rate.
Australians are enjoying better employment prospects, higher wages and lower interest rates because this government has taken hard decisions in the national interest. We have reformed industrial relations, cut income tax, balanced the budget and repaid every cent of Labor’s debt. At every step, Labor opposed every single measure we put in place to help create the prosperity we enjoy today. Despite Labor’s opportunistic obstructionism, the Commonwealth has done what is within its capacity to put Australians in a good position to afford a home. But there are also factors which are clearly within the control of state governments that impact directly on housing affordability.
Firstly, there is property taxation, particularly stamp duty. State governments around Australia, as we all know, are enjoying massive GST windfalls. This financial year alone, state governments will receive almost $2 billion more than they would have received under the old system. If federal Labor is serious about addressing housing affordability, they could approach their state colleagues to cut stamp duty. It is not as though state and territory Labor governments cannot afford it. Mr Rudd is very fond of impersonating a prime minister. He calls his own summits and meets state premiers on all sorts of issues, getting them around the table all the time. He should call his state colleagues together to do something about stamp duty.
Secondly, clearly within the realm of state government control is the issue of development and infrastructure charges levied on developers of new housing estates. State governments should cut these charges or fund them themselves. These charges inflate the price of housing in new developments, the very developments that are most likely to produce affordable housing. Again, state governments have the capacity, with the GST, to do something about that.
Thirdly, again clearly within the area of responsibility for state governments is the shortage of land for new housing. Housing would be more affordable if supply were increased. It is a pretty simple equation. New housing estates require land but state governments are failing to release the required land. State Labor governments are failing homebuyers. It is not the blame game to hold a tier of government accountable for something that is within their responsibility; that is called holding a government to account.
If the Labor opposition are concerned about housing affordability, there is something they can do about it. Mr Rudd can step up to the plate and demand that his state Labor colleagues release more land for housing, cut stamp duty and cut infrastructure levies. But there is one federal colleague in particular whom I think Mr Rudd needs to bring into line. An article in the Australian a while back under the heading ‘Energy guzzling McMansions in Labor’s sights’ said:
Australia’s energy guzzling McMansions are in Labor’s sights under a new housing policy designed to tackle the nation’s supersized houses.
Who was the author of this policy? Senator Kim Carr. The article went on:
The new housing agenda calls for a redesign of the popular first home owners grant scheme.
I think we all know what ‘redesign’ means. First homebuyers can kiss the scheme, in its current form, goodbye if Labor gets into government. Senator Carr went further. He wants to educate families that big houses in the suburbs are bad for the environment. Yes, Senator Carr has declared a jihad on McMansions. The article says that Senator Carr:
... who lives in a large, sprawling two-storey house in Melbourne—
and there is a very lovely picture of it in the article—
wants to generate a debate on housing,
Senator Carr told the Australian:
I am saying we cannot continue to build energy-guzzling houses without explaining to the people the cost of building a house where you need two air conditioners to make it habitable.
What an outrage for Australians to want to live in a large house; what an outrage for them to want two air conditioners! This is an incredibly patronising approach. The coalition have not pursued an approach which is patronising; we want to do something quite practical about the factors over which the Commonwealth government have control—low unemployment, low inflation, low interest rates and higher wages. We have done our bit in exactly the areas in which Labor have an appalling record. It is time for state governments to do something in the areas they are responsible for—stamp duties, infrastructure levies and supply of land for new housing estates. Young Australians wanting to buy a home will get no assistance from Labor, state or federal. Assistance will come only from the coalition government. (Time expired)

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-03-28,"— To conclude this debate, I remind the Senate and those listening that we are debating a matter of urgency—that a national affordable housing strategy should be developed involving all levels of government. I remind the Senate that statistics now show that households on an average Australian income can no longer afford to buy an average-priced home. Home ownership is fast moving out of reach for many in the next generation and, indeed, for many in the current generation. Private rental costs are also causing immense housing-induced income stress for many Australians, as are the very long waiting lists for public and community housing. ABS statistics show that the proportion of first home owners as a percentage of all homebuyers has dropped dramatically from 67 per cent in 1977 to 23 per cent in 2002. We are now down to a very small minority of the people purchasing a home who are first homebuyers. There is a crisis here.
I do not in any way say that there is not more the states can do. I would agree with Senator Fifield: there is more that the states can do. According to Senator Fifield, the Commonwealth government has done all it can in its capacity, through its various measures. I am afraid, if that is all it can do, then that is a very clear sign that this government is getting very tired and running out of ideas, because it needs to do something.
The first thing it should do is recognise that the things that are in its field of endeavour and capacity are not sufficient and in some cases may inadvertently be making the problem worse through market distortions. The reason you have a national cooperative strategy is to look at all these areas: to see if you can make the billion dollars of the first homebuyers’ money more targeted, more effective and noninflationary; to see if you can ensure that private rental assistance is spent in the most efficient way; to look at whether or not the totality of the enormous amounts that are provided to people who are not lower income, which is the negative gearing subsidy, can be changed—not abolished, scrapped or unilaterally withdrawn, to reassure Senator Ronaldson, but refocused so that it can be used in a way that will produce affordable housing outcomes.
There are many ideas out there. I would again mention the recently released proposal from the National Affordable Housing Summit group. They have already had their summit; they do not need another one. That group involves the Housing Industry Association that Senator Ronaldson quoted, community housing groups like National Shelter and the Tenants Union, and trade union groups like the ACTU and the CFMEU. They put up a proposal about a national affordable rental incentive scheme to boost the supply of affordable rental housing by at least 15,000 homes a year, so that the various incentives around—the billions and billions of dollars that are spent—might actually be spent in a way that provides incentives where affordable housing is part of the outcome. There was a whole range of different proposals that were released just yesterday by the Australians for Affordable Housing coalition. I am not endorsing all of them unequivocally, although I think many of them are good. But let us sit down and let us recognise that there needs to be national leadership and a national strategy—a national and consistent approach—that recognises that this is an urgent issue and a serious matter that is leading to very wide and growing inequality amongst Australians. If the federal government cannot recognise that there is a need for action in that regard, then frankly they really seriously are out of touch.

"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2007-03-28,"—On behalf of Senator Robert Ray, I present the fourth report of 2007 of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. I also lay on the table Scrutiny of Bills Alert Digest No. 4 of 2007, dated 21 March 2007.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I seek leave to incorporate a tabling speech in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
In tabling the Committee’s Alert Digest No 4 of 2007 I would like to draw the Senate’s attention to two bills on which the Committee has made comment: the Aged Care Amendment (Residential Care) Bill 2007; and the Education Services for Overseas Students Legislation Amendment Bill 2007.  Both of these bills include sections that may be considered to make rights, liberties or obligations unduly dependent upon insufficiently defined administrative powers, in breach of principle 1(a)(ii) of the Committee’s terms of reference.
Since its establishment the Committee has consistently drawn the Senate’s attention to legislation which gives administrators seemingly wide and ill-defined powers. 
In respect to the Aged Care Amendment (Residential Care) Bill 2007, the Committee has raised concerns in respect to subsection 25-4D(1) of the bill, which gives the Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing the power to require further information from an applicant seeking to have their suspension to conduct appraisals and reappraisals of care recipients lifted. The secretary can request that this further information be provided ‘within 14 days after receiving the notice, or within such shorter period as specified in the written notice.’
The Committee’s concern is that, in its current form, the bill would allow the Secretary to request this information within very short periods of time, without having regard to what might be considered reasonable in the circumstances.   Where a bill confers powers of this nature on an official, the Committee has an expectation that these powers will have some limits placed on them, to ensure that they are not used in an arbitrary or unreasonable manner.
In respect to the Education Services for Overseas Students Legislation Amendment Bill 2007, the bill appears to afford an unduly wide discretion in the delegation of functions and powers to ‘an officer or employee of a State’.   The Committee’s expectation is that delegation powers will reflect the principle that the discretion to delegate ought to be limited in some way, either by limiting the class of person to whom the powers of functions can be delegated or by limiting the range of powers or functions that can be delegated.
I would also like to draw the Senate’s attention to the Committee’s Fourth Report of 2007 and, on behalf of the Committee, thank the Minister for Education, Science and Training, the Minister for Human Services and Mr Georganas MP, all of whom have committed to make amendments to explanatory memoranda or bills in response to concerns raised by the Committee in previous Alert Digests.

"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2007-03-28,"—On behalf of Senator Troeth, I present the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Public Works on the redevelopment of propellant manufacturing and other specified capabilities at Mulwala. I move:

That the Senate take note of the report.

I seek leave to have the tabling statement incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works I present the Committee’s first report of 2007.
This report addresses the redevelopment of propellant manufacturing and other specified capabilities at Mulwala at an estimated cost of $A338.7 million
Mr President, this was a particularly complex project in terms of its nature.
On the one hand the arrangements between the Commonwealth and the lessee are to all intents and purposes commercial.
On the other, the current relationship between the Commonwealth and the lessee while continuing to ensure that the propellant and ordnance needs of the ADF are met, maintains the arrangements that existed when Mulwala was government-owned and operated.
The Committee accepts the significance of Mulwala as the only facility in Australia that produces propellant for the Australian Defence Force, and its need as part of the overall Defence infrastructure is beyond question.  So to is the on-going requirement for Australia to be self-reliant for both the manufacture of propellant and ordnance to meet the demands of the defence force.
However, financial arrangements in place for the operation of the plant at Mulwala are problematic, particularly as to whether they reflect Commonwealth “best interest”.
The Commonwealth is investing a considerable amount of public monies in this project with little return on investment.  Indeed the arrangements that have been entered into between the current operator and the department as the agent for the Commonwealth skew the financial arrangements between the lessee and the Commonwealth in favour of the latter.
This situation has emerged largely as a result of the Mulwala Agreement signed off in 1998, but which has not been revisited since the new lessees took over the lease of the Mulwala facility in 2006.
Mr President, the Mulwala Agreement is of significance in the context of the redevelopment of Mulwala.  It establishes the terms and conditions under which the lessee occupies the facility; the lessee’s commitments to the ADF in terms of product supply and related issues; and the obligations of the Commonwealth to the occupier. 
This includes a number of conditions, but of specific interest to the Committee were those arrangements associated with the payment of a capability payment, the actual leasing arrangements of the property, and the distribution of revenue between the Commonwealth and the lessee.
Prior to Mulwala becoming fully commercial, financial arrangements between the then Australian Defence Industries and the Commonwealth could be seen as circular transactions – that is these occurred within the Commonwealth’s financial framework.
However with the introduction of a wholly commercial operation into the equation, accompanied by the Commonwealth’s commitment to a major investment in the facility, the circumstances have changed.
In a commercial environment, a lessee occupies a building and pays the lessor whatever rental has been determined by the lessor.  The occupier leases the property for a specified period, and apart from some obligations that the lessor meets, the leasing arrangement generates income for the lessor.
In the case of Mulwala, however, there are some fundamental differences.
The requirement under the Mulwala Agreement for the payment of a capability payment has brought about a situation whereby the Commonwealth receives no benefit in terms of revenue from the lease arrangement.
Where the Commonwealth is now offering the occupier considerably enhanced and more modern facilities to undertake its business, and that existing rental payments made by the lessee appear not to be in line with current market rates, it would be appropriate for the Agreement to be renegotiated by the department to take into account these circumstances.
As the Committee has recommended in its report, the renegotiation of rentals should include an assessment of comparable current commercial market rentals paid for purpose built buildings so as to deliver an enhanced revenue stream to the Commonwealth.
Mr President, the effect of the capability payment on the capacity of the Commonwealth to earn revenue from its investment also extends to other sources of potential revenue.
The Committee was informed at the Inquiry into this project that production at Mulwala is in excess of Defence requirements, to the extent that the lessee has successfully achieved sales in both domestic and overseas markets for surplus product.  However, the Commonwealth’s share of this revenue as provided for under the Mulwala Agreement is also subsumed into the capability payment.
Accordingly the Committee has recommended that the ongoing capability payment to the lessee be reviewed on the basis that the lessee is satisfying the requirement that the needs of the ADF have been met, and that there is potential revenue from sales of surplus product for which the Commonwealth should derive a benefit.
Similarly, the Mulwala Agreement determines the share of revenue between the Commonwealth and the operator.  In one sense this is an academic exercise since the capability payment absorbs almost all revenue.  However, the potential to review the capability payment would provide an opportunity to reassess the distribution of revenue particularly since it is contingent on the Commonwealth’s $338.7 million investment in this project. 
In conclusion, Mr President, the concerns of the Committee that I have outlined are contained in recommendations in its report.  These are significant issues and the Committee hopes that at the earliest opportunity the department look constructively at our recommendations at a time when the arrangements with the current occupier can be revised.
Finally, it is important for agencies and departments to consider all aspects of expenditure of public monies on projects of this magnitude to ensure that they deliver value for money to the Commonwealth.
Mr President, having given detailed consideration to the proposal, the Committee recommends that the redevelopment of propellant manufacturing and other specified capabilities at Mulwala proceed at the estimated cost of $338.7 million.
In closing, I wish to thank those who assisted with the site inspection and public hearing, my Committee colleagues, and Secretariat staff.
I commend the Report to the Senate.

Where the Commonwealth is now offering the occupier considerably enhanced and more modern facilities to undertake its business, and that existing rental payments made by the lessee appear not to be in line with current market rates, it would be appropriate for the Agreement to be renegotiated by the department to take into account these circumstances.
As the Committee has recommended in its report, the renegotiation of rentals should include an assessment of comparable current commercial market rentals paid for purpose built buildings so as to deliver an enhanced revenue stream to the Commonwealth.
Mr President, the effect of the capability payment on the capacity of the Commonwealth to earn revenue from its investment also extends to other sources of potential revenue.
The Committee was informed at the Inquiry into this project that production at Mulwala is in excess of Defence requirements, to the extent that the lessee has successfully achieved sales in both domestic and overseas markets for surplus product.  However, the Commonwealth’s share of this revenue as provided for under the Mulwala Agreement is also subsumed into the capability payment.
Accordingly the Committee has recommended that the ongoing capability payment to the lessee be reviewed on the basis that the lessee is satisfying the requirement that the needs of the ADF have been met, and that there is potential revenue from sales of surplus product for which the Commonwealth should derive a benefit.
Similarly, the Mulwala Agreement determines the share of revenue between the Commonwealth and the operator.  In one sense this is an academic exercise since the capability payment absorbs almost all revenue.  However, the potential to review the capability payment would provide an opportunity to reassess the distribution of revenue particularly since it is contingent on the Commonwealth’s $338.7 million investment in this project. 
In conclusion, Mr President, the concerns of the Committee that I have outlined are contained in recommendations in its report.  These are significant issues and the Committee hopes that at the earliest opportunity the department look constructively at our recommendations at a time when the arrangements with the current occupier can be revised.
Finally, it is important for agencies and departments to consider all aspects of expenditure of public monies on projects of this magnitude to ensure that they deliver value for money to the Commonwealth.
Mr President, having given detailed consideration to the proposal, the Committee recommends that the redevelopment of propellant manufacturing and other specified capabilities at Mulwala proceed at the estimated cost of $338.7 million.
In closing, I wish to thank those who assisted with the site inspection and public hearing, my Committee colleagues, and Secretariat staff.
I commend the Report to the Senate.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,27,2
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2007-03-28,"—This bill amends the Farm Household Support Act 1992, the Social Security Act 1991 and the Age Discrimination Act 2004 to allow agriculturally dependent eligible business operators access to the same exceptional circumstances assistance that is already available to farmers who have been adversely impacted by drought. While the opposition supports the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2007, we are concerned about whether the initiatives that are proposed in this bill work to give relief, given the dismal failure of a previous attempt to provide relief to drought affected business.
The contents of this bill were announced by the Prime Minister on 7 November 2006—namely, to allow agriculturally dependent eligible business operators access to the same exceptional circumstances assistance that is already provided to farmers. This assistance includes exceptional circumstances relief payments and ancillary benefits, such as a health care card and concessions under the youth allowance and Austudy means tests. This assistance will be made available to eligible business operators until 30 June 2008 unless extended by regulation.
Labor supports the thrust of this bill as regional and rural communities are being affected by the worst drought in possibly a thousand years and it is important that relief goes to where it is most needed, including those businesses directly affected by their community’s suffering through the drought. Forty-four per cent of the nation is declared to be in exceptional circumstances. Labor sees this as a desperate situation for all affected communities. Agriculturally dependent eligible business operators are currently able to access exceptional circumstances relief through ex gratia payments. This bill will formalise this arrangement for exceptional circumstances relief payments and allow agriculturally dependent eligible business operators to access a health care card and concessions under the youth allowance and Austudy means tests.
This bill includes provisions for farmers who have diversified into agriculturally dependent eligible businesses as a drought management mechanism. As these farmers are no longer deriving a significant proportion of their income from their farm, they would not be eligible for exceptional circumstances relief payments as farmers and their continued ownership of the farm assets would affect their eligibility under the business assets test.
The bill provides for farmers who have diversified into agriculturally dependent business to have farm and eligible business assets exempted from the relevant assets and means tests. The bill will apply to agriculturally dependent eligible business operators who derive 70 per cent or more of their gross business income from providing farming related goods and services to farmers in exceptional circumstances declared areas. This assistance will be made generally available to eligible businesses until 30 June 2008. However, to allow for the potential of continuing drought, this bill allows these end dates to be extended by regulation. Labor broadly supports these changes and expects that the government will implement them better than their previous dismal efforts.
It has to be said that it was Labor that put together the first comprehensive drought assistance package in 1992. At that time that drought was the worst on record. In many ways the 1992 drought was a pivotal moment in the history of Australian farming. It caused the nation’s farmers to rethink the way they ran their farms, it forced Australia’s banks to rethink the way they financed agribusiness and it caused policymakers to rethink the way they engaged with the farming community. Labor’s drought package was underpinned by a number of key principles which still stand to this day.
Those principles were: to encourage primary producers and other sections of rural Australia to adopt self-reliant approaches to managing climate variability; to facilitate the maintenance and protection of Australia’s agricultural and environmental resource base during periods of climate stress; and to facilitate the early recovery of agricultural industries consistent with long-term, sustainable levels. Labor’s drought policy reforms recognised for the first time a key principle that also survives to today—that is, despite a strong commitment from farmers toward drought preparedness, severe droughts will occur that the best farmer could not reasonably be expected to prepare for. That is the true meaning underpinning the policy of exceptional circumstances.
A region was declared EC if it could be demonstrated that the drought event was rare and severe and had led to a severe and prolonged downturn in farm income. Labor’s drought policy reforms offered eligible farmers access to exceptional circumstances business assistance, or ECBA. This was given effect to through the rural adjustment schemes, which offered farmers grants or interest rate subsidies of up to 50 per cent for eligible investments to improve the resilience of their farm businesses or to further enhance their business skills. The policy goal of Labor’s early reforms was to facilitate change in the way our farming communities approach the business of farming in Australia. It was about encouraging our farming businesses to operate in a natural climate which includes extensive periods of intense drought.
Labor’s early reforms also included many initiatives to improve training and skilling of our farm communities in relation to business management and drought preparedness. As a consequence of the 1993-94 drought, Labor recognised that further reform was needed. The then Labor government introduced the drought relief payment, the DRP, which provided farm families with a fortnightly welfare payment commensurate with unemployment benefits. The DRPs were provided to families within the exceptional circumstances declared regions. Like exceptional circumstances, these days the DRP still exists, only now it is referred to as an exceptional circumstances relief payment.
One of the key aspects of Labor’s early drought policy reforms was the introduction of the Income Equalisation Deposit Scheme, which was the precursor to the Farm Management Deposit Scheme. The two schemes have much in common, with a major difference being that the latter scheme was run by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, while deposits under the FMD are made with private institutions. The idea was to build a scheme so that people could put aside money in the good times without being taxed, and to allow them to draw it down in the bad times. It was a simple idea that has turned out to be a great success.
According to the recent review of the FMD Scheme, as at 30 June 2006 more than 42,000 primary producers held a total of $2.797 billion in the FMD Scheme. Only recently has there been a decline in deposits, and this coincides with persistent poor seasonal conditions across Australia.
It was Labor who introduced the early basis of the Farm Management Deposit Scheme, and it was Labor who initially developed the key principles underpinning drought policy. In May 2006, the National Farmers Federation former policy manager, Mr Peter Arkle, wrote the following retrospective critique of Labor’s 1992 national drought policy in the Farm Policy Journal:
The severe drought of 2002 to 2005 has provided an opportunity to reflect on the contribution of National Drought Policy. Encouragingly, Australian farmers were better prepared than in previous droughts, and there is evidence to indicate that the NDP has played a major role in providing farmers with improved risk information, enhanced farm risk management skills and, to a lesser extent, assistance in building financial and physical risk reserves. This enhanced preparedness also appears to have reduced relative demand for exceptional circumstances assistance, suggesting that farmers are making strong progress towards self-reliance.
It is reasonable to say that, by and large, there has been bipartisan support over the years for drought policy. However, there have been some differences, the most notable of which is the Agriculture Advancing Australia package. Soon after its election in 1997, the Howard government abolished the Rural Adjustment Scheme and introduced the AAA package. The Howard government’s AAA package includes the business assistance and relief payments schemes which Labor introduced; however, it also includes a number of other initiatives, with which the Howard government has had mixed success.
In 2004, the Howard government conducted an independent review of the performance of the AAA package. Across Australia, 2,550 producers were surveyed across 14 different industry groupings. Some aspects of the survey—in particular those relating to exceptional circumstances, the Farm Management Deposit Scheme and family welfare payments—were quite pleasing and corroborate Mr Arkle’s assessment, which I referred to earlier. However, some other results of the survey were quite disturbing. For example, uptake of some of the AAA programs has been very poor. The survey found uptake across all farm businesses was as follows: Rural Partnerships program, one per cent; Climate Variability in Agriculture program, two per cent; FarmHelp, three per cent; Farm Innovation Program, four per cent; and the Women in Rural Industries Program, four per cent.
The survey made the following key findings. Firstly, there is limited provision in the AAA programs to enhance market related skills for producers or trade readiness for regions and industries. Secondly, work is needed to increase trade readiness of regions and industries in the face of declining commodity prices. Thirdly, participation in the AAA natural resource management courses remained low. Fourthly, there is very poor awareness of the FarmHelp, Women in Rural Industries and Rural Partnerships programs.
Perhaps the most concerning finding of the government-commissioned independent report was this: 25 per cent of producers who believe they would have a significant problem in drought have done nothing about it, and more than 30 per cent of respondents felt they could have been better prepared. That is a policy failure which must be addressed. It must be remembered that the basis for drought policy was to ensure our farming communities and farm businesses are geared toward drought and have a business model which is all about drought preparedness. But the government’s own independent study found nearly one in four farmers have done nothing about it.
I want to turn my attention to the government’s performance in relation small business assistance, in particular the Howard government’s earlier attempt at designing an assistance package for non-farm small businesses affected by drought. The Howard government recognised the need to assist non-farm small businesses back in 2002 and announced the Small Business Interest Rate Relief program. Sadly, the government’s attempt to provide assistance to non-farm small businesses was a dismal failure. The Australian National Audit Office 2004-05 performance audit into drought assistance noted that it was forecast that up to 17,500 applications would be received and that 14,000 applications would be successful. Sadly, however, only 452 applications were received and 182 applications were successful. How is it that so few applications were made? How is it possible that the government could get it so wrong?
What has the National Party done to address this policy failure since its last attempt back in 2002? The fact is that businesses did not access the government’s previous business support program because the government made it too difficult to access. Criticism of the previous program from affected businesses included that small business operators were too busy to complete the forms, the forms were too complex and the effort to complete the forms was greater than the benefit available. Previously businesses found it difficult to prove that 70 per cent of income comes from farm businesses, and this process could be a costly and administratively demanding process for business.
The government needs to ensure that the application process for any assistance is not complicated and tied up in red tape. The government needs to go back to basics on drought policy and ensure that support goes out to those businesses and individuals who are eligible for assistance, and the government needs to get out there and make it easier for them to actually apply for assistance. Drought affected businesses deserve to receive a better go with drought relief than the government provided last time around.
It is time for us all to reflect on what needs to be done to improve drought preparedness in our farming communities and rural economies. Labor believes it is critically important to: improve drought policy communication and information dissemination; increase the number of drought-ready farming businesses; broaden the reach of drought policy to non-participating farms; ensure Commonwealth-state cooperation to drought policy—specifically comprehensive, integrated and consistent implementation of policy within an agreed framework of responsibilities; and better align drought preparedness programs and communication programs with rural R&D corporations.
Exceptional circumstances arrangements should not artificially support producers who are not viable over the short term or reduce the need for responsible risk management. Therefore, we also need to ensure there are positive incentives built into our policy framework to increase the number of drought-ready farming businesses. Labor is prepared to take the hard decisions and engage in partnership with farm leaders and rural communities on the challenges which face them. And drought continues to be one of the major challenges facing rural Australia today.
The drought is not just impacting on our businesses; it is having a major impact on the fabric of our regional communities. Most importantly, we as policymakers must heighten our collective consciences to the greatest tragedy of drought, and that is the loss of life and the loss of quality of life due to mental illness. According to the New South Wales Farmers Rural Mental Health Network, the percentage of deaths from suicide for male farmers and farm workers is approximately double what it is for the Australian male population. There are also a significantly higher number of ‘accidents’—for example, death by firearm and car accidents—occurring in the bush, particularly in remote areas.
Despite the disproportionately high levels of depression and other mental illnesses in rural and remote areas, communities in these areas continue to have poorer access to mental health support. This is a problem that must be addressed as a matter of urgency. In this regard, I wish to draw the Senate’s attention to the outstanding leadership of the New South Wales Farmers Association on this important issue. In response to the increasing despair being caused by the drought in regional New South Wales, in May 2005 the New South Wales Farmers Association held a drought summit in Parkes. Two thousand farmers attended and told personal tales about the significant personal and emotional impacts of drought on their families and friends and communities. This summit was a turning point for rural communities in terms of acknowledging and seeking to address the growing problem of mental illness.
As a result of the summit, the New South Wales Farmers Association brought together a group of key stakeholders in the area of rural mental health to discuss how best to work together to address rural and remote mental health issues. This forum resulted in the creation of a formal Rural Mental Health Network and a New South Wales farmers blueprint for maintaining the mental health and wellbeing of the people on New South Wales farms. The network includes 19 organisations, including St Vincent de Paul, Anglicare, the Salvos, beyondblue, the Black Dog Institute, the Centre for Rural and Remote Mental Health, the Australian Rotary Health Research Fund, the New South Wales DPI, Centrelink, the Country Women’s Association and the Rural Doctors Association. It identifies a number of challenges to be addressed, but the government should be looking at what additional assistance is available to the Rural Mental Health Network and the potential for this model to be scaled up to the national level.
As I have been meeting with our farm leaders in recent months there are two areas of the government’s AAA policy that consistently get a mention. The first is the Rural Financial Counselling Service. After lobbying from farm groups, the government postponed a foreshadowed change to the service until 30 June last year, and consequently last year’s federal budget boosted funding for the Rural Financial Counselling Service. However, this additional support only carries the service through until June 2008. The government cannot simply hope that the drought goes away and then withdraw this vital service. The government should be looking at making a serious long-term commitment to ensure that services provided by rural financial counselling groups around the country continue to be accessible, in good times and in bad.
The other AAA program that comes up consistently is the FarmHelp program. This represents the largest component of AAA and aims to support farmers in managing change. But the message I am consistently receiving from farmers and their leaders is that the eligibility criteria are too rigid. The criteria are so strict, and access to the program is so difficult, that there have been considerable underspends in the FarmHelp program over the past few years. We support the National Farmers Federation call to reform FarmHelp to remove the impediments to farmers wanting to access the program and to increase the level of incentive offered for farmers to take up the FarmHelp re-establishment grant and exit farming.
It is crucial that policymakers keep these important social issues at the forefront of their minds when developing future drought policy frameworks. Why not let this issue become the new benchmark for future generations to determine how successful we have been in learning how to respond to and live with drought?
Last week my office was fortunate enough to have a visit from Mr Brian Egan, the founder of a community initiative called Aussie Helpers. Mr Egan has provided my office with DVDs of case studies of the extent of the despair currently facing rural Australia. I note that Brian Egan appeared on this week’s Australian Story program on the ABC. I hope that my Senate colleagues will join with me in commending Mr Egan and the New South Wales Farmers Association and the Rural Mental Health Network for their leadership on the issue of rural mental health.
There are a couple of issues that I will need to address in the committee stage. Firstly, this bill needs to be amended. While we broadly support it, we will be moving an amendment in the committee stage in relation to the definition of a small business. I will deal with that later.
Let me conclude by saying Labor introduced drought reform policy more than 15 years ago. We will be supporting key elements of drought policy in the future, but more work needs to be done and we intend to be part of it to make sure that the framework for drought policy is more accessible to farmers.",SENATE,<title>FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,33,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-03-28,"—The Greens are supportive of the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2007. However, it raises a number of issues that we think are important and need to be given an airing and discussed. Drought, we know, has a devastating impact on the agricultural community—on farms themselves, on farmers and on their families. Senator O’Brien has mentioned the impact on mental health. Drought also has an impact on small businesses, on businesses within the agricultural community, on towns, on the health of towns and on the environment and natural resource management.
We believe it is important that Australia provides assistance to our farmers and to our rural communities; however, we believe we are ignoring the elephant in the room—that is, that climate change and its interaction with drought has an impact on Australian agriculture and on our farmers. In the second reading speech by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Ms Ley said:
The Australian government is committed to building the sustainability of the agriculture sector and providing assistance when it experiences severe downturns during rare and severe climatic events.
We are all witnessing the devastation of the current drought.
We have been in drought for a considerable period of time and it is having a devastating impact, but the Greens would argue that this can no longer be treated as a rare and severe climatic event. We are entering a period of climate change and of greater climate variability than Australian farmers have ever faced before. We need to acknowledge that fact and begin planning to ensure that our policy initiatives of financial support and the incentives we provide to the agricultural community take that fact into account.
I am not convinced that the government has got it yet. I highlight the Prime Minister’s comments that he made on 6 February this year in the House of Representatives when talking about the interaction between climate change and drought. He said:
I do think that the jury is out on the connection between climate change and drought, and that is a view shared by the shadow minister, the member for Kingsford Smith. I thank the House.
The point there is that he has not acknowledged and does not acknowledge the link between drought and climate change, and I am desperately concerned that we will see an ongoing cycle of having to provide exceptional circumstances support to an ever-expanding group of farmers who are increasingly affected by drought that is in fact increased climate variability caused by climate change. It is time that we reflected this in policy formulation and in the way that we structure other programs such as adjustment.
Just last year or in 2005, when Mike Young, then a senior CSIRO scientist, dared to produce a paper looking at the impact of structural readjustment on water reform, he was panned outrageously, I believe, by the now Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr McGauran, implying that he was scaremongering and that he did not have the facts right and questioning how he could attack adjustment and exceptional circumstances. Mr Young was pointing out that adjustment, as it has been carried out in Australia over a number of past decades, was not having the desired satisfactory impact. He had been through the research and established that these adjustment packages were not producing the required and desired policy outcomes.
Mr Young also looked at exceptional circumstances and drought risk. He pointed out that there is a risk that adverse climate change may be mistakenly interpreted simply as prolonged drought, which I think is exactly what is happening. So while we agree that of course right now we need to help our farmers, we also need to acknowledge that we are living in a drying climate and we need to be planning for that. Australia is the driest inhabited continent on the planet. We are going to be subject to climate variability and climate change that will inevitably have an impact on our farmers.
The limited research that has taken place to date indicates, certainly in Western Australia, that farmers are finding it increasingly harder to adjust to climate change. Western Australia—and it is nothing to shout about—is probably being subjected to climate change earlier than the rest of Australia. As I have said in this place before, the Western Australian government has taken that into account, for example, when planning for our water resources. It is an absolutely documented fact that our rainfall in Western Australia has decreased substantially. Our farmers have been adjusting and adapting to this, but it is reaching a point where they will no longer be able to adapt. So assistance and help are needed in order for them to adjust to these drying circumstances and we need to be looking at that in our policy formulation.
I note that the National Farmers Federation has in fact been calling for a change and an update to the national drought policy and for policy reform. I have been tracing some of the correspondence and some of the public calls that have been put out. I noticed they go back a number of years, so I spent some time on websites today looking at where Australia is up to on that. The latest information on drought policy reform that I could find on the website of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry was a reference to it in June 2006, when there had been some discussion on drought policy reform but in fact no significant progress. There is no new drought policy in this country. I would have thought that drought in this country would have warranted much more active policy discussion, considering the long-term drought that we are in and also considering the impact that climate change is having on agricultural communities.
It is essential that we start addressing this issue into the long term or we are all going to be in this place every year talking about exceptional circumstances that will no longer be exceptional circumstances. Long-term changes are happening as a result of a combination of seasonal variation and climate change, and they need to be factored into assistance packages and adjustment packages. The Greens will be supporting this particular bill, but we want to see some pretty dynamic change in the way the government addresses climate change. An acknowledgement that there is an interaction between drought and climate change and that we are no longer dealing with rare and severe climatic events would be a good start. We are going to be dealing with frequent, more dramatic events and with long-term change into the future.
This morning a number of senators, I think, and a number of members of the House of Representatives were at a forum, put on by Land and Water Australia, on how farmers are managing climate change. Our farmers are trying to address climate change, but I believe that not enough is being done to help farmers address climate change. In particular, when you look at the more marginal areas, farmers in those areas are going to be hit earliest, are now being hit, and climate change will progressively impact on other farmers in areas that traditionally we have not seen as marginal.
The sooner we get our heads around these facts, the better: we can no longer do business as usual and these will not be ‘exceptional’ circumstances. We need to consider what policy mechanisms are needed into the longer term, including, for example, stewardship support, further and more intense research on alternative crops, and industry development. We need to put money into research into alternative crops and industry development, so that people can have a diversified cropping system but also diversified income sources so that they can deal with climate variation. These are all things that need to be addressed; otherwise, every year we are going to be back here talking about ‘exceptional circumstances’. These circumstances are no longer exceptional; they are the norm, unfortunately.",SENATE,<title>FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,33,1
"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NATS,2007-03-28,"—I rise to speak on the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2007. I am pleased that the Greens are going to be supporting this legislation, as is the opposition. I will pick up on a couple of things that Senator Siewert said before I make my contribution.
Certainly, climate change is real, but a drought is a drought, and this, substantially, over the last three or four years, has been a drought. Where I live, we have records that go back about a hundred years, and there have been some very dry times before and, I guess, there will be some very dry times in the future. Every dry time is painful, and I do not think we should forget that. But I do not think we should immediately say that this particular drought is climate change. Climate change is certainly a fact of life, but I do not think we should use climate change as a means by which we can be distracted from an immediate problem.
I might say that, over the last decade—certainly after the drought of 1994-95—on the Liverpool Plains, which is west of where I live, some of the crops that have been grown, particularly with the wheat and sorghum crops are quite remarkable when you consider the amount of rain that has been available to those farmers. They are innovative, and they are using technology and methods of farming which would have been unthought of a decade ago. And it is a great compliment to them that they have been able to adapt and will continue to adapt. The yields of these crops are absolutely extraordinary, so that when they get a good season they will be even better.
I have pleasure in making a short contribution supporting this Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2007, which responds to the announcement by the Prime Minister on 7 November last year to allow agriculture-dependent small businesses access to the same exceptional circumstances assistance that is provided to farmers more generally. This assistance includes EC relief payments and ancillary benefits such as the healthcare card and concessions under the Youth Allowance and Austudy means tests. Assistance to small business operators will be available until 30 June 2008, unless extended by the government—and I am sure that it would be extended by the government if the need were apparent.
Drought, unfortunately, is part of Australia’s climatic make-up. The resilience of Australian farmers and their commitment to survive under the most difficult economic and seasonal conditions is well understood. The real price of drought can, unfortunately, never be felt by anyone who has not suffered or experienced it. It tears at the very soul of farmers and farming communities, and the impact of climate goes far beyond sound management and commonsense. There are many Australians in rural areas who know the pain that I am talking about. As I have said, I am a farmer in north-western New South Wales and for the last few years we have had a very difficult time.
Governments cannot make it rain, but they can address the needs of the farming community in an intelligent, empathetic and generous way. Our government has certainly attempted to do this consistently since we came to office in 1996, and particularly as the 2001 dry took a grip over much of southern and eastern Australia.
While there are some encouraging signs that the drought may be breaking, it will require some years of above-average rainfall for the watertable to be recharged. And the publicity that is given to the current crisis in the Murray-Darling has made it clear to even the most urbanised Australians that we have a real water problem in this country—a problem which the government is responding to, of course, with its $11 billion package, which is essentially about using our water with greater accountability and with greater recognition of its value.
As I have said, we must be positive and hope that the skies will soon open to provide relief for the more than 50 per cent of agricultural land across Australia which remains drought-declared. I think I am right in recalling that, as of earlier this week, that now includes the whole of Victoria.
It is vitally important that we support all agriculture in these times of need, because we cannot risk failure. This would lead to a decreased production of food and fibre within Australia, and this would mean that as a nation we would have to import more than we do already—and we would certainly diminish our export potential.
The farm contribution may be only around three per cent of GDP but, in terms of overall employment, export earnings and the way we think about ourselves as an agricultural superpower, the farm sector remains incredibly important to our economic and social wellbeing. As a nation we currently produce over four times more than we can consume and it is economically vital that we continue to grow our export industries as we move into more sophisticated trading arrangements, including FTAs when they are in Australia’s best economic interests.
I commend the Australian government for its contribution to assisting not only those farmers struggling through this drought but also the small businesses in our rural communities, which those of us who come from rural communities understand. We hope that they will be able to access this EC assistance. As at 9 March 2007, the Australian government had provided $1.4 billion directly to Australian farmers since the drought began in 2001. We have committed to providing more than $2.1 billion, but I do not imagine for one moment that, whatever is needed to move forward, the government will forget its farmers and its farming communities, who are reliant on each other. This assistance has helped over 60,000 farm families and has meant that these families have been able to stay in the region and continue farming. The government has also run initiatives such as the drought bus, an excellent initiative which took counsellors and Centrelink drought officers directly to farmers.
This bill recognises the financial hardships of all businesses in our rural and regional communities and that the viability of many agriculturally dependent small businesses is highly dependent on the viability of farm businesses. To confirm what this legislation does—and from the indications given by Senator O’Brien and Senator Siewert I know it will pass—the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2007 will allow small businesses to access the same exceptional circumstances assistance that is already provided to the farming sector. This includes EC relief payments and ancillary benefits such as the healthcare card and concessions under the Youth Allowance and Austudy means tests. It is a useful piece of legislation. It meets an undertaking that we made to regional communities. I commend the legislation’s finetuning of the assistance provided to the rural community and I will conclude by saying the government will continue to do whatever it can to soften the impact of the worst drought in our history.",SENATE,<title>FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,33,1
"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2007-03-28,"—I also rise to support the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2007. The agricultural sector in Australia is certainly fundamental to our economic wellbeing as well as to our sense of identity and way of life. It is also increasingly important in our guardianship of the environment and deserves support.
Our own state of South Australia, Mr Acting Deputy President Ferguson, is a major producer of agricultural commodities. Its markets are worth $672 million in grapes, $522 million in wheat and $306 million in barley. As well, the fisheries in South Australia contribute significantly, in my view far exceeding their importance in dollar figures. As well as being vital agricultural industries in their own right, these industries are part of the broader regional sector. Unfortunately, in South Australia this is relatively small and we feel the need to nurture it to some extent.
The nature of our produce, particularly that of the wine and seafood industries, provides a focus for tourism in the area as well as supporting many environmental programs and providing an important part of the social fabric of our state. Incidentally, it is also a significant employer of scientific talent. My first job was at an agricultural research centre looking at calf DNA and it probably gave me my first interest in the agricultural sector—although I did grow up in Mount Gambier. My father was one of those small business people whom this kind of bill might have assisted.
So I am well aware of the importance of the full range of businesses in country areas. I know that if the shops, the mechanics, the truck drivers or the fencing contractors are not getting business then that jeopardises all kinds of other services in country towns. Unfortunately, we have already seen many closures of banks, schools and government agencies in country areas. I do not think any of us would want to see the drought impact further on those. As Senator Sandy Macdonald said, all farmers would acknowledge that the services and products of small businesses in regional areas are absolutely critical to the continuation of the contribution that agricultural services make to our earnings and to the social life of our state. Certainly, they are a major contributor to export earnings, and, given our current balance of trade figures, it is very important to facilitate and nurture our exports.
It is often not well understood by some in city areas that in many aspects the cost of living in country areas can be well in excess of costs for town dwellers. Distance can cause high costs for the basics of life such as food and housing. People often think that rural areas have cheap housing, but because of the distance factor housing is often quite expensive in country areas, particularly where there has been an influx of workers, as in the south-east of South Australia: housing is very difficult to find and very expensive for the workers, and this has a great impact on them. Education costs for families can also be very high because children have to be transported long distances or, indeed, need to board in cities to further their education.
Incomes tightening in drought situations can make it very difficult for families to get by. It can be the case that when a large sector of the community—the farmers in the areas—spend less because of the impacts of drought then small businesses in those country towns and those who provide services to the farmers are the first to feel the impacts of that. I am pleased to see that this bill goes some way to redressing that situation and I am pleased that the government has recognised that, in a prolonged drought such as this, small businesses need support as well as farming families.
I support the bill in that it deals with an immediate problem. Like Senator Siewert, I think that the government needs to look at longer term issues as well. The Australian Treasury submission to the Agriculture and Food Policy Reference Group said that the current sound basic framework of the primary industries sector is due to three factors: the floating of the exchange rate, industrial relations reforms and competition policies. The industrial relations reforms that they are talking about are the reforms that began under the Hawke government, not the recent Work Choices reforms. They were all reforms continued under the Keating Labor government. A lot of those basic factors were in place under a Labor government. While the current Liberal government has managed the economy adequately over the last 10 years, I wanted to recognise that a lot of the building blocks for that were put in place by the former Labor government.
The critical point is that the Australian Treasury submission pointed particularly to productivity growth being required to allow the agricultural sector to continue to have that sound underpinning, to grow in the future and to deal with the challenges that are thrown up to it—whether it be drought, market factors or whatever else. It is a cliche, but I think there is a lot of truth in this: rural industries in Australia lead the world in innovation and self-reliance. They do not get a lot of government support, and they will not under plans to free up trade and to reduce barriers to trade. But they need some assistance from the government—the tools to help themselves and to increase productivity in the sector.
Most people in the agricultural sector that I have talked to talk about adequate infrastructure as being absolutely essential. This is so-called hard infrastructure, like roads, rail and ports, and also a bit of infrastructure that the Labor opposition has been talking about quite a lot recently—that is, information technology and broadband infrastructure. It has been discussed in general terms, but it is as important for the rural sector as it is for anyone else to have access to good broadband infrastructure in order to advance. I am sure that many people all around the states—but certainly in South Australia, where I am getting around to visit some of the primary industries—have been very impressed by the ability of many farmers to take up new technologies and use them to improve their productivity and to deal directly with their clients and their markets.
Where broadband is available, farmers are able to access the latest technology in satellite imaging and in weather forecasting. They are also able to deal directly with their markets; they are able to access information about markets and market conditions; they are able to speak and deal directly with their clients. This is not only farmers; in a lot of the country towns where the local market is very small, many of the small manufacturing businesses we have been talking about, and indeed service businesses, survive only by having access to broadband so that they can sell their products and services to a wider market, whether it is in Australia or overseas, which often occurs. I have been very impressed by the entrepreneurship of many small businesses in regional areas that have a thriving business selling directly overseas in all kinds of niche markets.
Good broadband, as for business anywhere else, is obviously good for both the rural sector and interregional business. That is what the Labor Party is talking about—putting government money in conjunction with private industries to leverage up the amount of money available to ensure that broadband infrastructure is rolled around this nation comprehensively.
It is this kind of long-term thinking that we need to address along with the changes that are outlined in this bill, which go to the immediate solutions to the problem. I am sure that the government are hearing from various groups in the agricultural sector that are crying out for ways to address long-term issues, and productivity is certainly one of the essential elements here, and infrastructure is part of that. It is a bit disappointing that there has not been more of a national approach to infrastructure issues. While commending the government for providing some assistance both to farmers and to small business, I urge them to now turn their attention to some of these long-term issues that so dramatically affect the agricultural sector in Australia and in my state of South Australia in particular.",SENATE,<title>FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,33,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2007-03-28,"—I thank the honourable senators who took part in this debate and I thank the Senate in anticipation of the support that the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2007 is about receive. As so many honourable senators have already said, this bill will help those small business operators who, due to the ongoing drought, are unable to meet the financial needs of their families. It is correct that this is not the first time this government has offered drought assistance to small business operators, but it should be noted that this program is very different to the one offered in 2002. During this debate it was mentioned that the assistance on offer in 2002 had low uptake rates and had a number of concerns raised about it by the small business community. However, based on that which we learned from the prior assistance measures and the expertise that has been gained from delivering exceptional circumstances assistance to farmers, this program is more in touch with the needs of agriculturally dependent small business operators. To put it simply, we have learnt from our past experience and are willing to tailor this program accordingly. This program will provide more value to small business operators.
The exceptional circumstances program for agriculturally dependent small business operators mirrors what is already in place for farmers. What we see in this bill is just one component—income support. There is also business support or interest rate subsidies on offer for eligible small business operators. In the 2002 small business program, only business support was available to small business operators suffering because of the drought. Interest rate relief was available only on loans of up to $100,000, meaning that a maximum of $10,000 over two years could be received. Small business operators can now get interest rate subsidies on all their commercial debts up to a maximum of $100,000 a year, just like farmers.
The 2006 assistance program also offers something new to small business operators—the income support outlined in this bill. On top of receiving funds to help meet the financial obligations of their business, agriculturally dependent small business operators may be able to receive up to $760 a fortnight for income support to help meet their household expenses. Those receiving income support can also access ancillary benefits such as a health care card and concessions under the youth allowance and Austudy means test. The program has been well received and it is already proving successful. It is expected that around 5,000 small business operators will be able to access this exceptional circumstances assistance. While I obviously cannot guarantee that exactly 5,000 people will walk through the door to get the assistance, as it is a demand driven program, I can say that we are well on the way towards achieving our target.
Since the program was announced in November 2006, approximately 1,500 applications for exceptional circumstances assistance from small business operators have been received. This figure is increasing at an amazing rate. On 13 February this year, the number of applications was around 800. In effect, in the last five weeks, application numbers have doubled. As more and more small business operators become aware of the assistance they can access, these figures will continue to grow. I expect that the number of applicants will increase following the recent advertising campaign and the continued good work of the drought bus.
Similarly, since November 2006, over $5 million has been provided to over 280 applicants at an approval rate of 69 per cent. In the last five weeks, the funds allocated to small business operators have almost trebled from $1.6 million. Based on these figures alone, the small business assistance program is performing better than the previous scheme, where we had 452 applications, 152 recipients and $1.1 million over the life of that program. You do not need to just take my word for it; the feedback we have received from the industry supports this initiative and confirms that the interest rate subsidies and relief payments are very valuable forms of assistance.
Questions have also being raised about whether this new program is getting to the right people. As I have already pointed out, the uptake rate of small business exceptional circumstances assistance has been very good. Of course, the approval rate will not be 100 percent as there are people out there who have not been able to access the assistance for a number of reasons. I can confirm that the two main reasons that small business operators are not able to get assistance are: they are not providing goods and services for the purposes of farming activities, or they are not in financial difficulty and are still trading profitably. Those small business operators who are unable to get assistance because they are not agriculturally dependent should be aware that they will indirectly benefit from the assistance provided. Providing assistance to both agriculturally dependent small business operators and farmers will have flow-on benefits for townships as they will continue to provide essential services and have some income to spend in other local businesses. We are already seeing a shortage of skilled workers in rural areas, and also young people from rural areas are being lured away to the city. By supporting small businesses in rural areas, we can reverse the current trend—because we all know that, once people leave regional Australia, it is very hard to get them back.
While farm businesses have been the first group to experience the effects of the worsening drought, agriculturally dependent small businesses in drought affected areas are definitely experiencing hardship as well. We as a government recognise that, without the assistance provided by this bill, the ability of some small businesses to service rural and regional communities may be at risk. Government and industry are working together to move the drought policy towards drought preparedness. All agriculture ministers—federal, state and territory—have focused their efforts on immediate assistance and will return to drought policy reform once the seasonal conditions allow their recovery processes to commence. I am sure that we are all hoping and praying that that may be as soon as possible. I thank honourable senators for their support and contributions on this bill.
Question agreed to.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2007-03-28,"—I rise to speak on the Migration Legislation Amendment (Information and Other Measures) Bill 2007. This bill seeks to make several simple amendments, if we could call them that, to the Migration Act to broaden the ability of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship to access and disclose personal identifiers in a way that is consistent with the Privacy Act provisions. The amendments proposed are not in themselves controversial but they are nevertheless important amendments. What is controversial is the bizarre delay in the government introducing this bill. The delay has had far-reaching consequences not only for the day-to-day running of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship but also on the ability of law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute crimes such as people smuggling.
This bill attempts to achieve three main objectives. It seeks to widen the scope for disclosure of identifying information in certain circumstances. It seeks to enable people to access personal records held by the department that relate specifically to them. And it seeks to incorporate new fishery offences introduced last year. I will deal with each of those objectives in greater detail as this debate proceeds.
In terms of the first objective, the bill attempts to fix some unintended consequences of some amendments in 2004 to the Migration Act regarding protection of privacy. The department may recall—although the faces have changed, by the look of it—that in 2004 the Migration Legislation Amendment (Identification and Authentication) Act was passed by parliament. This act introduced a regime for collection, access and disclosure of personal identifying information of noncitizens collected by the department. The situations in which such information is collected include: when people are applying for an Australian visa, when people are going through immigration clearance, when a noncitizen is put into immigration detention and when a person is suspected of being an unlawful noncitizen. The 2004 amendments prohibited the department from accessing and disclosing such personal identifiers except in circumstances expressly permitted under the act. Non-permitted access or disclosure was deemed to be a criminal offence that attracted up to two years imprisonment. But, in another example of this government falling short of the mark, the measures introduced ended up being overly restrictive.
The bill before the parliament now widens what is lawful disclosure for identifying information. Three new exemptions to unlawful disclosure are proposed that bring the Migration Act in line with the Privacy Act 1988. The first is where a person who accesses the information believes on reasonable grounds that the access or disclosure is necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the life or health of the person or of any other person. This provision would apply, for example, where there has been a threat against an immigration official or the Australian embassy, and the department held a photograph of this person. Then the amendment would allow the department to provide that photograph to the AFP to assist them in investigating the threat. The second exemption is where the disclosure is reasonably necessary for the enforcement of criminal law of the Commonwealth or of a state or territory. Hence, this amendment would fix the current problem whereby the department cannot disclose a signed incoming passenger card to the AFP or the Commonwealth DPP to assist with cracking down on people who might be up to no good, such as drug smugglers. The third exemption is where the disclosure is required by or under a law of the Commonwealth or a state or territory. This amendment is primarily designed to allow the department to provide identifying information in response to search warrants issued by a state or territory agency.
These amendments also amend mirror provisions in the Fisheries Management Act 1991, the Torres Strait Fisheries Act 1984 and the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The reason such mirror provisions exist is that, according to the explanatory memorandum, illegal fishers may be detained under any of these three acts but then the legal basis for their detention may shift to the Migration Act, under which they are then detained.
There are several other amendments provided by this bill to what is a lawful disclosure that go beyond the Privacy Act, but it seems that the case has been made that, nevertheless, they are thought necessary. That occurs where the disclosure is to a Commonwealth, state or territory agency for the purpose of verifying that the relevant person is an Australian citizen or holds a visa of that particular class. For example, many social security benefits require the recipient to provide evidence that they are an Australian citizen. Another such ground where it is thought necessary that that information may be able to be shared is for the purpose of investigations of the Privacy Commissioner or the Ombudsman relating to any action taken by the department. In addition, it may be disclosure of audio or video tapes for the purposes of the Migration Act or the Citizenship Act, which I understand the department says is for the purpose of utilising transcribing and translating services. It may also be for the purpose of facilitating or expediting the exercise of powers or performance of functions of the Migration Agents Registration Authority, commonly known as MARA, to investigate complaints into migration agents.
Allowing people to access their own movement records is the next area I will deal with. Schedule 2 of this bill enables the department to disclose to a person or to their appointed agent their own movement records, rather than requiring them to apply for access pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act. That would seem a sensible thing to be able to do, quite frankly—and if the department missed it in 2004 then it really is lucky it has got a change of face now. This amendment is designed to help both applicants and the department by allowing the department to provide people with their own movement records—which they may need, for example, for tax or health insurance purposes—so that the applicants need not apply under the FOI Act for access to those documents. If there is a committee stage on this bill, the government might like to indicate then how many times that has had to be undertaken and what cost has been shifted to people for that. I will foreshadow those questions so that we might have an opportunity to get some answers—I thought I might make sure you have to work this evening, Parliamentary Secretary Mason!
The application process under the FOI Act is far more complex and the retrieval process is unnecessarily resource intensive for the department. Hence, the explanatory memorandum states that this bill will allow the department to retrieve the information more efficiently for the client. Those areas do provide a greater responsibility for the department in that instance too, because the department has to consider more broadly the issues of how it handles that information, how it then provides it to the relevant people and how it ensures that privacy is maintained.
Schedule 3 is a technical amendment to the Migration Act that merely alters the definition of a ‘fisheries detention offence’ to include new fisheries offences introduced in 2006 to ensure that those arrested for committing the new offences receive an enforcement visa on arrival to Australia. It is clear that some of these matters were not fully thought out right back from 2004 till now. On one hand it is encouraging to see that the department is slowly moving, ensuring that these matters are now rectified. It would be interesting to know when the department first became aware of some of these issues and how long it has taken the matters to come to light. We already know that there has been delay in introducing these laws and, given the serious consequences for criminal investigations and prosecutions, that is difficult to understand. It has taken the government 2½ years to remedy these problems and one would have thought that it should have taken less time than that. There may be reasonable explanations, of course. The department may have been very busy during that period. I do recall some certain significant events over the last couple of years which have kept them busy. They do have a new name too—‘people are our business’—so hopefully they will be able to assist people with this new bill when it becomes an act.
In his second reading speech for this bill the new Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Kevin Andrews, outlined the havoc created by these laws. It is unusual for a minister to do that, but he did take the opportunity to say that the department has stopped disclosing photos and signatures that would help in investigating and prosecuting Migration Act offences. He said that the department no longer discloses photos and signatures to law enforcement agencies such as the Australian Federal Police or the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions for non-immigration related crime. For example, the minister stated that several drug importation matters ‘have been delayed because of our inability to provide this information’. He said:
My department’s ability to continue normal working practices is being seriously hampered and in some instances activities have been discontinued as a result.
Those were the words of the minister in his second reading contribution. The minister also stressed in his second reading speech:
... in light of the serious problems presently being faced by my department—
and it is not only in this area, I presume, but I suspect he was talking about this bill—
it is essential that certain amendments be made as soon as possible.
The legislation that caused this raft of problems was introduced in 2004. According to the Parliamentary Library Bills Digest, these problems started to emerge by late 2005. It is now March 2007 and rapidly approaching April.
When the Labor spokesperson for immigration, the member for Watson, Mr Burke, demanded to know why it had taken such an awfully long time to make basic amendments to the Migration Act to rectify serious problems that had arisen from the 2004 amendments, all the member for Moreton, Mr Gary Hardgrave, could retort was, ‘The process of drafting is always subject to the other priorities of the parliament.’ That does seem a very bureaucratic answer, quite frankly. It is not one that I would have expected Mr Hardgrave to make. For a government that claims it is proactive on border protection, people smuggling and national security, it really is an appalling excuse especially given the work that the department had gone through post Vivian Alvarez, Cornelia Rau and the Palmer review—and I will not go to all the matters that surround those. But in the final report—and I would be happy to be corrected here—I recall Mr Palmer trying to implement a better proactive approach to be able to identify and use data more effectively, especially the ability to have photographs and signatures available. In a more general sense one would have thought that the government would have moved a lot quicker to rectify these areas, if that were the case.
I would hope that in the second reading debate in the Senate the government can say that it has learnt its lessons from those earlier experiences. It concerns me that this may not be true. The government has repeatedly proven its incompetence when it comes to immigration matters. There have been numerous stuff-ups in the department revealed in the media over recent years. The examples of delay in fixing basic problems add to this growing list of sorry failures.
People smugglers put the lives of desperate people at risk on the high seas. Labor wants to make sure that the people responsible for such an ugly trade are met with the full force of the law. The same goes for illegal fishers and drug smugglers, may I add. When personal identifiers have to be withheld from agencies that are investigating serious crimes, whether they are immigration related or not, this government should be concerned about their credentials, quite frankly. It is disgraceful that people breach our border unlawfully or smuggle drugs and convictions do not happen because the government could not be bothered to introduce legislation that makes simple amendments that rectify the situation. Labor wants to ensure that the need for swift access and disclosure of such documents for the purpose of prosecuting crimes such as people smuggling is balanced against the need to prevent unwarranted breaches of privacy. Labor agrees with the government: this bill does reach an appropriate balance.
Labor is and remains shocked, though, at the delay in the introduction of such basic legislation to amend a problem that has caused enormous delay in the prosecution and investigation of crimes. We note that this is an election year, and we can only surmise that this is the reason why the government is moving so rapidly considering its slow pace up to now after a wait of more than a year. If we may provide any sage-like advice, we ask that the government, whenever such problems again come to light in the future, promptly introduce legislation to fix them and not leave its departments and the AFP, as well as other important bodies affected by defective legislation, in the lurch. I add, in conclusion, that Labor welcomes this bill.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (INFORMATION AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,35,1
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2007-03-28,"—I thank Senator Ludwig very much for his contribution to the debate on the Migration Legislation Amendment (Information and Other Measures) Bill 2007. His conceptualising of the bill as access versus privacy is an aspect that I enjoy, one that we have seen a lot of in this parliament in recent times. I will come to the point that Senator Ludwig raised about the costing implications in a minute.
This bill amends the Migration Act 1958 and mirrors provisions in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, the Fisheries Management Act 1991 and the Torres Strait Fisheries Act 1984 to address serious limitations in the provisions to limit access and disclosure of identifying information. Senator Ludwig touched on that.
Identifying information includes personal identifiers such as a person’s photograph, fingerprint or signature. Under all four acts, it is an offence to access and disclose identifying information unless the access or disclosure comes under a list of permitted accesses and disclosures. The limited grounds upon which this information can be accessed and disclosed is affecting the Department of Immigration and Citizenship’s ability to continue a range of normal working practices such as disclosing photos and signatures to other agencies—an issue we have touched on many times in recent weeks in this parliament.
The bill addresses this problem by adding some additional access and disclosure grounds to the four acts. These additional grounds are targeted at alleviating the most pressing difficulties being experienced under the current arrangements. For example, access and disclosure will be permitted where it is done to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to life or to health. The Department of Immigration and Citizenship will be able to disclose identifying information to the Migration Agents Registration Authority to assist in investigations into complaints against migration agents. Disclosure of identifying information to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions will also be permitted, to assist in investigations and prosecutions.
The amendments in the bill to replace ‘noncitizen’ with ‘person’ in various disclosure grounds  is to ensure that a permitted disclosure can still occur after the noncitizen from whom the information was collected has indeed become a citizen. However, the act will continue to allow personal identifiers to be collected only to identify noncitizens.
To follow up Senator Ludwig’s point, this bill will also broaden the ability of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship to disclose to a person that individual’s movement records, thereby avoiding the need for the person to access their records through the freedom of information process. This will greatly improve the service that the department can provide. The government, as I understand it—and this is in answer to your question, Senator Ludwig—has not costed the implications of this. This bill will also amend the definition of ‘fisheries detention offence’ in the Migration Act to ensure that enforcement visas are granted to noncitizens who have been brought to Australia in relation to new fisheries offences recently incorporated into fisheries legislation.
In summary, by expanding the currently limited grounds upon which identifying information can be accessed and disclosed, we will improve the efficiency of operations within the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. The bill will also enhance client service by enabling the disclosure of an individual’s movement records to the individual to which they indeed relate.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-03-28,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
This document comprises a couple of tabling statements of decisions made by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship under section 46A of the Migration Act. It is probably quite apt in a way that it is dealing with migration matters, as it is flowing straight on from the legislation we have just considered regarding privacy matters and the disclosure of information. Section 46A is one of a number of sections of the Migration Act where the minister has a discretion, if they so choose, to lift the bar, as the jargon goes, to void requirements. Section 46A means that a person who is an offshore entrant, an unlawful noncitizen and in Australia cannot make a valid visa application. It is a way of preventing people who are offshore entry persons from applying for asylum. These are people who arrive at islands outside the migration zone, for example.
Section 46A allows the minister, if they believe it is in the public interest, to give written notice to that person that the bar on making a valid application can be lifted, and when they do so the minister is required to table a statement in each house of parliament setting out that determination and the reasons why they believe that doing so is in the public interest. There are a range of other sections that also do this, such as section 351 and section 417, for example. All of them have minimal information. Indeed, I recall that the last wad of those statements that were tabled contained many hundreds. They can be all tabled at once and they are almost indistinguishable from each other. Sections 33(2)(b) and 48B of the Migration Act also have a similar sort of requirement. They are actually of no value in terms of scrutiny.
In my experience these statements are not normally tabled as documents in this way; they are simply tabled with other government documents, such as regulations and the like. These two particular statements simply state that the former minister has exercised her powers under section 46A of the act, that the circumstances of the cases were such that they were considered to be offshore entry persons and that the minister considered her determinations to be in the public interest. The statements do not set out the reasons for the determinations at all, which is certainly against the requirement of the act.
Having said that, I am actually quite pleased because the exercise of these powers, as has occurred, has allowed the individual and the family involved to make valid protection visa applications. After the debate we have just had about privacy and the disclosure of information, it is interesting to note that section 46 of the Migration Act requires that any statement tabled in the parliament must not include the name of the offshore entry person or any information that may identify the offshore entry person. That has not happened in these statements; as usual, there is virtually no information at all. But I have noticed that the names of the individual and the family to whom these statements apply appear on today’s Order of Business. That is a curious development, and it is perhaps an indication that the unintended disclosure of information is a little easier than people might assume, despite all the assurances we just heard from the minister in the last debate.
I am pleased that the individual, who was detained on Christmas Island, and the family, whom I met in Brisbane last year, are people about whom I made representations to the minister. I am very pleased that the former minister chose to exercise her discretion in that way. It has enabled these people to make applications, and hopefully they will be found to be valid so that they can get on with their lives. But it is curious that their names are listed on the Senate Order of Business as presumably being the individual and family that these statements apply to. I draw that to the attention of whoever’s attention it needs to be drawn to—presumably, the minister and the department. I ask them to clarify what has gone on there and why they have done that on this occasion. I do not imagine it is going to cause any major drama, but if we have these provisions in the act that say people should not be identified then I think it is important that they be complied with. (Time expired)

 (Senator Moore)—The issue you have raised has been noted and action will be taken to remove those names.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Migration Act</title>,Documents,36,1
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2007-03-28,"—I wish to raise in the chamber today an issue of utmost importance, not just to the families of Australia but to the country as a whole. There is a massive problem in Australia with the lack of involvement by our young people in organised sport and fitness. Too much time is being spent in front of the TV, PlayStation or computer and not enough at sporting fields, ballet halls and swimming pools. When you ask young children what their favourite game is, many will reply PlayStation 3 or Nintendo. Gone are answers such as cricket, footy, netball or even marbles. This lack of involvement is being caused by a number of things, including the length of the working day for parents, the high number of children in after-school care and the fear of many parents of injury or harm if their children are not safely seated in the lounge room.
However, one of the biggest factors in this whole debate is the rising cost of participation in children’s sport. At the moment, most parents are signing up their children for winter activities such as soccer, football, netball or hockey. It is not unusual for families to be faced with a bill of over $100 for each child just for the opportunity to be part of a team—that is, before uniforms and travel costs are included. Individual sports such as swimming, dancing and athletics are even more expensive, yet the value from a public health point of view of young people being physically active is huge. If children are not involved in some form of organised physical activity, there are severe implications for their weight, self-esteem and wellbeing.
Much has been written in the media about the physical implications for the nation’s children of obesity, including diabetes, heart disease and early onset of puberty. The mental implications of childhood obesity are also very important. The lack of self-esteem and the self-loathing and doubt that can be manifested by overweight and obese children and teenagers affects them for the rest of their lives. The most recent focus has been on the food that our children eat, on the influence of fast food advertising and on the importance of educating parents and children on healthy eating choices. The other side of the equation, however, is equally important: exercise and physical activity. The government has a responsibility to help every Australian family get moving.
Evidence suggests that the rising cost of participation in sport is a massive barrier to increased involvement. Ask any parent who has active children to list the cost of that involvement and I am sure that everyone in this chamber would be staggered. The limited available official data from the ABS household expenditure survey indicates that, for households with dependent children, the amount spent on sporting club subscriptions increased by 88 per cent, from 92c per week in 1998-99 to $1.73 per week in 2003-04. This is a much bigger increase than the growth in average incomes of these households, which was 32 per cent over the same period. That 88 per cent increase in sporting club subscriptions in five years does not include new boots, swimmers, goggles, uniforms, ballet shoes, bats, rackets, gloves and protective helmets, nor the petrol required to transport children to fixtures.
The sports participation component of the CPI has also been significantly greater than the increase in the overall CPI. For example, between June 1998 and December 2006 the sports participation component of CPI increased by 54 per cent, while the CPI increased by 28.5 per cent. Whilst the nature of both of these statistics cannot guarantee that the expenditure is only on children, the reality is that most families are paying more to be involved in physical activity. This increase is significantly higher than the CPI and is leading to families not allowing their children to be involved.
Sporting club costs are rising to the point where cost becomes the determining factor in a child’s involvement. A number of factors have most likely contributed to rising costs in these areas. The Senate Economics References Committee review of public liability and professional indemnity insurance stated that sport and recreation organisations have been most likely disproportionately affected by increases in the cost of public liability cover. Increased premiums for insurance have most probably been passed on to sports participants. Some increases cited in the review included the following: Surf Life Saving Australia Ltd premiums increased from $153,000 to $600,000 from 1996 to 2001; Soccer Australia premiums increased from $42,785 to $440,000 over one year; and Australian Swimming premiums increased between 150 and 350 per cent among affiliated organisations.
Also compounding the pressure on clubs and sporting organisations is the push for public authorities to move to full-cost recovery for the hire of premises. Council and government owned sporting fields are in many cases no longer made available to clubs at subsidised rates. As well, some clubs have to employ professional people in roles such as treasurer, secretary and canteen convener because the voluntary support from the community is not as available as it used to be.
Of great concern is the link between lower income families and sporting activities. A research report by the University of South Australia found a strong correlation between participation and family income. The study determined that parents of junior sport participants were predominantly in white-collar occupations. In particular, the data suggested that the direct and indirect costs favour children from high-income families with a flexible daily routine, or those having one parent at home full-time or part-time to provide transport and other means of practical support. The authors of a similar study cited in the research concluded:
There can be no question, on the basis of the findings of this study, that there remain substantial socio-economic barriers to children’s participation in club and representative sport.
I believe there needs to be a greater incentive for parents to get their children into physical activity, and for the last few weeks my office has been working on a proposal of a tax allowance for the registration and tuition costs of children’s sport. Last week the Australian Sports Federation Alliance contacted all MPs with an extremely similar plan. We were working in parallel, and I have since met with the alliance to consolidate our approaches. Both the Australian Sports Federation Alliance and I have called for a taxation deduction of at least $250 per child per annum, up to their 17th birthday. I am also proposing that families who do not have a taxable income should be able to present their receipts for up to $250 to Centrelink to receive a proportional payment equivalent to the tax rebate.
The net benefit to families via both systems would be about $75 per child per year. This benefit would allow families to claim for the equivalent of one winter sport and one summer sport registration, or a more intensive program like summer swimming lessons. I am also proposing no bottom age limit, as I believe that teaching young children the importance of an active lifestyle is absolutely important. The most common activity for children under five is swimming lessons and—especially in Queensland, where water is the focus of so many family activities—the more youngsters that we can save from drowning deaths and injuries by this government incentive, the better.
The ASFA’s proposal notes that similar actions have recently been taken by the Canadian government to provide tax incentives of up to $500 per child for children’s sporting involvement. The Australian Sports Commission has a long-established definition and criteria for recognising which activities are defined as sports and which sporting bodies are recognised. ‘Sport’ is defined as:
A human activity capable of achieving a result requiring physical exertion and/or physical skill which, by its nature and organisation, is competitive and is generally accepted as being a sport.
According to this definition, then, eligible activities would be undertaken at least once a week and for a period of at least 10 weeks and would include, amongst others: swimming, dancing, team sports, horse sports, gymnastics, athletics and martial arts. Extra curricular activities which have limited or no physical activity component, such as chess, yoga, drama or music classes would not eligible for rebates. I seek leave to have the rest of my speech incorporated in Hansard. (Time expired)

Leave granted.

The incorporated speech read as follows—

I am suggesting that tax deductibility would also not be available for the cost of transport or equipment like shoes or uniforms but would cover officially receipted costs such as registration fees, ground fees, and tuition costs. This benefit would encourage more families to consider a sporting activity enabling sporting organisations to cover the cost of registrations, insurance, and location hire. Parents would still bear the majority of the costs of their children’s involvement in sport but the incentive bonus would enable more children to become involved.
I am also aware that some health funds offer rebates for activities that promote a healthier lifestyle. However this is usually only available with the most expensive level of cover and few families can afford this.
Mr President, there are currently over three million school age children in Australia at the moment and this policy could help improve the health and fitness outcomes for every one of them. This idea is supported by hundreds of sporting greats in Australia who know and understand the value of involvement in physical activity on a regular basis.
I believe that action should be taken as soon as possible to halt the decline in young people’s involvement in sporting activities and I look forward to the opportunity to further develop my proposal and that of the Australian Sport Federation Alliance with the minister for sport, my colleague Senator Brandis.
The minister has tackled the complexities of his new portfolio with great competence. As a minister, he understands the importance of this issue for the health of our nation, and as a father himself I know he understands the added pressure that the high cost of sporting involvement is having on Australian families. His children have been involved in sporting activities, he has taken them to practice and games, outfitted them and most importantly paid the bills, so he knows how the costs mount up. I believe the minister would want to take every action possible to assist the young people of Australia to get physically active on a regular basis.
We are not talking about elite sport here, we are referring to the under-8s cricket match on a Saturday morning at the council oval, the local dance studio, and karate lessons in the CWA hall. It is local children undertaking local activities at a local level that this policy initiative is aimed towards.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Children and Sport</title>,Adjournment,37,1
