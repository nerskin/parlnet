The PRESIDENT,N/A,1999-08-09,"—On behalf of all senators, I express our deepest sympathy to the families and friends of those young Australians who were killed and to those who were injured at Interlaken on 27 July 1999. I offer condolences to the families and friends of those citizens of Switzerland, New Zealand, South Africa and Britain who also lost their lives in this tragedy. I also wish to commend the efforts of the rescuers and support services attending the scene and extend thanks to the Swiss authorities who came to the assistance of the survivors, friends and families.
A number of senators who have just been presented to the Governor-General commented to him on his presence at the service at Interlaken. I include our thanks to him for representing this country with the distinction with which he did on that sad occasion. I invite honourable senators to stand and observe a minute's silence in memory of those who died and in sympathy with their loved ones and friends whom we join in mourning.
Honourable senators having stood in their places—

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-08-09,"—I want to ask the Manager of Government Business a question. I just want to be clear on this. Is the 20-minute time limit going to apply to these speeches? Is that the government's proposal?
The reason I ask is that, as you would be aware, Mr Acting Deputy President McKiernan, sometimes a little generosity has been applied. But there might be a little inconsistency here as to whether we enable a senator, if they have not quite completed their remarks in 20 minutes, to have an extension of time. That is the reason I raise this issue. It strikes me that in first speeches we ought to be a little generous in relation to time limits. I wonder if the government has given any thought to this or if, by leave, we could perhaps agree to extend a little more generosity than we normally would, that is all.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>First Speeches</title>,Business,9,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-08-09,"—by leave—I want to support the view that has just been put by my leader, Senator Faulkner. I think under the previous arrangements the whips had in place it was understood that if a first speech went to a maximum of 25 minutes nobody would interrupt. On the last occasion first speeches were given, the President ruled quite correctly in terms of the formal arrangement and cut off a senator giving a first speech. That was never the intention of anyone. On that occasion it had been agreed that the 20 minutes was a guide to new senators and advice was given to some of them that they would not be interrupted if they went a few minutes longer. But that was not then reflected in the resolution.
It was always the understanding of the parties that they would be given an indication that they would get 20 or so minutes, but if they needed a few minutes more they would, for probably the only time in their careers, be extended the courtesy of being allowed to finish. I remember one Senator—I think it was Senator Trish Crossin—was stopped before she had finished. I think that was not the intention of anybody. I think Senator 
 Faulkner's point is well made, that we ought to allow a little more flexibility if they go a bit longer.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>First Speeches</title>,Business,9,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-08-09,"—by leave—What I might do is amend the time for the commencement of the first speeches to be made by Senators McLucas and Ludwig back to 5.40 p.m. That would allow a maximum of 25 minutes for each of them, so they will not run into the dinner adjournment. I am sure if we do hit the dinner adjournment and Senator Ludwig is still in full flight we could probably be a bit flexible. I know that has been the pattern, but we do not want to let them get into bad habits too soon—as long as they recognise it is a very special deal for very special people in their first week.
I seek leave to amend my motion.
Leave granted.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-08-09,"—by leave—On a similar and associated matter which relates to the Manager of Government Business's proposition—the opposition, let me make clear, supports the motion before the chair: is it possible that we run a risk in regard to first speeches on Wednesday that if a senator is speaking at a few minutes to 12.00 and uses the time either for an extensive committee stage contribution or perhaps a second reading speech, there is a potential to run into a problem at 12.45? I am not raising this point to bowl up a googly. I just want to make sure that we allow a little flexibility in the delivery of first speeches.
I think Senator Evans's point was well made because there has been a little inconsistency here. Sometimes we have applied a little flexibility; sometimes we have not. I do not think it is really fair to whoever is presiding. If the clock is set at 20 minutes, the President, the Deputy President or the Acting Deputy President is really obligated to ensure that senators are limited in their speaking 
 times. I just raise that with the Manager of Government Business and ask him to be mindful of this.
I suspect that we can in an informal way work something out between the parties in relation to this, but I think that—given that we have seven new senators, all of whom will be giving first speeches—now is the time for us to get some consistency into how we apply this issue of the time limit. I think it is difficult to sit down a new senator who requires a minute or two to conclude their first speech. I, for one, would want on this occasion, in these circumstances, to err on the side of flexibility. Where we might not always be as generous in the chamber, I think in these circumstances we ought to be.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>First Speeches</title>,Business,9,1
"Harris, Sen Len",IND,1999-08-09,"—by leave—I would like to endorse both of the speakers' calls for some leniency. Bearing in mind that there are tight time frames in the chamber, it would be greatly appreciated. I, being the only new senator in the chamber at the moment, feel it would be remiss of me not to speak to this motion and endorse these sentiments. I appreciate the opportunity to do this and ask that consideration be given to extending the time.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,1999-08-09,"—On behalf of the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum, I present the committee's advisory report on the Constitution Alteration (Establishment of Republic) 1999  and the Presidential Nominations Committee Bill 1999 , together with submissions, Hansard  record and minutes of proceedings. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
The process of which this report is the result began substantially with the Constitutional Convention held in February last year, a very special event in Australian history, not only in terms of our democratic structures but also in terms of the ongoing debate about our head of state. It and this report were both important steps in engaging the Australian community in an understanding of and debate on their Constitution and important steps in the process of consultation and community engagement.
At the outset, I would like to thank all of the committee staff, especially the committee secretary, Claressa Surtees, for their work over the past month or so. Arranging a committee of 18 members for such a process cannot have been an easy task. Between coordinating diaries, desires and preferences, the staff have done an excellent job. I would also place on record my thanks to the chairman of the committee, Mr Bob Charles MP, and my other Senate and House of Representatives colleagues who participated in the committee.
We received 122 written submissions from a range of interested individuals and organisations and conducted hearings all over the country—in Adelaide, Brisbane, Broome, 
 Canberra, Darwin, Hobart, Melbourne, Newcastle, Perth, Sydney and Townsville. It was the view of many committee members that it was imperative to visit both regional and metropolitan locations to ensure that all who wanted an opportunity to address the committee had that chance, and particularly to give those outside metropolitan Australia an opportunity to express their views with regard to the bills.
A range of witnesses gave evidence to the committee, from constitutional lawyers—more and more of those—and academics, both monarchist and republican, to those with less expert, but no less enthusiastic, involvement and interest in the issues. The committee has made a number of recommendations that include changes to the long title of the bill; membership of the Presidential Nominations Committee; the process of nomination; the qualifications, powers, dismissal and term of office of the President; and the education  campaign to be conducted prior to the referendum. I wish to briefly address two of those.
Firstly, I refer to the issue of the long title of the bill. It is my view that the long title of the bill as recommended by the committee does represent a more accurate wording without making the question unwieldy or misleading. It was important for us to keep in mind that the aim is for the question put to the people to be as informative as possible without being overly complex. However, I note that this afternoon the Prime Minister announced a new wording. I am sure that that proposal will receive the considered attention of all participants in the debate. Hopefully it will address many of the concerns that have been raised in recent days by enthusiasts of change and opponents of change alike and produce some of the balance much sought after by many of those people.
Secondly, I refer to the membership of the nominations committee. The committee has recommended that the Prime Minister, in appointing the nominations committee, have regard to, as far as practicable, the diversity of the Australian people. The diversity of the Australian populace is one of the fundamental building blocks of our community. Australians of different ethnicities, genders, ages and 
 backgrounds have contributed enormously to the development of our nation. It is my hope as a republican that all Australians, from a variety of backgrounds, will continue to enhance this development. It is fundamentally important for the President of this nation to be truly representative of the diversity of our people. An appropriate way to ensure this is to ensure a nominations committee which is reflective of this diversity.
These recommendations reflect a genuine concern by committee members to ensure that the referendum most accurately reflects the outcome of the Constitutional Convention. I believe it is important that this be maintained. The public was so actively involved in the Constitutional Convention that it would represent a breach of faith to not represent the outcome of that body as far as possible.
I commented earlier that this report represents a culmination in a process of community engagement—and, of course, it is not the last word on constitutional change. Another process of engagement must now commence; that is, engaging the community in a debate about the merits of the proposed reforms and the benefits which might be offered through becoming a republic.
It is no secret that I will be seeking to vote yes on 6 November. I note that the chairman of the committee, after this long and arduous process, has also put on the record this afternoon in another place a similar commitment. This process of engagement is one that must continue until 6 November. I hope that this report, in its own way, might mark the commencement of a new round of invigorated and enthusiastic debate on the issue which will lead to a positive outcome for the referendum in November.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>Report of Republic Referendum Committee</title>,Bills,16,1
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-08-09,"—I also rise to speak on the report of the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum. I also start by commending the committee secretariat for the amount of work they have been able to put together and analyse in a very short period of time. The report is a very useful one, coming at a quite critical time in the move towards Australia becoming a republic. This report is a good reflection not only on the capacity of those in 
 the secretariat who were party to it but also, I must say, on all members and senators who were party to this process. So I place on the record my thanks to the chair and all members of the committee for the way they contributed to this particular report. I also thank the 122 or so people who made original submissions as well as those appearing in person before the committee.
There were some 14 recommendations from the committee. It is fair to say that, with respect to the majority of those recommendations, if not all of them, the overwhelming majority of members and senators came to the same conclusion. Our task, in essence, was to look at and assess the model which came through last year's Constitutional Convention to see how it was reflected in—and what changes were needed to—the government's legislation to ensure that the spirit and the letter of the Constitutional Convention model were reflected in that legislation.
In a sense, this committee has achieved much; it has achieved a refinement of the model. Thirteen of the amendments go to issues that relate to the actual operation of the model proposed by the Constitutional Convention. The 14th recommendation goes to the core issue facing the parliament and the Australian people—and that is the actual referendum question to be put to the people. In that sense, the committee was faced by the Prime Minister's continuing campaign of subterfuge. His personal proposal for what should be the question to be put to the Australian people was found by the committee to not be a fair and accurate reflection of the considerations and deliberations of the Constitutional Convention. In fact, the committee said:
The committee considers that the reference in the draft long title to the two-thirds majority of the members of parliament gives an incomplete picture of the essential feature of the nomination process which involves public consultation and a process for bipartisan nomination by both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition.
Essentially, we found that the government's proposed question was one that did not fairly reflect the essence of the new system proposed to the people through the referendum mechanism. The committee felt also that there 
 was the need not only for a new question but also for a degree of fairness to be imparted into this process.
It is undisputed that an ever growing majority of Australians want Australia to become a republic. The driving force for this parliament should not be political trickery; it should be to give expression to the will of that increasing majority. I say `increasing' because the polls this morning indicate that some 63 to 64 per cent of those who have a position on whether Australia should become a republic support the model put up by the joint parliamentary committee. That is an all-time high. It is a high which still prevails, despite the attacks of Mr Reith in trying to undermine the move towards a republic and despite the game the Prime Minister is playing in this  particular area. Faced with the issue, the committee analysed alternatives extremely extensively and came up with the question which, as I say, the Australian public has endorsed in the polls taken since that proposal was floated in the media and in the public generally.
Australians want a fair question, and that is what the committee has come up with. It is fair, and it is fairer than the question that is now being proposed by the government. In the last few hours or so, the government has floated an alternative question to be put to the Australian people at the referendum on 6 November. The differences between that question and the question proposed by the republic advisory committee are two, and they are important. For some reason, the Australian government is not prepared to place the word `Australian' before the word `president' in the proposal put to the Australian people. This process is all about having an Australian president at the end of the process. The fact that the Australian government is not prepared to put the word `Australian' before `president' in the proposal going to the public reflects very badly on the government and is also a further reflection of the trickery that the Prime Minister is prepared to indulge in in order to sabotage the republic push.
The other aspect that the government is insisting on putting in the referendum question is the reference to a president `appointed 
 by a two-thirds majority of the members of the Commonwealth parliament'. This is precisely the wording that the joint parliamentary committee found to be biased. This is precisely the wording which the committee in major part found reflected the unpopular aspect of the process while not fully reflecting the whole process. For that reason, the opposition thinks what we have today is another instance of the Prime Minister's trickery. But it comes as no surprise, because this is the Prime Minister who—by his own admission—does not want Australia to become a republic and who thinks talk of a republic is a waste of time. I drove from Melbourne to Canberra yesterday and, hour after hour for six or seven hours, I heard on the news grabs of the Prime Minister saying, `Whenever I get together with Mark Taylor, we don't talk about the republic. I don't waste time talking about the republic.' It is not a waste of time to talk about the republic. In fact, it is a reflection on the poor standard of commitment that this Prime Minister brings to the job that he thinks cricket is more important than the constitutional structures that he should be responsible for and should be promoting throughout the country.
It is a bad example for this country and for the children of this country to have the Prime Minister saying, `Look, let's talk about Shane Warne as a spinner, but don't get serious about what sort of structure we are living under.' And that is precisely what he was saying. It is a bad reflection on him, it diminishes the position of prime minister and it is also a bad example for Australia to have our Prime Minister say that discussion of the Constitution and of the republic is a waste of time. This statement belies the fact that the Prime Minister is a person who has taken every step along the way, through one act of trickery or another, to ensure that this proposal does not get up. He knows full well that for the proposal to have the maximum chance of succeeding, both sides of parliament need to be behind it. He plays a tricky game, saying on the one hand, `I don't have a position,' and on the other hand, `If it ain't broke, don't fix it.'
The Prime Minister knows full well that he is subverting the road to Australia becoming 
 a republic. He is doing it, and he knows full well that his colleague Mr Reith is also doing it. We have had enough of Peter Reith's indulgence in this debate. We know that he is no more than a monarchist in drag. We have seen his comments in the past; we have seen his more recent comments. We know that, when it comes to constitutional reform and the Constitution, he pays no respect to the processes and conventions. He would be the sort of person who would take us back to the damaging practices of 1975. For him to come out parading as a republican but proposing that we keep the Queen is something that has been too rich for the Australian public to cop.
This has been a useful process because in part it has driven the government to propose a new question for the referendum. But, as I said earlier, this question is also laden with trickery and is incomplete. We believe there should be reference to an Australian president. We also believe referring to a president `appointed by a two-thirds majority of the members of the Commonwealth parliament' is an unbalanced reflection of the process. In closing my contribution on the tabling of this report, I once again thank the chair and so many members of the government together with my colleagues and Senator Natasha Stott Despoja for the contribution they have made to ensuring that this process is fairer than it was at the start of the committee process.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>Report of Republic Referendum Committee</title>,Bills,16,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1999-08-09,"—I will begin where Senator Bolkus left off by commending the participation and contribution of all our colleagues on the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum. As Senator Payne pointed out, 18 members on a committee could potentially be quite unwieldy. Those who participated at varying stages throughout the process did so often with a passionate interest in the debate, but we tried to be fairly clear headed as we listened to the evidence provided. We also commend the chairman and the secretariat as well as the many witnesses who appeared before the committee and those people who provided written submissions to the joint select committee.
I rise to speak on the report, entitled Advisory report on: Constitutional Alteration (Establishment of Republic) 1999 Presidential Nominations Committee Bill 1999, as the Democrat spokesperson on republican issues and also as the sole member for the Democrats on this large committee. By and large, this report ensures that the legislation to come before this place and to go before the Australian people on 6 November will reflect the outcomes of the Constitutional Convention last year. Australians will have the opportunity to vote to become an Australian republic with a head of state who is chosen from among us for the first time in this nation's history. For more than a year, many of us have read headlines and various  polls that have predicted the demise of the referendum in November, predicated on assumptions of apathy within the Australian community on this issue. As part of the joint select committee on this legislation, we heard many submissions from Australians from all over—from regional and remote areas and from towns and urban centres—and the enthusiasm with which many greeted this legislation and the coming referendum gave lie to any reports that the Australian people are simply not interested in the republic issue.
Many witnesses who appeared before the committee were supportive of the legislation, although, I acknowledge, many improvements were suggested and many people expressed their support of the move to a republic per se. Like those witnesses, the Australian Democrats support the move to a republic with an Australian head of state and, like a number of witnesses before the committee, we do have some concerns with this legislation which we hope will be addressed.
I should acknowledge that the Democrats support—and I have put this in my dissenting report—a majority of recommendations that have come from the committee and, in particular, I commend the committee on recommending that, as per the Constitutional Convention's communique, there is reference given to or attention paid to ensuring diversity is included in the nomination process, that is, ensuring a diversity of views are involved in the nomination process. I certainly commend 
 the unanimous decision made by the committee in relation to the nomination process.
But the concerns of the Democrats, as outlined in my minority report, relate principally to the procedure for the dismissal of a President. While the Democrats do recognise the safeguards that are incorporated in this legislation by way of  requiring a Prime Minister who has dismissed a President to come before the House of Representatives to explain his or her actions within a 30-day period, the Australian Democrats believe that the protection afforded the President can and should be strengthened. The President of an Australian republic will be a unique figure—a constitutional umpire and symbolic head of state. The importance of such an office cannot be underestimated or, we believe, undermined.
The majority of the committee has acknowledged the risks of politically motivated or peremptory dismissal but concluded that public reaction to such dismissal combined with the requirement for House of Representatives ratification would presumably dissuade such action. This may prove to be the case, but the Democrats would prefer that those protections be stipulated and of course readily enforceable. As one witness, Professor Leslie Zines, stated to the committee:
After all, the head of state is supposed to be above us all and representing the community and a person who is neutral and not a protagonist and all that sort of thing. If you know anyone who can be dismissed instantly, and it says so in clear language—unlike the cover of the Crown where it is not so obvious—obviously it is going to affect, I think, the way the people see the person.
As constitutional umpire and symbolic head of state, the President of an Australian republic requires and deserves proper security of tenure. The Democrats proposal would ensure that he or she would be afforded similar protection to that extended to federal judges under section 72(ii) of the Constitution. A President would be able to be removed only on stated grounds of proven incapacity or misbehaviour and the dismissal would need to be ratified by a two-thirds majority of a joint sitting of federal parliament—that is, involving the Senate as well as the House of Representatives. This proposal also addresses our 
 deep concern about the exclusion of the Senate from the dismissal procedure.
At the 1998 Constitutional Convention, at which I was a delegate on behalf of the federal Australian Democrats, I moved a series of amendments to provide a role for the Senate in the dismissal process. This proposal was not a new one. The requirement that the dismissal of a President be ratified by a two-thirds majority of a joint sitting of federal parliament was recommended by the Republic Advisory Committee in 1994 and was actually a feature of the original Keating and Australian Republican Movement models.
Our proposal echoed the evidence of a number of witnesses before the committee including Professor Leslie Zines, Professor George Winterton, Sir Zelman Cowan, Harry Evans, Dr John Hirst, Ms Anne Winckel, Ms Linda Kirk, Dr John Uhr, George Williams and Professor Cheryl Saunders. In making these recommendations, the Democrats are very much aware of the divergence from the original Constitutional Convention communique or model but, as Dr John Hirst said in his evidence to the committee:
. . . I would guess there would not be 10 members of that convention that would support this dismissal procedure now.
The Democrats hope that the concerns of these legal and constitutional experts are taken into account when the legislation comes before this place for debate and of course amendment. Our proposal is to ensure that the head of state under this legislation receives the same protection from politically motivated or peremptory dismissal as that given to federal judges. We appeal to both the government and the opposition to consider such amendments when the legislation comes before us.
I would like to refer to two other matters. The first is an issue which has received considerable attention—that is, the long title of the bill, which will form the question on the ballot paper. In considering the evidence before the committee on this issue, the Democrats were keen to ensure that the long title most accurately reflected the constitutional change to be effected by the referendum, and even confirmed as of this morning the Demo 
 crats did believe and do believe that the wording suggested in this report best fulfils the goals of simplicity and accuracy. However, this afternoon I understand that the Prime Minister has come forward with a suggested form of words, and I will be discussing that issue with my colleagues. We will get together shortly to examine the new form of words proposed by the Prime Minister, and that will give us an opportunity to assess its worth. On the one hand, it is a recognition by the Prime Minister that the original wording needed to be changed. But we will assess the worth of his new proposal and comment.
The second issue relates to the education campaign to be undertaken by the government in the lead-up to the vote and to be conducted by the yes and the no committees. Evidence was received from witnesses around the nation on the complexity of the issues to be voted on and the difficulties, in particular, faced by regional or rural communities in accessing information about the campaign. The challenge facing the government and the two committees is to ensure that all Australians are given access to the relevant information on these issues well prior to referendum day so that they will have an informed vote.
My personal commitment to Australia becoming a republic is well known. As a committed republican and member of the yes committee, I look forward to 6 November and what I hope will be a vote by Australians for a system of government which will launch our second centenary of Federation as a truly independent and mature nation. I also look forward to a second Constitutional Convention to consider broader issues of constitutional reform, something that the Australian Democrats have long expressed a commitment to.

"Boswell, Sen Ronald",NP,1999-08-09,"—Before dinner we were debating the report of the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum. As a member of 
 that committee, I was very much surprised one night to turn the television on and hear that there was a unanimous report that the question be changed. I had spoken to the committee that day and advised them that I sought the right to put in a minority report. In fact, the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum produced five reports on the republic—the majority report and four dissenting reports, including my own. Any impartial observer would have to consider that the abundance of dissent on the proposed constitutional change does not augur well for the success of the referendum on 6 November.
I was given five minutes to speak. I think I can extend that a bit, but I have to confine my remarks. I emphasise that the committee was in no way united in proposing a different referendum question on the republic. Two of the dissenting reports representing three committee members opposed the majority's recommendation on the question to be put to the people. In some ways the Senate debating this referendum question at the moment will be bypassed by a decision by the cabinet and by the National and Liberal party rooms who have taken into consideration the views of the republicans and the views of other people such as the McGarvieists and all those people who are cobbled together to form the republican movement.
The Prime Minister has brought forward a question to ask the Australian people. The question is that the people of Australia are going to vote on an act to alter the Constitution to establish the Commonwealth of Australia as a republic with the Queen and the Governor-General being replaced by a President appointed by a two-thirds majority of the members of the Commonwealth parliament. I see that as being absolutely fair. The Prime Minister has decided to listen to the other side of the debate and put to the people a question that they believe is fairer and describes the vote in a certain way.
It is no good telling the people an untruth. If people vote for a republic they are going to get a republic with a head of state that two-thirds of parliamentarians will elect. It is no good trying to hide that. It is no good trying 
 to disguise it. It is a fact of life. That is what the Constitutional Convention came up with when there were three warring factions of the republican sector. There were the McGarvieists, the Turnbullists and then there were those for a publicly elected President. The question that was proposed by the three sectors and supported by the Constitutional Convention was very clear: if you want a republic you accept that two-thirds of the parliament will elect the President.
Tonight I heard Senator Bolkus describing the Prime Minister as unfair. I cannot think of anything fairer than what the Prime Minister has done. He has accepted the question and amalgamated the question to cover the proponents of the republic and the proponents against a republic. It is no good going out there and saying that the Prime Minister is unreasonable. The Prime Minister has a position, as does Senator Bolkus, as do I. Those propositions have been recognised in the question, but do not attack the Prime Minister or anyone else who does not support a change to a republic, because the question is honest, it is frank and it is accurate.
As Leader of the National Party of Australia in the Senate, I support the existing question. I support the government's position to alter the question to pick up both sides of the debate. I think it is a defining characteristic of the constitutional change being proposed. It goes to the heart of what the delegates at the Constitutional Convention decided to put to the Australian people. It describes what kind of a republic Australians are going to get. Not to have in the question the fact that the President will be appointed by a two-thirds majority of the members of the Commonwealth parliament is not telling the people the accurate way that a President will be elected. I think it would be plainly dishonest not to include that in the question. (Extension of time granted)
As I say in my report, describing the republic model as one which replaces the Queen and the Governor-General with a President is like describing your car as having four wheels. We all know a car has four wheels and we all know that a republic does not have a Queen and it does not have a Governor- 
 General. If you do not include that part of the question, it tells you very little about the republic.
The committee's majority recommendation of the wording of the referendum tells you very little about the nature of the republic. Many Australians hold strong views about methods of selecting a President, and they have the democratic right to know exactly what they are voting for or what they are voting against. As legislators, it is our duty to ensure that the question faithfully represents the nature of the proposed constitutional changes.
I would like briefly to mention one other aspect—that is, membership of the Commonwealth of Nations. Australia would not automatically continue as a member of the Commonwealth, and any other Commonwealth country could veto our readmission.
—Garbage! What a red herring! Why don't you tell the truth?
—I am going to tell the truth. As a matter of fact, I am going to seek leave to table the document. The Secretary-General must gain the concurrence of every Commonwealth country to readmit Australia. While this may be a formality, it is not automatic, a point which is not picked up in the majority report. I seek leave to table correspondence between Professor David Flint from Australia for a Constitutional Monarchy and the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth of Nations on this matter.
Leave granted.

It is significant because this bill, on which we are commencing the second reading debate this evening, was first put on the Notice Paper  at the beginning of this year. Indeed, late last year, the members of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs Legislation Committee were told that this legislation was so vital and so important that it needed to be debated and passed within the first week or two of this year's sittings. Because of that urgency, the committee had to consider the legislation and report by the first week of the 1999 sittings—that is, the sittings that commenced in February this year.
So the committee dutifully did that, notwithstanding the fact that it meant that the committee's deliberations had to be done over the Christmas-New Year period and that we had to truncate the public hearings  to ensure that we could meet the timetable set by the government and by the Senate and notwithstanding that this was a piece of legislation that had extremely wide interest right across the community, particularly in regard to those areas where the logging of forests takes place.
We met the timetable set by the government and we brought our report in. There was, of course, a majority report by the government which said the bill should be passed unamended. There was a minority report by the Labor opposition which indicated that there should be some significant amendments made to the legislation. No doubt we will get on to those in the committee stage of the debate this week. There were also reports from the Democrats and the Greens.
That was back in February that we were set to debate this legislation. Since then, despite the legislation being on the program virtually every week and despite the fact that I have had this speech prepared and in the top drawer, what has happened? The government, at every opportunity that they had to bring this bill on, baulked. They refused to bring it on for debate, notwithstanding the importance of this legislation to the completion of the RFA process whereby all regional forest agreements are due to be completed by the end of this year.
Why has the government procrastinated and delayed? We have seen clearly the evidence, and it has been because of the incompetence of the Minister for Forestry and Conservation in this government, the Hon. Wilson Tuckey. The minister huffs and puffs and has spent most of this year roaming around the countryside making outrageous threats against state governments, against the ALP and against the Senate. Indeed, we have again recently seen the abuse that he hurls and the threats he has made against his own coalition colleagues in the state of Western Australia.
Let me quote what Minister Tuckey has said recently, in the last couple of days. This was an interview that was replayed on PM after the introduction by Mr Mark Colvin, the presenter, who said:
Australia is at war this evening, though not a shot has been fired. It's a civil war between Federal and State Governments, and the declaration came from the Federal Forests Minister, Wilson Tuckey.
Mr Tuckey was quoted as saying:
I got preliminary advice from other sources and, in fact, I've spent three hours on the phone. I got up at 3 o'clock in the morning in Helsinki to talk to people at the appropriate time here, and as I told them, if you proceed with this I quoted some words from Phantom of the Opera : `There will be war between us'. And that's where I stand on it.
That is what he said in respect of the decision taken by the Western Australian government.
—Ironbar.
—This is Ironbar Tuckey; this is Chainsaw Tuckey. That is what he said in regard to Premier Court and his government when they recently made a decision to revise the RFA that they had 
 entered into with Minister Tuckey to, in effect, phase out logging in certain old-growth native forests by the year 2003. But, of course, not everybody takes Minister Tuckey's threats and outbursts seriously. We have learned to live with them on this side of the chamber because we know that it is all bluff and bluster and hollow threats, notwithstanding some form, which I will not go into, from the past. Even the Western Australian government are now learning that they cannot always take Wilson Tuckey's outbursts and threats seriously because, on the same PM  program last Friday, 6 August, the response from the state Western Australian Minister for the Environment, Cheryl Edwardes, to Mr Tuckey was:
Well I think perhaps that is just Mr Tuckey talking, and we are really not interested in a fight with the government. The message we got very clearly from the local councils and the community yesterday was a positive one. They want proactive action in reinforcing and attracting investment to those communities for alternative employment opportunities and that is what we are about.
The interviewer, Joe Pritchard, asked:
Wilson Tuckey has said this is war between the federal leaders and the state leaders. Is it war?
Cheryl Edwardes replied:
Well we are not interested in a fight with the government, the federal government. We are more interested in getting on and helping those south-west communities.
Joe Pritchard:
Isn't Mr Tuckey being unhelpful by stirring up so much emotion?
Cheryl Edwardes:
Oh well, look, I think it is just Mr Tuckey talking.
We have a major problem developing in the forest debate in this country, and it is one that we on the opposition side are sad to see occur. We all know, irrespective of our particular political point of view, that the forest debate has been a heated debate for many years.
It is not an easy issue to resolve. Indeed, when we were in government we saw, assembled around this parliament, the trucks of the loggers blockading this parliament. We have seen time and again over the years this debate degenerate into slanging matches between 
 representatives of industry, no doubt properly concerned about the future of their industry and the jobs of their employees, and the equally strong views held on the environmentalist side. It has never been an easy debate to try to stand in the middle of and resolve, but when we were in government we, with the cooperation of all the states, established a process for the development of regional forest agreements.
Unfortunately, with the current federal minister, who has now been in that position since October last year—pretty close to 12 months in that portfolio—what have we seen? We have seen the debate become divisive again. It has even got to the extent that it is divisive within his own party. We have declarations of war between a Liberal federal minister and a Liberal Premier and a Liberal government in Western Australia. That is the level that the debate has degenerated to.
And what have we seen in terms of results in that period? Not one RFA finalised since this minister has been in the position, except for the RFA that was negotiated in Western Australia and has since been revised by the Western Australian government itself. Yet this minister was put in charge of this portfolio  specifically to get this process completed within the time frame set down: that is, by the end of this year.
That is the background against which this legislation now comes before the Senate. This is legislation that this minister has said, if it is amended by the Senate, he would prefer to withdraw rather than accept any amendments to it—once again, another threat. The problem is that, whether or not one regards Mr Tuckey's performance as being over the top, or whether he thinks he is funny and witty or making threats that he can carry out, or whether other people think they are threats that are hollow or that he is merely all bluff and bluster and talk, at the end of the day it does not really matter. What matters is that the proper process for negotiating RFAs is being undermined by the actions of an irresponsible, out of control minister, and the sooner the Prime Minister does something about it and him, the better.
I want to turn to the legislation and specifically to the proposals that the opposition will be bringing before the chamber in the committee stage. As we have said in our report of the Senate committee, the opposition supports the RFA process. That is a process that was developed under the previous Labor government and one which can deliver satisfactory, balanced outcomes for the competing interests within this industry. The process, of course, has its genesis in the National Forests Policy statement, and there are 11 goals of the National Forests Policy statement. I want to quote firstly the introductory paragraph, because it is important to bear it in mind when considering this legislation. This is what the National Forests Policy statement said:
The Governments agree that, to achieve their vision for the forest estate and to ensure that the community obtains a balanced returned from all forest uses, eleven broad national goals must be pursued. These goals should be pursued within a regionally based planning framework that integrates environmental and commercial objectives so that, as far as possible, provision is made for all forest values. The eleven broad national goals are as follows:—
and they are set out under the headings `Conservation', `Wood production and industry development', `Integrated and coordinated decision making and management', `Private native forests', `Plantations', `Water supply and catchment management', `Tourism and other economic and social opportunities', `Employment, workforce education and training', `Public awareness, education and involvement', `Research and development' and, finally, `International responsibilities'.
The first two of those goals, particularly conservation and wood production and industry development, are particularly critical. It is the RFA process which seeks to achieve the balance between, on the one hand, conservation and, on the other hand, wood production and industry development. The RFA process is about achieving these goals through proper scientific analysis and through assessment and negotiation with all the relevant stakeholders.
The problem, of course, is that some participants in the debate do not really believe in finding a balanced outcome between conservation on the one hand and resource security on the other. We reject that extreme position, 
 whether it comes from those whom Senator Brown represents—and he has stood in this chamber and has attacked the position of the Labor Party, claiming that it is a sell-out to the woodchip companies, a claim which is totally erroneous and grossly unfair—or whether it comes from the other side, from Minister Wilson Tuckey, who is unashamedly pro-logging to the point of irresponsibility.
For instance, Minister Wilson Tuckey is on record as claiming that the commitment to protecting 60 per cent of old-growth forests under the JANIS criteria was only ever a target: it was never a firm commitment and was not something that he saw really ever had to be achieved. I know that he said that, because I heard him say it at the ABARE Outlook conference earlier this year in Canberra. Yet, if you look at the JANIS criteria, they clearly spell out that at least 60 per cent of old-growth forests will be protected—and, indeed, that figure can be expected to increase as plantations are developed into the future.
I have already referred earlier to the minister's attacks and criticisms of the states, such as the attacks he has made upon the New South Wales state government and the agreements they have negotiated on the North Coast forests, and his threats to withhold funding from the states—particularly from the state of New South Wales, because it happened to be a Labor state and he happens not really to agree with the politics of the Labor government. Consequently, not long before the state election, he was threatening to withhold the funding for the properly negotiated agreements in that state.
Of course, what happened? His threats were rejected. Indeed, even his own people and supporters within the coalition have rejected his views in that state, and the agreements reached between the New South Wales government and the industry have been strongly supported across the political spectrum.
In turning specifically to the amendments that the Labor Party will be seeking to move in the committee stage—we will be making some extensive comments in regard to them at that point in time—I particularly want to make some brief comments about some of the 
 key amendments. We propose to insert an objects clause. That clause will reflect the provisions of the national forest policy statement. We propose to insert a provision whereby a wood and  paper industry council would be established under legislation. This was a commitment made by and included within the wood and paper industry strategy and, indeed, was one which was carried on until this government came into office after the 1996 election and John Moore abolished the council.
But the most important amendment—which will no doubt be the subject of debate in the chamber—is our proposal whereby regional forest agreements would be subject to further parliamentary scrutiny by the federal parliament before they are given the final approval. We propose a system whereby RFAs, once in a draft proposal form, would be tabled in the parliament by the minister. A period of 15 sitting days would then be available during which a resolution disapproving of an RFA may be passed. If no such resolution is passed within the specified time, then the RFA would become operative.
There has been a lot of misinformation and scaremongering about this proposal. I want to make it very clear why we put it forward. Firstly, whilst the process of negotiating RFAs is the correct one, it is clear that not all of the stakeholders come to that process with clean hands and with a desire to bring about a balanced solution in accordance with the objectives of the national forest policy statement. You do not need any further proof of that than seeing what is happening in this debate in Western Australia at the moment. The situation is that an RFA was entered into between the state government and the federal minister. Within a matter of a couple of weeks the state government, because of the public clamouring and outcry, as well as the internal objection within that government to the provisions of that RFA, amended it. And so we have the minister saying that he is not going to accept it. That is a substantial reason for such an RFA to be subject to the final scrutiny of this parliament in an expeditious and timely manner.
It is certainly incumbent upon this parliament, when we will be giving future RFAs resource security for the next 20 years and committing in excess of $100 million of taxpayers' funds in industry support and restructuring, to have the final opportunity to scrutinise any RFA negotiated between the executive of the federal government and a state government. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-08-09,"—I rise to make the initial contribution for the Australian Democrats on this piece of legislation, the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998 , which is a very important piece of legislation dealing with a very crucial issue. I do so as the Democrats' environment spokesperson. The second reading stage of the debate will be closed by my new colleague Senator Brian Greig, who has primary carriage of this bill as the spokesperson on forestry issues.
Firstly, I would particularly like to reinforce my agreement to, and support for, Senator Forshaw's comments about the completely farcical committee inquiry process and the totally inadequate time frame that was forced upon the committee to inquire into this piece of legislation. I think it did the Senate's reputation no good at all to have such an important issue dealt with in such a incredibly truncated time frame. As Senator Forshaw highlighted, the great shame was that the committee was forced to go through that process in such a ridiculously fast time frame—I think back in February—and yet here we are, six months later, finally getting around to debating the legislation. I urge the Senate as a whole to consider more wisely in future the timetable it sets for legislation. I think that is a particularly extreme case of a major problem, but it is not an isolated case either. Another aspect of Senator Forshaw's comments that bears agreement is his reflection on the inadequate performance of the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, Mr Tuckey. I think, if anything, he has done more to move this issue in a backwards direction than anything else.
This regional forest agreement legislation as it stands risks legitimising, for an extraordinary period with extraordinary protection from 
 review or challenge, the claims of one set of sectional interests to the detriment of other sections of the industry, the government's employment and regional development objectives, Australia's international obligations and the broader interests of the community. It will facilitate the destruction of areas of unique environmental significance, and it will do so permanently and needlessly.
The Democrats' particular concerns with the regional forest agreement process as it has occurred and the legislation can be summarised as follows. The RFA process as it has occurred fails to resolve one of the most long running and contentious issues to face the nation. It fails to deliver on jobs for impoverished and vulnerable rural areas. It unfairly discriminates against the plantation industry. It will destroy many areas of native forest, including old-growth areas. It fails to protect Australia's biodiversity, contrary to an international agreement. It discriminates unfairly against other important cultural values and social and economic benefits provided for by native forest areas. It will be mostly controlled by state governments which have vested or financial short-term interests in the outcomes, thereby leading to positions of conflict of interest. It raises constitutional issues and imposes potential legal and financial difficulties on the Commonwealth and the taxpayer. The Democrats argue that this bill legitimates a process which has been unscientific, uneconomic, illogical and immoral. We are totally opposed to this bill.
The future of Australia's forests has unfortunately become a contentious and highly divisive issue. Hundreds of thousands of people have marched in the streets, taken part in protests in the forests themselves, written letters or directly participated in public interest or industry organised groups about the issue. There have been blockades and sometimes violent confrontations in forests in several states and even a blockade of federal parliament. Successive governments—both state and federal—have tried a variety of means to satisfy competing interests and Australia's obligations under international treaties. The regional forest agreement process 
 was supposed to bring an end to the divisiveness and conflict.
The Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee inquiring into the bill—and I attended one of the two brief committee hearings as part of that process and examined many of the submissions—heard allegations that agreements had been reached on highly unscientific grounds in bureaucratic secrecy without equal opportunity for all stakeholders to be represented, that lobbying had changed reserved areas that were supposedly set in stone and that biodiversity and conservation needs had been met with `loggers' scraps and slivers'. Even if only some of these allegations are true, the bill will set such flawed agreements in place for a considerable period and place them far beyond challenge or amendment. It is hard to see how this will reduce conflict over Australia's forests.
The motivation behind this bill—which is quite a slim bill—seems to be solely for the Commonwealth to abdicate its environmental responsibilities and legal powers to the states. The bill removes hard fought for community and environmental safeguards, favours the  declining sector of the industry at the expense of the growing sector of the industry, and offers selective compensation as a means to put the schemes beyond the reach of further consideration or challenge.
The Democrats are concerned that the perception that one interest has achieved an officially sanctioned game, set and match with this legislation will exacerbate rather than resolve community conflict. Indeed, the implied lack of productive outlets for expressing widespread community disquiet over woodchipping operations in old growth forests in particular may mean that protest assumes a more extreme and confrontational aspect than has been the case to date. We only need to look—as Senator Forshaw has alluded in his contribution—to the immense community disquiet in Western Australia over the inadequacy of the process.
Speaking as a Queenslander with an RFA that has been under negotiation for some time, it clearly seems to be taking a turn for the worse and there is great concern in terms of 
 where it might be heading. Apart from my concern about where the agreement may end up, I am certainly also concerned about what that may mean in terms of the community protests that it will engender and the increasing community disquiet and confrontation that will occur in Queensland and in south-east Queensland where I am from. I very much hope that we can avoid going down that unnecessary path.
Of course, the question of RFAs is so vexed that even Australia's larger political parties have found it difficult to come anywhere near consensus on this issue. The National Party, the Liberal Party and the Labor Party have all had public stoushes between branches, state and central bodies on the issue, with brawls sometimes becoming major news. As the legislation comes into the Senate and finally starts being debated, it is quite clear that those brawls are continuing. It will be interesting to view the careful speeches and delicate positioning of individuals who are going to have to justify themselves before their caucus, their states, their factions, their branches and their electorates as this legislation progresses. Of course, the final vote in the chamber is what counts, and it is clear that some would prefer the legislation to be started all over again—or to be thrown out all together—and that others do not agree with particular aspects of RFAs and will be voting against their own judgments.
It has also become obvious that many politicians are so confused over the massive amount of sometimes quite emotive information coming from either side and the passionate nature of the issue that they have taken the easy option of believing that you just cannot win on forests, that there is no outcome which will satisfy anybody and that the only way to deal with the dreaded `f' word is to hush it up and weld in legislation that will push the issue aside for many years to come. It was clear from the submissions to the legislative committee that examined the bill that the range of people unhappy with the RFAs will not give up and will keep making this an issue, even if this attempt to lock the forests out of the legislative protection at the federal level does actually pass this chamber.
The Democrats predict that the issue will remain a bleeding sore for major parties and individuals in those parties while ever the industry remains unsustainable, while people are not offered meaningful and continuing work and while native forests are logged for woodchips. The RFAs lock in those concerns, so it is logical to assume that the community will continue to be unhappy with their elected and aspiring representatives.
The Democrats feel that the only basis for greater community consensus on this issue lies with an open process based on more equal inputs from stakeholders, undistorted scientific and economic assessment and community education. Compensation may well be part of a long-term solution to the vexed question of access to Australian forests. However, it should be focused on assistance to affected communities rather than being—as the RFAs risk implying—a handout to companies, pork barrel for some electorates or a threatened big stick to ward off any community efforts to rearrange or alter agreements.
Yet the reason that the regional forest legislation has been put before the Senate is to provide a so-called resolution to forest issues. It is clear that this process has failed that test, and voting for this legislation will continue such conflict in the Australian community. This reason alone—among many others—is sufficient to throw this legislation out.
This piece of legislation comes with an explanatory memorandum which contains assertions that in the Democrats' view are simply not correct. I would like to focus on two of them. The first is in the general outline of the explanatory memorandum:
RFAs are the central focus of a package of measures designed to implement the National Forest Policy Statement (adopted by the Commonwealth and all State and Territory Governments) in relation to native forests.
There are some simple tests to see if this statement is accurate, and I will highlight just a few. The National Forest Policy Statement provides for the development of Australia's plantation industry. Does this bill—and the RFA process that it seeks to legitimise—in any way assist the development of Australia's 
 plantation industry? It does not. The National Forest Policy Statement provides for a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system. Does the RFA bill or the RFA process guarantee that? It clearly does not. Again, I only need to point to south-east Queensland in my own state where the clearing that has already occurred puts the land there beyond what is already an inadequate and representative reserve system. Yet the industry—and certainly Minister Tuckey—is proposing that significant areas of the already inadequate remnants of native forests be further cleared.
The National Forest Policy Statement allows for areas where comprehensive, representative and adequate systems are in place. Approvals for exports of woodchips for periods longer than one year assume the Commonwealth will be able to meet its obligations under section 30 of the Australian Heritage Commission Act. The question is: will the Commonwealth meet those obligations? The answer clearly is no. Clause 5, subsection (3) provides that, for areas under an RFA, section 30 of the Australian Heritage Commission Act must be disregarded. Again under  the comprehensive, representative and adequate reserve system a set of nationally agreed criteria—the JANIS criteria—were established. Do the RFAs meet those criteria? Let us have a look at a couple of examples.
A benchmark of 15 per cent of the pre-1750 distribution of each forest community was to be protected within conservation reserves, yet this criterion has clearly not been met. Another benchmark is the retention in reserves of at least 60 per cent of existing old growth, increasing up to 100 per cent for rare forest community old growth. Is that criterion met? Again, the answer is no. While on the old growth issue, this bill and the explanatory memorandum and the RFAs claim to be about ecologically sustainable development. It is patently clear that it is not possible to sustainably log old-growth forest. This fact was even recognised by that well-known left-wing, pinko, feral greenie organisation, the Resource Assessment Commission. Just going back to the JANIS criteria, another criterion is the protection of 90 per cent or more, 
 wherever practicable, of high quality wilderness. This is another criterion that is not met.
The second falsehood in the explanatory memorandum which needs highlighting will be more fully explored by my colleague Senator Andrew Murray—it deals with financial issues which is a specialty of Senator Murray's—but is worthy of mention here. That is that the RFA has no direct financial implications. It is beyond belief that any responsible government would seek to put out such a statement about a bill before the house of review, which this chamber is, and expect to get away with it.
This bill sets up provision for massive compensation payouts to the states with a blank cheque, and the government wants the Senate to sign it—a blank cheque for about 20 years. Putting aside any environmental or social arguments about the RFA process, this simple fact alone should be enough for the Senate to force the government to suspend the legislation until it can absolutely quantify the amount of compensation the public purse may be eligible for in the future.
I would like to emphasise briefly the situation facing the forests of south-east Queensland, the area that I represent. The fate of south-east Queensland forests, in part, may be decided by the future of this legislation. As a Democrat I was heavily involved during the last state election in Queensland in the discussions with all parties about what their commitments would be on environmental issues, particularly relating to land clearing, which is a vital issue in Queensland, and the future of the forests. Clearly, the preference decisions of many Democrat voters were quite crucial to the Labor Party eventually winning government by an extremely narrow margin, as everybody knows.
I am sure they were influenced in part by the commitments that the ALP made in relation to the future of the native forests. I call on Premier Beattie to stick to his election commitment to move logging out of native forests as a matter of urgency. Queensland forests are already the least protected of any in Australia and yet they contain the highest levels of biodiversity. Fifty-five per cent of native forests in south-east Queensland have 
 been cleared since the middle of last century. In an open letter printed in the Courier-Mail recently a range of individuals and organisations, including the Queensland division of the Australian Democrats, urged Premier Beattie to protect the native forests of south-east Queensland, pointing out such facts that scientific studies have found only 2.7 per cent of native forests in south-east Queensland are clearly identified as old growth.
South-east Queensland has the smallest percentage of forests protected in national parks and other reserves of any forested region in Australia. An expanded parks system must protect high quality habitat for forest animals and include all high conservation value forests such as Mapleton, Bellthorpe, the Conondales, Mt Mee, Tewantin and many more. South-east Queensland already has plantations providing 73 per cent of all sawlogs produced in the region. Establishing additional plantations on already cleared land will help Australia meet its obligations in dealing with the greenhouse effect and assist in a speedy transition to plantation timber production.
Polling conducted as part of the forest agreement process has indicated that 83 per cent of people in south-east Queensland do not want logging continued in our native forests and yet that is specifically the agenda that Minister Tuckey, in particular, has tried to impose on the negotiation process for the RFA in south-east Queensland. That process had for some time been proceeding in a constructive fashion between timber industry representatives and conservationists, particularly the Rainforest Conservation Society, but it was obviously a process of great concern to Minister Tuckey. He clearly put in a lot of effort to destroy that constructive working relationship and to ensure that protection of Queensland's native forests was not going to be an end outcome on the negotiation.
South-east Queensland is an area of approximately 2.7 million hectares and is the home of some of the most biologically rich and unique forests in Australia. Tall eucalypt forests dominated by blackbutt and tallowwood rise above the ridge lines of the great divide and the coastal ranges. Amongst the 
 gullies and ravines there are precious remnants of the once extensive subtropical rainforest that dominated the landscape of south-east Queensland for thousands of years. These forests are of enormous significance to the region's traditional owners. Together with northern New South Wales, these forests include the last global stronghold of subtropical rainforests and contain at least 284 plant and animal species that are found nowhere else on the planet.
Once extensive in south-east Queensland, these forests have been fragmented and isolated by repeated unsustainable logging and clearing. The unsustainable activities of the native forest timber industry in south-east Queensland have led to a wood supply crisis. Having decimated the extensive stands of red cedar, hoop and bunya pines, the native forest industry has now nearly exhausted the available sawlog supplies of eucalypt species such as blackbutt.
Unsustainable logging and clearing has left a legacy of denuded river valleys and isolated pockets of undisturbed old-growth and wilderness forests. It is a matter of great concern to me and, as I just pointed out, a significant majority of Queenslanders that these forest remnants are now under great threat with the RFA that is being considered at the moment in south-east Queensland. I again urge the state Labor government there to ensure that their pre-election commitments are met.
The bill that we have started to debate today is crucial in terms of how it increases the threat to those forests around Australia that are subject to RFAs. In terms of my own region of Queensland, I urge the Senate not to further increase the risk and threat to those valuable forests. I also urge the Senate to explore another route to phasing out logging in old-growth forests as quickly as possible rather than locking in financial protection for woodchippers and loggers at the expense of the very important and fundamental scientific and ecological criteria that were meant to be at the foundation of the RFA process.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,1999-08-09,"—What can I say? Although I come into this place to make a contribution in regard to this legislation, one would think that I might 
 also be able to say, after so many years of debate on this issue, that we are actually heading somewhere. Who would have thought that, after some 15 years, we would still be heading nowhere and that this particular process would be in just as big a mess—if not a bigger mess—today as it was 15 years ago? In looking at the Regional Forest Agreement legislation and the purpose for which it is intended, we firstly probably have to look at the Regional Forest Agreement process, the processes prior to that that actually brought regional forest agreements about and why those processes were put in place.
We know that the forestry debate raged for many years in this country and led to a process being introduced by the Commonwealth government known as the National Forest Policy Statement, which was the forerunner and mechanism through which Regional Forest Agreements would be developed. Part of that process, of course, was that we would see an end to the conflict in the forests and have an agreed process for the assessment of forests and ecosystems that were worthy of protection and, indeed, warranted protection, as necessary for the wellbeing of this country and its forests in the longer term and, hopefully, forever. Secondly, that process was to provide some surety and security for the people involved in the commercial aspect of forestry. We started off, I think, with very good will and intent but, as I said, here we are now debating resource security legislation and I have to say that, as a process, it has succeeded in doing neither of the things that I just mentioned.
It has failed to determine the environmental debate in regard to what forests shall be available, which shall not be available and which shall be protected. More importantly—particularly from my point of view—I think the Regional Forest Agreements that were supposed to provide security for workers in this industry are not going to give that security. Indeed, where Regional Forest Agreements exist today, those workers do not have security—not one little bit of security. I suppose that we have provided some security for some of the major companies involved in the industry, particularly for the export 
 woodchippers. We have provided circumstances where they can enter into what are known as `wood supply agreements' that can last for many years, but what have we done for workers? What is happening to the workers and contractors that those companies used to front the public profile and run the argument and the case for security for this industry? Most of them are losing their jobs.
Is the RFA system creating new jobs? Is it causing new investment in the industry? One has to say no, not really; it is not doing that. I know that in my state forestry is such an important industry from a commercial point of view. It is the second largest manufacturing employing industry in this state. It should be the largest, but it is not. It will not ever become that until such time as governments—and I do not care of what political persuasion—are actually prepared to take up the issue and deal with this on the basis that it ought to be dealt with.
Head west, and the Western Australia government signed a Regional Forest Agreement with the Commonwealth that was supposedly run through all the scientific processes to determine which forests would be preserved and conserved and which would not, so that the people within the industry—the workers and contractors; not the companies—would be able to at least have some idea of what the future might hold for them. But no—what does Mr Court do? He reverts to the old political game: forests and old-growth forests are a political issue. The green Liberals say that we must preserve more of the forests, so we throw out the Regional Forest Agreement, which is supposed to be based on sound scientific knowledge. I am not going to purport to be an expert in that respect, but that was the name of the game. They were the processes put in place and agreed to, and yet they get ratted on.
There is not a Regional Forest Agreement in this country, either existing or proposed, that is going to deliver any security to workers in this industry. That is a shame because they are the ones whom we ought to have some feeling for. Of course, we must take account of the very important environmental issues that are involved with making decisions 
 about which forests we are going to make available for commercial use. It is important that we make decisions based on sound science but also take account of the future of the forests of this country. What I cannot stand, and never will be able to stand, is the wanton waste that I see going on around this country in the commercial use of these forests.
As a nation, we ought to know that we have such great opportunities, particularly within the hardwood industry. We know that nations to our north and north-east have placed their hardwood forests under extreme pressure. Indeed, some of them have been virtually wiped out. We know that, in Papua New Guinea, the World Bank and the IMF have instructed the government that it has to change its practice with regard to its forests. Anyone who has been there would know. You can go through all of the Pacific nations and find the same problem. Although a small timber supplier in world terms, we at least had an opportunity to take some steps forward in this process. But what have we done? We have stuffed around with this issue for so long, vacillated and booted the political forestry football to and fro, that people are fundamentally fed up with the issue.
My prime concern has always been the workers in the industry and the opportunities that exist for states and this nation to proceed to have a better forest industry. I always thought governments ought to have played a positive role in industry development. We saw some aspects of that in the early days with regard to some industry plans that were developed by the former Labor government. In respect of forestry, I have to say, we did not do all that well. In my view, we used it wrongly as a political football for many years. We finally started to head in the right direction with regard to putting in place a process that was supposed to deliver outcomes—and I do not like to say this—for both views in respect of forests. As I said, it has failed, and it is going to continue to fail until such time as premiers, prime ministers and ministers responsible are able to put in place a process that will stick.
I have pursued the issue of forestry for a long time. Indeed, I have written to senators in this place from time to time about forestry related issues. As I said, I just cannot understand how we cannot get this right. It is not as though it is difficult. It just needs a little bit of initiative and willpower and some proactive efforts on the part of government. You can create a lot of jobs in this industry—and I speak from my own state's point of view more than any other because that is the state that I have the most experience with. We have recently had a review of segregation and utilisation practices in my state, and I am amazed at the fact that, despite the limited capacity of the reviewer and the fact that it was run at a time when forestry operations were basically at a standstill, that person developed a report that said that there were significant things wrong. We have had an industry growth plan proposed by the state authority, the Forestry Corporation of Tasmania.
By way of example, that industry growth plan proposed a certain number of things in terms of industry development, but primarily it proposed three laminated hardwood veneer lumber plants. Of course, people say, `That sounds like a reasonable idea.' Yes, it does, except that there is really not much market for hardwood LVL. Of course, if you ask any of the major consulting firms—that is, those that have any global experience—they will tell you that there is not a market because of the softwood competition and the fact that the market essentially requires softwood LVL. They will also advise you that to produce a new product and then put it into the marketplace could take as long as 10 years.
Of course, we have another aspect to the whole issue with regard to export woodchips. I listened to Senator Bartlett saying, `We want to stop the export of woodchips.' I do not disagree with that in respect of old-growth forests, but I say to Senator Bartlett, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that it is highly likely that those people exporting old-growth hardwood woodchips will stop themselves from that practice in terms of old-growth forests before we ever have any capacity at a governmental level, either state 
 or federal, to come to grips with the issue and how the problem should be addressed. The market for paper and the paper manufacturers of the world will demand, and indeed are demanding, that the fibre that is supplied to them be whiter and younger. I would suggest that within the next three years we will see a self-declared end to the exporting of old-growth hardwood woodchips.
With regard to this bill, the opposition has proposed some amendments, one of which I have had a fair bit to do with—that is, the one going to a wood and paper industry council being established. The simple reason for my wanting that put into this legislation is this: regional forest agreements have no real review mechanism. There is a five-yearly review—not annual, but five-yearly—but that will be conducted by the participants to the agreement and primarily by the state authority.
What are the mechanisms for us as a parliament to make an assessment of the outcomes? How do we measure whether or not the commitments given by the state and the RFA are being delivered? We cannot. If a state does not deliver on its commitments, there is no process by which the parliament can debate the issues. In fact, once an RFA is signed, a state, for all intents and purposes, can cut down all of the trees available in its commercial forest area and ship them out as logs—and there is nothing we can do about it. At least if we have in this process a wood and paper industry council, set up as proposed by the opposition, it will provide for one small mechanism whereby some people representing workers will be able to be in there arguing the case for greater industry development.
I notice that the government has proposed a late amendment that says it will `set up a forest products advisory council' and that it will be `constituted in accordance with the regulations'. Of course, the Governor-General may make regulations prescribing matters `(a) required or permitted by this act to be prescribed or (b) necessary or convenient to be prescribed' et cetera. With regard to the establishment of that council, it `provides for the establishment of a council to be known as 
 the forest products advisory council' and that `functions of the council in relation to the forest and wood sector are to be prescribed by regulations' and `the council is to be constituted in accordance with the regulations'.
We do not know what the regulations are. We do not even know whether workers will be represented on the council. On the record of the government, I have to say this: prior to the last election, you people gave a commitment to adhere to the national forest policy process, to adhere to the regional forest agreement process—and that included the establishment of a wood and paper industry council. It included a constitution for that council and, indeed, a membership list for that council.
But the government did not adhere to that; it set up a thing not dissimilar to what it is proposing to set up again. That particular forum established by the  government I think met only twice. You only have to see the circumstances with which we are now confronted to understand the worth of that forum—because we have gone nowhere. I have to say that I would have expected more; indeed, the government members on the committee that dealt with this legislation—and I do not want to misrepresent them—certainly agreed that we did not want to have another forum that was of no value.
That is why it is of fundamental importance that the amendment for the establishment of a wood and paper industry council be incorporated into this legislation and that there be a requirement at least that it then be included in regional forest agreements, both those already in existence and those yet to come. That will be the only way that workers and contractors, people who have bought plant and equipment in this industry, will have some hope of getting some equity into the process for themselves. That is what this was intended to do. I do not think anybody intended ever to give security to export woodchip companies. I think both Labor when last in government and the current government said that on many occasions. In fact, I can remember the current Prime Minister accusing the former Prime Minister of being the king woodchipper. I know who 
 is king of the woodchips, and it is certainly not Paul Keating. It is the Prime Minister, John Howard, who is king of the woodchips.
The existing minister for forests, try as he might, has not led this debate to where it ought to be going. I just hope that one day a government might be able to do that; I do not think this one will, and I am not quite sure whether we would.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-09,"—Once again I would like to commend Senator Murphy on his contribution. He comes at this debate from a different angle and certainly with differently weighted priorities from me. But his concern for the workers in this industry underlines everything he says, and his analysis of the failure of this industry to deliver when it comes to average Australians is absolutely spot-on.
If we take today as an average day of logging activities taking place in Australian native forests, 600 to 700 log trucks have taken logs out of this nation's native forests to woodchip mills. The vast majority, 80 to 90 per cent—up to 95 per cent in Tasmania—of those log trucks carting our native forest heritage out of those wild forests are going to export woodchip mills. From export woodchip mills, those forest products go through the paper process and end up largely on the rubbish dumps of the Northern Hemisphere, with a 1,000 per cent mark-up in the base product going to overseas interests.
There will be those who will talk about the importance of jobs in this industry, and I only wish the industry felt that was the case as well. Since the export woodchippers set up their mills, first at Eden on the South Coast of New South Wales—which is now the wholly Japanese owned Daishowa mill—and, shortly after, at Triabunna on the east coast of Tasmania, the industry has shed 20,000 jobs. This is largely due to the big corporations—operating overseas or out of the states in which the forests exist in the main—moving in to close down small operators, small sawmills, and bringing in technology which gets rid of workers in the bush where the little processing that remains occurs in Australia. They have got rid of workers both in processing and in transporting.
It pains me a lot to know that such workers are out around the parliament of Western Australia tonight—much the same as they were out around the parliament here a few short years ago—at the bidding of the woodchip corporations, the big city based operators that fund the Forest Protection Society and the other extensions of the woodchip industry. There is no security coming from those corporations for the very people who sit out there at night blockading parliament and, in the case of Canberra—I do not know about Western Australia—breaking the law with impunity, something which conservationists certainly do not get away with in the forests.
It needs to be said that the hypocrisy of this industry, crying crocodile tears over jobs, is one of the reasons why it has lost the public. In my home state of Tasmania, the Regional Forest Agreement was signed by the Prime Minister, John Howard, and by the then Liberal Premier of Tasmania, Tony Rundle, and it has been taken up with gusto by the now Labor Premier of Tasmania, Jim Bacon, who wanted to log even more of the forests. In the short time since that was signed—less than two years—we have seen the closure of the Burnie pulp mill, with a loss of 280 jobs last October, and 10 per cent of the big woodchipper North's work force axed, with another 31 jobs lost in May and the sacking of 33 workers—which is the entire work force, including the disabled work force—who were brought here to Canberra to campaign for logging in the Tarkine against so-called greenies. The lot of them have been closed down and sacked since the Regional Forest Agreement came in.
North then shed another 40 contractors' jobs in February. Sixteen jobs went in the shake-up at Australian Newsprint Mills down in the Derwent Valley in June. Ongoing insecurity in the pine sawmilling industry due to Forestry Tasmania's refusal to give Auspine and Wynwood secure contracts continues. There has been the temporary closure of the Burnie paper mill in June this year. There has been North's recent decision to sell its private forests and plantations and its decision the month before last to transfer nine information technology jobs from Tas 
 mania to Melbourne. Besides that, Boral, the other big private woodchipper, in May this year cut its work force by nine jobs.
Over 400 jobs have gone west in my little state since the Regional Forest Agreement was signed, yet we have these corporations that are interlinked through the National Forest Association crying crocodile tears in Western Australia and saying that the change to the Regional Forest Agreement is causing the loss of jobs. We have a mass manipulation going on there by these big corporations with the workers manipulated in the middle. I agree with Senator Murphy that it is time that the workers' interests were put at the forefront in this industry and the undue influence of these big corporations was expunged from the political decision making process.
I have only to reiterate to this chamber the major decision made by the last government after Senator Faulkner, as minister for the environment, made a very impressive stand for the wishes of most Australians that more forests be protected in this country. That was reversed under pressure. On the very day that the then forestry minister, Mr Beddall, issued licences to the woodchippers—21 December 1965 is the date, if I am not wrong; I will correct that if necessary—the biggest suite of woodchip donations went to the big parties in this parliament. That was not a coincidence. That is undue influence, and it is only the tip of the iceberg when one comes to analyse the power of these big corporations against not only the interests of the forests the people are concerned about but also the interests of their own workers. Their major interest is profit: downsizing, getting rid of jobs which cost money and putting that across into their profit line for the following year.
The big failure of this whole process and this legislation is to not look at the prudent and feasible alternative, which is the massive plantation establishment in this country, most of it paid for by taxpayers' money over the last 30 years. Those plantations are available. They are mature. They can provide all the wood requirements for this country, including the current export woodchip aliquot. You have mainly only softwood available but, as 
 far as our important interests are concerned—including structural timbers for building in this country—that is totally available from plantations. We do not need to be destroying our forests and, what is more, the plantation industry is at least involved in downstream processing. Outside this whole process, the good news for jobs in this country is the new mill at Tumut which is going to employ 1,000 workers in New South Wales and is totally based on plantations. That is happening at the same time as this crocodile tear shedding industry is putting hundreds of people out of work, RFA signed or not RFA signed, in the native forest industry.
What about the lost job opportunities? In my home state of Tasmania there are 18,000-plus jobs in tourism. Compare the 3,000 jobs that are dependent on forests and wilderness to the 2,400 jobs dependent on logging forests. These are on a collision course; you cannot have it both ways. The smaller the wild forest aliquot the less interest, the less international renown and the more people are going to go elsewhere. So we have a choice here: on the vertical, wild forests for the tourist and recreation industry, which is creating jobs, and they are good quality jobs; or, on the horizontal, forests on the back of a log truck going to a woodchip mill to be processed elsewhere in the world where jobs will be created while we lose jobs.
I am amazed that we are still having this debate in this place. Moreover, this legislation is a lay down misere for the woodchip industry. I am amazed that the Labor Party is going to support it, amendments or not. Let me look at the pivotal amendment of the Labor Party: it is that regional forest agreements ought to be vetted by parliament. I am sure One Nation is going to agree that it is not good enough for a Prime Minister and a Premier to sign an agreement outside this parliament and say that that is how a publicly owned resource is going to be worked for the next 20 years. Of course  parliament should be vetting those regional forest agreements. But due to internal pressures, including the enormous pressure of the Bacon Labor government in Tasmania on the Labor caucus, the notable exceptions in the Labor amendment are Tasmania and East 
 Gippsland in Victoria—the first RFAs that were signed. They are not to be brought before parliament. There is no way Labor can explain this inconsistency. That is why I will be moving an amendment to ensure that all regional forest agreements are brought before this duly elected parliament so that we can debate, analyse and give feedback as far as these regional forest agreements are concerned.
In particular, if there is one thing I take objection to in the provisions of this legislation it is section 7. It was the last section added to this legislation, and it is the section which says that in future any Commonwealth minister who acts to protect part of Australia's forest heritage makes the taxpayer liable to pay the woodchip corporations and the other logging corporations who will lose access to the destruction of those very forests as far as their profit making future is concerned. There is a compensation clause in this legislation added at the last minute under pressure of the woodchip corporations. But there is no compensation in here for workers who lose their jobs—none at all. Is Labor going to support my amendment that puts that to rights?
Why should we, as a parliament, be offering compensation to these big woodchip corporations, including internationally based corporations like Daishowa, but failing totally to even get reskilling for workers who lose their jobs because of the action of those very same corporations? It is totally wrong. This is, again, the parliament becoming involved in this manipulation by the woodchip corporations to their own interests. I foreshadow that I will move an amendment to remove that compensation clause. I challenge the Labor Party and the Democrats to back that. It is very important that we do not make the taxpayers of this country responsible for future moves by elected parliaments to protect the nation's heritage in the interests of future generations or even in the interests of more job rich alternative industries which depend on those forests.
In my home state there is an enormous amount of heritage at stake in this legislation. For 20 years this will give the logging indus 
 try based outside our state with boards of management meeting elsewhere, most of whom have never set foot in the wild forest we are concerned about, the power to determine what happens in those forests and it will strip the  federal authorities'—we, as elected parliamentarians—right to stand up for this nation's heritage. I noted the contribution by Senator Bartlett. I note that all nine Democrat members will be speaking in this second reading debate. I put this to the Democrats and I ask the two new ones to look to those who were here six weeks ago and ask this question: how could you, how could the Democrats, without exception pass the so-called environment protection bill—guillotine it so that it could not be debated properly, knock out the  amendments through that guillotine process and in so doing endorse this very legislation?
—Senator Brown, I think you should address the Chair.
—How could they, Acting Deputy President? They will need more than your protection before I am through in this debate, Acting Deputy President.
—Is that a threat, Senator Brown? Are you threatening the Chair?
—If you read it that way, it will not be the first mistake that has been made in this place.
Senator Sherry interjecting—
—And it will need more than Labor interjectors to come to the Democrats assistance on this. Just six weeks ago the Democrats passed, with the use of the guillotine, legislation which set in concrete the pivotal provision of this legislation which strips the Minister for the Environment and Heritage of the power to move to the protection of the forests and their wildlife wherever an RFA is in place. That includes endangered species. It overrides the endangered species provisions of that legislation. That involves half the species of this nation's plants and fauna. The legislation which the Democrats voted for in total says that a person may 
 undertake RFA forestry operations—that is, whole scale woodchipping—without approval of the minister if they are undertaken in accordance with a regional forest agreement.
I drew the attention of every Democrat to this provision back in June. But they voted for it, and the destruction of the forests from here on in is on their plate. It is their responsibility. They voted for it. To come in now and vote exactly the opposite way shows at best, if we are going to put a good spin on it, a complete confusion about their approach to forests. More than that, it shows a culpability. It shows a failure to carry through the rhetoric of so many years of forest protection, and that has just been exemplified by what Senator Bartlett had to say, which, no doubt, every Democrat in this debate is going to follow up with. I do not bring this matter up just as a political point score. I drew this to their attention before those votes were taken in June. They went ahead knowing what they were doing.
This is dastardly legislation. It is awesomely destructive legislation. This locks this nation in for 20 years to the ongoing destruction of our forests, our ecosystems and our wildlife against the wishes, as the opinion polls show, of 80 per cent plus of people right around this nation. This is a failure of the political process. This is a failure of the major parties. This is a tribute to political influence of the corporate sector, including multinational corporations. It lets down not only the environment but also the workers and tragically coopts them in the sort of event that is occurring in Perth tonight and which we saw around this parliament only a few years ago.
I put this on notice: those who think that this is the end of the fight to protect, amongst other things, the world's tallest hardwood forests and ancient living ecosystems in my home state of Tasmania and to prevent them being turned across to this evil system inherent in the regional forest agreements of logging, then fire bombing and then 1080 poisoning—a complete destruction of ecosystems as a presage to putting in quick profit making, genetically manipulated plantations—and those who think that the spirit of the people who oppose that is going to go away, 
 are very, very wrong indeed. If this legislation passes this Senate, and the signs are that it will, the fact that it is being sheeted home in the way it is will be on the heads of not only the government but also the Labor Party and the Democrats.
There will be a turnaround. It may be difficult to achieve. It may take a lot of turmoil, but it will come. Worst of all is that we should leave that simply to the marauding woodchippers to run out of profitability in the forests that they are destroying at the moment and say, `Well, this industry's come to the end of its life.' It should be transferred to a plantation basis now. It is a failure that, with the political system in this country, that is not the outcome we are voting for in this legislation. I move:

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-08-09,"—It is not coincidence that, when looking through the speakers list on this legislation, there are five senators from Tasmania of the 20 speakers listed who will make a contribution. As a senator from Tasmania, as indeed any of my colleagues know on all sides of the chamber, in Tasmania you cannot escape forestry as an issue.
I am pleased to have been in the chamber when Senator Brown made his contribution. Being from Tasmania, I am used to Senator Brown's gross exaggerations. His somewhat hysterical language, some of his use of terminology and some of the examples that he paints to this chamber about forestry in Tasmania are gross exaggerations. I will refer to some specific instances a little later in my contribution. Senator Brown has the habit, and we are used to it in Tasmania, of painting this as good versus evil, black versus white, tourism versus forestry. You can never have a happy compromise according to Senator Brown. As I said, I will refer to some issues that he has raised a little later.
I turn firstly to the origin of the legislation we are considering, the National Forest Policy 
 Statement 1992. The Commonwealth and the states and territories signed the National Forest Policy Statement. That statement outlined agreed objectives and policies for the future of Australia's public and private forests. It provided national goals in 11 areas. I will not go through those because time does not permit.
As provided for in the National Forest Policy Statement, a comprehensive regional assessment, known as a CRA—a joint assessment of all the forestry values by the Commonwealth and the state, an assessment of the environment, the heritage, the economic and the social implications—will lead to the establishment of a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system, agreements on forest management and the signing of regional forest agreements, known as RFAs. Where the CRAs are in place, approvals for the export of woodchips for periods longer than one year would be considered. The Commonwealth would be able to meet its legislative obligations under section 30 of the Australian Heritage Commission Act.
A regional forest agreement is an agreement about the long-term management and use of forests in a particular region between the Commonwealth and the state government. The purpose is to reduce the uncertainty—and I stress the word `reduce'—the duplication and the fragmentation in government decision making by producing a longstanding and durable agreement on the management and use of forests. It was in December 1994 that the then Prime Minister, Mr Keating, intervened to expedite the regional forest agreement process. He announced a strict timetable that would be developed for each agreement which would be developed on the basis of technical and scientific assessments of the values of all the forests.
In January 1997, the Commonwealth released details of the agreed criteria for the reserve system. There were three broad criteria of biodiversity for old-growth forests and wilderness: firstly, a benchmark of 15 per cent of the pre-1750s distribution of each forestry community to be protected within conservation reserves; secondly, retention in 
 reserves of at least 60 per cent of existing old growth, increasing up to 100 per cent for rare forestry and community old growth; and, finally, protection of 90 per cent or more, where practical, of high quality wilderness.
I think it is fair to say that, on reflection of forestry issues and the areas that should be logged and the manner in which those areas should be logged, over the last 20 years, the last couple of decades, Tasmania has been strongly divided about the way in which forest resources should be used and the way in which the environment should be protected. If we look at the process that I and others have outlined, it had its genesis in the so-called Salamanca agreement in Tasmania. This was an agreement between the various parties, including the environment movement, I might say, at that time and the then Labor government. I pay tribute to the contribution to that process by my state colleague David Llewellyn and the ongoing development and, I hope, finalisation of this process in the recently signed RFA in Tasmania by my colleague the Deputy Premier, Mr Paul Lennon.
Senator Brown would have us believe that every tree in every forest that is not in a plantation in Tasmania—and I will say something about plantations a little later—is going to be chopped down, ruthlessly ripped to pieces and exported as woodchips. That is the scenario that Senator Brown would paint, but that is very far from the truth, and I can speak with at least some knowledge of the situation in Tasmania.
In my home state, the outcome of the RFA process has been that the total area of Tasmania now within reserves is 2.7 million hectares, or 40 per cent of Tasmania's total land area. As a result of the RFA process, an additional 396,000 hectares of public land reserved, based on the CAR criteria, was placed into those reserves, thus expanding the amount of public land within reserves by an additional 17 per cent. Some 95 per cent of high quality wilderness areas are now included within the CAR reserve system in my home state of Tasmania.
I would contend you can have it both ways. You can have a world-class forestry reserve, 
 a national park or a world heritage wilderness area in this country as well as have certain areas set aside for the use of logging. You can have both. Obviously there is an associated and very important spin-off in terms of tourism in those world heritage and national park areas, and we have that in Tasmania.
Senator Brown would contend that the big corporations have moved in—they were his words—that they have closed in on the small operators and that the major parties are doing the bidding of the woodchip operators. He would argue that there should not be any woodchip exports. It is on that last point that there would be some common ground between Senator Brown and me.
I would fervently hope that we were not exporting woodchips from this country. I would hope that we would maximise the value adding of those woodchips in Australia. But, of course, what is the position of some of the environment movement at least? It is to oppose—at least at the present time—the only practical way of converting those woodchips into pulp or paper products in this country, and that was well demonstrated by their attitude to the proposed pulp and paper mill development at Wesley Vale in my home state of Tasmania.
Some in the environmental movement want it both ways. They argue no logging of native forests, convert over to plantations tomorrow and no woodchips and do it tomorrow. That is simply not possible and not practical. If we were to adopt that as an approach, we would shut down the entire forest industry in Australia overnight. The social and economic outcomes of that would be catastrophic in terms of not just the jobs lost in regional economies, I might say, not in the big cities, but the tens of thousands of jobs lost in Australia, not to mention the thousands of jobs lost in Tasmania, my home state, which has a very significant unemployment rate.
What is often lost in this debate is that forestry and the downstream processing of forestry is a major regional employer in this country. It is all very well for Senator Brown to say that the big corporations have moved in and are reducing labour and reducing employment—I accept that total employment 
 levels have dropped in most areas of the forest industries as a result of technology—but Senator Brown's solution is to wipe the industry out overnight, to not have the industry at all. He wants to get rid of all the jobs and get rid of all the value adding because the jobs in the forest industries have been slowly reduced. He in fact proposes an accelerated process to deal with what he considers to be the problem. Of course, forestry is no different from most other manufacturing processes in this country with the advent of technology.
I was disappointed that Senator Brown used, as an example of the decline in jobs, the manufacturing operation at Somerset, where there are a number of disabled workers. I make particular comment about this because the closure of that operation in Somerset had absolutely nothing to do with disputes about access to forestry resources. As I understand it, it was something to do with the alleged poor management of the operation at the time. It had absolutely nothing to do with the RFA or access to forestry products. He makes mention of those disabled workers at Somerset in a misleading way, using that situation as an example of jobs declining in this industry. He talks about the undue influence of big corporations, but if we were to get rid of every big corporation in Australia—least of all in Tasmania—not just in the forest industry but right across industry, I suspect we would be wiping out half the manufacturing sector in this country overnight. It is not a terribly logical argument from Senator Brown.
We make a couple of comments about plantations, but why do we log old-growth forests? Firstly, hopefully, and I think we are now at that point, we are logging them on a sustainable basis. We log old-growth forests in certain areas in Australia because you cannot immediately switch over to plantations. It will take 20 or 30 years to switch over to plantations for logging purposes in this country, and even then there are certain species of trees that are in demand, not for woodchips but for good quality timbers, that do not grow in plantations. We have two basic problems that the environment movement would have us believe are solved overnight, and they can't be. One of the reasons 
 we log old-growth forests in Tasmania, on a sustainable basis, is that certain species of good quality and high demand timber cannot be grown in plantations. Presumably under Senator Brown's proposed solutions you just say goodbye to that section of the industry
One of the interesting issues about the environmental movement's point of view is plantations. Interestingly, in Europe much of the environment movement is very concerned about plantations because plantations are monocultures. Plantations are single species trees—vast thousands of hectares of crop growing with very little biodiversity within those plantations. That is a major issue of concern in Europe amongst the environment movement today. It has, I would argue, a much more significant impact on biodiversity, the local ecology and the water systems than native forest, both old-growth and regrowth forest, that is logged on a sustainable basis.
As I said earlier in my contribution, we have been dealing with this issue for about 20 years in Tasmania. The Regional Forest Agreement has been completed in Tasmania, the legislation has passed the Tasmanian parliament and my hope is that, with the successful conclusion of the RFA process at a state level and at a national level, we will see the end of at least some of the difficulties we have seen associated with forest industries. It is important for those who rely on the forest industries to have security of resource. That is an important issue. It is also important that there are significant areas of wilderness and world heritage that are put aside for future recreational use and the important tourist industry. As I said earlier, we are fortunate, at least in Tasmania, to have the best of both worlds.
One thing I did learn about this issue long ago is that you have to have a reasonable, logical and scientific process. If you do not have that, you can make short-term political judgments to satisfy particular constituencies, whether it be an industry constituency driven by its short-term needs, or it be the environment constituency with its insatiable demand for preserving every tree. I do not think there would be one tree that Bob Brown could point to in Tasmania that he would be happy 
 to see cut down—he would be opposed to every tree being cut down and there would not be an exception. I can recall Senator Brown being opposed to the cutting down and removal of some disease ridden exotic trees in the Hobart Botanical Gardens. Senator Brown takes the most extreme views. It was not a weed, but it was certainly a threat because of the disease and the fact that the tree itself posed a significant threat.
—Not even a weed.
—Not even a weed can be dispensed with. I do think that is sometimes Senator Brown's position. I find that very disappointing and very sad because you cannot compromise with Senator Brown, and compromise is possible.
With this legislation, and with the legislation that is passed in my home state of Tasmania, we will certainly see a process set in place that ensures adequate reserve systems, that ensures world heritage and wilderness values are maintained, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, ensures that there are areas that are available to the forest industries for their legitimate use. Senator Brown referred to logging and firebombing. The reason you burn a regrowth native forest after logging is to regenerate it. If any senators have seen an old-growth forest that is not burnt after it has been logged, it is an absolute catastrophe; it is a wasteland. What regrows as a result is a total disaster. Fire is a natural part of the forestry ecology in eucalypt forests in this country.
Senator Quirke interjecting—
—They are trying it out in Western Australia. Senator Brown raises these highly emotive descriptions when, in fact, they are part of the very essence and survival of eucalypt forests in this country. He never explains that to his particular constituency. I hope that we see at least the end of some of the more rancorous and outrageous contributions we have had from sections of the environment movement and, in particular, Senator Brown. Fortunately, with the setting in place of this process in my home state of Tasmania, and I hope nationally, we have seen some security on both sides of the divide on this issue. We have seen some acceptance 
 and realisation of a reasonable reality and a balance on the reality of this issue.
I would say that I am concerned about woodchip exports. I think there is a real political danger that we will see an unravelling of RFAs unless we see greater downstream processing in Australia, particularly in my home state, of woodchip exports. Woodchip exports are an unfortunate by-product of logging—and they  should be a by-product and not the primary purpose for logging forests. But, of course, I have highlighted the hypocrisy of the environment movement when it comes to processing or downstreaming those woodchips into pulp and paper in Australia. That would certainly be of significant benefit to my home state of Tasmania in terms of jobs and the critical problem that we have in our balance of payments in the forest areas.

"Woodley, Sen John",AD,1999-08-09,"—I also want to speak on the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998  and perhaps make a couple of comments about previous speakers. Let me commend Senator Sherry for his speech. While I do not agree with all of it, as usual it is a very thoughtful, considered and reasoned approach that he takes, and he has made a useful contribution.
I was going to comment about Senator Brown's speech, but I think Senator Sherry has probably covered most of the things I would want to say. I am not sure what Senator Brown is trying to do, because he makes the same speech time after time, and it is always negative. One of the other problems with Senator Brown's contribution is that he always uses half-truths, and half-truths are probably the worst kind of lie that there is, because they always promote a suggestion that what he is saying has some truth in it and therefore it should be listened to. But in fact, when you promote a half-truth, it is the most dangerous lie of all.
That is why I believe that what Senator Sherry has said—while I would have wanted to have gone into detail—covered some of the things that I would have said. Obviously, I do not agree with all of Senator Sherry's contributions but, as I said by way of introduction, certainly it is always worth listening to the 
 contribution he makes because it is always well reasoned and well thought through. The problem that the Democrats have is that we do not really believe that the RFA process delivers jobs—that is the biggest problem we have with it—and certainly not for the impoverished and vulnerable rural areas, where most of the disputes are occurring.
I had the responsibility of sitting in on the Senate legislation committee which heard evidence from a number of witnesses about the breakdown of the social fabric of communities which are heavily dependent upon the timber industry. That breakdown continues, and that concerns me very deeply. I know some of these people personally, particularly those in Queensland, and I know the hurt that they are suffering. In particular, from the Senate hearings, the evidence which was given by the Forest Protection Society about this, and the evidence which they produced and the documentation of the research which underpinned their evidence, is worth quoting from. The Democrats are deeply concerned about the decline in employment and population in many of Australia's rural and regional areas. The submission of the Forest Protection Society stated in graphic language the situation:
RFA social assessments have identified many social affects our communities have, arising from insecurity and uncertainty, including very high unemployment rates, increased suicides, substance abuse, marriage breakdowns and medical problems, as well as economic consequences of bankruptcy and debt related breakdown of business and family units.
The Democrats recognise the loss of jobs in the timber industry which has occurred over many years, although some witnesses gave evidence of a slight improvement in some areas. However, we reject the simplistic notion that job losses are primarily a result of attempts at environmental protection of oldgrowth forests.
There are complex reasons for the loss of jobs in the timber industry, some of which parallel the loss of jobs in many areas of rural and remote Australia generally. Reasons unrelated to environmental activism—and, it would seem, ones of far greater employment significance—include the following: increas 
 ing mechanisation, corporate consolidation and rationalisation of mill operations, and decreasing areas of easy source material. They also include the takeover of pulping and woodchipping as the primary focus in many forest areas. This deters or deleteriously affects downstream or value added investment. Problems arise when plantation industry products, which are a greater employer, are undercut to such an extent by lower employment generating pulp and woodchip products.
The Democrats believe the only way in which long-term job security can be assured is through proper value adding to forest products and basing the industry on sustainable and existing plantations. It was demonstrated by a number of witnesses, such as Judy Clark and Francis Gray, that the economics of native forest logging are simply not sustainable. Of Australia's 14 largest sawmills, each processing over 100,000 cubic metres of logs per annum, all are softwood plantation mills. None relies on native forest logs.
The Western Australian branch of the Australian Workers Union is part of the way there in its assessment:
The jobs with manufacturing and processing capability close to production of material in the south-west will enhance the quality of life for many south-west residents. With this commitment together with that of the industry and workers, it would be possible for Western Australia to become known for its furniture in the same way that Holland is known for its tulips. There is no doubt that, should this be the only exploitative use for those forests, the issue would not be as contentious. But since the majority use becomes focused around the voracious needs of the woodchip industry, smaller saw millers are disadvantaged considerably.
Senator Shayne Murphy, in his evidence to the inquiry, argued that North Forest Products, one of the main woodchippers in Tasmania, is controlling the supply of logs for woodchips to the detriment of small sawmillers and that many logs are being sent to be chipped or even burnt when they could be processed for higher quality uses. He pointed out that sawlogs and timber for quality furniture are being lost to the industry as a result. Senator Murphy showed the committee photos of a salvage operation after woodchip harvest where myrtle species suitable for sawlog use 
 were being taken away to be burnt. I quote from his evidence:
When you look at these photographs you will see, and you do not have to be a rocket scientist to work it out, that these are sawlogs. The Forestry Corporation of Tasmania indicated  to me—indeed, in writing—that these coupes contain no sawlogs.
Although some witnesses said the absence of completed RFAs was holding back investment, the actual evidence linking RFAs to employment outcomes was much less tangible. Some basic figures were not available to the committee, including the exact number of jobs in the plantation sector and the number of jobs in the native forest sector overall.
How are we to take the government on trust that the RFA process is the way to solve the dispute about use of Australia's native forests? Senators certainly pursued a common line of inquiry in search of evidence that resource security will generate investment and jobs, but there was no substantial evidence presented that it would. Even with RFAs substantially in place the industry has not made the commitment that it will invest in the downstream processing that is the only possible source of major new employment in the native forest product sector. Indeed, evidence was given that the Burnie pulp mill closed with the imminent signing of the RFAs, with the loss of many jobs. The reality is that jobs in the native forest industry will continue to decline because the native forest industry is relying more and more heavily on woodchip, despite the fact that the woodchip industry needs considerable propping up from the public purse and is unsustainable.
If the government were serious about long-term jobs and security, then it should focus on the most commercially viable part of the industry—the plantation sector. Within that sector investment must be encouraged in processing and plantation wood, particularly at this time as we have larger and larger areas of plantation coming on stream. I recognise the comment made by Senator Sherry—that is, that there is a problem with monoculture within plantations. However, it is not necessary to have plantations simply of one species. There have been experiments in north Queensland particularly with revegetating and replanting, particularly on clapped-out dairy 
 farms in that area. There are about 11 different local government authorities involved in this particular experiment where, instead of planting simply monoculture, the attempt has been made to plant a number of species in association with one another. So I take the point that Senator Sherry made that it is not necessarily the way of the future in relation to plantation timber.
The big employment generators are to be found in further processing of plantation sawn timber and wood panels into products like furniture, joinery, roof trusses and the like. This way, the plantation industry further processes most of the timber it harvests, creating more jobs. The native forest industry does not even get over the first hurdle of processing as they export most of their products overseas as woodchips, and that is the problem—they do not provide the raw product for further processing. So it is nonsensical to put money, legislative backing and time into the native forest industry while failing at the same time to capture and increase jobs in the plantation sector. The irony is that most of those jobs are in regional Australia so it would match the government's rhetoric perfectly should they choose to deliver in this area.
Evidence was given that about 60 per cent of wood logged from native forest is chipped and exported, and that is increasing and will continue to do so under the RFAs. Evidence was also given that this process is heavily subsidised and the community receives a grossly inadequate return on the use of its resource. The majority of Australia's processed wood needs are being met by the plantation sector, and this process will continue despite the continuing heavy subsidy of the native forest sector. The overall effect of the evidence, particularly that of economic consultants, was that jobs would continue to be lost in the native forest sector covered by the RFAs and generated in the plantation sector, which has been mainly ignored in the RFA process.
With indirect jobs the position only gets worse. With the increasing dominance of woodchipping in native forest logging, indirect employment in this area will continue to 
 decline. It is apparent that government subsidies to increase downstream processing have had an insignificant effect. In contrast, in the plantation sector not only is the employment multiplier greater, it will continue to improve regardless of the relative lack of government assistance. If the government were to match its regional employment and development rhetoric with positive action it would be addressing a number of issues holding the plantation sector back, not continuing to prop up a native forest sector even more in thrall to woodchipping interests which appear, from the evidence, to have the lowest levels of employment and the most minimal multipliers.
It is unfortunate, but apparently true, that the plantation industry is at a crossroads where there will be losses of potential downstream jobs as a result of the RFAs. Prices of native forest logs are now so low that there are starting to be stockpiles of sawlogs and export of unprocessed plantation sawlogs as well. The Burnie pulp mill closed despite the imminent signing of the Tasmanian RFA, meaning hundreds of jobs disappeared in an area that could ill afford to lose them.
—You should have built Wesley Vale.
—That is certainly an issue that should be debated as well I think, Senator Sherry. If the RFAs were truly about guaranteeing jobs, then this should not have happened. It would also not have happened if the industry in the area was sustainable. If the industry was based in plantations it may have stood a chance, as there is little doubt that a Japanese decision to source all chips from plantation areas within a decade has had a significant impact on the decision to close.
Events in Western Australia have reached high farce, with decisions being made and remade against political tidal waves. Workers have as little security from day to day as Western Australians do about the security of their old-growth forests from woodchip mills. Western Australia has shown us conclusively that there is no certainty with RFAs in terms of conservation of jobs. The bill, which potentially exposes the Commonwealth to huge compensation payouts, has no guarantee 
 about investment or jobs.  If the bill is before the Senate in order to help increase employment in rural and regional areas, it will have the effect of suppressing employment in a growing sector and presiding over its dwindling in a declining sector. The Democrats have not supported the RFA bill, because so much information is distorted or missing and the RFA process does not satisfy our concern for providing the maximum amount of jobs in a sustainable manner for rural and regional Australia.
I want in the couple of minutes that are left to place on the record a number of articles by a journalist from the Courier-Mail in Brisbane, a journalist whom I respect very greatly. His name is Tony Koch. Not only has he written some very good articles on this issue; he has written a number of articles in the whole area of what is happening in Aboriginal communities. They underline his commitment to rural, remote and regional areas, particularly in my state of Queensland. He comments about the particular issue in Queensland of small sawmills, particularly in south-west Queensland, that depend on the cypress pine industry.
I need to underline that I do know a fair bit about this particular industry. Having lived in western Queensland for quite a few years, I was aware of the cypress pine industry there and of the important contribution it made and makes to regional economies in that area. I point out that cypress pine is one of those resources which regenerates without any help from human beings. In some places it grows like weeds but, nevertheless, it is a very good timber for building houses—and, I might add, for building churches. On one occasion I built a church at Injune out of cypress pine that was supplied by a grazier who supplied all of the pine for the church and then a double quantity to pay for the sawmilling. So I have some experience of that.
However, in his articles in the Courier-Mail Tony Koch pointed out the threat to some of those regional areas in Queensland because of the possibility of the loss of the cypress pine resource to small sawmillers. That was not because of the RFA so much as through the process of the national competition policy, 
 which would force the industry to throw open the resource to public tender, and the possibility of large corporations moving in and taking over that resource and the small towns losing the employment which was provided. In his article, he points out:
Cypress harvesting generates $30 million annually, and the State Government is paid almost $3 million in royalties from the sawmillers.
Just let me put on the record:
The towns which would be affected by any closure of local mills include Inglewood, Millmerran, Cecil Plains, Chinchilla, Miles, Taroom, Wandoan, Injune, Roma, Augathella, Mitchell, Mungallala, Dulacca-North and Surat.
He says that the pessimism in those townships about local ownership and control of the western Queensland cypress industry is reflected also in the departure of key staff from the industry. I want to underline in my contribution tonight the concern I have for the loss of jobs in the timber industry—although I would give different solutions perhaps to some of the ones given by Senator Sherry—because I am concerned also for all of those small towns which employ people in this industry.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1999-08-09,"—I rise to speak on the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998 . Other Democrats colleagues have spoken or will speak on the issues of jobs, plantations and the environment and on legal issues, and I will address other less considered forest values. The Democrats believe the RFA process discriminates unfairly against other important cultural values and social and economic benefits provided by native forests in this country. Forests account for an increasing amount of tourist dollars and, as a new market area is developed, more areas open up, providing more value adding to tourist experiences. Not only is the tourism industry a significant growth industry in native forest areas; it has a far better multiplier effect than the woodchip industry, and its services are delivered on site in the local area, rather than exported as a basic product.
It is hard to imagine an Australia without some of our most significant natural areas, and very often they do not enter our psyches as important until after they have been pro 
 tected. Australians, I am sure, would not now tolerate the logging of Fraser Island any more than they would the wet tropics, and these places now attract hundreds of millions of dollars in tourism revenue. The RFAs, I would argue, have the potential to destroy infant and prospective tourist areas for a short-term—disgracefully underpriced—return. In my home state of Victoria, the state government sold timber from native forests for just 9c a tonne.
In terms of opportunity costs, the Democrats predict that the tourism industry will be one of the biggest losers in the RFA process. There was evidence in Western Australia that the tourism industry has been ignored by the WA RFA process as well, and their concerns about the RFA are well catalogued. Another witness suggested, not unreasonably, that the tourism industry could equally argue for compensation under the RFAs for the opportunity cost of areas that would be logged and mined.
Briefly, in terms of other forest uses, the Wombat Forest Society presented evidence that beekeepers would be significantly disadvantaged. They also pointed out that a large number of people rely on high quality water through that forest region, which will be detrimentally affected by logging, and that irrigators downstream would also be negatively affected. Logging continues in the Otways, even though many coupes are in water attachments. The evidence is clear that clear-felling reduces water production very substantially and for many years to come. Geelong's water supply depends on the Otways. The dams are very low at present and we cannot afford to lose the water generating capacity of this or any other forest.
It is not clear that compensation has been ruled out for parties affected by RFAs and, again, perhaps there is potential for future compensation claims on the Commonwealth as a result of these processes. The Wombat State Forest is quite close to Melbourne and I think it is fair to say it is highly valued by the surrounding communities. It was once selectively and sustainably logged by foresters who are now appalled by the clear-felling taking place, as are those thou sands of people 
 who visit the area on a regular basis. The question is whether it is responsible for the Senate to vote on legislation that will certainly destroy areas of huge income potential which have the ability to create sustainable jobs in local areas, maintain water quality and generate wealth in return for one-off destruction and export of a primary product. The Democrats simply do not believe so.
The bill removes the capacity for the Commonwealth to require export licences for hardwood woodchips and other unprocessed wood from an RFA region. Even the CFMEU, not normally noted for being uncompromising protectors of native forest areas, disagrees with this provision of the bill and says that export controls should remain. The hundreds of thousands of people who have participated in forest marches, and written to state and federal governments over the last decade all think that woodchipping native forests has a significant impact on the environment.
Not only will large and ecologically significant areas be sanctioned for woodchipping, with no environmental regulatory control; the Australian taxpayer will clearly be paying dearly for this devastation. Woodchipping does not make money; it costs money, and plenty of it. In my home state of Victoria, five years ago the state made $40 million out of native forest woodchip export, but it cost $90 million in the process. That means Victorians paid $50 million to have our forests chipped in just one year.
It seems to me that state governments have a conflict of interest with regard to RFAs. The RFA process will be mostly controlled by state governments who have a vested and financial short-term interest in the outcomes. The RFA agreements have been controlled and negotiated, and will be managed by sections of state governments, and serious questions have been raised about their ability to provide objective assessment and regulation. One lot of evidence pointed to the Western Australian EPA bulletin No. 912 which produced a landmark report stating that there was a significant conflict of interest in the Department of Conservation and Land Management—

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,1999-08-09,"—In the book The Clever Country? Australia's Digital Future , Daniel Petre and David Harrington explore the capacity of Australia to meet the challenges of an inevitably technological future. They comment particularly on the capacity of the Australian populace to utilise the `online revolution' to their advantage. They speak of the need for Australia to become `an information capital, not an information outpost'. Clearly, Australia must use the information revolution to its greatest advantage, but how best to do that is often a matter for debate.
I have previously addressed issues relating to the IT revolution and information technology in general, and most recently discussed the particular challenges for those in rural and regional Australia in terms of their particular route on the information superhighway. I have also spoken, not in conjunction with this but in other areas, of the work of the NSW Liberal Women's Council and Liberal Women's Forum and the important efforts that they have put in in many policy areas. In continuing to recognise their efforts, I want to put on record the success of their most recent endeavour, an annual rural rendezvous held in Mittagong in the New South Wales Southern Highlands which I attended a week or so ago. This year's theme `The Bush Telegraph for the 21st Century' targeted questions of information technology for non-metropolitan regions. The range of speakers included Tom Worthington, who is the immediate past president of the Computer Society; Fay Lamont, a finalist in the Telstra Businesswoman of the Year Awards in 1998; Meredith Laverty, a board member of the Internet Industry Association; and Dr Wendy Craik, the Executive Director of the National Farmers Federation. The benefit of the meeting was in raising policy issues in the areas of telecommunications and IT that need to be addressed, particularly for those Australians 
 outside metropolitan areas who are, in many ways, at a disadvantage in terms of IT developments.
Issues of access, speed and resources are very real stumbling blocks for those in rural and regional areas who wish to join the information superhighway. For women, the challenges can be still greater. In addressing these issues, the organisers of the meeting—in particular, the Vice-Presidents of the Women's Council, Robyn Parker and Juliet Arkwright—were focused on matters of crucial importance not only to women but also to the broader Australian community. Of most interest to the meeting was the interaction of women and IT. On the one hand, the challenge is to ensure that women have access to IT developments and can utilise them in their daily lives. On the other hand, it is also about ensuring that women take advantage of the employment boom in this area, so that the IT industry is not just `jobs for the boys'.
Some of the international trends in this regard are of concern. The percentage of women holding technical jobs in the United States stands at just 28 per cent. In Australia, the estimated percentage of women working in IT is similar. When you combine that with other US indicators, where female enrolments in computer science degrees are dropping, that low level is of concern, especially when you reflect on the trend over recent decades of increasing numbers of women entering the work force. This trend has been responsible for much of the employment growth over that same period. Recently, Phil Ruthven, Executive Chairperson of IBIS Business Information, made the point on ABC's Lateline that 30 per cent of the jobs created since 1965 have arisen out of the increase in the number of working women who now require other people to do the work often traditionally done by women in the home. An area like child care is a prime example. It is important to note this because the IT industry is clearly distinct  from this trend. IT is an area where women are not enjoying an automatic foothold in its growth.
Ensuring that women are able to take advantage of this employment direction must be done consciously and deliberately, and at 
 two levels. Firstly, we need to encourage women to pursue career opportunities in this area. The Women in Technology International Foundation, based in the US, has this firmly in its sights. Founded in 1989, it is dedicated to advancing women in technology. Its agenda includes increasing the number of women in executive roles in technology and technology based companies and encouraging young women to choose careers in science and technology. In Australia women in IT are developing their own support networks.
The online publication Geekgirl has been in operation for some time. It is providing support for women interested in IT by communicating with those women who might count themselves as cyber buffs. It started its life as a comic and went on to become an immensely popular e-zine and even a more old-fashioned magazine. It is also important to encourage younger women towards IT careers and we can start this process at a very early age. In fact, in the United States Girl Scouts can gain a proficiency badge in technology and the Internet. In Australia, our Brownies can pursue a badge in computers.
One of the most important issues that I think we need to consider as a nation amongst the issues relating to information technology is that of the information poor. While we may recognise the impact of the Internet on economies, employment and other areas, there is growing concern that this impact may not be equal across contemporary society. Information poverty is about those in our society who do not have access to or an understanding of IT developments and advantages. There is a body of thought which predicts that, as IT developments continue to sweep the world, we run the risk of creating a whole new class of underprivileged. Because of the speed of communication and information access inherent in information technology developments, there is even concern that this trend may heighten gaps in our society between rich and poor rather than alleviating the divide, as many would hope.
Information poverty is visible at two levels: at an international or macro level and at a community or micro level. At an international level, there is a serious concern that IT 
 advantages are accessible primarily to Western developed nations and not to those who might benefit most from IT implementation. Recent research in Information Technology for Development referred to the challenge of ensuring that IT is adopted equally across the globe. Current indications are that developed nations, like Australia, are most advanced, but underdeveloped nations have not been able to adopt IT as easily. The comparison is in fact staggering. In the January edition of Technology Review, reference was made to the spending of the United States on IT compared with other countries. For every $US1 spent in Bangladesh, for example, $3,000 is spent in the United States.
I think this is an area in which Australia can play a leadership role, both in our region and across the globe more generally, but not at the expense of those Australians who might unwittingly fall into the category of information poor at a micro level—for example, those people in regional areas; women, as I have already referred to; those with little education; those on low incomes; and those from a non-English speaking background. We have to ensure that those on the inside, so to speak, do not gain advantage at the exclusion of others in the Australian community. Our challenge is to ensure that new technologies do not reinforce existing inequities and, where possible, alleviate them where they exist.
A couple of weeks ago, an article in the Australian Financial Review highlighted many of the difficulties. It cited, again, American statistics indicating a significant information divide, with the lowest users of the Internet in the United States being rural and inner city Hispanic households and inner city African-American households. Indications are that the disparity between these groups and others is growing. In the United States and Australia, this is real poverty. It is about people who cannot pay home phone bills, let alone buy mobile phones and computers for themselves and their children. The disparity in the Australian context is similar. Rural Australians do not have the multiplicity or perhaps even the luxury of access to the Net that many of us enjoy. 
While I have a computer with Internet access in my office in Parramatta, here at Parliament House and at home, most rural and regional Australians, particularly women, do not have this range of access. For many of them, their home is their office and, if they do not pay for the access themselves, there is no other option.
The capacity of information technology to alleviate social divides is something on which we must focus. A special report in last Saturday's Sydney Morning Herald noted how young residents of Newcastle are using the Internet to organise significant events and help revitalise their city. One contributor said:
The Internet has changed the dynamics of living in a regional area.
They went on to say that it had enabled people to remain in Newcastle after finishing university rather than automatically going to Sydney or Melbourne. This work is a reminder of how the Internet can act as a catalyst for overcoming inequalities rather than reinforcing them.
In considering the preparedness of Australian governments to deal with advances in technology, Petre and Harrington contemplated the design of this very building. They asked:
. . . whether, given the communications revolution, the architects would have changed the design of their building if undertaking the project today.
Such hindsight is valuable but impossible to attain. In a sense, however, we are now in an equivalent position with regard to the development of the IT industry in Australia. We are at the designing stage and it is important that we have the best possible structure—one that assists development, whilst ensuring that no Australians are falling through the cracks.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Information Technology: Access</title>,Adjournment,22,1
