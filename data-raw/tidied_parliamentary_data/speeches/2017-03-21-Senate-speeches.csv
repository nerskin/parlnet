(aa) Part 7B of the Interactive Gambling Act 2001;


These amendments are all about strengthening the Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2016. I welcome this bill, I welcome the debate and I welcome the fact that we are trying to make the Interactive Gambling Act more effective because it is quite disturbing that after almost 16 years of operation of this bill, there has yet to be one prosecution under it. The minister helpfully said last night, in terms of the bill, that ACMA will be dealing with these matters rather than the Federal Police and that the burden of proof would be one of the balance of probabilities for these civil penalties rather than beyond reasonable doubt. In the circumstances, that is something that would more likely lead to more prosecutions. 


I am concerned that it is going to be dealt with by way of a ministerial council—which is looking at the O'Farrell review—and that we will get the lowest common denominator. There is no question that the Commonwealth has the power to deal comprehensively with interactive gambling using its constitutional powers under telecommunications, banking, corporations and taxation powers in order to deal with these matters. 


The amendments that I am moving—(1) to (23) and (25)—are largely borrowed from the legislation that I previously introduced into the parliament as a private senator's bill, which was co-sponsored by my colleague Senator Kakoschke-Moore just late last year. These amendments strengthen the bill in a number of respects. They look at, for instance, microbetting, which is banned, and you cannot bet on a particular event within a game or race. Microbetting corruption is problematic in sports. It is also very problematic in driving gambling addiction, because people particularly chase their losses with microbetting.


The amendments also look at the whole issue of not having gambling ads during G-classified times. It is an anomaly that you cannot show gambling ads during G-rated times unless it is during a sporting broadcast. Sporting broadcast should not be exempted from that. They also ensure that the regulator has regulatory powers in what a restricted wagering service is. It also looks at the whole issue of making sure that gambling service employees are appropriately trained and there is an offence if they are not trained to be able to intervene. 


The amendments also include issues with respect to giving power to regulators to stop prohibited transactions in relation to prohibited interactive gambling services, including injunctive relief. We have dealt with the issue of not offering credit, through an amendment which was passed last night in the parliament, by this chamber. Let us wait and see what happens to it in the lower house, but I would urge the government to reconsider their opposition to that.


In relation to having restricted wagering services not inducing a person to use a service, it is all about offering inducements to gamble, which is very problematic in terms of gambling addiction, as well as requiring wagering services not to provide details of an account. In other words, individuals ought to be given details of what they have lost. The amendments also have stronger verification-of-identity provisions. They include that there is a national self-exclusion register before creating an account, which is an important reform that was raised in the O'Farrell review. They also, importantly, raise the whole issue of having mandatory recommitment options when creating an account, so they have real teeth and, combined with a national self-exclusion register, would actually be quite effective in dealing with these issues. Together with that, an online gambling service must not increase an individual's betting limit.


These are a framework of consumer protections that ought to be acted on now, not later. These are the sorts of things that I believe would give this bill real force, real effectiveness, in dealing with problem gambling, because my concern is that the government's approach has been a minimalist approach and, as my colleague Senator Kakoschke-Moore will indicate with her amendment, the bill is questionably effective at dealing with the matter that it deals with because it does have a number of loopholes in it. I am very happy to speak to this and take questions from my colleagues in relation to this, but effectively this is a belt-and-braces approach, to ensure that we have an effective approach to deal with problem online gambling in this country.



The CHAIR:  The question is that amendments (1) to (23) and (25) on sheet 8038, moved by Senator Xenophon, be agreed to.

Minister must mandate blocking illegal overseas gambling websites



The Minister must, within 6 months after the commencement of this section, make a legislative instrument requiring internet service providers to block access to illegal overseas gambling websites.


I excised this amendment because of a request from the Australian Greens, and I respect that request. This amendment says that the minister must within six months after the commencement of this section make a legislative instrument requiring internet service providers to block access to illegal overseas gambling websites. This is something that I know is contentious, but if you want this to work it can work.


We know from just one company, Netsweeper of Canada, that I met with and that have given submissions to inquiries in relation to this that you can have internet content filtering categorisation, web threat management solutions and services that allow organisations to manage internet access and activity. This can be used for gambling. This can be used to ensure that these illegal overseas online gambling sites cannot be easily accessed. Netsweeper is not 100 per cent perfect, but my understanding is that it ends up filtering well over 95 per cent of these sites. It makes it very difficult for these sites to be accessed. We know from the Australian Bankers Association that they can track the merchant numbers, or they have a pretty good idea of what the merchant numbers are, of these unauthorised online casinos. We do not know exactly how much is lost to these casinos, but it is in the hundreds of millions of dollars. If we are going to be fair dinkum about tackling illegal online casinos this is the way to do it. This has merit and will be effective.


It is enough of a battle to deal with the legal online bookmakers here in Australia, with sports betting and the damage that causes, but it is really the wild west when it comes to these unauthorised online casinos from overseas. I have had constituents and Senator Kakoschke-Moore has worked with constituents who have been devastated by losses to companies that are based in Malta, Gibraltar or the Caribbean. I commend this amendment as a means of requiring the government to seriously tackle this by ensuring that we use available technologies to block these sites.


Question negatived.

Senator KAKOSCHKE-MOORE
 (South Australia) (12:50):by leave—I move Nick Xenophon Team amendments (1) to (6) on sheet 8046 together:


(1) Schedule 1, item 7, page 5 (after line 21), after the definition of designated interactive gambling service, insert:



electronic betting terminals means electronic equipment that is:


(a) installed on a permanent or fixed basis at a place where gambling services are provided; and


(b) located in an area that is set aside for gambling services and under the continual supervision of the provider; and


(c) unable to connect to the internet; and


(d) available for use only by customers using cash or a card issued by the provider.




[Note: The definition of 
""
electronic equipment
""
 has not been removed because it is used in the definition of 
""
electronic betting terminals
""
.]



(2) Schedule 1, item 27, page 11 (lines 32 and 33), omit ""electronic equipment"", substitute ""electronic betting terminals"".


(3) Schedule 1, item 27, page 12 (line 1), omit ""electronic equipment is"", substitute ""electronic betting terminals are"".


(4) Schedule 1, item 27, page 12 (lines 19 and 20), omit ""electronic equipment"", substitute ""electronic betting terminals"".


(5) Schedule 1, item 27, page 12 (line 22), omit ""electronic equipment is"", substitute ""electronic betting terminals are"".


(6) Schedule 1, item 27, page 12 (line 24), omit ""electronic equipment is"", substitute ""electronic betting terminals are"".


It is the view of the Nick Xenophon Team that the bill as it is currently drafted will increase the opportunities for in-play betting in TABs, clubs and licensed premises. This goes against the intention of the government's bill. Indeed, the Department of Communications and the Arts admitted that the definition of electronic equipment within the bill could include smartphones and tablets. They also admitted that they have done no analysis or modelling of whether this will increase the effects of problem gambling.


Consequently, the amendments on sheet 8046 narrow the definition of electronic equipment and make it clear that electronic equipment will instead be defined as an electronic betting terminal which is installed on a permanent or fixed basis at a place where gambling services are provided, is unable to be connected to the internet in a designated supervised area and is available for the use only of customers using cash or a card issued by the provider.


This definition will limit in-play betting to electronic betting terminals to ensure that gambling operators do not seek to expand their operations by allowing people to place in-play bets using tablets or smartphones provided by the venue. These terminals are permanent installations located in a specific area set aside for gambling and are unable to be connected to the internet. We put that if the government is sincere in its intent to clamp down on in-play sports betting it should not be enabling venues to hand out tablets and smartphones to its customers. Therefore, we encourage the Senate to support the amendments on sheet 8046, which will put a stop to this harmful practice.

 (New South Wales) (12:52):  Labor is well and truly on the record for raising concerns about terminals in licensed venues. As I have already stated, we do not want to see and do not support a proliferation of mobile devices. Minister Tudge, in the other place, has already said that he will act if there is a proliferation, and Labor expects the government to maintain the status quo. We are not supporting the amendment, on this occasion, but I just wanted to put on the record, again, that we have raised concerns about this issue and I indicate, clearly, to the government that Labor does not expect to see a proliferation of mobile devices, given the minister's comments.

I do not agree with the argument and think it is a weak one, respectfully, but could the minister at least humour us and give a response to this amendment? You did not on the previous amendments, but this is a pretty discrete amendment. It goes to the heart of this bill about in-play betting and whether it can be circumvented. This amendment, moved by my colleague Senator Kakoschke-Moore, seeks to obviate that. Can the minister give us the government's position on this amendment and any undertakings that if there is a proliferation of tablets, smartphone devices, the government will monitor it and act accordingly?

We did canvass these matters extensively last night, your contributions, and those of Senator Kakoschke-Moore, in relation to these amendments and the previous ones and I responded to those, at length, last night. As the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, I have the practice of avoiding repeating myself, where I can, to ensure that legislation is passed efficiently. But let me restate that this legislation is not seeking to create a new situation. This legislation is, simply, seeking comment, with place based betting, to maintain the status quo. As I indicated last night, this is something that we will monitor.

Casino
‑style poker or blackjack gambling service



(1) For the purposes of this Act, a casino‑style poker or blackjack gambling service is a service for the conduct of a game covered by paragraph (e) of the definition of gambling service in section 4:


(a) to the extent to which the game is poker or blackjack; and


(b) to the extent to which the game is conducted in a manner substantially similar to the manner in which it would be conducted at a casino;


so long as the other conditions (if any) determined under subsection (2) have been satisfied.


(2) The Minister may, by legislative instrument, determine one or more conditions for the purposes of subsection (1).


(4) Schedule 1, item 28, page 13 (after line 29), after paragraph 8E(1)(g), insert:


(ga) a casino‑style poker or blackjack gambling service (see section 8BC); or


Items 1 and 3 on sheet 8054 define casino-style poker and blackjack as poker or blackjack conducted in a manner substantially similar to the manner in which it would be conducted at a casino so long as any other conditions determined by the minister, by legislative instrument, are satisfied. Item 2 excludes casino-style poker and blackjack services from the definition of prohibited interactive gambling services. Item 4 includes online casino-style poker and blackjack services in the definition of regulated interactive gambling services.


If these amendments are passed, the person who is licensed to provide an online casino-style poker or blackjack services under a law of the state or territory would face no criminal or civil penalty under Commonwealth law. This would only be a first step towards legalising online casino-style poker and blackjack services. State and territory licensing would still be required, but it is a necessary step.


Despite the current prohibition in the existing law, online poker and blackjack are enjoyed by many Australians. They are entertaining games of chance and considerable skill. And despite the current lack of regulation—or, should I say, loophole of regulation?—there is no evidence that online poker and blackjack causes more harm than the other services this bill seeks to regulate rather than prohibit, like online sports betting. I commend the amendments to the Senate.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts) (12:58):  As I indicated in my second reading contribution, the government believes that online poker poses a risk to problem gambling in Australia and it will maintain the prohibition of these services under the Interactive Gambling Act. The act creates an offence of providing or advertising interactive gambling services to customers in Australia, prohibiting gambling services—including online casino-style gaming services, including online poker—which are played for money or anything else of value. The intent of the act is to minimise the scope of gambling in Australia.


The government was clear in its response to the illegal offshore wagering review that it will not expand the online betting market in Australia. This bill will maintain the status quo and uphold the original intent of the Interactive Gambling Act. Online poker will, therefore, remain a prohibited interactive gambling service.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:59):  Senator Leyonhjelm has obviously thought through this amendment and it would be disrespectful not to respond to it.


I and my colleagues do not support this amendment for a number of reasons. There is an ambiguity as to how it would operate and as to what the betting limits would be. I have met with poker machine players who like playing online poker, and they have made the point that sometimes you pay $50 and it will last you for a number of hours, which is very different from sports betting services where you can lose thousands of dollars with just one bet. Their argument is that there is an inconsistency in the current law that allows sports betting where enormous amounts of money can be lost; whereas, if online poker were regulated with very small bet limits, it would not be as harmful as sports betting. I am not canvassing and I am not commenting on those remarks as such. But, in the context of this debate, whilst I do not want to see any expansion of online gambling, there does seem to be a dichotomy between poker players, who have described to me that they can bet 1c at a time and lose very small amounts of money in the scheme of things, and sports betting. Senator Leyonhjelm has raised an important issue. 


The paradox may be that if there were very low bet limits, and I am talking very low bet limits as a number of cents compared to dollars or multiples of dollars, the impact would be smaller than sports betting as it currently exists. It is a matter that the Productivity Commission raised in its reports on gambling. I think there will still be an ongoing debate on this, and I understand the point of online poker players who say that there is a dichotomy between a game where $50 will keep you playing all day compared to being able to lose literally tens of thousands of dollars at a time with sports betting. This is something that will need to be debated. I do not want to be seen to be encouraging an expansion of gambling, but there is an inconsistency in the approach of the government and opposition to sports betting, where you can bet thousands of dollars at a time per game or per sporting event—per horse race—compared to online poker, where there could be some very strict limits as to what could be bet. It is something that needs to be debated further.

Whether particular services should no longer be restricted under the IGA is a separate question that this committee was not asked to consider as part of this inquiry.


That is one important point that should be made here in the course of the debate. We do also need to put on the record that the purpose of this particular piece of legislation is to act in a harm minimisation way as a preventative to the adverse outcomes of gambling in our community. I make that point by way of contribution to the debate this afternoon.

 (New South Wales) (13:03):  I want to add a few additional comments to put this into context. There is a very active poker community in Australia. They like to play poker. They like to win. There are tournaments. They make money. Some people lose money. Some of them have high stakes, and they can lose a lot of money at once, but mostly it is pretty small beer. That is not, essentially, regulated very much at all. That occurs in pubs and clubs where people gather, and if you are interested in playing poker competitively, there are no shortage of opportunities. What we are doing here is saying, 'You can't do that online. You can't play poker online with the same sort of people.' The risks are the same—you can lose small amounts of money or large amounts of money—and you bet what you choose. Yet, we are saying, 'No you're not allowed to do that online. You're only allowed to do it face-to-face.' It a little bit like saying to Australians, 'You're allowed to talk to each other by telephone, but you are not allowed to talk to each other by FaceTime, because FaceTime goes via a server in another country.' I am sure most of you know what FaceTime is. It is that method within Facebook of talking to each other external to the telephone system. What we are basically saying here is that one kind of playing poker is okay, but another kind of playing poker is not okay because it is online. Seriously! This is the 21st century. Almost everything is online these days, and to pretend that we can regulate so that you can do one but not the other is dreaming. I think it is very bad legislation. We really should not entertain it.



The CHAIR:  The question is that amendments (1) to (4) on sheet 8054 moved by Senator Leyonhjelm be agreed to.

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (13:13):  by leave—I move Pauline Hanson's One Nation amendments (1) and (2) on sheet 8093:


(1) Schedule 1, item 26, page 11 (after line 13), at the end of paragraph 8A(5) (c), add:


(vi) a service relating to betting on the outcome of a lottery;


(2) Schedule 1, page 13 (after line 15), after item 27, insert:




27A


At the end of subsection


8D(2)



Add:


; or (c) betting on the outcome of a lottery.


My amendments are about a service related to betting on the outcome of a lottery. We have a foreign investor in Australia by the name of Lottoland, who bought a licence in the Northern Territory for $550,000. They are actually allowing people to bet on the outcome of a lottery anywhere in the world. They pay no tax. They are here in Australia. They do not employ a lot of people; they employ about six people. They are providing a service that is detrimental to 4½ thousand newsagents around this country who rely on lottery tickets being sold and who are struggling. So here we have a foreign company in Australia, possibly taking hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions of dollars, out of the country in unpaid taxes.


I also raised this in light of the government moving a bill in this house to address multinationals not paying their taxes in Australia. I think this has been on the table since almost 20 years ago when, I can remember, I raised the topic of multinationals not paying their taxes in Australia. This would be a good reason for the government to support my amendment to shut down one foreign multinational company working here in Australia and to stop the demise of 4½ thousand newsagents who are losing business because of this. If they are fair dinkum about clamping down on multinationals in Australia—in this case not employing a lot of Australians—taking money out of the country by not paying taxes here, then I expect the government and the opposition to support my amendments.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts) (13:15):  I thank Senator Hanson and her office for taking the government through the intent of One Nation's amendments. I think my colleagues would appreciate that, under the law as it is, Lottoland is not illegal, and I think that is the point of Senator Hanson's amendments. Lottoland is also not offshore. It is a licensed service in the Northern Territory, and the proposition here is beyond the scope of this bill. As Senator Hanson and One Nation have put this proposition here, the government will examine it, but it is important, with the proposed changes, that there be consultation. So it is not possible for the government to support these amendments in the context of this bill, but, as One Nation have asked that we examine this, we are happy to do so.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (13:17):  I indicate very briefly that I and my colleague strongly support these amendments. If the government does not support them, I genuinely suggest Senator Hanson put up a private senator's bill. I would co-sponsor it. The sooner we get onto it, the better. We need to bring this to a head. This is a loophole under current laws. It is beyond me that the Northern Territory regulator actually allows this to be licensed. I believe it is a sneaky and tricky form of gambling that effectively allows more people to get sucked in or roped in and become gambling addicts, because this service promises huge returns, but the odds are even huger. I think it is very problematic in terms of it being offered as a service. It also has a real impact on state-based lotteries. Whatever problems you have with those, at least you know that the revenue is staying here in the Commonwealth rather than going off overseas.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (13:18):  I too would like to put Labor's position that we are very sympathetic to the issue that Pauline Hanson's One Nation party has drawn to the attention of the chamber through these amendments. However, it did arrive into the whole consultation very, very late, and one of the important things in legislative care is to make sure that there is adequate consultation, so we will not be supporting these amendments at this point in time.

Senator ROBERTS
 (Queensland) (13:18):  I am pleased that the government has recognised the merit of these amendments so far as the tax is concerned and so far as it will be considered. I will just add some weight to that because the evasion of tax by foreign entities is something that has not been addressed since 1953. It is something that we must, must get on top of because of our debt situation in this country and the unfairness of our tax system. It needs to be a part of the considered and comprehensive review of our tax system.

Insert:


(aa) Part 7B of the Interactive Gambling Act 2001;


These amendments are all about strengthening the Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2016. I welcome this bill, I welcome the debate and I welcome the fact that we are trying to make the Interactive Gambling Act more effective because it is quite disturbing that after almost 16 years of operation of this bill, there has yet to be one prosecution under it. The minister helpfully said last night, in terms of the bill, that ACMA will be dealing with these matters rather than the Federal Police and that the burden of proof would be one of the balance of probabilities for these civil penalties rather than beyond reasonable doubt. In the circumstances, that is something that would more likely lead to more prosecutions. 


I am concerned that it is going to be dealt with by way of a ministerial council—which is looking at the O'Farrell review—and that we will get the lowest common denominator. There is no question that the Commonwealth has the power to deal comprehensively with interactive gambling using its constitutional powers under telecommunications, banking, corporations and taxation powers in order to deal with these matters. 


The amendments that I am moving—(1) to (23) and (25)—are largely borrowed from the legislation that I previously introduced into the parliament as a private senator's bill, which was co-sponsored by my colleague Senator Kakoschke-Moore just late last year. These amendments strengthen the bill in a number of respects. They look at, for instance, microbetting, which is banned, and you cannot bet on a particular event within a game or race. Microbetting corruption is problematic in sports. It is also very problematic in driving gambling addiction, because people particularly chase their losses with microbetting.


The amendments also look at the whole issue of not having gambling ads during G-classified times. It is an anomaly that you cannot show gambling ads during G-rated times unless it is during a sporting broadcast. Sporting broadcast should not be exempted from that. They also ensure that the regulator has regulatory powers in what a restricted wagering service is. It also looks at the whole issue of making sure that gambling service employees are appropriately trained and there is an offence if they are not trained to be able to intervene. 


The amendments also include issues with respect to giving power to regulators to stop prohibited transactions in relation to prohibited interactive gambling services, including injunctive relief. We have dealt with the issue of not offering credit, through an amendment which was passed last night in the parliament, by this chamber. Let us wait and see what happens to it in the lower house, but I would urge the government to reconsider their opposition to that.


In relation to having restricted wagering services not inducing a person to use a service, it is all about offering inducements to gamble, which is very problematic in terms of gambling addiction, as well as requiring wagering services not to provide details of an account. In other words, individuals ought to be given details of what they have lost. The amendments also have stronger verification-of-identity provisions. They include that there is a national self-exclusion register before creating an account, which is an important reform that was raised in the O'Farrell review. They also, importantly, raise the whole issue of having mandatory recommitment options when creating an account, so they have real teeth and, combined with a national self-exclusion register, would actually be quite effective in dealing with these issues. Together with that, an online gambling service must not increase an individual's betting limit.


These are a framework of consumer protections that ought to be acted on now, not later. These are the sorts of things that I believe would give this bill real force, real effectiveness, in dealing with problem gambling, because my concern is that the government's approach has been a minimalist approach and, as my colleague Senator Kakoschke-Moore will indicate with her amendment, the bill is questionably effective at dealing with the matter that it deals with because it does have a number of loopholes in it. I am very happy to speak to this and take questions from my colleagues in relation to this, but effectively this is a belt-and-braces approach, to ensure that we have an effective approach to deal with problem online gambling in this country.



The CHAIR:  The question is that amendments (1) to (23) and (25) on sheet 8038, moved by Senator Xenophon, be agreed to.

Minister must mandate blocking illegal overseas gambling websites



The Minister must, within 6 months after the commencement of this section, make a legislative instrument requiring internet service providers to block access to illegal overseas gambling websites.


I excised this amendment because of a request from the Australian Greens, and I respect that request. This amendment says that the minister must within six months after the commencement of this section make a legislative instrument requiring internet service providers to block access to illegal overseas gambling websites. This is something that I know is contentious, but if you want this to work it can work.


We know from just one company, Netsweeper of Canada, that I met with and that have given submissions to inquiries in relation to this that you can have internet content filtering categorisation, web threat management solutions and services that allow organisations to manage internet access and activity. This can be used for gambling. This can be used to ensure that these illegal overseas online gambling sites cannot be easily accessed. Netsweeper is not 100 per cent perfect, but my understanding is that it ends up filtering well over 95 per cent of these sites. It makes it very difficult for these sites to be accessed. We know from the Australian Bankers Association that they can track the merchant numbers, or they have a pretty good idea of what the merchant numbers are, of these unauthorised online casinos. We do not know exactly how much is lost to these casinos, but it is in the hundreds of millions of dollars. If we are going to be fair dinkum about tackling illegal online casinos this is the way to do it. This has merit and will be effective.


It is enough of a battle to deal with the legal online bookmakers here in Australia, with sports betting and the damage that causes, but it is really the wild west when it comes to these unauthorised online casinos from overseas. I have had constituents and Senator Kakoschke-Moore has worked with constituents who have been devastated by losses to companies that are based in Malta, Gibraltar or the Caribbean. I commend this amendment as a means of requiring the government to seriously tackle this by ensuring that we use available technologies to block these sites.

Senator KAKOSCHKE-MOORE
 (South Australia) (12:50):by leave—I move Nick Xenophon Team amendments (1) to (6) on sheet 8046 together:


(1) Schedule 1, item 7, page 5 (after line 21), after the definition of designated interactive gambling service, insert:



electronic betting terminals means electronic equipment that is:


(a) installed on a permanent or fixed basis at a place where gambling services are provided; and


(b) located in an area that is set aside for gambling services and under the continual supervision of the provider; and


(c) unable to connect to the internet; and


(d) available for use only by customers using cash or a card issued by the provider.




[Note: The definition of 
""
electronic equipment
""
 has not been removed because it is used in the definition of 
""
electronic betting terminals
""
.]



(2) Schedule 1, item 27, page 11 (lines 32 and 33), omit ""electronic equipment"", substitute ""electronic betting terminals"".


(3) Schedule 1, item 27, page 12 (line 1), omit ""electronic equipment is"", substitute ""electronic betting terminals are"".


(4) Schedule 1, item 27, page 12 (lines 19 and 20), omit ""electronic equipment"", substitute ""electronic betting terminals"".


(5) Schedule 1, item 27, page 12 (line 22), omit ""electronic equipment is"", substitute ""electronic betting terminals are"".


(6) Schedule 1, item 27, page 12 (line 24), omit ""electronic equipment is"", substitute ""electronic betting terminals are"".


It is the view of the Nick Xenophon Team that the bill as it is currently drafted will increase the opportunities for in-play betting in TABs, clubs and licensed premises. This goes against the intention of the government's bill. Indeed, the Department of Communications and the Arts admitted that the definition of electronic equipment within the bill could include smartphones and tablets. They also admitted that they have done no analysis or modelling of whether this will increase the effects of problem gambling.


Consequently, the amendments on sheet 8046 narrow the definition of electronic equipment and make it clear that electronic equipment will instead be defined as an electronic betting terminal which is installed on a permanent or fixed basis at a place where gambling services are provided, is unable to be connected to the internet in a designated supervised area and is available for the use only of customers using cash or a card issued by the provider.


This definition will limit in-play betting to electronic betting terminals to ensure that gambling operators do not seek to expand their operations by allowing people to place in-play bets using tablets or smartphones provided by the venue. These terminals are permanent installations located in a specific area set aside for gambling and are unable to be connected to the internet. We put that if the government is sincere in its intent to clamp down on in-play sports betting it should not be enabling venues to hand out tablets and smartphones to its customers. Therefore, we encourage the Senate to support the amendments on sheet 8046, which will put a stop to this harmful practice.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (12:52):  Labor is well and truly on the record for raising concerns about terminals in licensed venues. As I have already stated, we do not want to see and do not support a proliferation of mobile devices. Minister Tudge, in the other place, has already said that he will act if there is a proliferation, and Labor expects the government to maintain the status quo. We are not supporting the amendment, on this occasion, but I just wanted to put on the record, again, that we have raised concerns about this issue and I indicate, clearly, to the government that Labor does not expect to see a proliferation of mobile devices, given the minister's comments.

I do not agree with the argument and think it is a weak one, respectfully, but could the minister at least humour us and give a response to this amendment? You did not on the previous amendments, but this is a pretty discrete amendment. It goes to the heart of this bill about in-play betting and whether it can be circumvented. This amendment, moved by my colleague Senator Kakoschke-Moore, seeks to obviate that. Can the minister give us the government's position on this amendment and any undertakings that if there is a proliferation of tablets, smartphone devices, the government will monitor it and act accordingly?

As the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, I have the practice of avoiding repeating myself, where I can, to ensure that legislation is passed efficiently.

(1) Schedule 1, item 7, page 5 (after line 14), after the definition of carriage service, insert:



casino
‑style poker or blackjack gambling service has the meaning given by section 8BC.


(2) Schedule 1, page 8 (after line 12), after item 23A, insert:




23B


Before paragraph


5(3)(c)



Insert:


(bc) a casino‑style poker or blackjack gambling service (see section 8BC);


(3) Schedule 1, item 27, page 13 (after line 15), after section 8BB, insert:




8BC


Casino
‑style poker or blackjack gambling service



(1) For the purposes of this Act, a casino‑style poker or blackjack gambling service is a service for the conduct of a game covered by paragraph (e) of the definition of gambling service in section 4:


(a) to the extent to which the game is poker or blackjack; and


(b) to the extent to which the game is conducted in a manner substantially similar to the manner in which it would be conducted at a casino;


so long as the other conditions (if any) determined under subsection (2) have been satisfied.


(2) The Minister may, by legislative instrument, determine one or more conditions for the purposes of subsection (1).


(4) Schedule 1, item 28, page 13 (after line 29), after paragraph 8E(1)(g), insert:


(ga) a casino‑style poker or blackjack gambling service (see section 8BC); or


Items 1 and 3 on sheet 8054 define casino-style poker and blackjack as poker or blackjack conducted in a manner substantially similar to the manner in which it would be conducted at a casino so long as any other conditions determined by the minister, by legislative instrument, are satisfied. Item 2 excludes casino-style poker and blackjack services from the definition of prohibited interactive gambling services. Item 4 includes online casino-style poker and blackjack services in the definition of regulated interactive gambling services.


If these amendments are passed, the person who is licensed to provide an online casino-style poker or blackjack services under a law of the state or territory would face no criminal or civil penalty under Commonwealth law. This would only be a first step towards legalising online casino-style poker and blackjack services. State and territory licensing would still be required, but it is a necessary step.


Despite the current prohibition in the existing law, online poker and blackjack are enjoyed by many Australians. They are entertaining games of chance and considerable skill. And despite the current lack of regulation—or, should I say, loophole of regulation?—there is no evidence that online poker and blackjack causes more harm than the other services this bill seeks to regulate rather than prohibit, like online sports betting. I commend the amendments to the Senate.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts) (12:58):  As I indicated in my second reading contribution, the government believes that online poker poses a risk to problem gambling in Australia and it will maintain the prohibition of these services under the Interactive Gambling Act. The act creates an offence of providing or advertising interactive gambling services to customers in Australia, prohibiting gambling services—including online casino-style gaming services, including online poker—which are played for money or anything else of value. The intent of the act is to minimise the scope of gambling in Australia.


The government was clear in its response to the illegal offshore wagering review that it will not expand the online betting market in Australia. This bill will maintain the status quo and uphold the original intent of the Interactive Gambling Act. Online poker will, therefore, remain a prohibited interactive gambling service.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:59):  Senator Leyonhjelm has obviously thought through this amendment and it would be disrespectful not to respond to it.


I and my colleagues do not support this amendment for a number of reasons. There is an ambiguity as to how it would operate and as to what the betting limits would be. I have met with poker machine players who like playing online poker, and they have made the point that sometimes you pay $50 and it will last you for a number of hours, which is very different from sports betting services where you can lose thousands of dollars with just one bet. Their argument is that there is an inconsistency in the current law that allows sports betting where enormous amounts of money can be lost; whereas, if online poker were regulated with very small bet limits, it would not be as harmful as sports betting. I am not canvassing and I am not commenting on those remarks as such. But, in the context of this debate, whilst I do not want to see any expansion of online gambling, there does seem to be a dichotomy between poker players, who have described to me that they can bet 1c at a time and lose very small amounts of money in the scheme of things, and sports betting. Senator Leyonhjelm has raised an important issue. 


The paradox may be that if there were very low bet limits, and I am talking very low bet limits as a number of cents compared to dollars or multiples of dollars, the impact would be smaller than sports betting as it currently exists. It is a matter that the Productivity Commission raised in its reports on gambling. I think there will still be an ongoing debate on this, and I understand the point of online poker players who say that there is a dichotomy between a game where $50 will keep you playing all day compared to being able to lose literally tens of thousands of dollars at a time with sports betting. This is something that will need to be debated. I do not want to be seen to be encouraging an expansion of gambling, but there is an inconsistency in the approach of the government and opposition to sports betting, where you can bet thousands of dollars at a time per game or per sporting event—per horse race—compared to online poker, where there could be some very strict limits as to what could be bet. It is something that needs to be debated further.

 (New South Wales) (13:03):  In the same way, I have respect for Senator Leyonhjelm with regard to the amendment he has put forward. With regard to these matters, the Senate standing committee's report indicates in its closing section at 2.62:


Whether particular services should no longer be restricted under the IGA is a separate question that this committee was not asked to consider as part of this inquiry.


That is one important point that should be made here in the course of the debate. We do also need to put on the record that the purpose of this particular piece of legislation is to act in a harm minimisation way as a preventative to the adverse outcomes of gambling in our community. I make that point by way of contribution to the debate this afternoon.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2017-03-21,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (13:03):  I want to add a few additional comments to put this into context. There is a very active poker community in Australia. They like to play poker. They like to win. There are tournaments. They make money. Some people lose money. Some of them have high stakes, and they can lose a lot of money at once, but mostly it is pretty small beer. That is not, essentially, regulated very much at all. That occurs in pubs and clubs where people gather, and if you are interested in playing poker competitively, there are no shortage of opportunities. What we are doing here is saying, 'You can't do that online. You can't play poker online with the same sort of people.' The risks are the same—you can lose small amounts of money or large amounts of money—and you bet what you choose. Yet, we are saying, 'No you're not allowed to do that online. You're only allowed to do it face-to-face.' It a little bit like saying to Australians, 'You're allowed to talk to each other by telephone, but you are not allowed to talk to each other by FaceTime, because FaceTime goes via a server in another country.' I am sure most of you know what FaceTime is. It is that method within Facebook of talking to each other external to the telephone system. What we are basically saying here is that one kind of playing poker is okay, but another kind of playing poker is not okay because it is online. Seriously! This is the 21st century. Almost everything is online these days, and to pretend that we can regulate so that you can do one but not the other is dreaming. I think it is very bad legislation. We really should not entertain it.

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (13:13):  by leave—I move Pauline Hanson's One Nation amendments (1) and (2) on sheet 8093:


(1) Schedule 1, item 26, page 11 (after line 13), at the end of paragraph 8A(5) (c), add:


(vi) a service relating to betting on the outcome of a lottery;


(2) Schedule 1, page 13 (after line 15), after item 27, insert:




27A


At the end of subsection


8D(2)



Add:


; or (c) betting on the outcome of a lottery.


My amendments are about a service related to betting on the outcome of a lottery. We have a foreign investor in Australia by the name of Lottoland, who bought a licence in the Northern Territory for $550,000. They are actually allowing people to bet on the outcome of a lottery anywhere in the world. They pay no tax. They are here in Australia. They do not employ a lot of people; they employ about six people. They are providing a service that is detrimental to 4½ thousand newsagents around this country who rely on lottery tickets being sold and who are struggling. So here we have a foreign company in Australia, possibly taking hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions of dollars, out of the country in unpaid taxes.


I also raised this in light of the government moving a bill in this house to address multinationals not paying their taxes in Australia. I think this has been on the table since almost 20 years ago when, I can remember, I raised the topic of multinationals not paying their taxes in Australia. This would be a good reason for the government to support my amendment to shut down one foreign multinational company working here in Australia and to stop the demise of 4½ thousand newsagents who are losing business because of this. If they are fair dinkum about clamping down on multinationals in Australia—in this case not employing a lot of Australians—taking money out of the country by not paying taxes here, then I expect the government and the opposition to support my amendments.

 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts) (13:15):  I thank Senator Hanson and her office for taking the government through the intent of One Nation's amendments. I think my colleagues would appreciate that, under the law as it is, Lottoland is not illegal, and I think that is the point of Senator Hanson's amendments. Lottoland is also not offshore. It is a licensed service in the Northern Territory, and the proposition here is beyond the scope of this bill. As Senator Hanson and One Nation have put this proposition here, the government will examine it, but it is important, with the proposed changes, that there be consultation. So it is not possible for the government to support these amendments in the context of this bill, but, as One Nation have asked that we examine this, we are happy to do so.

 (South Australia) (13:17):  I indicate very briefly that I and my colleague strongly support these amendments. If the government does not support them, I genuinely suggest Senator Hanson put up a private senator's bill. I would co-sponsor it. The sooner we get onto it, the better. We need to bring this to a head. This is a loophole under current laws. It is beyond me that the Northern Territory regulator actually allows this to be licensed. I believe it is a sneaky and tricky form of gambling that effectively allows more people to get sucked in or roped in and become gambling addicts, because this service promises huge returns, but the odds are even huger. I think it is very problematic in terms of it being offered as a service. It also has a real impact on state-based lotteries. Whatever problems you have with those, at least you know that the revenue is staying here in the Commonwealth rather than going off overseas.

I will just add some weight to that because the evasion of tax by foreign entities is something that has not been addressed since 1953. It is something that we must, must get on top of because of our debt situation in this country and the unfairness of our tax system. It needs to be a part of the considered and comprehensive review of our tax system.

"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2017-03-21,"



Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (13:29):  This bill would amend the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 and the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003. These acts concern the issuance of security identification cards, ASICs, and maritime security identification cards, MSICs. It comes to us as a response to a recommendation from the National Ice Taskforce for greater rigour in guarding against drug smuggling in ports and airports through a toughening of background checks. 


When this legislation came on in the other place in the 44th Parliament, we the opposition noted our concern about whether the addition of an organised crime check to the existing terrorism check might inadvertently reduce the level of rigour that applies to the terrorism check. That remains our concern. Our worries about these administrative matters have been deepened by the government's strange secrecy about its broader position on transport issues and its ongoing attempts to undermine Australian jobs. I note you are nodding with me there, Mr Acting Deputy President Ketter. Security standards in Australia's maritime and aviation sector should have nothing to do with politics. Public safety is our only priority. Laws and regulations relating to the security of ports and airports need to be tough and clear so Australians, and criminals who might wish us harm, are in no doubt of the strength of our resolve to keep our nation safe. 


The legislation before us would take background checks on workers in airports and in the maritime sector. Under existing arrangements, people applying for aviation security identification cards and maritime security identification cards undergo background checks. Those checks are designed to establish whether applicants have links with terrorist organisations. This bill would add an extra layer of checking, to ensure that applicants have no links to serious and organised crime. The opposition will not oppose the bill, because we take security seriously. However, we are deeply concerned about the glaring inconsistencies in the government's approach, particularly when it comes to maritime security. 


It was less than 12 months ago that the government asked the other place to support laws that would have removed Australian mariners from coastal trade and replaced them with overseas crews who have not been through the maritime security identification card checks. What was known as the notorious 'Workchoices on water' legislation would have allowed overseas vessels paying their crews as little as $2 an hour to undercut Australian vessels, whose owners are required to pay Australian level wages. It would have destroyed Australian jobs and it was quite rightly rejected in this place. 


Today, we are being asked to toughen background checks on Australian mariners in the name of security. We argue that these proposals are at odds, so the opposition seeks clarity. On the one hand the government wants to enhance security with better background checks, but on the other hand it seeks to reduce security by clearing the way for people who have not been subject to security checks by replacing people whose backgrounds have been vetted. That does not seem to make sense to us. 


Australians know and need to know more about the government's forward agenda for the shipping and the aviation industries. During last year's election campaign—the longest in decades—the coalition released no policies on aviation or shipping. All we have to guide our understanding of the government's forward agenda is its history, and that is a history of trying to undermine Australian jobs. Labor on the other hand has a comprehensive shipping policy that covers the full range or maritime issues, including: security, industry taxation arrangements, workforce planning, cruise shipping, ports, the Australian International Shipping Register and Labor's approach to coastal trading. We also have an aviation policy that sets out all of our policy principles for that sector. If anyone wants to know where Labor stands on aviation and shipping, they can go online and access those documents. 


Australians deserve to hear more information about the principles underlying the coalition's policy in shipping and aviation. That is the thrust of the amendments put forward in the other place and again here today. Our amendments would require the government to do exactly what Labor has already done: sit down and put in the work required to frame aviation and maritime policies. The opposition has always seriously considered enhanced security measures and will also take a non-political path on such matters. Australians of course demand nothing less. Australians also expect us to look at the whole picture around any picture put to us. As it stands, we cannot see that full picture. Let me be clear: Labor supports well-targeted measures that address serious and organised crime. Those who use our aviation and maritime transport systems as means to distribute drugs or other contraband into, out of and within Australia commit crimes. We know it happens, and sensible measures to minimise this trade, detect the perpetrators and bring them to justice are initiatives that Labor will of course support. 


The report of the National Ice Taskforce from December 2015 was welcomed by Labor. We support measures to align and refine the security identification cards and maritime security identification cards to ensure that persons accessing secure areas around airports, ports, aircraft and ships are subject to proper background checks. Labor also supports a transport security framework that has a clear purpose in its own right. Transport security is a vital mission for government. It is a qualitatively different task from targeting organised crime in our transport system. We trust that the government has systems in place to ensure the strong focus on transport security will not be lost with the addition of a new purpose. 


However, it is not clear that the security issues are always considered when the government develops aviation and maritime policy. Two substantial acts exist which govern, respectively, transport security at our major aviation and maritime gateways, including offshore facilities, and which also extend to aircraft and maritime vessels within our jurisdiction. The Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 and the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003 are both post-September 11 pieces of legislation that seek to implement a transport security environment targeting that class of risk. The two acts currently target unlawful interference in the aviation and maritime sectors.


'Unlawful interference' is currently defined in both acts as being acts that impede the operation of airports, aircraft, ports, offshore facilities or ships, or which place the safety of facilities, ships or aircraft at risk, with exceptions for mere advocacy, protest, dissent or industrial action. The current focus is, accordingly, on targeting deliberate behaviour which may cause harm to passengers, crew, aviation and maritime personnel, the general public and damage to property. In a word: terrorism. The changes proposed will add a new, secondary purpose to both acts as per above, and administer this solely through changes to eligibility criteria for existing aviation security identification cards and maritime security identification cards.


There is a potential risk that widening the purpose of the transport security legislation will confuse the two missions of transport security and targeting serious and organised crime in the transport system. Both these tasks are important; the question is whether achievement of both is best done via the mechanism here.


Labor expressed concerns arising from the Senate inquiry in the previous parliament about how this change affected the transport security mission. It is also not clear that the government has fully thought through what it wants in these changes, and that is a concern. The Ice Taskforce called for the aviation security identification cards and the maritime security identification cards to include checks to target 'serious and organised crime', as did the Attorney-General's Department and the coalition majority on the Senate inquiry that last looked at this bill. But the bill is worded much wider than that: it looks at 'serious or organised crime'.


It is of concern that two phrases with different meanings are used variously by the government without nuance as to the difference. In adding new scope to an existing vital mission, it is essential that we are clear about what the mission is. Labor will seek to amend the bill to clarify this, and we hope that the government will support our amendment.


A quarter of a million people currently hold an ASIC or MSIC card. In the quest to target organised crime, it is important to acknowledge they have a right to be fairly treated by this change, as their jobs are at stake. While we will not tolerate criminals in our midst, we need to be careful that how we specify the offence could unfairly affect existing participants in the system. Labor will be carefully scrutinising the regulations that follow this bill, particularly in the area of offences and their relation to the behaviour the system seeks to eliminate. Such a system should have well-justified offences and cut-offs. It should not be open to abuse.


Refusal of an MSIC or ASIC can mean that employees lose their jobs. For this reason, the system must have a robust appeals mechanism. Labor will move to require this in the legislation, and we will carefully scrutinise the regulations when they comes forward.


This legislation fits within a wider system of aviation and maritime transport security. Labor is concerned that the focus on our ports and airports does not remove a focus from those outside secure areas who also have an opportunity to participate in serious crime via the transport system. This includes personnel and their managers packing and unpacking containers in establishments away from secure zones where ASIC and MSIC cards rule. We should care about who is moving high-consequence domestic cargo around our ports. Ammonium nitrate, explosives and fuel should ideally be moved by holders of MSIC or ASIC cards rather than crew on Maritime Crew visas, that are less able to be verified.


And we deserve a government that believes in promoting Australian jobs in shipping and aviation. We know that government can better vet Australians than foreign employees. That only stands to reason. This government in the last term effectively tried to replace some Australian aviation workers with foreign crews when it considered changing air cabotage arrangements in northern Australia. And in shipping, we had Work Choices on water. The government tried to replace the Australian flag on the back of Australian vessels with the white flag of surrender on Australian jobs.


If you work in Australia, you should be paid Australian-level wages: it is that simple. Labor's laws backed a level playing field for Australian shipping employers when bidding for work in Australia. It is in Australia's economic, environmental and national security interests to maintain a vibrant Australian shipping industry. None of the major environmental accidents around the Australian coast in recent years have involved Australian-flagged vessels. If you drive a train across the country or a truck down the Hume Highway, you should be paid Australian-level wages. Arrangements should be no different on the blue highway from the Hume Highway.


Quite apart from removing a level playing field based on Australian standards for Australian aviation and maritime businesses and the people they employ when competing for work in their own country, these policies also work against improved outcomes in targeting transport security and organised crime. Work Choices on water continues to cast a threatening shadow over job security in the maritime sector.


The government's failure to produce shipping and aviation policies mean that we have no idea about its future intentions. I have no doubt whatsoever that the government takes maritime and aviation security seriously, but I and the opposition fear that its ideological warriors will be back for another attempt to destroy Australian shipping. Indeed there are numerous senior ministers who, before and since Work Choices on water was rejected, have indicated their support for its key principles. The government has bitter ideological divisions which are graphically demonstrated by the conflicting nature of the bill before us—and, I might say, many other pieces of legislation—and the government's previous positions on shipping. That is why we seek to amend the bill.


Our concern is not only about the lack of a government policy on shipping and aviation. In recent months there have been a range of other indicators that raise red flags for the opposition. For example, a High Court judgement last August exposed the government's zeal for facilitating the replacement of Australian workers with cheap overseas labour. In December 2015, the government granted working visa exemptions to overseas workers on oil and gas rigs in Australian waters. The government had argued that oil rigs were vessels. It wanted to help employers to cut costs by hiring overseas workers instead of Australians. In August, the High Court ruled the exemption invalid and declared the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection had exceeded his authority.


Since the rejection of Work Choices on water, the Minister for Transport and Infrastructure has continued to undermine Australian maritime jobs by abusing provisions of the existing laws relating to temporary licences. Existing legislation allows the use of overseas crews for temporary work around Australia's coasts when no Australian crew is available. In the most flagrant example of this abuse, the government, last year, issued a temporary licence allowing the operator of the MV Portland to sack their Australian crew and replace them with a foreign crew. The Portland has been operating between Western Australia and the Victorian port of Portland for two decades. This work is not temporary and an Australian crew were available. The existing Portland crew were sacked and escorted off the vessel.



An honourable senator interjecting—




Senator FARRELL:
  Yes, it is a shame. Over the summer break, the Commonwealth and Victorian governments reached a deal with the Portland smelter for taxpayer support to allow it to keep operating; yet, as far as we know, this government is happy to continue to have the smelter supplied by a vessel crewed by overseas mariners. Let's not forget that only two years ago the Harper review into competition policy proposed allowing overseas aircrews to undercut the Australian aviation sector. The conservative economist Ian Harper wanted to allow foreign airlines coming into Australia to be allowed to also fly Australian domestic routes in direct competition with Australian airlines. Just as with overseas mariners, these overseas employees are paid less than their Australian counterparts. 


With so many red flags waving, the government needs to be up-front with the people of Australia on its plans for aviation and shipping. Labor is always up for supporting genuine security measures, but, even if we support this bill before us today, it seems highly likely that the government will undermine the bill's objectives with a fresh attack on Australian shipping. We know this because we have clear evidence that the government previously discounted warnings from its own security advisers by advancing Work Choices on water. We know also that, having failed to secure passage for that disgraceful piece of legislation, it has continued to promote its vile objectives in both word and deed. And we know, despite the political controversy caused by its previous attack on Australian shipping, it chose during the recent election campaign to refuse to outline its future intentions. It is time that the government started being straight with the Australian people. It could do so by accepting our amendments.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2017-03-21,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (13:49):  I am rising to speak on the Transport Security Amendment (Serious or Organised Crime) Bill 2016. In making my comments on the bill today, I want to reiterate the view that the Greens put in our report when the regional and rural affairs and transport committee inquired into this bill last year, which is that we believe preventing serious and organised crime in our ports and airports is a critical issue. But the question remains whether trying to tackle that by tacking that provision onto existing bills, which primarily were intended to deal with threats of a terrorist nature, is an appropriate way to enact appropriate security measures. 


Although we see merit in trying to align the powers of the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 and the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003, we still have some significant concerns with the legislation in its current form. And this is important because this bill has the potential to affect up to 260,000 Australian maritime and aviation workers. We believe that there is the potential for the proposed new background checking to be very punitive for people with particular histories of involvement with drugs. Access to employment is very important for those with a history of drug or alcohol abuse and should not be denied to people who have successfully rehabilitated their lives. We are concerned that, by attempting to add a secondary purpose to the maritime security or aviation security ID cards, the bill's measures could unreasonably exclude work opportunities for a large pool of already disadvantaged Australians seeking work. The fact remains that these cards—the ASIC and MSIC cards—were and should still be primarily identity cards, not security cards. 


We are also concerned with the history of this bill. Submitters representing the workers have shared their concerns that they still do not feel that they have been appropriately consulted and engaged with the development of this legislation. We remain hopeful that, if there are amendments to this legislation being considered and in the rollout of this legislation, there will be more effective consultation.


In particular, our concerns about this bill also relate to whether it is tackling what are the fundamental security concerns because if we are serious about tackling the security holes that exist in our maritime and aviation security policy settings we need to work out whether tacking these issues onto another bill is the best way to achieve appropriate policy. It seems the reason ramping up the checks on maritime and aviation workers is being focused on is that it is the area that fits with the government's ideological agenda, it is relatively easy to do and it gives the impression that they are doing something whilst there are gaping holes in other elements of our security regime.


During the inquiry into this bill we saw lots of submissions that talked about the existing flaws and loopholes in the maritime crew visa background and security checks, and the fact that foreign aviation workers can be excluded from the need for ASIC cards. There is also the issue of exclusion of managers from stevedoring companies and trucking companies who are responsible for things like personnel recruitment, rosters, allocation of ship berthing and directing security. These are positions which are unquestionably vulnerable to infiltration by people seeking to cause damage or to engage in illicit activities, and yet these are not being addressed. In fact, managers, operators and workers in container packing yards, for example, who are often backpackers, have no requirement for MSIC checks. These yards are sometimes only metres outside of the security container terminals and the workers have the responsibility to place customs locks on containers, but they are exempted from the MSIC program.


Then there were the issues raised during our inquiry into flag-of-convenience shipping and the huge flaws and the huge, gaping holes in the regulation of these ships. In seeking to deregulate the domestic shipping industry we have been opened up to many, many more flag-of-convenience vessels. What we risk is that we have a much higher-risk workforce predominating in our shipping industry and a far fewer number of MSIC registered seafarers who are working our domestic shipping routes. This imbalance in itself—the fact that we have a majority of seafarers that are plying our ports, plying our shores and going in and out of our ports are on flag-of-convenience ships rather than on Australian flagged vessels—is a particular security concern.


In the Senate inquiry into flag-of-convenience shipping on the Australian coast there was a startling admission that the federal government's Department of Immigration and Border Protection made where it warned that there are features of flag-of-convenience registration, regulation and practice that organised crime syndicates or terrorists may seek to exploit. Reduced transparency or secrecy surrounding complex financial and ownership arrangements are factors that can make flag-of-convenience ships more attractive for use in illegal activity, including by organised crime or terrorist groups. This means that flag-of-convenience ships may be used in a range of illegal activities, including illegal exploitation of natural resources, illegal activity in protected areas, people smuggling and facilitating prohibited imports or exports.


Here we have a bill that is presenting this image that we are getting serious about organised crime when we know that we have got many, many more areas where there are gaping holes. Some of these areas have been identified and they are alarming. The fact is we have flag-of-convenience ships that are involved in the carriage, storage and delivery of really dangerous cargoes, including ammonium nitrate. There is huge evidence that with regard to the background checks for maritime crew visas for foreign workers who are engaged on flag-of-convenience shipping there is a lot that can slip through the net. So we have ourselves in a particularly vulnerable situation. We have critical infrastructure of oil and gas production, exploration and storage where we have foreign workers with inadequate checks having access to that. Yet we are focusing on increasing the security checks on Australian workers. We have Australian city ports where there are no security checks at all and where foreign crew on foreign flagged ships and flag-of-convenience ships are free to come and go through open gates. These are where we really have the problems and where we really need to focus our efforts if we are serious about addressing serious and organised crime.


We really think it is important that we are addressing issues of serious and organised crime, but we feel that this current legislation is failing to deal with the real problems. So the Greens do not believe that this legislation should be supported in its current form, but we are open to seeing this legislation improved. We understand and have considered the Labor Party amendment being proposed to this bill. We think that amendment, if passed, would significantly improve some of the aspects of this bill. In particular, rather than imposing these background checks just on Australian workers for serious or organised crime, the fact is it should be serious and organised crime considered. If an Australian worker is denied a visa there needs to be a process of appeal because it is important not to be denying Australian workers a visa unilaterally, with many people missing out on their opportunity to be working in our ports. We have to have an appeals process, particularly if you compare that with the situation of the many foreign workers on flag-of-convenience vessels who do not have to have the same checks. We have all of these gaping holes. We know that we can have foreign workers coming through our ports without the same checks, but we are unnecessarily and inappropriately having to have very restrictive arrangements on Australian workers working on our ports.


We look forward to the rest of the debate on this legislation and we look forward in particular to discussing the amendments that have been proposed by the Labor Party. I am hoping that we can see some vastly improved legislation that we will be able to support.



The PRESIDENT:  Order! It now being 2 pm we will proceed to questions without notice.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Transport Security Amendment (Serious or Organised Crime) Bill 2016</title>,BILLS,4,1,speech
"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2017-03-21,"



Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (13:29):  This bill would amend the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 and the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003. These acts concern the issuance of security identification cards, ASICs, and maritime security identification cards, MSICs. It comes to us as a response to a recommendation from the National Ice Taskforce for greater rigour in guarding against drug smuggling in ports and airports through a toughening of background checks. 


When this legislation came on in the other place in the 44th Parliament, we the opposition noted our concern about whether the addition of an organised crime check to the existing terrorism check might inadvertently reduce the level of rigour that applies to the terrorism check. That remains our concern. Our worries about these administrative matters have been deepened by the government's strange secrecy about its broader position on transport issues and its ongoing attempts to undermine Australian jobs. I note you are nodding with me there, Mr Acting Deputy President Ketter. Security standards in Australia's maritime and aviation sector should have nothing to do with politics. Public safety is our only priority. Laws and regulations relating to the security of ports and airports need to be tough and clear so Australians, and criminals who might wish us harm, are in no doubt of the strength of our resolve to keep our nation safe. 


The legislation before us would take background checks on workers in airports and in the maritime sector. Under existing arrangements, people applying for aviation security identification cards and maritime security identification cards undergo background checks. Those checks are designed to establish whether applicants have links with terrorist organisations. This bill would add an extra layer of checking, to ensure that applicants have no links to serious and organised crime. The opposition will not oppose the bill, because we take security seriously. However, we are deeply concerned about the glaring inconsistencies in the government's approach, particularly when it comes to maritime security. 


It was less than 12 months ago that the government asked the other place to support laws that would have removed Australian mariners from coastal trade and replaced them with overseas crews who have not been through the maritime security identification card checks. What was known as the notorious 'Workchoices on water' legislation would have allowed overseas vessels paying their crews as little as $2 an hour to undercut Australian vessels, whose owners are required to pay Australian level wages. It would have destroyed Australian jobs and it was quite rightly rejected in this place. 


Today, we are being asked to toughen background checks on Australian mariners in the name of security. We argue that these proposals are at odds, so the opposition seeks clarity. On the one hand the government wants to enhance security with better background checks, but on the other hand it seeks to reduce security by clearing the way for people who have not been subject to security checks by replacing people whose backgrounds have been vetted. That does not seem to make sense to us. 


Australians know and need to know more about the government's forward agenda for the shipping and the aviation industries. During last year's election campaign—the longest in decades—the coalition released no policies on aviation or shipping. All we have to guide our understanding of the government's forward agenda is its history, and that is a history of trying to undermine Australian jobs. Labor on the other hand has a comprehensive shipping policy that covers the full range or maritime issues, including: security, industry taxation arrangements, workforce planning, cruise shipping, ports, the Australian International Shipping Register and Labor's approach to coastal trading. We also have an aviation policy that sets out all of our policy principles for that sector. If anyone wants to know where Labor stands on aviation and shipping, they can go online and access those documents. 


Australians deserve to hear more information about the principles underlying the coalition's policy in shipping and aviation. That is the thrust of the amendments put forward in the other place and again here today. Our amendments would require the government to do exactly what Labor has already done: sit down and put in the work required to frame aviation and maritime policies. The opposition has always seriously considered enhanced security measures and will also take a non-political path on such matters. Australians of course demand nothing less. Australians also expect us to look at the whole picture around any picture put to us. As it stands, we cannot see that full picture. Let me be clear: Labor supports well-targeted measures that address serious and organised crime. Those who use our aviation and maritime transport systems as means to distribute drugs or other contraband into, out of and within Australia commit crimes. We know it happens, and sensible measures to minimise this trade, detect the perpetrators and bring them to justice are initiatives that Labor will of course support. 


The report of the National Ice Taskforce from December 2015 was welcomed by Labor. We support measures to align and refine the security identification cards and maritime security identification cards to ensure that persons accessing secure areas around airports, ports, aircraft and ships are subject to proper background checks. Labor also supports a transport security framework that has a clear purpose in its own right. Transport security is a vital mission for government. It is a qualitatively different task from targeting organised crime in our transport system. We trust that the government has systems in place to ensure the strong focus on transport security will not be lost with the addition of a new purpose. 


However, it is not clear that the security issues are always considered when the government develops aviation and maritime policy. Two substantial acts exist which govern, respectively, transport security at our major aviation and maritime gateways, including offshore facilities, and which also extend to aircraft and maritime vessels within our jurisdiction. The Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 and the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003 are both post-September 11 pieces of legislation that seek to implement a transport security environment targeting that class of risk. The two acts currently target unlawful interference in the aviation and maritime sectors.


'Unlawful interference' is currently defined in both acts as being acts that impede the operation of airports, aircraft, ports, offshore facilities or ships, or which place the safety of facilities, ships or aircraft at risk, with exceptions for mere advocacy, protest, dissent or industrial action. The current focus is, accordingly, on targeting deliberate behaviour which may cause harm to passengers, crew, aviation and maritime personnel, the general public and damage to property. In a word: terrorism. The changes proposed will add a new, secondary purpose to both acts as per above, and administer this solely through changes to eligibility criteria for existing aviation security identification cards and maritime security identification cards.


There is a potential risk that widening the purpose of the transport security legislation will confuse the two missions of transport security and targeting serious and organised crime in the transport system. Both these tasks are important; the question is whether achievement of both is best done via the mechanism here.


Labor expressed concerns arising from the Senate inquiry in the previous parliament about how this change affected the transport security mission. It is also not clear that the government has fully thought through what it wants in these changes, and that is a concern. The Ice Taskforce called for the aviation security identification cards and the maritime security identification cards to include checks to target 'serious and organised crime', as did the Attorney-General's Department and the coalition majority on the Senate inquiry that last looked at this bill. But the bill is worded much wider than that: it looks at 'serious or organised crime'.


It is of concern that two phrases with different meanings are used variously by the government without nuance as to the difference. In adding new scope to an existing vital mission, it is essential that we are clear about what the mission is. Labor will seek to amend the bill to clarify this, and we hope that the government will support our amendment.


A quarter of a million people currently hold an ASIC or MSIC card. In the quest to target organised crime, it is important to acknowledge they have a right to be fairly treated by this change, as their jobs are at stake. While we will not tolerate criminals in our midst, we need to be careful that how we specify the offence could unfairly affect existing participants in the system. Labor will be carefully scrutinising the regulations that follow this bill, particularly in the area of offences and their relation to the behaviour the system seeks to eliminate. Such a system should have well-justified offences and cut-offs. It should not be open to abuse.


Refusal of an MSIC or ASIC can mean that employees lose their jobs. For this reason, the system must have a robust appeals mechanism. Labor will move to require this in the legislation, and we will carefully scrutinise the regulations when they comes forward.


This legislation fits within a wider system of aviation and maritime transport security. Labor is concerned that the focus on our ports and airports does not remove a focus from those outside secure areas who also have an opportunity to participate in serious crime via the transport system. This includes personnel and their managers packing and unpacking containers in establishments away from secure zones where ASIC and MSIC cards rule. We should care about who is moving high-consequence domestic cargo around our ports. Ammonium nitrate, explosives and fuel should ideally be moved by holders of MSIC or ASIC cards rather than crew on Maritime Crew visas, that are less able to be verified.


And we deserve a government that believes in promoting Australian jobs in shipping and aviation. We know that government can better vet Australians than foreign employees. That only stands to reason. This government in the last term effectively tried to replace some Australian aviation workers with foreign crews when it considered changing air cabotage arrangements in northern Australia. And in shipping, we had Work Choices on water. The government tried to replace the Australian flag on the back of Australian vessels with the white flag of surrender on Australian jobs.


If you work in Australia, you should be paid Australian-level wages: it is that simple. Labor's laws backed a level playing field for Australian shipping employers when bidding for work in Australia. It is in Australia's economic, environmental and national security interests to maintain a vibrant Australian shipping industry. None of the major environmental accidents around the Australian coast in recent years have involved Australian-flagged vessels. If you drive a train across the country or a truck down the Hume Highway, you should be paid Australian-level wages. Arrangements should be no different on the blue highway from the Hume Highway.


Quite apart from removing a level playing field based on Australian standards for Australian aviation and maritime businesses and the people they employ when competing for work in their own country, these policies also work against improved outcomes in targeting transport security and organised crime. Work Choices on water continues to cast a threatening shadow over job security in the maritime sector.


The government's failure to produce shipping and aviation policies mean that we have no idea about its future intentions. I have no doubt whatsoever that the government takes maritime and aviation security seriously, but I and the opposition fear that its ideological warriors will be back for another attempt to destroy Australian shipping. Indeed there are numerous senior ministers who, before and since Work Choices on water was rejected, have indicated their support for its key principles. The government has bitter ideological divisions which are graphically demonstrated by the conflicting nature of the bill before us—and, I might say, many other pieces of legislation—and the government's previous positions on shipping. That is why we seek to amend the bill.


Our concern is not only about the lack of a government policy on shipping and aviation. In recent months there have been a range of other indicators that raise red flags for the opposition. For example, a High Court judgement last August exposed the government's zeal for facilitating the replacement of Australian workers with cheap overseas labour. In December 2015, the government granted working visa exemptions to overseas workers on oil and gas rigs in Australian waters. The government had argued that oil rigs were vessels. It wanted to help employers to cut costs by hiring overseas workers instead of Australians. In August, the High Court ruled the exemption invalid and declared the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection had exceeded his authority.


Since the rejection of Work Choices on water, the Minister for Transport and Infrastructure has continued to undermine Australian maritime jobs by abusing provisions of the existing laws relating to temporary licences. Existing legislation allows the use of overseas crews for temporary work around Australia's coasts when no Australian crew is available. In the most flagrant example of this abuse, the government, last year, issued a temporary licence allowing the operator of the MV Portland to sack their Australian crew and replace them with a foreign crew. The Portland has been operating between Western Australia and the Victorian port of Portland for two decades. This work is not temporary and an Australian crew were available. The existing Portland crew were sacked and escorted off the vessel.



An honourable senator interjecting—




Senator FARRELL:
  Yes, it is a shame. Over the summer break, the Commonwealth and Victorian governments reached a deal with the Portland smelter for taxpayer support to allow it to keep operating; yet, as far as we know, this government is happy to continue to have the smelter supplied by a vessel crewed by overseas mariners. Let's not forget that only two years ago the Harper review into competition policy proposed allowing overseas aircrews to undercut the Australian aviation sector. The conservative economist Ian Harper wanted to allow foreign airlines coming into Australia to be allowed to also fly Australian domestic routes in direct competition with Australian airlines. Just as with overseas mariners, these overseas employees are paid less than their Australian counterparts. 


With so many red flags waving, the government needs to be up-front with the people of Australia on its plans for aviation and shipping. Labor is always up for supporting genuine security measures, but, even if we support this bill before us today, it seems highly likely that the government will undermine the bill's objectives with a fresh attack on Australian shipping. We know this because we have clear evidence that the government previously discounted warnings from its own security advisers by advancing Work Choices on water. We know also that, having failed to secure passage for that disgraceful piece of legislation, it has continued to promote its vile objectives in both word and deed. And we know, despite the political controversy caused by its previous attack on Australian shipping, it chose during the recent election campaign to refuse to outline its future intentions. It is time that the government started being straight with the Australian people. It could do so by accepting our amendments.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2017-03-21,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (13:49):  I am rising to speak on the Transport Security Amendment (Serious or Organised Crime) Bill 2016. In making my comments on the bill today, I want to reiterate the view that the Greens put in our report when the regional and rural affairs and transport committee inquired into this bill last year, which is that we believe preventing serious and organised crime in our ports and airports is a critical issue. But the question remains whether trying to tackle that by tacking that provision onto existing bills, which primarily were intended to deal with threats of a terrorist nature, is an appropriate way to enact appropriate security measures. 


Although we see merit in trying to align the powers of the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 and the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003, we still have some significant concerns with the legislation in its current form. And this is important because this bill has the potential to affect up to 260,000 Australian maritime and aviation workers. We believe that there is the potential for the proposed new background checking to be very punitive for people with particular histories of involvement with drugs. Access to employment is very important for those with a history of drug or alcohol abuse and should not be denied to people who have successfully rehabilitated their lives. We are concerned that, by attempting to add a secondary purpose to the maritime security or aviation security ID cards, the bill's measures could unreasonably exclude work opportunities for a large pool of already disadvantaged Australians seeking work. The fact remains that these cards—the ASIC and MSIC cards—were and should still be primarily identity cards, not security cards. 


We are also concerned with the history of this bill. Submitters representing the workers have shared their concerns that they still do not feel that they have been appropriately consulted and engaged with the development of this legislation. We remain hopeful that, if there are amendments to this legislation being considered and in the rollout of this legislation, there will be more effective consultation.


In particular, our concerns about this bill also relate to whether it is tackling what are the fundamental security concerns because if we are serious about tackling the security holes that exist in our maritime and aviation security policy settings we need to work out whether tacking these issues onto another bill is the best way to achieve appropriate policy. It seems the reason ramping up the checks on maritime and aviation workers is being focused on is that it is the area that fits with the government's ideological agenda, it is relatively easy to do and it gives the impression that they are doing something whilst there are gaping holes in other elements of our security regime.


During the inquiry into this bill we saw lots of submissions that talked about the existing flaws and loopholes in the maritime crew visa background and security checks, and the fact that foreign aviation workers can be excluded from the need for ASIC cards. There is also the issue of exclusion of managers from stevedoring companies and trucking companies who are responsible for things like personnel recruitment, rosters, allocation of ship berthing and directing security. These are positions which are unquestionably vulnerable to infiltration by people seeking to cause damage or to engage in illicit activities, and yet these are not being addressed. In fact, managers, operators and workers in container packing yards, for example, who are often backpackers, have no requirement for MSIC checks. These yards are sometimes only metres outside of the security container terminals and the workers have the responsibility to place customs locks on containers, but they are exempted from the MSIC program.


Then there were the issues raised during our inquiry into flag-of-convenience shipping and the huge flaws and the huge, gaping holes in the regulation of these ships. In seeking to deregulate the domestic shipping industry we have been opened up to many, many more flag-of-convenience vessels. What we risk is that we have a much higher-risk workforce predominating in our shipping industry and a far fewer number of MSIC registered seafarers who are working our domestic shipping routes. This imbalance in itself—the fact that we have a majority of seafarers that are plying our ports, plying our shores and going in and out of our ports are on flag-of-convenience ships rather than on Australian flagged vessels—is a particular security concern.


In the Senate inquiry into flag-of-convenience shipping on the Australian coast there was a startling admission that the federal government's Department of Immigration and Border Protection made where it warned that there are features of flag-of-convenience registration, regulation and practice that organised crime syndicates or terrorists may seek to exploit. Reduced transparency or secrecy surrounding complex financial and ownership arrangements are factors that can make flag-of-convenience ships more attractive for use in illegal activity, including by organised crime or terrorist groups. This means that flag-of-convenience ships may be used in a range of illegal activities, including illegal exploitation of natural resources, illegal activity in protected areas, people smuggling and facilitating prohibited imports or exports.


Here we have a bill that is presenting this image that we are getting serious about organised crime when we know that we have got many, many more areas where there are gaping holes. Some of these areas have been identified and they are alarming. The fact is we have flag-of-convenience ships that are involved in the carriage, storage and delivery of really dangerous cargoes, including ammonium nitrate. There is huge evidence that with regard to the background checks for maritime crew visas for foreign workers who are engaged on flag-of-convenience shipping there is a lot that can slip through the net. So we have ourselves in a particularly vulnerable situation. We have critical infrastructure of oil and gas production, exploration and storage where we have foreign workers with inadequate checks having access to that. Yet we are focusing on increasing the security checks on Australian workers. We have Australian city ports where there are no security checks at all and where foreign crew on foreign flagged ships and flag-of-convenience ships are free to come and go through open gates. These are where we really have the problems and where we really need to focus our efforts if we are serious about addressing serious and organised crime.


We really think it is important that we are addressing issues of serious and organised crime, but we feel that this current legislation is failing to deal with the real problems. So the Greens do not believe that this legislation should be supported in its current form, but we are open to seeing this legislation improved. We understand and have considered the Labor Party amendment being proposed to this bill. We think that amendment, if passed, would significantly improve some of the aspects of this bill. In particular, rather than imposing these background checks just on Australian workers for serious or organised crime, the fact is it should be serious and organised crime considered. If an Australian worker is denied a visa there needs to be a process of appeal because it is important not to be denying Australian workers a visa unilaterally, with many people missing out on their opportunity to be working in our ports. We have to have an appeals process, particularly if you compare that with the situation of the many foreign workers on flag-of-convenience vessels who do not have to have the same checks. We have all of these gaping holes. We know that we can have foreign workers coming through our ports without the same checks, but we are unnecessarily and inappropriately having to have very restrictive arrangements on Australian workers working on our ports.


We look forward to the rest of the debate on this legislation and we look forward in particular to discussing the amendments that have been proposed by the Labor Party. I am hoping that we can see some vastly improved legislation that we will be able to support.

"McCarthy, Sen Malarndirri",ALP,2017-03-21,"



Senator McCARTHY
 (Northern Territory) (14:00):  My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Brandis. The Prime Minister has on at least 16 occasions ruled out his government amending section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. Today, on Harmony Day, we learned that the Turnbull government is proposing the removal of the words 'insult', 'offend' and 'humiliate' from section 18C. What insulting, offensive or humiliating comments does the Prime Minister think people should be able to say to me?

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (14:00):  Might I begin by correcting the premise of your question: the Prime Minister has never, not on 16 occasions and not once, said that the government would never reform section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. He did say, as was the case at the time, that it was not a priority for the government.


Nevertheless, I think we all know that events have happened in this country in the recent past, in particular, the treatment of the QUT students, which was disgraceful, and the treatment of the late Bill Leak, which was disgraceful. The report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, to which Labor senators and members of the House of Representatives continue, proposed beneficial law reform. What the Prime Minister and I announced a short while ago was a strengthening of the antivilification provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act.


What you did not mention in your question, which I think is a very important consideration, is the insertion, into section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act, of a prohibition against racial harassment. Did you know that in 1991, when the then—

Senator Cameron:
  On relevance. The question was: 'What insulting, offensive or humiliating comments does the Prime Minister think that people should be able to say to the senator?' That was the question, and he has not gone near it. He should actually take off that Harmony Day badge. It is absolutely crazy that he has that on.



The PRESIDENT:  On the point of order, the Attorney-General has been giving a detailed response to a detailed question. He is aware of the question.




Senator BRANDIS:
  In 1991, when the current part IIA of the Racial Discrimination Act was recommended, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission actually recommended to the parliament that one of the grounds of racial vilification should be harassment. That was one of the grounds recommended by the predecessor body of the Human Rights Commission. For some unaccountable reason that was not done by the then Labor government. (Time expired)

You may say that section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act and the complaint-handling procedures of the Australian Human Rights Commission Act are perfect and incapable of reform. You may say that, but if you do you would be alone because there is no serious person in this country who has followed human rights debate who says that section 18C in its current form, which actually omits to prohibit racial harassment, or the complaint-handling procedures of the Human Rights Commission cannot be improved.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Employment and Minister for Women) (14:07):  I thank Senator Hume for the question. As you would expect, Labor and the unions have deliberately sought to mislead the Australian people in relation to the decision of the independent Fair Work Commission when it comes to penalty rates. Colleagues on this side of the chamber know why. This is nothing more and nothing less than a desperate attempt by the current Leader of the Opposition to hide from what is a very, very inconvenient truth. Let us put the facts on the record insofar as Mr Shorten is concerned. When he was the leader of the Australian Workers Union—and at that time he had the responsibility of representing the workers—what did Mr Shorten do? He sold the workers down the river! And how did he do that? Mr Shorten, the 'champion of the working man and working woman', did a deal whereby he saw their penalty rates either reduced or removed. Mr Shorten had the penalty rates of some of the lowest paid workers in this country removed—and he was meant to be representing their interests!


Why would a leader of a union charged with representing the interests of the workers sell them down the river? Let me tell you why. The company Cleanevent made a secret payment to the AWU to continue this arrangement for several years, to continue the arrangement of stripping the workers' penalty rates, which Mr Shorten himself did when he was head of the union charged with representing their interests. He ripped the workers off—solely and with intent.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Employment and Minister for Women) (14:09):  The reality is this. Unfortunately, small businesses in this country have had an unfair disadvantage because Mr Shorten and Labor are very happy for big unions and big businesses to do deals which basically either remove or reduce penalty rates for workers on Sundays. Small business is not afforded the same opportunity. Let us have a look at some of the deals that have been done and how it creates an unfair playing field. A bed-and-breakfast, a small business, must pay $10 more per hour on Sundays than a five-star hotel. A family chicken shop must pay $8 an hour more than KFC. A family owned takeaway must pay $8 an hour more than McDonald's. A family greengrocer must pay $5 an hour more than Woolworths. The decision of the Fair Work Commission helps small business and levels the playing field so they have half a chance against the big union deals. (Time expired)

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Employment and Minister for Women) (14:10):  Colleagues, this is yet another inconvenient truth for Bill Shorten, the Leader of the Opposition, and the Australian Labor Party. The Fair Work Commission, this independent tribunal, was set up by the Australian Labor Party in 2009. The Labor Party then tasked the Fair Work Commission to review all awards every four years. As workplace relations minister—he does like to do things himself, like rip off workers and their penalty rates—Mr Shorten amended the Fair Work Act to specifically ensure that penalty rates were considered as part of this process. But they have even more ownership of this decision. Mr Shorten and Labor actually appointed the members of the commission who sat on the panel and made the decision. Good old President Iain Ross is one of those from the other side. So Mr Shorten made the rules, appointed the umpire and insisted on the decision—and now he is running a mile! (Time expired)

Senator McCARTHY
 (Northern Territory) (15:01):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Attorney-General (Senator Brandis) to a question without notice asked by Senator McCarthy today relating to the Racial Discrimination Act 1975.


The answer was incredibly disappointing, in particular on this day, Harmony Day. As we reflect on Harmony Day, I want to go to some of the answers to me and my questions by Senator Brandis. I want to begin with Senator Brandis's response in terms of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. I asked, first up, about the fact that Mr Turnbull has said on at least 16 occasions that he had ruled out his government amending section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. Senator Brandis said that he had not said that—certainly not that many times. I just want to point out some very important media coverage of the moments when Mr Turnbull denied that it was a distraction for his government. In news.com, on 31 August 2016: 'The government has no plans to make changes to section 18C'. He said it again on 30 August in The Australian:


It’s filled the op-ed pages of newspapers for years and years but the government has no plans to make any changes to section 18C. We have other more pressing, much more pressing priorities to address. 


Then again on 14 November 2016, on ABC 7.30, Mr Turnbull said:


18(C) is talked about constantly on the ABC. It's talked about constantly in what's often called the 'elite media'. I've focused overwhelmingly on the economy. 


It appears that Prime Minister Turnbull has changed tack. Today is one of the most significant days in Australia and across the world. The purpose behind Harmony Day is to reflect on the diversity of culture across this country, something that unfortunately has been really stained by the Prime Minister's move to change the Racial Discrimination Act on this day in particular. It is incredibly sad. It really is a watering down of protections against racial vilifications. The irony of it being done on this day! The Attorney-General says he does not believe the Australian people are racist.




Senator Brandis:
  No, I do not.




Senator Bilyk:
  Coming from a white man.




Senator McCARTHY:
  As a white man growing up in Petersham, attending private schools, I am sure you have never been denied access or service in a shop. You have never had taxis drive past, pretending not to see you. You have never received hateful letters and emails because of your race or the colour of your skin. I really wish I could believe there are not any racists in Australia. But certainly my personal experience, and my family's experience, informs me of the reality that I live in this country. It is deeply unfortunate. 


I asked you in my question: what else do you need to say to me and to many other people of different races in this country that you cannot say now? What is it that you are so determined to say that you cannot say to people now? 


My predecessor, Senator Nova Peris, had a disgraceful time in this Senate, standing here, being called all sorts of things—in fact, even on her Twitter account today—in terms of what racism she received from the general public. Just to clarify, in case you were thinking I meant it occurred in the Senate; I meant this is where she raised the issue about the racism that was displayed against her by the general public across Australia. It is really important to put this on the record. She stood courageously here to point out from her own personal experiences that racism is very much alive and strong in this country. We as parliamentarians in both the Senate and the House of Representatives must show leadership about the importance of harmony, diversity and cultural respect. That is something that is not happening now today in the Turnbull government.


Being the target of racist, hurtful comments is deeply distressing and causes deep harm. (Time expired)

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2017-03-21,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania) (15:07):  The Australian people are rightly sick and tired of political correctness, which has been stifling our freedoms—including our freedom of speech. The destructive and divisive victimhood industry needs to be reined in, and that is what this legislation seeks to do. It seeks to get rid of the words 'offend, insult and humiliate' and to replace them with the word 'harass'.


As a former Australian Human Rights Commissioner, Sev Ozdowski, quite rightly said:


There should be no right to not be offended.


Part and parcel of the freedoms and the society we enjoy today is the underpinning of the virtue of freedom of speech. And, along with that, comes the opportunity for some people to behave in an untidy way from time to time. But that does not mean that the state should step in and stop it.


Similarly, one of the great underpinnings of our society in the criminal law is that you should be convicted on the basis of beyond reasonable doubt. Why do we have that? Because in our system of law we believe that it is better that nine guilty people walk free rather than convicting one innocent person. We do protect those freedoms in our society. Indeed, those opposite could say, 'Why do you support a system of law that allows nine guilty people to walk free?' It is because we believe in the right of the innocent to be absolutely protected.


Similarly, with the freedom of speech, we do say in this debate that people should be able to have a robust discussion—that people should not be able to claim a victimhood-type status. The Australian people are robust; we are not snowflakes. But what we as a government firmly believe in is that nobody should be harassed or intimidated, and that is what those on the other side will never tell you about—that there is that protection against genuine harassment and against intimidation. Of course, we all believe that that should be the case.


When we have a law that seeks to bring an absolute world-class cartoonist, in Bill Leak, before the Human Rights Commission because somebody thought they might be offended by him, we know that the law is reaching too far. It is not often that the Australian people will hear me quote a Greens senator in support of that which I am putting forward. But let's be reminded that when this legislation first came in the then Greens senator from Western Australia Christabel Chamarette made some very prophetic comments about 'creating a crime of words':


This will take the legislation across a certain threshold into the realm of thought police …


Even Greens senator Christabel Chamarette saw the consequences of the legislation which has now played out, unfortunately, against the now-deceased—and may his soul rest in peace—Bill Leak and the four QUT students who were harassed in a most inappropriate manner.


And so we on this side believe that the QUT students and Bill Leak were in fact offended, insulted and humiliated by the actions of the Australian Human Rights Commission in its very inappropriate methodologies in pursuing those four students. This is about balancing up our fundamental right to freedom of speech and ensuring that people within our community are not harassed or intimidated.


So I feel exceptionally comfortable with the landing that the government has come to on this. It is a sensible compromise. It is a system which will ensure freedom of speech and, what is more, protection from those who would seek to harass and intimidate. The Australian people will be well served by this legislation. The Australian people will see this as a sensible balance, where freedom of speech is absolutely protected—as it ought to be. (Time expired)

Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:12):  I do want to start by acknowledging the contribution of Senator Abetz on this matter. He is someone who I strongly disagree with, but at least, unlike others, he has been very consistent over a long period of time on his views about this issue.




Senator Singh:
  Don't give him credit!




Senator DASTYARI:
  It is credit for being consistent! I rise today on the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination—Harmony Day. The idea that today is the day that we are going to talk about watering down section 18C—watering down race hate laws in this country—is appalling. It is embarrassing. You could not script the joke that this place has become.


The irony is that the same people who keep going on about this matter of freedom of speech in this theoretical sense are the same people who argue against the right to freedom to marry the person that you love. The hypocrisy there is unbelievable! Where this debate is really headed to is this: as Senator McCarthy said, what is it that is so insulting, that is so humiliating or that is so offensive that people feel the current laws do not allow them to say those things, and feel like they are being held back by the laws as they are written currently?


When we have the challenges of youth unemployment and the challenges facing the economy, what do we have from the government? What we have from the government is this theoretical debate within their own wings which is more about protecting the Prime Minister's own job than it is about the jobs of tens of thousands of millions of Australians who are under threat in a changing economy.


Let's be honest: it is not going to impact the people in this chamber. We are all privileged to be here. But it is the message that you send to society; it is the message that gets sent from the top. It is when you have an Attorney-General who stands up in this chamber and talks about people having the right to be a bigot—the exact words of the Attorney-General, who is sitting here. It is the message that sends to our society.


It is about the 10-year-old school girl who might look a bit different or have a bit of a funny name getting picked on in the schoolyard, and it is about the parents who have to deal with the different children and their kids and what happens in the playground. At a practical level, they were never going to be able to take their cases to the Human Rights Commission—that is not what it is about. It is about the message that we send as a society and the message that we send as a community. Frankly, it is elitism for people who have never faced that type of discrimination and who have never faced that type of language to stand up and profess how difficult it must be for others. What is incredible is when you have groups like the Lebanese Muslim Association and the Executive Council of Australian Jewry—the leaders of the Jewish community—coming together, including many Asian community leaders right across the board and ethnic communities across this country, saying: 'Hang on. What has made our country so strong and so successful has been the tolerance and the openness of our society.' Part of that is the message that comes right from the top from the highest levels of government. When you have a government that has spent more time—more air time, more parliament time, more Senate time and more of the focus of the past nine months since the last election—trying to sort out the internal mess over this issue of 18C rather than the real issues that are affecting Australian households and Australian families, what message is that sending about values and priorities? I say to this government: 'You have responsibility for your actions. You have responsibility for your words.' The message that is consistently being sent by this government and this Attorney-General that it is okay to be a bigot is not the right message that we should be sending to future Australian leaders.— (Time expired)

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2017-03-21,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:17):  I am very, very proud to live in a country like Australia. We all recognise that we are living in the most successful multicultural society in the world, built on a foundation of mutual respect. We are not a racist country; neither I nor anyone on this side of the chamber believes that to be the truth for a moment. The Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Brandis, made that very clear in his answers earlier today. 


It is sad to me that the official opposition, the Australian Labor Party and, perhaps more significantly, the Australian Greens, think that Australia is a racist country. The question by Senator Di Natale during question time was the low point in question time in this Senate. Senator Di Natale, you may think Australians are racist. I do not, and not many people would share your view. 



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald, please take your seat. 




Senator Di Natale:
  I rise on two points of order. I ask that Senator Macdonald not address his response directly to me but to address it through the chair, as is appropriate. Also, I would like to point out that Senator Macdonald is completely misrepresenting my position and I ask him to withdraw. 



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Di Natale, the second point is a debating point. But I do remind Senator Macdonald and all senators to address the chair in their remarks. Please continue. 




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  You always know in this chamber when you are hitting the mark. You will have spurious points of order made as we just had by Senator Di Natale. Anyone who listened to question time today would have been disgusted at the tenor and nature of that question from Senator Di Natale earlier. 


We, as Australians, value freedom of speech and we recognise the enormous benefits that multiculturalism has delivered to our country. We are a very proud multicultural society. I always say that all of us in Australia were at one stage immigrants to this land through our forebears—my forbears used to run around the highlands of Scotland wearing dresses and little skirts—but we have all integrated into Australia and we reflect our traditions once or twice a year at particular times. We have pipe bands, which are good. It is part of the multicultural nature of our society that has been so successful over so many years. 


It is important that we understand how this whole debate started. The original section 18C was preceded by three significant independent inquiries: the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, the then Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's National Inquiry into Racist Violence and the Australian Law Reform Commission's inquiry into Multiculturalism and the Law. None recommended that the current law should apply. Instead, they recommended that the law tackle racist harassment and incitement to hostility. So 'harass' in the proposal put forward by the government today reflects the recommendations of the National Inquiry into Racist Violence conducted in 1991 by the then Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. 


I will point out that it is not just coalition politicians talking about this and raising these issues. A distinguished law professor, Professor George Williams—a former ALP preselection candidate—who is currently the Dean of Law at the University of New South Wales, said: 


Despite its limited operation, there is a good case for amending section 18C. … the law should proscribe extreme forms of speech such as racial vilification and incitement to violence. Section 18C— 


as it currently stands— 


goes too far in applying to more minor forms of speech, in particular words that offend or insult. 


David Marr, a journalist from The Guardian newspaper, of all, says:


I want ""offend"" and ""insult"" taken out of section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. I don't think the law should engage at that level. But I can't see that this country would be a better, freer place if ""humiliate"" and ""intimidate"" went too.


He is even suggesting a stronger response.


The proposal put forward by the government gets rid of the political correctness, it gets rid of the issues that Professor Williams and David Marr—to name just two—have raised in relation to this issue, and it does bring us to a very sensible amendment to a law that has caused so much controversy and has led to such injustice in the cases of the QUT issue and Mr Leak.

Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (15:22):  Today, schoolchildren all across the country celebrate Harmony Day, a day I remember going to my own children's school and celebrating. It is a day when they recognise the different cultures in their school and their community, celebrated through picnics, food, dance and all the kinds of rich tapestry that living in a multicultural country gives us here in Australia.


Whilst those children, the next generation, are celebrating this day—Harmony Day, a day of belonging—little do they know that their government has chosen this day to put forward how it wants to weaken protections against race hate speech in our country. The very things they are celebrating—the right to live in harmony, the right to live peacefully amongst one another and the right to share and celebrate the differences amongst us—are being threatened by their government. Little do they know. Those children, if they had the right to vote at their age right now, I think that they would very clearly not vote for this government. They would not vote for a government that would take away the very essence of what it means to belong to a multicultural society and to recognise diversity as a strength and not as a weakness.


Senator Brandis said that the changes they are going to make to the protections we have against race hate speech are not a weakening or a watering down of them. He calls them a strengthening of them. Taking out three key verbs that are currently in our laws and replacing them with one—he says that is a strengthening. I do not know if that is straight out of the Trump fake news handbook or what, but that is clearly not true. It is not true. It is fake. It is a falsehood and it needs to be named as such. With the little time it appears that the Attorney-General has left in this place, with all the talk of him going to perhaps a posting or perhaps another position in his legal fraternity—I do not know—one would think that he would not want to be the Attorney-General that will go down in history as the Attorney-General who weakened our protections to race hate speech and who jeopardised that fantastic thing we have in Australian that we call multiculturalism.


It goes in the face of what the government announced yesterday with its multicultural statement. I acknowledge and give credit that it was a decent statement by this government, but it is a statement that was not worth the paper it was written on when the next day—Harmony Day—the government comes into the parliament to make clear its intentions to weaken protections against race hate in this country.


Who is happy about all of this? I do not know anyone that is happy about all of this. The only people I can see and understand to be happy about all of this are the very conservative members of the government: the Senator Abetzes of this world, the Senator Patersons of this world and the fringe dwellers like One Nation. They are the only people I can see who are happy out of this. Out of that, let's just have a look at them. They are conservatives who would not have a clue what it feels like to be in the position of Senator Malarndirri McCarthy and her family, or former Senator Nova Peris and her family. Why not actually represent those people? No, they do not care about those people.


They do not care about the people who actually needs these laws and the reason we had these laws put in place in the first place 20 years ago through, I would say, a decent amount of inquiry and reporting that took place in the parliament. No, they simply want to have the right—the right to what? I ask them: what is it that you want to say? What do you want to say to me? What do you want to say to former Senator Nova Peris? What do you want to say to Senator McCarthy? What do you want to say to Senator Dodson? What is it you want to say out there in the community to Aboriginal people, to people of Indian background, to people of Pakistani background, or to people of the many nations that make up this fantastic country of Australia? I ask them: what is it that you want to say? (Time expired)

Leave granted.




Senator HANSON:
  I table an explanatory memorandum, and I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



I rise to speak on my private senator's bill, the Communications Legislation Amendment (Executive Remuneration) Bill 2017. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 and the National Broadband Network Companies Act 2011 to remove the ability of the respective Boards to set remuneration and to give that authority to the Remuneration Tribunal by amending to the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973.


Australia Post and the National Broadband Network Company (NBN Co) are two of six government owned enterprises known as Government Business Enterprises (GBEs) which are defined in section 8 of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (PGPA Act) and are prescribed in section 5 of the PGPA Rule to the PGPA Act.


The other four are the Australian Rail Track Corporation Limited responsible for some 10,000 kilometres of interstate rail, Australian Submarine Corporation Pty Ltd responsible for naval ship building and in particular the proposed spend of $50 billion on new submarines, Defence Housing Australia and the Moorebank Intermodal Company Limited to be responsible for the major infrastructure hub in Sydney.


All these businesses are very different but they share some important characteristics. 


each business has its capital provided by the taxpayer and its existence based on a government monopoly. All the risks are underwritten by the taxpayers of Australia through Australian Government ownership. In these respects these government owned enterprises businesses are unlike any listed public company;


these businesses, with their safety net of government underwriting, were established to fulfil a dominant purpose - to provide an essential service; and


the responsibility for achieving the respective purposes lies with the respective Board and with the Shareholder Minister or Ministers.


I now want to turn to Australia Post. It is common ground in the community that the payment of some $5.6 million to the Managing Director of Australia Post is out of step with community expectations. The way in which the remuneration package was discovered, the response of the shareholder Ministers and the Board and the Managing Director will no doubt become a text book study of what not to do.


It seems that this payment of $5.6 million also permitted the Managing Director of Australia Post to take on other paid work. The 2016 Annual Report of Pro-Pac Packaging reports Mr Ahmed Fahour was also paid a fee of $109,500 last year by the ASX listed. It maybe that Mr Fahour also earned other income but my concern is not with Mr Fahour but with the Board of Australia Post. 


The Board of Australia Post is either unaware its Managing Director has another job in the same space that Australia Post operates in or it is aware and does not care.


The Board of Australia Post has failed the people of Australia and needs to be replaced. In the meantime the power to set remuneration for the Managing Director needs to be removed and given to the Remuneration Tribunal which already sets the remuneration of most of the other GBE's.


Here are the problems with setting the remuneration of the Managing Director at $5.6 million. 


The single payment is excessive, it reduces the dividend to government, but worse it has a flow on effect throughout Australia Post. It makes payment of between $1.3 and $1.8 million to a number of other executives seem reasonable when it is not and that further reduces the dividend. 


The flow on effect goes on and on because these excessive payments come at the cost of moral and a sense of fairness to the real workers at Australia Post, the staff, the contractors and owners of licensed and franchised post offices who deliver the community service obligation. It's a zero sum game: someone has to pay for this excessive remuneration regime.


So the question now has to be asked 'how did this happen'? The short answer is a complete failure of the Board of Australia Post and the Coalition Government who failed to bring to a stop a remuneration arrangement already in play under the previous Labour Government.


I think it is instructive to look at the sequence of recent events. The Board of Australia Post ceased publishing the remuneration arrangements of the Managing Director in its Annual Report in 2013. 


The remuneration arrangement for the Managing Director of Australia Post were revealed in a response to a question at Senate Estimates and a flurry of newspaper articles in The Australian and other print media which was followed by radio and television commentators. Finally we knew what the Board and the shareholder Ministers had known all along.


Once the media took up the story, the Government responded with a letter to the Board of Australia Post. Later the Prime Minister thought the Managing Director of Australia Post could search his conscience and return some of the money. You would have thought the Government was simply powerless to act. 


This Bill makes it clear that the tools necessary to deal with the matter of remuneration were always available to Government.


I met with Communications Minister Fifield on 9 February 2017 and pointed out that the position of Managing Director of Australia was already a principal executive office along with the CEO of the Australian Rail Track Corporation Ltd which seemed to surprise him and he told me he would get back to me shortly. He didn't.


On the 16th of February 2017 I won the ballot for that day's Matter of Public Importance and spoke about Australia Post and said I had been left with no alternative but to try to fix the problem myself because quite clearly no one else had any interest in doing so. 


The Bill before you reflects no more and no less than the removal of the remuneration setting power of the Board of Australia Post and the allocation of that removed power to the Remuneration Tribunal.


The Remuneration Tribunal sets the salary of the Prime Minister which is $517,504. The Chief of the Navy, the Chief of the Army and the Chief of the Airforce receive much less. 


If the Remuneration Tribunal as an independent statutory body can handle the remuneration of the Prime Minister, the judiciary and others managing government businesses then they can handle the remuneration for the most senior officers at Australia Post and NBN. 


Once the Remuneration Tribunal sets the remuneration package for the Managing Director at Australia Post some community confidence will be re-established in the system of government in Australia. Possibly some lessons will learned.


The Coalition and Labour need to get out more. Less time in their political bubble in-fighting and more time with the rest of Australia, the people they so passionately care about when interviewed for television and radio. In 2016 Australia Post reported a dividend of $20 million and that amount would have been much higher probably double if the Board of Australia Post and the shareholder Ministers were not asleep at the wheel of Australia Post.


Before I leave the case for change, I want to look briefly at the remuneration for comparable organisations. 


In the United States (US) the US Postal Service is an independent agency responsible for providing the postal service and like Australia Post it is obliged to provide a postal service regardless of geography at a uniform price. The US Postal Service employs over 600,000 staff and delivers more than 660 million pieces of mail a day yet their CEO has a package worth $1.2 million Australian dollars, which is one quarter of the remuneration of the equivalent position in Australia Post. How can that be justified? It's the same story for the United Kingdom and Canada.


On the 24th of February 2017 the Government announced it would bring the position of Managing Director of Australia Post within the regime administered by the Remuneration Tribunal but it said nothing about the CEO of NBN.


I now want to turn to the Board of the NBN Co and its payment of $3.6 million to the Chief Executive Officer. This Bill also brings the CEO of NBN Co within the framework of the Remuneration Tribunal.


Finally I would like to mention the questions asked and replied to at the Additional Senate Estimates Environment and Communication Committee on the 28th of February 2017. The Managing Director of Australia Post suggested that his religion and his skin colour have paid a role in my decision to speak in Parliament on the issue of his remuneration. It has not.


Personal factors have played no role in my decision to speak up on the remuneration of the Managing Director at Australia Post on the 16th of February 2017. Every other speaker on that occasion agreed the remuneration package for the managing Director of Australia Post was excessive. On that basis I would expect them to support this Bill.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (15:50):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to table an explanatory memorandum relating to the bill.


Leave granted.




Senator CAMERON:
  I table an explanatory memorandum, and I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



The Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Take-Home Pay) Bill 2017 will prevent the penalty rates cut proposed by the Fair Work Commission's decision in matter AM2014/305 from taking effect. 


It will protect workers take-home pay now and into the future.


The Bill ensures that modern awards cannot be varied to reduce the take-home pay of an employee. This includes any reduction in take-home pay as a result of a reduction in penalty rates or the hours to which penalty rates apply.


The Bill preserves the independence of the independent workplace umpire, the Fair Work Commission (the Commission), but appropriately guides the exercise of its discretion to ensure wages are not cut.


The purpose of the Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Take-Home Pay) Bill 2017 is to amend the Fair Work Act 2009 so that the Fair Work Commission, in exercising its powers to vary modern awards, cannot vary a modern award so that the effect of the variation would be likely to reduce, or reduce the take-home pay of any employee.


The Bill amends the definitions of reduction in take-home pay and take-home pay in the Fair Work Act 2009 by reference to new subsections 135A(4) and 135A(5).


Item 3 of the schedule inserts a new subsection 135A in Division 2 of Part 2-3 which requires that, in exercising its powers under this Part, the Fair Work Commission cannot vary a modern award such that an employee's, or prospective employee's, take-home pay is reduced.


It does not require individual employees to provide evidence to the Fair Work Commission of actual loss of take-home pay.


The Bill provides that any determination of the Fair Work Commission made on or after 22 February 2017 that would result, or would be likely to result in a cut to take-home pay under the Award, is of no effect.


At the date of the introduction of this Bill, no determination has been issued arising from decision AM2014/305 by the Fair Work Commission. The effect of this amendment is to invalidate any determination which may be issued by the Fair Work Commission, arising from decision AM2014/305 by the Commission, prior to the enactment of this Bill.


This amendment ensures that modern awards are a safety net for the take-home pay of employees currently under the award and of prospective employees under the award. 


For the avoidance of doubt, the definition of take-home pay makes it clear that all employees under modern awards are to receive the full benefit in their take-home pay of any increase to the modern award minimum wage. For example, the Fair Work Commission may not vary a modern award so as to phase in a cut to penalty rates by offsetting that cut against any annual increases in the modern award minimum wage.


Australia's national workplace relations system can, in simple terms, be viewed in three parts. 


Firstly, the National Minimum Wage and the National Employment Standards (NES); which are ten statutory minimum employment standards that all employees are entitled to.


Secondly, modern awards, which are legal documents that outline the minimum pay rates and conditions of employment. There are 122 industry or occupation awards that cover most people who work in Australia.


Thirdly, enterprise agreements and other registered agreements which set out minimum employment conditions. When a workplace has a registered agreement, the award does not apply. However, in order to have an approved, registered agreement it must leave workers better off overall than the relevant industry award.


At the time of their conception, the then Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Ms Gillard made it clear that modern awards were established to, ""ensure that they maintain a relevant and fair minimum safety net and continue to be relevant to the needs and expectations of the community.""


This provision was further supported and strengthened by an amendment to the Fair Work Act 2009 in 2013 which amended the modern awards objective to ensure that the Fair Work Commission, in carrying out its functions, must take into account the need to provide additional remuneration for employees working outside normal hours, such as employees working overtime or on weekends.


At the time, the Minister for Workplace Relations, Mr Shorten, said ""Our Bill makes it clear that this Labor government believes in the value and utility of penalty rates…""


It is abundantly clear that it was not ever envisaged that modern awards would be cut in the manner the Fair Work Commission proposes in the penalty rates case. The fact that the Fair Work Commission has been able to propose cuts in the manner it has is contrary to the intention of the Parliament. To reduce the pay of already low and middle income earning Australians does not, in the Opposition's view, maintain a relevant and fair minimum safety net, nor is it relevant to community expectations.


It is paradoxical that modern award conditions such as penalty rates, which exist as a safety net, can be reduced by the Fair Work Commission but enterprise agreements, which are negotiated between employers and their workforces ensuring workers are better off overall than the award, cannot be altered to reduce pay or conditions of employment otherwise than in a manner which is consistent with the better-off-overall-test.


Inequality in Australia is at a 75-year high. Wages growth is at historic lows and underemployment is at record highs. 


There could not be a worse time to cut workers' take-home pay; a fate workers will not have to suffer if this Bill is passed.


The decision of the Fair Work Commission, one that was campaigned for by the Prime Minister and Government, affects 700,000 Australians and will have particularly devastating effects on women, Culturally And Linguistically Diverse (CALD) communities, young people and regional communities. The McKell Institute's analysis states, ""For many, the changes are dramatic: full time or part time retail workers who work a full 8-hour shift, for example, will lose at least $72.90 per week. Annually, this equates to a $3499 loss."" Further, ""55 per cent of those impacted by the proposed changes are female…"".


In relation to regional communities, the McKell Institute estimated a partial abolition of penalty rates in the retail and hospitality sectors would result in, ""workers in Rural Australia losing between $370.7 million per annum and $691.5 million per annum."" and ""A loss in disposable income of between $174.6 million per annum and $343.5 million per annum to local economies in Rural Australia.""


In arriving at its conclusion, the Fair Work Commission noted the hardship which the proposed cuts to penalty rates will impose on employees who work on public holidays and Sundays. The Commission observed that, ""…. the variation of a modern award which has the effect of reducing the earnings of low-paid employees will have a negative impact on their relative living standards and on their capacity to meet their needs"". The Opposition agrees and believes the Commission has not given appropriate weight to the effects of reducing penalty rates in reaching its decision.


This decision has implications for workers beyond retail, hospitality and pharmacies. Workers such as nurses, teachers, community workers, disability workers, cleaners and construction workers are, as a result of this decision, at risk of seeing their penalty rates cut in the future.


Through this Bill, Labor is making it clear we don't share the Coalition Government's easy to hire, easy to fire, low road, race-to-the-bottom view of what the Australian labour market should look like.


The way to protect the take-home pay of workers under modern awards is for the decision of the Fair Work Commission not to take effect, and for the Parliament to amend the Fair Work Act 2009 in the way proposed by the Opposition to make it clear that the Commission may not vary a modern award in a way that would result, or would be likely to result in a cut to the take-home pay of an employee or prospective employee covered by a modern award.


I commend the Bill to the Senate.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2017-03-21,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (16:57):  It is common ground that a large number of multinational companies operating in Australia do not pay any tax, whilst others pay very little. This situation is not new, and in fact this problem has been around for a long time. Liberal and Labor governments have done nothing about the problem for over 40 years and, in the meantime, profits made here in Australia have gone untaxed, causing Australia to go further and further into debt. Every Australian is now paying for the failure of governments to get multinationals to pay their fair share of tax.


Just a few hours ago the government voted against my proposal to deal with Lottoland Ltd, a multinational betting company located in Gibraltar, a known tax haven. That decision will cost Australians and the economy billions of dollars. If we can understand how we got to this position with multinationals we may have a chance to dig ourselves out of the problem. Successive governments, both Liberal and Labor, have become captives of multinational companies. They believe that if we ask these companies to pay tax they will leave Australia, jobs will be lost and the economy will spiral downwards, leaving everyone worse off.


Let us look at credit card companies like American Express, Visa and Mastercard. These multinational companies, owned by banks, are residents of tax havens. They pay little or no income tax. They provide a guaranteed payment to merchants and they recover the debt from the credit card owners. Credit card companies make money on the transactions in Australia and they make money on balances carried forward at the end of the month. Some people never pay, and they charge higher interest rates to mitigate that risk. 


What would happen if the government found a way to make these multinationals pay income tax? Would these multinational companies pick up sticks and take their ball home to their tax haven? Or would they stay in Australia and make a bit less profit and pay tax? My view is they would stay in Australia. But, if they do not, there are plenty of alternative players around to fill the vacuum they would leave behind. 


So what has stopped governments telling credit card companies they have to pay tax? The multinationals understand the fear of the government and they work it at every opportunity, telling them what the government needs to do to keep them in Australia. I said in my 1996 maiden speech that we must stop kowtowing to others. If we had acted then to deal with multinationals, we would now be in a stronger position as a country. The government proposes a progressive reduction in the company tax rate to 25 per cent, despite the widely held view that it will give foreign investors a windfall, while local employers, including small and medium businesses, will be worse off.


I want to turn now to the Business Council of Australia, the BCA, which represents some of the biggest multinationals in the world who also happen to be some of the biggest tax avoiders in the world. The BCA have been wandering the corridors of parliament, knocking on doors and selling their message that Australia needs to lower its corporate tax rate to 25 per cent or else the sky will fall in. Many members of the Business Council of Australia do not pay tax, and back in 1996, former Assistant Commissioner of Taxation Jim Killaly said that he estimated a loss from multinationals in Australia not paying tax of around $200 billion per year. Transfer pricing is another killer and a source of loss of taxes in Australia. When we have over 90 per cent of corporate Australia foreign owned, we are in dire straits in getting taxes out of these multinationals.


One Nation come to the issue of taxation with fresh eyes. We are not captives of the multinationals. Our feet are not tucked under the tables of billionaires with harborside mansions. We believe Australia as a nation can negotiate with multinationals for a fair outcome, and in government we would do so.


The United States, like other countries, faces the problem of multinationals not paying their fair share of tax. There is much debate in the United States about how this will be done. I understand the new President of the United States is looking at a lower tax rate, possibly 15 per cent, but on the basis that debt interest will not be deductible. The Democrats in the United States have recently introduced a new bill to deal with the ways multinationals avoid tax, and these include all the same tricks that are used here in Australia, because multinational tax avoidance tricks work in every jurisdiction.


One Nation believes that the time has come to stop being a hostage to multinationals. The world has changed, and it is time we changed the rules to fit the new game. If we do anything less we will be unable to fund our basic health, education and defence services and we will go further and further into debt. To think, even for a moment, that the only reason multinational companies trade in Australia is a function of tax rates is to misunderstand what we have to offer as a nation.


We are being sold short by this coalition government, as we have been sold short by the previous Labor government. It is time for the government to be brave and to say we will not be a hostage to multinationals any longer. If the government is willing to do that, we will hear some bold new initiatives in the May budget. If the government needs help, my door is open.


The government needs to learn from past mistakes. In 2009 Colonial Sugar Refining, CSR, sold its business to a Singaporean company. This multinational agribusiness operates in Australia through Wilmar Sugar Australia Ltd. In 2014 Wilmar reported a turnover of $1,567,605,050 but had no taxable income and paid no corporate income tax. We know the sale of these core sugar assets was a mistake because Wilmar are standing in the way of Queensland sugar growers selling their crop for a fair price.


The government needs to take into account tax compliance behaviour in making decisions about whether these multinationals can continue to operate here. It is a statement of the obvious, but no-one continues in business very long making no money or making losses. Still multinationals stay in Australia, and, year after year, we are asked to believe they make no money. Clearly something is wrong, and this has a name: it is called tax avoidance, and what we are doing is not working.


The government's response is predictable: it introduces another tax law. Today we are being asked to consider yet another lengthy tax law. This time we are being asked to agree to a law that will allow the ATO to tax diverted profits and to increase reporting and information exchange. This law, well intended, will make little difference to the conduct of multinationals. Recently the tax commissioner said he had the laws he needed to combat tax avoidance, but still tax avoidance goes on. Multinationals can outspend the government in every step of the process, including court action. If the commissioner is the farmhouse cat, then there are just too many multinational mice for him to chase. These multinational mice are willing to take the chance of being caught.


The government needs to think outside the box. Firstly, we suggest the government begin by withdrawing multinationals from the self-assessment system, so that the current onus of proof is reversed. This means that the ATO can raise a tax assessment and it is up to the multinational to prove otherwise. Secondly, multinationals need to be approached on an industry-by-industry basis, so that the business models can be better understood and the basis of taxation decided. Particular focus needs to be given to resource multinationals, including those with coal, oil and gas interests. The one-size-fits-all approach has not worked for the taxation of multinational profits.



The
Australian Financial Review reports a tax case involving Chevron Australia, who in 2003 borrowed $3.7 billion from another Chevron-linked financing company. The interest rate agreed averaged nine per cent, making it unlikely any profit would be made in Australia on which tax would be paid. In a more recent development, a Chinese owned coalminer, Yancoal Australia, is buying coal assets from Rio Tinto. At the same time it is borrowing US$950 million from its parent company in Hong Kong. We hope this is not another attempt to shift profits offshore and pay no tax in Australia.


Of course, tax avoidance is not limited to multinationals. Origin Energy is Australia's leading electricity and gas supplier. But despite rising prices and a turnover of $12.2 billion, it did not make enough to pay tax in Australia.


The government must change the way it relates to multinationals. The new way of dealing with multinationals needs to include the way our Foreign Investment Review Board makes decisions. The board needs to take a more strategic and long-term view to stop selling our assets. Many countries— (Time expired)

"O'Sullivan, Sen Barry",Nats,2017-03-21,"



Senator O'SULLIVAN
 (Queensland) (17:08):  I too rise to make a contribution pursuant to standing order 75 on this issue, a reinforcement of the statement of the need for multinational companies to pay tax. I suspect that almost all of the senators in this place would support that principle, making allowance for some of the recent debate—unless you thought the tax was an unfair tax, Senator Williams, in which case you would be encouraged to avoid the law and not pay your income tax, because that is the way you protest to have an unfair tax rule changed.




Senator Williams:
  That's the Greens' way.




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  That is obviously the policy of the Australian Greens. Before I start on the substantive issue, I want to address a small reference Senator Hanson made in her speech. I do not believe she intended to leave the impression that this coalition government would, by act or omission, do anything to protect multinational companies from meeting their tax liabilities in this country. That is the position I want to adopt on that statement, and Senator Hanson can qualify or reject that at another time if necessary.


At the heart of a liberal society is people operating within the bounds of the law. On matters of taxation, on matters of how we operate our business, on matters of how we make a contribution to how our society operates, our government is generally by law and regulations. And taxation is no different. The laws in this space are relatively clear. There can be some complex aspects. But generally speaking you operate your business, you have inputs and expenditures, you calculate all of that and if you are left with a sum of money, known loosely as a net profit, you will pay a sum of tax in those circumstances.


I do think that, in this space, there is a belief that those who might make a great effort to avoid or minimise their tax liabilities to the lowest possible level, where it will have an impact on the economy, are generally within the larger corporate community, including many multinational companies. I do not think anyone denies any corporation or any individual the right to conduct their business and manage their affairs in the best way possible, not just to minimise their tax liabilities but to minimise all of their liabilities. That is how you operate a business. If you take your eye of that, if you ignore that, you will not be in business for long.


But it is unfair to say that this coalition government has ignored this issue. People like me have consistently spoken out against things such as transfer pricing; I find that an abhorrent practice. And I agree with Senator Hanson that it has quite a degree of prevalence. Particularly in and around agriculture, transfer pricing is occurring. It worries me that multinational corporations that are operating in our space—whether they own land or not—would exploit the chance to drive on our multibillion-dollar road networks to move soft commodities and freight and use our port networks and take advantage of the massive investment this nation has made and continues to make in matters of biosecurity. We have a very stable rule of law. We have civil jurisdictional relief. We are one of the most stable countries in the world in which to do business. We have a very low sovereign risk, and that is what appeals to many of the corporations and companies that come here.


The message is very clear. This government has already demonstrated its mettle in the space. It will not tolerate people who unlawfully avoid their tax liabilities. We introduced the multinational anti-avoidance legislation. You might remember that former Treasurer Hockey led a very advanced debate in relation to these areas when we hosted the main visitors from the Western world here in 2015. And there has been quite a bit pursued in this space since that time.


Senator Hanson made reference to the fact that this is impacting on our debt. Senator Hanson, I would have to say that that was one of the few things that I disagree with in your speech. What impacted on our debt was the absolute indolence and negligence of the Australian Labor Party when they were managing the economy of this country prior to a change of government. It was pink batts and school halls that impacted on the massive debt—hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars—that we have got. And, of course, we have an environment where the structural deficits continue.


But, notwithstanding that, this law that was introduced has the potential just in this financial year to claw back $2 billion in tax. Remember, this was resisted by the Australian Labor Party. That is the sort of money that they would have left on the table with multinationals had we not introduced the legislation. Currently, the Australian Taxation Office, I am instructed, are quite aggressively pursuing those potential law-breakers. There are something in the order of 100 very, very significant audits underway, 70 of which are of multinational corporations. The diverted profits tax will commence on 1 July this year, and that provides a powerful new tool to the Australian tax office to tackle these contrived arrangements and uncooperative taxpayers.


This challenge is not just here in our country; this is a challenge across all of the developed economies. This is a challenge faced by many of our trading partners. Indeed, it is an international problem, and the solution therefore requires international cooperation and thinking. Areas such as tax havens, which do not cooperate with the likes of our Australian tax office, make it very difficult for matters to be investigated and prosecuted. These are people, in some instances, particularly with transfer pricing, who have developed some very, very exotic methods in order that they might avoid taxation. As a result, our government will have to visit, I think, some fairly exotic solutions to these problems. I know that one colleague has suggested that we start to look at a royalty on soft commodity exports so as to avoid any impacts on transfer pricing.


My message to multinationals and companies that are being clever with respect to their tax management is to tell them that this is a government that supports statements such as those put up by Senator Hanson that there is a need for multinational companies to pay tax in this country. If you do not want to do that, you should go and trade somewhere else. There are those of us in government, in the coalition—most of us, I would say—who are constantly thinking about the methodologies, constantly thinking about adjustments in legislation and practices, that can achieve this goal.


I have sent the message to Wilmar on a couple of occasions. It was a case provided by Senator Hanson. Wilmar ignored a number of us, thinking that we would not achieve outcomes. I think that, if Wilmar had had their time over again in these last two years, they would have behaved differently. They would have listened more intently to what we had to say, and I think we would have got a higher level of cooperation. So I say to the multinational corporate world: you just watch the Wilmar case. It is not over yet. It will send a clear signal to you of the commitment of this government to see that everybody supports the laws, particularly in the case of taxation. (Time expired)

Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (17:18):  There has not ever been, I think, a more important time for multinational companies to pay their fair share of tax than there is now. Among a number of reasons, there is the fact that, if we look at Australia in 2013, our net government debt at that time was $184 billion, but Australia's net government debt is now $317 billion. That is a net debt increase by $113 billion since the coalition came into office. You would think that, with that growing net debt accumulated by this government, it would act on multinational tax avoidance and it would drop this ridiculous policy position of giving company tax cuts. But, no, that is not the government's approach. It is happy to let that debt continue to scale right out of proportion. It is happy to let multinationals get away with paying the bare minimum amounts of tax, if not none at all. It is happy to give company tax cuts over the next 10 years in the hope of some fantasy of trickle-down economics, all because it wants to attack everyday Australians in this country—everyday Australians trying to make ends meet. That is this government's approach to trying to bring down debt. That is this government's approach to public policy.


What an absolute shame, and what an absolute shemozzle. We have already had here today, on Harmony Day, the government choosing section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act as the most important public policy issue that they want to prosecute on Harmony Day, a day that is all about everyone belonging. They want to water down our race-hate laws in this country rather than actually focusing on what is so important in this country right now, which is decent jobs, decent wages, decent education and health care. None of that is in the purview of the government. It is all about these kinds of strange issues that are led by the IPA or led by the conservatives that attack the very fabric of our nation, our multicultural society.


And now we have them attacking the very bread-and-butter workers of our country, hospitality workers. Some 30 per cent of Australian income earners are hospitality workers. They are in the bottom pay threshold in this country. With these changes that the government want to bring in to reduce penalty rates, they are the workers that will be most affected. Up to 700,000 Australians will receive a pay cut if these penalty rate changes go through, making them up to $4,000 worse off a year. If this is not a kind of nuanced Work Choices mark 2, I do not know what is. Of course, we need to also recognise that it is women that make up over 50 per cent of hospitality and retail workers. Penalty rates are not a luxury. Penalty rates are there for what they need to pay their bills and put food on the table—something that our Prime Minister, unfortunately, is completely out of touch with. I am sure he does not even know where his Medicare card is.


These are the issues that make this country so important and so successful as a nation: having decent pay and conditions and having our safety net for health care, Medicare. These are the bread-and-butter things, as I call them, that this government wants to attack, instead of attacking the taxes that should be paid by those massive companies that earn those massive profits each year, a lot of which end up going offshore and not staying in our country.


There was a time when we had a Treasurer who was Mr 'Budget Emergency'. He has now moved to Washington DC. He has gone and now we do not talk about debt. The government does not want to talk about debt. Why? Because it has escalated out of control. It no longer claims that it matters. It put a $50 billion corporate tax cut on the table when it went to the election, knowing full well the government's debt position since coming to office had increased by $113 billion. 


Modelling done by Independent Economics says that the corporate tax cut is going to cost around $48.2 billion—slightly shy of $50 billion—and that its annual cost will be $8 billion a year. That is a massive hit to the government's budget and the government's coffers. So, of course, they are going after family tax benefit. Of course, they are going after Newstart allowance. Of course, they are going after penalty rates. How else are they going to pay for this massive $8 billion a year corporate tax cut? The ideology of this government astounds me. The fact that they can pick on everyday Australians in this way is abysmal. Yet that is what we have on the table.


Now, in some kind of pathetic attempt, the government are trying to address the issue of child care. Both sides agree that child care has got too unaffordable and it needs to be addressed. Instead of looking at child care as a policy issue on its own, no, this government want to ties it to family tax benefit. It says: 'Let's cut family tax benefit to pay for child care. Let's not touch the multinationals. Let's not touch the corporate tax rate policy that we have in place'—the $8 billion a year that they want to give to corporates—'Let's actually look at low-income Australians, families who are trying to make ends meet, and take a little bit of their money away from them. Take a little bit of money here, take a little bit of money there, a bit of penalty rates and a bit of family tax benefit.' They try and come up with a childcare policy in that way.


On top of that, what do we have? Scrapping the energy supplement is another one. Five weeks wait for Newstart allowance is another one—forcing young people to live off nothing for five weeks before they can access their income support. That is not the kind of Australia that Labor want people to live in. We believe in equality. We believe in fairness. 


I thought it was a slightly bizarre slogan at the last election, nevertheless a slogan, that the Prime Minister chose to adopt. Remember 'Jobs and growth'? We heard it a million times. It was on billboards and the like. He tried the Abbott-style slogan approach with 'Jobs and growth'. Do we hear about 'Jobs and growth' anymore? No, we do not hear about it. We hear about cuts to penalty rates, watering down race hate laws and giving massive corporate tax cuts. That is all we hear about. We do not hear about jobs and growth. Whatever happened to that? it has gone out the window, like so much of the Prime Minister's beliefs. Beliefs on climate change, beliefs on marriage equality—it has all gone. 


Unfortunately, this Prime Minister, as former Prime Minister and a great Prime Minister Paul Keating called him, has been an absolute 'fizzer'. It is so disappointing that someone with the intellect and, you would think, the business aptitude and the political experience of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull would actually want to make a mark of some type during their time in parliament and mean something—something based on what we all thought in this nation that Malcolm Turnbull believed in. Well, that has all gone and instead what we have is this attack on everyday Australians which Labor simply cannot support.


We cannot support a cut to a company tax rate when the Liberals and the Nationals have so badly increased debt in this country—from $184 billion to $317 billion, as currently project in MYEFO. That is a near doubling of Australia's government debt. That is why there is a need now more than ever for multinational companies to pay their fair share of tax. It is so unfair to take away from everyday Australians, the majority of Australians who are trying to make ends meet, and let these massive companies get away with murder. It is absolutely disgusting and the government needs to do something about it.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2017-03-21,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (17:28):  It is a bit rich to be lectured at by a senator from the Labor Party. When in government, they inherited not only a surplus in 2007 but about $40 billion in the bank, and they passed over a debt of $200 billion. We know we are having to borrow offshore $400 million a day—$1.2 billion a month—to repay Labor's debt.




Senator Singh:
  What about the global financial crisis?




Senator BACK:
  Don't talk to me about debt. I do agree with Senator Hanson, as everyone else does, that it is only fair that multinational companies pay their tax. But it is interesting that that $2 billion a year that the tax commissioner thinks multinationals are not paying is about six weeks interest on Labor's debt from 2007 to 2013. In a speech the taxation commissioner made on 16 March, he really advised us where the real figures lie. He said, 'Yes, it's probably the case that multinationals are avoiding about $2 billion a year in tax and I will tell you how this government is working to make sure they pay the lot.' 


But the taxation commissioner said that it is average Australians who are actually costing the budget about $19.7 billion in claims they should not be making for work-related expenses. He said that is by far and away the largest component. He said the second biggest component is:


… a willingness on the part of ordinary Australians to ignore the tax evasion implicit in paying cash for a kitchen renovation or cheap meal.


So $24 billion to $25 billion each year is lost to the Australian economy as a result of people willing to participate in the cash market. His projection is it is about $2 billion a year. Tax Commissioner Jordan said:


Getting every single dollar out of multinationals and large corporates is not going to make a dent.


The biggest of all is individuals, wage and salary earners, claiming work-related expenses. So that's what we've actually got to focus on—


in this country.


It is interesting that Senator Singh came into this place and criticised the coalition government, because in 2015, when the Turnbull government introduced the multinational anti-avoidance law, which I will refer to as MAAL—a piece of legislation expected to claw back about $2 billion under its crackdown on multinational tax avoidance this year—where was the Australian Labor Party? It is a shame Senator Singh is not here to answer the question. Because the Labor opposition opposed it, we required the support of the Greens political party to get that legislation passed. Labor were very happy to allow the multinationals to continue to avoid paying that tax. It is interesting that they have some chance of redeeming themselves—



Senator Dastyari interjecting—




Senator BACK:
  Senator Dastyari, this time around. This year the Turnbull government has introduced the Treasury Laws Amendment (Combating Multinational Tax Avoidance) Bill 2017. It gives the Labor opposition the opportunity to realise their sinful ways and, in fact, this time around to support that legislation. It is nowhere near as effective as the MAAL legislation, which this year will claw back about $2 billion, but at least the new combating multinational tax avoidance bill will yield some hundreds of millions of dollars.


In the time available to me I will make a few points about who pays tax in this country. Who are the two biggest taxpayers in this country? Are they the banks? No, they are not. Are they the insurance companies? No, they are not. As Senator Smith knows only too well, the two biggest taxpayers in this nation come from our home state of Western Australia. By a country mile is BHP Billiton, which paid in 2014 some US$4.9 billion. That was two years ago, so it is probably closer to $6 billion now. When royalties and the resource rent tax are taken into account, BHP Billiton paid more than $8.7 billion, more than A$10 billion at a rate, if you do not mind, of some 45 per cent. As the minister for resources would know, the contribution by the big resources company is massive—US$8.7 billion. I will go to Rio Tinto. In 2015 Rio Tinto paid in Australia US$1.5 billion in tax and $1.4 billion in government royalties to either federal or state government entities. Rio Tinto and BHP pay their fair share. 


I listened to the comments made by senators in this place. Once again it is important to understand how misinformation can get out. Regrettably, it was the then member for the Pilbara, Mr Brendon Grylls, who jumped on the figure of 50c a tonne for iron ore in Western Australia and invited the entire Western Australian community to believe that the only figure paid per tonne of iron ore by the two majors, BHP and Rio, was 50c. Well, here are the facts. In fact, enough people in the Pilbara must have believed him, because Mr Grylls is no longer the member for the Pilbara. Those two companies pay about $18 per tonne for iron ore, not 50c a tonne. Of that $14 is tax, about $4.50 per tonne is paid as a royalty depending on the price and, lo and behold, at the bottom of it all is a figure of 50c. So what did Mr Grylls do? He grabbed hold of the 50c and conveniently forgot the $17.50 and ran the line that the only figure that BHP and Rio Tinto pay is 50c a tonne. The community of Western Australia has spoken and have a very good idea on Mr Grylls's contribution. It was his own electorate that voted him out the other day.


I will go to other multinationals that seem to be the subject of a lot of scrutiny: Chevron and its partners on Gorgon and Wheatstone on the North West Shelf—Gorgon on Barrow Island and Wheatstone near the town of Onslow. Here are some figures just to alert you to the value of multinational investment in this country. Some $60 billion—not million; $60,000 million—has been paid of local content to the Australian economy in the construction phase of the Wheatstone and Gorgon projects to date. Over the 30-year life of Gorgon and Wheatstone, it is predicted that there will be a contribution to Australia's GDP of over $1 trillion, more than 150,000 full-time equivalent jobs and $340 billion to federal government revenue. Already in the town of Onslow—which, as Senator Smith and I know, is just a small regional town—some $250 million of social infrastructure has gone into Onslow.


So this is the level of investment. Is there anything else in Australia like this? A hundred billion dollars has been invested by Gorgon and their partners in those two projects. Let me put US$100 billion into perspective—that is A$130 billion. If the Snowy Mountains scheme were built today, it would be a A$9 billion project. Contrast that with A$130 billion in just two projects alone, as Australia goes to being the biggest LNG exporter.


You will hear commentary on the petroleum resource rent tax. Remember: that is a super profits tax, on top of the normal taxes paid by multinationals. You should know that better than anybody.

"Ketter, Sen Christopher",ALP,2017-03-21,"



Senator KETTER
 (Queensland) (17:38):  I rise to make a contribution in respect of the need for multinational companies to pay tax. I think it is good that this matter has been brought to the chamber for discussion today. It is, of course, something that many Australians feel very strongly about. As I get around in the state, very often people will talk to me about a range of issues, but they will generally raise this concern that they have about gigantic companies operating in Australia and making significant profits but then the Australian community not getting the benefit of the fair share of taxation that flows from that.


In the chamber today, I note that Senator Dastyari is here. As the former chair of the Senate Economics References Committee, he has done some extremely good work. I also acknowledge former Senator Milne for her efforts in shining a light on this issue. So we can be proud of the efforts of this Senate in addressing this issue and in attempting to do the work that the community expects of us in highlighting the problems associated with multinational tax avoidance.


But I must say that, in a desperate effort to distract attention away from its $50 billion tax cut to large companies, including the big banks, this government is pretending that it is serious about reducing multinational profit shifting. As chair of the Senate Economics References Committee, I have spent a great deal of time wading through large amounts of information and published reports that need to be looked at. Despite my best efforts and the efforts of the Labor Party and others in this place, and the efforts of some of Australia's most prestigious journalists, the government continues to have a soft touch when it comes to multinational tax avoidance. As usual with this government, you have to follow the numbers and not the spin. The coalition's attempts to tackle multinational tax avoidance, such as the diverted profits tax, will raise just $200 million over the forward estimates. When it was announced in the 2016 budget, Labor signalled that we would support the diverted profits tax, and we welcome any coalition attempts to close loopholes, no matter how small.


To his credit, the Treasurer, in a mad scramble, just scraped in on his own deadline for releasing the diverted profits tax draft legislation before the end of last year. After all, in mid-November Treasury officials had told the Senate estimates that the legislation was yet to be drafted, but since then the government has done some tweaks, most of them behind closed doors. In the lead-up to the 2016 budget, the government appears to have backgrounded journalists about possible changes to the safe harbour thin capitalisation provisions for multinational debt deductions—namely, a lowering of the current 60 per cent threshold to 50 per cent, which appears to have been pulled at the last moment. In stark contrast, Labor went to the 2016 election with a plan to close debt deduction loopholes exploited by multinational companies. Our reforms would deliver $1.6 billion over the forward estimates and $5.9 billion over the decade.


If the government were serious about getting tough on multinationals, they would do something about the one in three big companies that pay no tax. The most recent 2014-15 tax office tax transparency data shows that more than one in three large firms pay no tax. This includes 109 companies that paid no tax despite reporting more than $1 billion in total income. This transparency data report, covering 1,904 companies in total, is only available thanks to Labor's tax transparency laws, which passed the parliament in 2013 over the objections of the coalition. The Liberals and Nationals voted against those laws at the time. A little while later, they voted with the Greens to water down Australia's tax transparency laws, taking two-thirds of private companies out of the reporting net. Comparing the most recent figures for the tax year 2014-15 with data for the 2013-14 tax year shows that the share of large firms paying no tax has stayed unchanged, at 36 per cent in both years. This points to the coalition's failure to crack down on multinational tax avoidance. Labor led the way on tackling multinational tax avoidance under the Gillard government, in the face of blanket opposition from the coalition, while the coalition government has had to be dragged into action.


Over 3,000 Australian Taxation Office jobs were slashed under the Abbott-Turnbull government, undermining enforcement ability and losing institutional knowledge. Back in 2015, coalition MPs cheered when former Prime Minister Tony Abbott told parliament:


So far the only idea they—


the Labor Party—


have come up with is to spend $100 million on the ATO to raise $1 billion. Well, next time they will be telling us to spend $1 billion on the ATO to raise $10 billion. That is the problem. All they can think of is spending more and taxing more.


Yet in the 2016 budget the government did precisely that, claiming that a $679 million investment will raise more than five times as much, $3.7 billion. If this is true, it must also be the case that the government's savage cuts to the tax office, axing over 3,000 jobs, have cost revenue over the past few years. Promising to restore some of the tax office's funding in this budget is an admission of failure, not a new crackdown on multinationals.


The difference between Labor and Liberal could not be starker. We will put people first, while the 2016 budget has shown that Mr Turnbull and the Liberal Party will look after high-income earners and multinationals. The government has seriously mismanaged the budget. The recent mid-year budget update has confirmed Mr Turnbull's and Mr Morrison's economic plan is in tatters, leaving Australia's gold-plated AAA credit rating at real risk. The figures confirm that debt and deficits are continuing to blow out at the same time as the economy is shrinking and full-time jobs are disappearing. Net debt has blown out to an estimated $317 billion since the Liberals took office, up from $184 billion when they took office. Deficits over the forward estimates have blown out by another $10 billion. Since the first budget, the budget deficit for 2017 has blown out tenfold from $2.8 billion to $28.7 billion. The projected surplus in 2020-21 has shrunk and is now wafer thin, leaving us in the danger zone when it comes to the AAA credit rating—a weakening economy that has delivered more than $30 billion in revenue write-downs.


Yet the government refuses to drop its $50 billion tax handout to big business. Mr Turnbull's great big economic plan has been exposed for the laugh-out-loud farce that it is. Their own modelling suggests that a company tax cut, funded by higher personal income taxes, will raise household income by just 0.1 per cent in the mid-2030s. Household income gain of 0.1 per cent is equivalent to about one month's income growth. Whilst handing over an easy $50 billion to large companies, Mr Turnbull is smashing household budgets today through his cuts to Medicare, schools and family payments. The Turnbull government's company tax handout could also put Australia's AAA credit rating at risk, which could smash family budgets by putting up mortgage payments.


There is a complex web of tax avoidance amongst many of the major corporations and we need to deal with that. One look at it is not enough; we will always need to be vigilant and always need to be on top of corporate tax. Here we have Mr Turnbull cutting penalty rates and offering up a tax cut to some of the biggest corporations in the world when they are not paying their fair share of tax at the moment. 


The evasiveness of multinational company executives who fronted the corporate tax avoidance inquiry, particularly from the pharmaceutical and tech industries, left the impression that they have something to hide. I think the effective level of tax of some of the pharmaceutical companies was of the lowest order amongst the multinational companies. It is clear that some multinationals will go to extreme, even absurd, lengths to conceal their tax minimisation practices. The audacity of certain multinationals in refusing to comply with legitimate and reasonable requests for information leaves me with reason to suspect that the current framework for tackling multinational tax avoidance needs significant improvement. The unwillingness of many multinationals to openly discuss their tax arrangements underscores the need to establish mechanisms to increase transparency. Effectively, companies that do not have standardised pricing across the jurisdictions can charge whatever the market will bear and then back out the profits through transfer pricing. Allowing multinationals, in effect, to arbitrarily attribute value between countries provides them with opportunities to price gouge Australian consumers while, at the same time, reducing the tax liabilities of their Australian subsidiaries.


Perhaps the most reckless parts of the government's inability to combat multinational tax avoidance are their false attempts at true reform. I would strongly encourage the government to adopt Labor's broad selection of reforms, as outlined in our policy agenda.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2017-03-21,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (17:48):  We should all pay our fair share of tax: I think everyone in here agrees on that. With a progressive tax system in Australia, it is only fair that low-income Australians pay a lower rate of tax than high-income Australians or wealthy Australians who pay a higher rate of tax. That is what the basis of a progressive tax system is. The Greens would obviously like to see higher income Australians taxed at an even higher rate. We have had policies in place for a buffer tax and a millionaires' tax and we have opposed tax cuts to wealthy Australians. 


While we have this matter of public interest from One Nation today, let's be very clear: in this 46th Parliament, the Labor and Liberal parties, along with One Nation, supported tax cuts to the wealthiest 20 per cent of Australians. While the Greens thought that was disgusting and a sellout of the battlers that One Nation purport to represent, we do agree with One Nation today on the simple proposition that multinational corporations are not paying their fair share of tax. In fact, we can especially agree on the fact that it is not fair for some of the biggest and most profitable companies in the world to pay no tax at all. In fact, by coincidence, it was just reported in New Zealand today—and I am sure Senator Dastyari is on it, because he has been tax watcher for some time—that Apple have paid no tax— 




Senator Dastyari:
  Shame.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  in New Zealand for the last 10 years. What a surprise! We discovered the same thing here in Australia. We are in this situation where we have large companies that need to pay their fair share of tax. 


Interestingly, Mr Chris Jordan, the head of the Australian tax office was talking about tax avoidance and cracking down on it in a speech last week and said:


The sentiment in Australia is very strong in this regard. The stories and coverage of…base erosion and profit shifting related issues over the past couple of years have led to unprecedented levels of interest in the tax behaviour of large corporates, especially multinationals.


As a result, the new multinational anti-avoidance law, the MAAL, was introduced—


last year and now we have a diverted profits tax, or what is commonly called a 'Google tax' about to come to parliament.


I would also like to put on record my thanks to former Senator Christine Milne who was the Leader of the Greens and who initiated the multinational tax avoidance inquiry in 2013, which led to a large number of inquiries on this subject over a long period of time and which have, of course, snowballed. Thanks to the good work of the Senate, this public sentiment—also driven by a large number of stakeholders, particularly stakeholders like the Tax Justice Network and others who have campaigned on this issue for decades—is finally bearing some fruit. So for One Nation to come in here and say that nothing is being done on tackling the issue of multinational tax avoidance is actually incorrect. In fact, it is so they can set themselves up to look like they have delivered something—an actual policy, a real policy—when in fact, this parliament is actually getting on with doing the job. 


Saying that, there is still an absolutely long way to go. The hundreds of millions that might be raised by the legislation about to come to this parliament is nothing on what is needed to raise revenue in this country. It goes nowhere near covering a $40 billion tax cut that we are about to give to corporations. There is much more we need to do in this country to raise revenue. It all about revenue. We need to make sure the petroleum resource rent tax is fixed and, unlike Senator Back, I do not necessarily believe that BHP, Rio Tinto and Chevron—three corporates pinned in our inquiry for not paying enough tax—are actually paying their fair share.

When I spelt it out, she said, 'How is the government going to pay for it if you and other crossbenchers won't go along with that?' I said, 'Let's dig into the so-called Google tax. There's plenty of money there. Get the money from Google.' I notice that the Treasurer, Mr Morrison, has claimed that we will have with the Google tax, as it is colloquially known, the toughest laws in the world to fight multinational tax avoidance. I hope that is true. I hope that happens. He has been talking about having 40 per cent tax penalties for multinationals who do not play the game. I hope that is true. We are told the ATO is going to finally concentrate on the multinationals' tax avoidance. We hope that is true too. As we have just been told by Senator Whish-Wilson, it was Christine Milne five years ago who instigated the Senate inquiry.

Senator Whish-Wilson mentioned Apple in New Zealand. I had to laugh when I heard on the news: 'It has been found out that Apple in New Zealand haven't been paying their money there. With all their profits, they have paid no tax because it's all been going to Australia.' That sounds great! So we get it? No, we do not. It goes to Ireland. It does not come to Australia.

Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (17:54):  I rise to speak on today's matter of public importance, which is the need for multinational companies to pay their fair share of tax. The government's bid to combat multinational tax avoidance is only a token action. The government must put tax reform back on the table and be prepared to consider reforms that have the capacity to make a real difference to the budget without making cuts to 99 per cent of the population. The government can start by looking at a financial transactions tax, a tax between 0.01 per cent and 0.1 per cent—and I am being very conservative here; I could raise it—applied only to six high-frequency share-trading companies. This tax is likely to raise, conservatively, $1.4 billion a year at a minimum, without taking money from Australia's pensioners, families, students and jobseekers. A 15 per cent death tax on estates worth more than $5 million would raise $5 billion a year and would only impact the top 0.8 per cent of Australians. A cap on capital gains tax exemptions for houses worth more than $2 million would raise $3 billion per year, and 56 per cent of the revenue raised would come from Australia's top 10 per cent of earners. 


These things have all been costed independently. They have come from the Australia Institute. And what do you know? The Treasurer and his ego will not even look at them. Being conservative, we can raise $10 billion in a year. The government is struggling to balance the budget, because it is taking crumbs from the people in Australia who need them the most. A government that takes $50 a fortnight from pensioners or families has completely wiped out their budget for power, or the funds they have stored away to cover insurance or groceries, let alone put milk on the table. But the economic and tax reforms I have mentioned here are a drop in the ocean in terms of wealth held by the groups targeted. All I am talking about is hitting, mostly, one per cent of the top-earning Australians and their companies in this nation, and we can leave our pensioners alone finally. (Time expired)

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2017-03-21,"



Senator STERLE
 (Western Australia) (17:57):  I present a report of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee relating to the committee's inquiries concerning the importation of seafood and seafood products. I move:


That the Senate adopt the recommendations contained in the report, as circulated to senators. 


Question agreed to. 




Senator STERLE:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


When I first came into this chamber, nearly 12 years ago, one of my first inquiries when I was put onto the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee was an inquiry into the importation of citrus canker. My first thought was, 'My goodness me; I hope I don't catch that!' It was not funny, let me tell you. It ended up wiping out the citrus industry in Emerald in Queensland. What had happened was that, through very mischievous devices and deviousness, someone had imported some citrus—I think it might have been some stems or some buds—hidden in tea. To cut a long story short, there was a biosecurity outbreak, and it went mad through Queensland. Every citrus tree in the Emerald growing area—orange, lemon or lime—had to be destroyed. 


We have now, unfortunately, found that a massive biosecurity clusterstuff has happened here in Australia in the seafood industry. I am not sending out a scare campaign, because those poor devils that are affected already know. I want to mention some statistics for the Senate. They go to the value of crustaceans—prawns, crabs, marron, gilgie, rock lobster, which we call red crayfish, and all crustaceans. This is the value to Australia of wild caught crustacean species at the last count, in 2014-15: rock lobster, a $668 million industry; prawns, $272 million; other, which includes crabs and other crustaceans, $61 million. That is a total of $1.001 billion to Australia. Then we add the value to Australia of farmed crustacean species, through aquaculture. Once again, the latest figures are for 2014-15. The value of prawns is $86 million; other, $4 million. A total of $90 million. For both wild and farmed that is a total of nearly $1.2 billion worth of exports and local market production. Unfortunately, an outbreak of a disease in prawns, called white spot, was discovered in the Logan River in Queensland, in the aquaculture area. After a series of tests the industry has been shut down. The farm ponds have been drained. You have to understand that the aquaculture facilities, as well as producing prawns for the domestic and export markets, breed the little ones that are sent off to other parts of Australia.


On Thursday I was in Queensland. While I was there, unfortunately, it came out that the white spot outbreak is now in Moreton Bay. We, Senator O'Sullivan and I in particular, have gone through this intensely in Senate estimates. This is a massive, massive stuff up that has occurred for a number of reasons. One reason is that absolutely devious importers of seafood have been bringing in prawns from countries where prawns are affected by white spot. Part of the biosecurity of this nation and the IRA is an inspection regime that is carried out by the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources. The inspectors have certain guidelines, under which they have to go in and take a certain number of samples from the containers. These prawns normally come in in container loads of between 17,000 and 24,000 tonnes at a time. You can imagine how many thousands and thousands of prawns come in. The inspectors are supposed to go in there and determine which boxes will be opened, which pallets will be pulled out, which pallets they will go to—hopefully in the middle of the container and at the back of the container. But what has happened, it came out in Senate estimates, is that some inspectors have not bothered to go out into the freezer facility. They have not bothered to go out there and make sure that when the container is cut there is still the security band—the tin thing; the name for it has just escaped me. What they have done is wait in board rooms or in the waiting room while the importer has brought out a sample of prawns. I know this sounds hard to believe for all of us in this chamber. The importers have said, 'Here you are, mate. Here are the prawns that we've brought in from Vietnam, from Thailand, from somewhere else in South-East Asia, from China or from South America,'—whatever it is—'Test them.' Of course none of the tests came back positive. They all came back negative—no white spot.


So how the heck did we suddenly have to close down the aquaculture prawn industry in South-East Queensland because there has been an outbreak of white spot? Are we seriously stupid enough to believe the nonsense that the department was running as a defence in Senate estimates: 'It's only a little bit. We're testing it. We'll just make sure that, ooh, look, hopefully it's not got out.'? As if the prawns in the Logan River stopped when they got to the edge of the river mouth and thought, 'Hang on, gang. We'd better not go any further so we don't infect our brothers and sisters in the wild catch area.' This is ridiculous.


I have read these figures to you. Any sensible Australian would sit back and say, 'Someone's head has to roll.' Rolling a head or two, whether they be of the crooked importers—and we will chase them; we will be going around this nation finding out how the hell this happened—or departmental officials who did not do their job properly, we can kick their backsides all the way across the Nullarbor. At the end of the day, thousands of Australians are going to be affected by this. I will roll off some employment figures, before I get to the poor devils who invested everything they have to get these businesses up and running, whether they be in aquaculture or whether they be in wild catch where they are investing in boats. We know through other seafood inquiries that it is not cheap to get into this industry. It is estimated that 13,813 people are employed in the Australian commercial fishing and aquaculture industry, based on 2011 census data.


I hope and pray that those prawns got to Moreton Bay, chucked the skids on and did not head north. You are joking if you think that this has not gone further. God help us if this has gone right into our wild catch along the Queensland coast. I am not a Queenslander. I am not from the Gulf of Carpentaria or the Top End. But I know very well how important the seafood industry, not only prawns but the rock lobster fishery, is to Western Australia. We have one of the best rock lobster fisheries. This white spot outbreak is very serious. The sad part is that if it destroys the crustaceans it will destroy our export markets, it will destroy our domestic markets and it could possibly destroy the livelihoods of thousands of Australians even before we get to the business people.


On that, Senator O'Sullivan and I will travel the nation along with the other diligent, hardworking members of the committee. This is not a goose chase; this is a very serious inquiry.




Senator Kim Carr:
  A prawn chase!




Senator STERLE:
  It is a spot chase. To cut a long story short I should ignore that interjection, because you got me on the hop there, Senator Carr. It was a good one. I am absolutely alarmed that this has happened in this day and age. Unfortunately, we will come back here. I cannot see any good coming out of this. I do not know what the hell it is that these importers—I tell you we will find out who you are and we will report you to the relevant authorities. They cannot be allowed to walk away from this scot-free. I would expect every Australian to be absolutely disgusted that some so-and-sos thought they were so clever that they could import prawns, evade all our biosecurity and do this damage to our aquaculture and wild catch industries, not to mention show such scant regard for Australia's biosecurity.


I have to leave on this: it absolutely alarms me that officials can sit in Senate estimates and tell senators who are asking how the hell this happened something along the lines of: 'We've had a little bit of a hiccup. Our inspectors didn't quite have the skills they needed,'—I am not making this up; you have to believe this—'but we've spoken to them and we've corrected it. They'll be right.' I cannot give you the exact lines, because I left them up on my desk. It will not be right. I know the carry on and the damage that happened with canker, but we were able to contain that. How the hell we can contain this outbreak in our oceans has me absolutely perplexed. Anyway, we will certainly do our job, the rural, regional affairs and transport committee. It will be done on a diligent expedition around Australia, and I am not looking forward to the final report that we may have to present to the Senate. To the bureaucracy down there in Canberra: if you think you're going to get out of this one—gee whiz—you'll be better than Houdini!

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2017-03-21,"



Senator STERLE
 (Western Australia) (17:57):  I present a report of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee relating to the committee's inquiries concerning the importation of seafood and seafood products. I move:


That the Senate adopt the recommendations contained in the report, as circulated to senators. 


Question agreed to. 




Senator STERLE:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


When I first came into this chamber, nearly 12 years ago, one of my first inquiries when I was put onto the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee was an inquiry into the importation of citrus canker. My first thought was, 'My goodness me; I hope I don't catch that!' It was not funny, let me tell you. It ended up wiping out the citrus industry in Emerald in Queensland. What had happened was that, through very mischievous devices and deviousness, someone had imported some citrus—I think it might have been some stems or some buds—hidden in tea. To cut a long story short, there was a biosecurity outbreak, and it went mad through Queensland. Every citrus tree in the Emerald growing area—orange, lemon or lime—had to be destroyed. 


We have now, unfortunately, found that a massive biosecurity clusterstuff has happened here in Australia in the seafood industry. I am not sending out a scare campaign, because those poor devils that are affected already know. I want to mention some statistics for the Senate. They go to the value of crustaceans—prawns, crabs, marron, gilgie, rock lobster, which we call red crayfish, and all crustaceans. This is the value to Australia of wild caught crustacean species at the last count, in 2014-15: rock lobster, a $668 million industry; prawns, $272 million; other, which includes crabs and other crustaceans, $61 million. That is a total of $1.001 billion to Australia. Then we add the value to Australia of farmed crustacean species, through aquaculture. Once again, the latest figures are for 2014-15. The value of prawns is $86 million; other, $4 million. A total of $90 million. For both wild and farmed that is a total of nearly $1.2 billion worth of exports and local market production. Unfortunately, an outbreak of a disease in prawns, called white spot, was discovered in the Logan River in Queensland, in the aquaculture area. After a series of tests the industry has been shut down. The farm ponds have been drained. You have to understand that the aquaculture facilities, as well as producing prawns for the domestic and export markets, breed the little ones that are sent off to other parts of Australia.


On Thursday I was in Queensland. While I was there, unfortunately, it came out that the white spot outbreak is now in Moreton Bay. We, Senator O'Sullivan and I in particular, have gone through this intensely in Senate estimates. This is a massive, massive stuff up that has occurred for a number of reasons. One reason is that absolutely devious importers of seafood have been bringing in prawns from countries where prawns are affected by white spot. Part of the biosecurity of this nation and the IRA is an inspection regime that is carried out by the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources. The inspectors have certain guidelines, under which they have to go in and take a certain number of samples from the containers. These prawns normally come in in container loads of between 17,000 and 24,000 tonnes at a time. You can imagine how many thousands and thousands of prawns come in. The inspectors are supposed to go in there and determine which boxes will be opened, which pallets will be pulled out, which pallets they will go to—hopefully in the middle of the container and at the back of the container. But what has happened, it came out in Senate estimates, is that some inspectors have not bothered to go out into the freezer facility. They have not bothered to go out there and make sure that when the container is cut there is still the security band—the tin thing; the name for it has just escaped me. What they have done is wait in board rooms or in the waiting room while the importer has brought out a sample of prawns. I know this sounds hard to believe for all of us in this chamber. The importers have said, 'Here you are, mate. Here are the prawns that we've brought in from Vietnam, from Thailand, from somewhere else in South-East Asia, from China or from South America,'—whatever it is—'Test them.' Of course none of the tests came back positive. They all came back negative—no white spot.


So how the heck did we suddenly have to close down the aquaculture prawn industry in South-East Queensland because there has been an outbreak of white spot? Are we seriously stupid enough to believe the nonsense that the department was running as a defence in Senate estimates: 'It's only a little bit. We're testing it. We'll just make sure that, ooh, look, hopefully it's not got out.'? As if the prawns in the Logan River stopped when they got to the edge of the river mouth and thought, 'Hang on, gang. We'd better not go any further so we don't infect our brothers and sisters in the wild catch area.' This is ridiculous.


I have read these figures to you. Any sensible Australian would sit back and say, 'Someone's head has to roll.' Rolling a head or two, whether they be of the crooked importers—and we will chase them; we will be going around this nation finding out how the hell this happened—or departmental officials who did not do their job properly, we can kick their backsides all the way across the Nullarbor. At the end of the day, thousands of Australians are going to be affected by this.

Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (18:07):  I present the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights on freedom of speech in Australia together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.


Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator PATERSON:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


I begin tonight by talking about the committee process and, obviously, the committee report but, fortuitously, we had the announcement of the government's response to the report today so I am also going to address that in my remarks.


Firstly, I want to place on the record my appreciation and thanks to the committee's secretariat who did heroic work in a short time to assist the committee with its work, receiving over 10,000 submissions and holding over nine hearings in six cities. It was a phenomenal effort and I know all members of the committee are very grateful for the support we received from the secretariat.


I am also very grateful to my colleagues on the committee—both my coalition colleagues and colleagues from other parties—for the way in which they participated in this inquiry. It was a genuine inquiry of people with sincere and different beliefs and different conclusions were drawn but everyone brought to this debate their own values and principles, and I recognise the sincere commitment that my colleagues have to these issues.


As a committee we were wrestling, on the one hand, with a very fundamental freedom—which we should all cherish and which is so central to living in a free society and a liberal democracy—freedom of speech, and, on the other hand, the right not to be discriminated against and, for me, particularly, the right to feel safe and included in the Australian community. They are difficult issues to reconcile. They do clash and, ultimately, this is a question about where we draw the line.


I believe the committee report pointed in a good direction and gave the government a good path, which they have now taken up, to resolve that issue, and the government has done so today with a reasonable compromise. I say compromise because one of the things all members of the committee agreed to, during this process, was that the Queensland University of Technology students' case was a travesty of justice and should never happen again, but we had different views about how best to ensure a case like that never happens again. 


There are those who believe—and by the comments today I assume that includes members of the Labor Party and the Greens—it would be sufficient only to update the Human Rights Commission's processes to ensure that a QUT case does not happen again. Even though I very much welcome the proposed changes to the Human Rights Commission's process announced by the government today, I do not think they are sufficient on their own to ensure that we never have another QUT case. I will use this opportunity to outline, in detail, why I think that is.


The Human Rights Commission already has the power to terminate unmeritorious, vexatious, weak cases. In this case, they did not use those existing powers. The President of the Human Rights Commission said, publicly, that she believed this case had a level of merit and that is why it was not terminated. So I am not confident that extra powers to terminate cases like this would ensure that this case would have been terminated. But even if they did provide that a QUT case in the future would be terminated by the commission, I am not convinced that that would be sufficient to discourage what we had in this case, which was a very determined applicant and lawyers who advised her to continue the case. 


Not only did this applicant continue it beyond conciliation, when conciliation was unsuccessful, and take it to the Federal Circuit Court but also when she was unsuccessful in the Federal Circuit Court and when costs were awarded against her in the Federal Circuit Court she chose to appeal the court's decision to the Federal Court and continue the case. Clearly, any discouragement that was put in place at the Human Rights Commission level, by these reforms to the Human Rights Commission processes, would not have been sufficient to dissuade the applicant.


I am concerned not just about the three students who, ultimately, went to court and defended themselves—though I have great admiration for them and their lawyers, who offered their services pro bono to defend this case, this important principle case—but also about the students electing to reach a confidential financial settlement with the applicant. They did so for a number of reasons. One is that they did not want to be accused, in public, of being racist and breaching the Racial Discrimination Act. I do not blame them for not wanting that on the record. The students, in persisting with the case, have detailed to the committee how this has profoundly affected their lives and careers. 


Another reason is that they did not have confidence, had it gone to court, that they would have been successful in defending their case. And so they elected to pay money. It has been reported it was $5,000 each. It was also reported that they offered to settle for lesser amounts or to apologise, but the applicant did not accept those offers. The students felt that the law was so stacked against them that there was no choice but to pay money—and they have testified that they were barely able to afford this and had to scrounge together for it. They chose to do that because the law was so stacked against them. That is also why change to the law itself is necessary.


I am very pleased, today, that the Prime Minister and Attorney-General have announced that the government intends to reform 18C by removing the words 'offend, insult and humiliate', and adding the word 'harassment' in its place, keeping the word 'intimidate' in the law. That will give students, like those at QUT, confidence that if they are accused of this and if the Human Rights Commission handles it well—or badly—ultimately, if they choose to defend their case in court, they will get a fair hearing and there is a good chance they will get off. Hopefully, it will not take them 3½ years to clear their names—as it did for the students who decided to defend their names, in this case.


The government will also proceed to reforming the test in 18C to ensure that it is an actual objective community standards test. A number of court cases have narrowed this reasonable-person test to make it not just in my view a relatively subjective test but in the view of many legal experts, like Professor George Williams and Justice Sackville—because it relies on the perception of offence, insult or humiliation, in the current law, by a member of the affected community rather than by a member of the Australian community at large. That is an important and welcome reform.


The challenge is now before the parliament. The government has resolved its position and is moving forward on this and it is now up to the parliament to decide what, if any, reforms it is willing to vote for. I hope we do not just vote for Human Rights Commission changes alone because, as I have said, I do not think that will ensure there are no more cases like QUT or Bill Leak. I also hope they vote to change the law. In considering how they do that, I hope that members of this place consider that if these reforms are defeated, and if there is another case like QUT, that will be on their conscience. It will be their fault because they have decided to oppose reasonable, compromise reforms. The only thing we can do to guarantee that there will be no more cases like QUT, Bill Leak or Andrew Bolt is to repeal 18C completely. That is not something that has the support of this parliament and it is clearly not going to happen. But we can substantially reduce the risks of that happening and we can do that by voting for both of these reforms. If we do not do that we are running the very real risk that one of the 76 cases that are before the Human Rights Commission today on 18C, or any of those that might be brought in the future, will turn into the next Bill Leak or QUT. Two things will happen: one, people who voted in this place not to reform this law will have to take responsibility for those cases; and two, you can expect the Australian public will be even less sympathetic to the law or to the Human Rights Commission than they are today. If they again see this law being misused to pursue students, cartoonists or journalists, I suspect they will be much less sympathetic to arguments to retain these laws. They might even be more sympathetic to going further and getting rid of all these laws together. So, if you want to preserve 18C in some form, if you want to preserve a targeted limitation on racial abuse, which I think we should have in this country, the time is now to vote for the reform that is on the table because it will ensure that harassment and intimidation based on race are unlawful, as they should be, and it will ensure that freedom of speech is better protected. This is about finding a better balance. I am very pleased that the government has so carefully studied the report of this committee and has taken up many of the recommendations of the committee and I am very hopeful that the parliament will give it equal consideration and, ultimately, support it.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (18:16):  Today, the Prime Minister has announced that his government will attempt to weaken protections against racist hate speech in this country. I rise today on the occasion of the tabling of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights report which, I might add, recommends no such thing as weakening protections against racist hate speech in this country. I rise as yet another privileged white bloke with little or no lived experience of racism to speak about something that is very difficult for me to comprehend, as it is very difficult for most who have offered opinions on this matter recently to comprehend because we have little or no lived experience of it. We have been told today by yet another privileged white bloke, the Attorney-General, Senator Brandis, that Australia is not a racist country. I say to Senator Brandis and I say anyone else who thinks that racism does not exist or is not rife in Australia that they have not been listening. They have not listened to the evidence that was put before the human rights committee, and they have not listened to the terrible stories of racism that are being told right now on a hashtag 'FreedomofSpeech' on Twitter.


I am going to read some of the tweets on the hashtag 'FreedomofSpeech' now so that no-one who is in here or who is listening or watching can ever say again that they did not know about racism in Australia. Here is Reah when someone describes her interracial relationship as 'jungle fever #FreedomOfSpeech''. Here is Benjamin Law who, by the way, started this hashtag 'FreedomofSpeech' discussion today: 'At the age of 10, I was at the local pool as a group of white boys held my head underwater, laughing at me for being Asian #FreedomOfSpeech.' Here is Milleficent: 'A cop saw me with my black boyfriend and gave me unsolicited DV hotline numbers #FreedomOfSpeech.' Here is Sarah: 'I was called a ""bloody Muslim"" on the school run, in front of my daughter. Now don't wear my hijab when she's with me #FreedomOfSpeech.' Here is Andre: 'People would introduce me and say ""This is Andre, he's a Leb, but he's not one those Lebs"" so group would feel comfortable #FreedomOfSpeech.' Here is Faustina: 'In the 90s: almost veered off the road with my Chinese mum and aunt by a group of white men yelling ""go back to where you came from!"" #Freedomof Speech.' Here is Omar: 'I've been called a terrorist too many times to count. I've been stopped by cops and other authorities too many times to count #FreedomofSpeech.' Here is Sonia: 'Being called a ""fucking curry"" from a passing car while I was minding my own business at a tram stop #FreedomofSpeech.' Here is Pat: 'I was sent a letter that said ""shut your mouth you wog"" and called a ""foreign mug"" when I was in the local paper aged 10 #Freedomofspeech.' Here is Con who grew up in a town where he was in one of only two Greek families and he felt like an outsider every day and feared he would be bashed for being Greek. Here is Philip: 'I saw a white man on a train spit on a Sudanese man as he called him a monkey. It was horrific. #FreedomofSpeech.' Here is Thatgirl: 'I was six years old the first time someone told me to go back to where I came from #freedomofspeech.' Here is Meleika: 'If you don't like it pee off and go back to where you came from!' I'm First Nations. This is my country #FreedomOfSpeech.' Here is Kat: 'I've had people throw coins at me because I'm Jewish #FreedomofSpeech.' Here's Randa: 'Dropping my kids aged 7 and 10 off at school and the car slows down and yells out ""effing terrorists"" #FreedomofSpeech.' Here is Bronte: 'Bogans in Perth pretending to shoot a gun at my best friend and screaming, ""F-off back where you came from, gook."" We were 14 years old, at a train station in our school uniforms #FreedomOfSpeech'. Here is Caravaggio: 'My best friend in primary school had her food spat on regularly because she brought what they called chink food from home #FreedomOfSpeech'. Here is Squeak: 'I was bullied and bashed by the good Catholic white boys at school because I was friends with ""all the wogs"" #FreedomOfSpeech'. It goes on and on and on.


And on this day, Harmony Day, a day that the UN has called on the world's political leaders to stand up against race hate speech, we have a Prime Minister who has announced that he will water down protections against race-based hate speech in this country. The lived experiences of people from multicultural communities in this country are absolutely devastating. The stories are awful. You can see them under the hashtag 'FreedomOfSpeech' or you can go through and read the submissions from right across the spectrum of multicultural Australia that were made to the human rights committee inquiry, which I sat on, Senator Paterson sat on, people from right across the political spectrum in this place sat on recently, and you can read the stories of people's lived experiences of racism in this country. Yet we have a Prime Minister who, in order to appease One Nation and to appease the far right of his party, has announced today that he wants to water down protections against race-based hate speech in this country. Not only has he done that; he has the gall to send his Attorney-General into this place to claim that he wants to strengthen protections against race-based hate speech. It is a barefaced lie. 


The changes proposed today will water down section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act and will make it easier for people to be racist in this country. And racism hurts; racism harms. It harms mentally and it harms physically, and we heard evidence of that during this committee's hearings. Make no mistake: if this reform passes, the reform announced by Prime Minister Turnbull today, it will shake multiculturalism in this country to its core, because there has never been a worse time for western democracies around the world to send a message out into the community that it is okay to be more racist than you could be before. But that is exactly what will happen if Prime Minister Turnbull's legislation passes this parliament. And it is only this chamber, the Senate, that can stand up and save us from sending the message out into the country that racism is now more permissible than it was before. 


I will make a prediction here: if these reforms passed—and I sincerely hope they do not, and the Greens will do everything we can to ensure that they do not—you will have the freedom-of-speech warriors in this place, the Senator Patersons, the Senator Leyonhjelms and One Nation, going, 'This is a great victory for freedom of speech.' But what the racists who undoubtedly live in this country will hear is, 'It is okay now to be more racist than we were before.' That will hurt and that will harm. It will hurt people from the Jewish community, the Muslim community, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community, the Greek community, the Italian community, the Chinese community, the Indian community and all people right across the multicultural spectrum.


I say this: the Greens have listened to the evidence put to us, we have listened to the horrendous, devastating stories of casual racism during this committee process, and we will stand shoulder to shoulder with multicultural Australia to defend section 18C— (Time expired)

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2017-03-21,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (18:27):  I also rise to speak in relation to the tabling of the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights inquiry into freedom of speech in Australia, an inquiry which many would better understand as being about section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act, the section which makes it illegal to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate a person on the basis of their race, colour, national or ethnic origin. This inquiry was brought about solely by the stubborn, if not determined, effort to fulfil the desire of the hard-right faction of the Liberal Party to undermine laws against racist hate speech in this country—a desire which the Prime Minister now intends to do his best to fulfil. 


It is extremely important to stress and note that, through our inquiry, the committee have found no basis to recommend any changes to section 18C. That should be the end of the matter. If the Prime Minister were true to his word, it would be. Yet now we hear that the government intend to proceed with changes to the act which would see the words 'offend', 'insult' and 'humiliate' removed from the act.


Perhaps at this point it is worth noting that today we meet in this place on National Harmony Day, and the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, a day which is about celebrating diversity and multiculturalism in our society. On this day we could be celebrating the fact that the final report of the committee has not recommended a change to 18C. 


This is a victory for common sense. It is also a victory for multiculturalism and diversity. Labor is pleased to sign onto this report, because we are not for turning in our unwavering support for ethnic communities and diversity. Labor believes unequivocally that protections against racial hate speech are worth keeping. However, today is not a day for celebration, because the Prime Minister has chosen this day to announce that his government, at the behest of the extreme right, intends to ignore the inquiry report—which he asked for—and proceed with changes to section 18C of the act which weaken protections against racist hate speech. Why? Because to say that the Liberal Party is bitterly divided on this matter would be a significant understatement.


Section 18C has become yet another matter where the Prime Minister is forced to bend to the will of those members of his party who do not even want him as Prime Minister. Already we have multiple reports emerging from discussions at the joint coalition party room meeting this morning. According to reports, not unsurprisingly, those who argued for weakening laws against racist hate speech included the member for Goldstein, Tim Wilson; the member for Barker, Tony Pasin; the member for Canning, Andrew Hastie; the member for Dawson, George Christensen; Senators Paterson and Abetz; and former Prime Minister Tony Abbott. On the other side were members in the other place: Mr Laundy, Mr Coleman, Ms Sudmalis and Mr Alexander.


The member for Reid, in what I will acknowledge was a valiant, perhaps even noble, effort, was out on ABC Radio this morning, defending section 18C and arguing that there is no basis for change—exactly what the report found. It is a position, of course, shared by the committee and stated, as I have said, in the report. We know from reports that Senator Fierravanti-Wells warned changing section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act would be very unpopular with multicultural communities. We know that the Deputy Prime Minister, Barnaby Joyce, warned that dragging out debate on race hate laws will cost the coalition votes. We are no doubt reliably informed by sources inside the room that one of the ardent supporter of former Prime Minister Mr Tony Abbott, the member for Canning, Mr Hastie, argued changing Section 18C was about 'de-fanging the operational arm of the political correctness movement in this country'—whatever that means. Perhaps these are the thoughts that occupy the deepest recesses of the member for Canning's mind as he lies awake at night, fretting about the matters he incorrectly believes to be at the forefront of concerns of the Australian people.


The fact that the Prime Minister has repeatedly been forced to kowtow to the likes of the member for Canning begs the question: what is even the point of being Prime Minister if you cannot even stand by your convictions? Well, The Huffington Post has very helpfully provided some quotes from the Prime Minister to illustrate his evolving view on this matter. In question time on 20 October in 2015 Mr Turnbull said:


The short answer to your question is: the government has no plans to change the Racial Discrimination Act at all.


At a doorstop on 5 February 2016 the Prime Minister said:


There's a longer discussion about the wording of 18c but there are no plans to make any changes to it. OK, thank you.


On 2GB on 25 August last year Mr Turnbull said in relation to the prospect of the government making changes to 18C:


The answer is no, not at this stage because we have higher and more urgent Budget repair priorities.


At a doorstop on 31 August last year he said:


I think the Government has no plans to make any changes to Section 18C. We have other more pressing, much more pressing, priorities to address.


On the ABC's Insiders program in August the host, Barrie Cassidy, asked the Prime Minister if:


… at one stage you'll be open to the idea of taking 'insult' and 'offend' out of the Bill?


Mr Turnbull responded:


Barrie, it is not on our agenda.


More recently, on 2GB in February this year the Prime Minister said:


Well, I've said in the past that I think it can be usefully amended.


It would perhaps, behove the Prime Minister to heed the words of the member for McMillan, Mr Russell Broadbent, who is a member of the committee. He told The Guardian yesterday:


Changes to the RDA should be about process, not about the wording of the section.


Unfortunately, what we have seen instead is that Malcolm Turnbull is prepared to trade away protections for Australia's multicultural communities in order to save his own skin. In doing so, the Prime Minister must answer the question: what forms of racist hate speech does he want to be able to use that he cannot now under current law? Unlike the Prime Minister, Labor is prepared to have the courage of our convictions and stand resolutely on the side of multiculturalism.


Labor will never support changes to section 18C. We believe that protections against racial hate speech are worth keeping. Everyone who opposes hate speech must now stand together to campaign against the government's proposed changes. In doing so we will be demonstrating the commitment of the vast majority of Australians to an inclusive society that respects people from all cultures and backgrounds.


Labor committee members were prepared to support some minor procedural changes to raise the threshold required for a complaint to be dealt with by the Human Rights Commission. These changes were agreed to by the committee in our final report and are supported by the Human Rights Commission and the president, Professor Gillian Triggs. The changes are designed to quickly dispense with frivolous or vexatious claims and will only affect a very miniscule number of complaints made to the commission.


It would have been nice if today we could come together in this place to support the committee's recommendations. Instead, we have had to bear witness to a weakened Prime Minister once again bending to the will of the hard right in his party; a Prime Minister who has been forced to implement one of the priority agenda items of the former Prime Minister, Mr Abbott; a Prime Minister whose legacy will now include a scurrilous attempt to weaken the fabric of harmony in our community and support the most vulgar forms of hate speech imaginable.


In speaking to this committee's final report, I urge senators in this place to take note of all the recommendations contained in it. I urge them to make sure that the Senate remains the place where we are able to stop this sort of law, keeping in place the section of the law that has served this country well since 1975. I seek leave to continue my remarks.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (18:58):  By leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of the report to parliament on livestock mortality during export by sea for the reporting period 1 July to 31 December 2016.


This is another troubling report about the livestock industry. Again we see—the figures are there—the inherent cruelty in the livestock export industry. It is a further reminder of the failed government policy in this area. It is a failed government policy, particularly in terms of animal cruelty and also in terms of the industry itself, because while we are exporting cattle overseas we are robbing jobs from regional Australia—thousands of jobs, in fact. That is why, if we had a government that had a commitment to rural and regional Australia, to jobs growth and to addressing the issue of animal cruelty—which goes hand in hand with this industry—we could have a win-win. So, about the report itself: Landmark Operations, on 27 April 2016, is linked to a number of deaths of the cattle it was exporting. Pneumonia and bloat were causes of death in the animals, both obviously extremely distressing for the animals involved. Also, what is not explained is that 35 cattle were euthanized in port due to being unfit to be discharged and, obviously, then slaughtered in that country for meat. Why did that happen? What were the conditions under which those animals were kept and treated while on board? What I found concerning in the report is that it states that the department took no regulatory action in relation to these mortality events.


Then there is Emanuel Exports from July last year. Heat stress is a common cause of death in live export ships and that was the main factor with regard to deaths here. The department, in this case, did require the exporter to amend what they call a comprehensive heat stress management plan, but what they are calling for should already have been in place. They are saying there should be further reduction in stock density on vessels, industrial fans to assist with ventilation and changing of the port rotation, and other aspects in the way the animals are treated. But this is where the whole ESCAS process—the Export Supply Chain Assurance Scheme—that has been put in place is just an absolute miserable failure. Here they are saying this is what should be done, but the ESCAS process has been in place since 2012 and we still have the department telling the exporters, 'You have to clean up your game.' Meanwhile, more animals die and more animals suffer. The North Australian Cattle Company was another one that is named in this report. 


I want to go back to the ESCAS scheme, because it now coming into fifth year. We are know why ESCAS was brought in: to justify the live export trade. It was a way for the government to have an out so they could say, 'We have a scheme to address cruelty.' You cannot manage cruelty and the live export trade from a desk in Canberra—we have seen that time and time again, and these figures are further proof of that. 


When I read these reports, they remind me of the work of Dr Lynn Simpson. She is a live export vet who was on 57 long-haul live export voyages and was eyewitness to much of the extreme suffering that is linked time and time again with this trade. It really highlights the Nationals, Liberals and Labor—but particularly the Nationals—not addressing this problem. Let's go directly to where the problem lies: the Deputy Prime Minister, Barnaby Joyce. He has a conflict of interest here. He is so close to the big live-export traders that he is not willing to put effort into transitioning the industry to one that operates in Australia. This is where we could have massive jobs growth. Tens of thousands of jobs could be created if the government was willing to build more abattoirs. Abattoirs that once existed have been closed down to drive the live-export trade. It is time that the government got behind the chilled-box-meat tray. That is where we can drive jobs and reduce the animal cruelty that goes with this industry. (Time expired)

Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Minister for Resources and Northern Australia) (19:05):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



The National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Bill 2016 amends the National Health Act1953 to support the efficient operation of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS).


The PBS has been providing affordable access to medicines for Australians for over sixty years and is rightly respected for the high quality, cost-effective services it delivers. In the past year, over 291 million PBS prescriptions have been dispensed through almost 5,900 PBS approved suppliers, including community pharmacies and hospitals, and over 10.8 billion dollars has been paid in tax-payer funded subsidies for those medicines.


For the PBS to maintain its ability to support an increasing number and range of services, it is essential that it embraces change and new technologies. The legislative changes being proposed today are part of a process of renewal for the rules and systems that underpin it.


This Bill proposes amendments which will support the PBS in three different ways. Specifically, the changes will improve efficiency across the entire Scheme by:


allowing for computer decision‑making for administrative processes to make the prescribing of 'authority required' scripts more efficient for doctors; 


reducing red tape for pharmacies in the aftermath of disasters such as fire or flood; 


ensuring that concessional entitlements work correctly until the last day of a person's life. 




Use of computer programs for administrative actions and decision-making



The first of the amendments provides the opportunity for the PBS to take a major leap forward in its use of technology. The new provisions support the use of computers for fully automated processing of administrative decisions.


The functions that could be automated include any function for which the decision‑making power is held by the Minister for Health, the Secretary of the Department of Health, or the Chief Executive Medicare. 


The advantages of using automated processing to determine whether an incoming application, request, or claim meets certain criteria are many. Computer programs handle complex algorithms with ease, are available whenever required, are not subject to bias, and respond instantaneously. 


Automated processing reduces errors, increases accountability and generates easily auditable transaction records. Users can be confident that decisions are uniform and fair. 




Substitute decision for computer decisions



However, as a safeguard, the amendments also provide for the person who holds responsibility for a function, or their delegate, to make a decision personally or make a substitute decision to replace the computer decision, if required. This is important to ensure that if a computer program is not operating correctly or has taken an action that is different from the decision that would have been made by the responsible person, that action can be over‑ruled and replaced without the need for formal review under administrative law.




Appeals for computer decisions and substitute decisions



An added protection is that where merits review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal is currently available for a PBS decision, this will continue to apply regardless of whether the decision has been made by a computer or a person, or has been substituted by a person. 




Use of computer decision-making



The first administrative functions to transition to computer decision‑making are the assessment of payments to pharmacies for dispensing PBS medicines and the processing of requests from prescribers for approval to write certain prescriptions.




Online PBS claims processing



Since 2004, PBS Online has provided real-time connectivity between pharmacies and the Department of Human Services. This interaction allows patient entitlements, prescription details and special authorities to be validated, and the claim payment to be assessed, during the dispensing process.


Computerised decision-making will enable the claims computer system to match payment assessments against a pharmacy's certification of supply and take the administrative actions that would otherwise be taken by the Chief Executive Medicare.




Online PBS prescribing authorities and approvals



For prescribers, computerised decision‑making will mean that requests to prescribe 'authority‑required' PBS medicines will be able to be processed online via prescribing software. 


At present, most prescribers contact the Department of Human Services by telephone or in writing for approval by a government officer.


When requesting authority prescriptions for their patients, prescribers are asked a number of questions by the Department of Human Services in order to confirm patient eligibility. 


The questions are based on the restriction that has been recommended by PBAC and approved by the Minister as part of the listing of medicines on the PBS.


The questions can vary from checking appropriate age, sex and weight of the patient to more complex queries such as the result of the patient's last platelet count or whether the requested medication will be used in conjunction with another medication or as a monotherapy. 


The telephone approval system has been an on-going concern for doctors for many years. It is one of the health processes most often nominated for red tape reduction.


In 2015-16, the Department of Human Services received 6.8 million requests for prescribing approvals by telephone and post.


Because the approval number must be included on the prescription, telephone requests are made during the patient consultation. The average time taken per call is 1 minute 27 seconds.


With the introduction of the Online PBS Authorities system, the majority of telephone requests will be able to go online. For requests not suitable for online processing, the prescriber will be able to speak to a person. For complex therapies, most requests will still need to be in writing, at least for the time being. As online capability expands, more complex requests will be handled online.


The development of online transactions for authority approvals has involved many contributors. These include medical software providers, medical and pharmacy organisations, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee and the Department of Human Services. I acknowledge their skill and hard work in delivering this project.




Supply of PBS medicines at alternative premises following a disaster



The second group of amendments in the Bill will reduce administrative requirements for PBS pharmacies following a disaster.


The current legislative provisions for supplying PBS medicines at other premises reflect that life does not always go to plan and that pharmacies, like any other business, can find themselves caught up in catastrophes and events beyond their control. 


In the aftermath of a disaster, the ability for a pharmacy to resume operating without delay can be important, not only to the business, but to the recovery of the community and to individuals who may have lost possessions, including medicines.




Operation of pharmacy location rules



Since 1990, the ability for a pharmacist to obtain approval to supply PBS medicines has been subject to pharmacy location rules. Their purpose is to ensure that access to PBS medicines is available via a suitable geographic spread of PBS-approved pharmacies, including in rural and remote regions of Australia. 


The operation of the location rules is being considered separately as part of the Review of Pharmacy Remuneration and Regulation led by Professor Stephen King. The changes in this Bill are not related to the Review.


The location rules also include limits on how frequently and how far a PBS pharmacy can move from its current site. This helps to keep pharmacies connected to their local areas and communities. 


However, for exceptional events some flexibility is required. Refusing to allow a pharmacy to move to other premises could make an already difficult situation worse and would not be in the interests of the local community. 




Current provisions for supply at other premises



Under the current legislation, a PBS-approved pharmacist can supply PBS medicines from other premises prior to obtaining PBS approval. Claims are paid at 90 per cent of the full amount until approval for the other premises is obtained. The current provisions allow a pharmacist to set up quickly at another site in an emergency and supply PBS medicines while the approval process for the new location is being sorted out.


Because a PBS approval number is tied to specific premises and cannot be transferred, obtaining PBS approval for the new site involves submitting a relocation application to the Australian Community Pharmacy Authority, even if the move is only temporary. 


The application must contain full documentation, including evidence of legal right to occupy, council approval, public access, and distance measurements from other pharmacies. In addition, it must contain evidence of the exceptional circumstances or event. 


In a disaster situation, preparing an application of this kind can be onerous. The pharmacy proprietor may need to recover in conditions where local government services and other businesses are also disrupted. It may be weeks before the required information can be compiled. This compounds the losses for the pharmacy as the flat 10 per cent reduction on payments for PBS claims continues until the approval is in place. The lost PBS subsidies cannot be recovered later.


Moving back to the original pharmacy means repeating the process in reverse. Overall, two full applications and two new PBS approval numbers are involved. For each new approval number, dispensing labels and pharmacy stationery need to be reprinted and a new public key infrastructure software certification is required for claiming.


The process carries high administrative overheads in a stressful situation and for what is usually a temporary move.


Another problem with the current arrangements is that although they are intended to be used in exceptional circumstances, experience has shown that that is not always the case.


Instead, the provisions are sometimes used where a PBS pharmacy is relocating for any reason. In these situations, supply of PBS medicines commences at the unapproved premises while the approved pharmacy is still operating. PBS claims are made from the approved pharmacy at the full rate, and from the unapproved premises at the 90 per cent rate, using the same PBS approval number. This continues until an application for PBS approval at the new site is successful, which may take several months. Use of a PBS approval number at two sites simultaneously in this way is contrary to the policy intention of the current law. 




New provisions for supply at alternative premises following disaster



The proposed amendments will improve arrangements for PBS pharmacies genuinely affected by disaster. The changes will allow an affected pharmacy's PBS approval number to be used to supply PBS medicines at alternative premises in substantially the same locality for up to six months until, either supply resumes at the original pharmacy, or a new PBS approval number is obtained for a different site.


PBS claims will be paid at the full rate, not at 90 per cent, while an approved pharmacy is operating from alternative premises after a disaster.


The amendments make it explicit that the new provisions apply only for disaster or exceptional circumstances, only when the PBS-approved pharmacy cannot operate, and only for one alternative premises at a time.


The pharmacist will be required to provide information to the Secretary of the Department of Health regarding the disaster or event, the reasons the approved pharmacy is beyond use, and the nature and location of the alternative premises. The Secretary will be responsible for determining whether exceptional circumstances and locality requirements are met and for granting permission for up to six months. A permission can be extended for an additional period via a similar process if clean‑up or repairs take longer than expected.


What does or does not constitute disaster or exceptional circumstances, what is or is not substantially the same locality, and the kind of documents or evidence required in an application can be set out in legislative instruments, if necessary.




Benefits for pharmacies affected by disaster



The average number of pharmacies affected by disaster annually is usually around three. The number in the past year has been higher, seven in total. One was due to storm damage and six due to fire.


The new provisions will reduce administrative effort, time and costs for pharmacists and support continuity of access to PBS medicines for the communities they serve. The simplified requirements will allow a forced temporary move to be handled accordingly, rather than be treated as two separate full‑scale relocations. Payment of PBS claims at the full rate will reduce unnecessary losses to pharmacy businesses. 




Repeal of current 
'
other premises
'
 provisions



The amendments also repeal entirely the current provisions regarding supply of PBS medicines at other premises prior to PBS approval. 


This will mean that the only situation in which it is legal to supply PBS medicines at alternative premises is when the approved pharmacy cannot operate due to disaster or exceptional circumstances, and only for as long as necessary due to the disaster.


The repeal of the current provisions will also provide clarity that supply of PBS medicines must not occur at or from an approved pharmacy and other premises, under the same approval number, concurrently, in any circumstances. 


Where current arrangements are being used inappropriately to relocate an approved pharmacy or to supply PBS medicines via a pharmacy which is not PBS-approved, transitional arrangements will allow a maximum of six months for a PBS approval to be obtained, or for supply at, or via, the unapproved pharmacy to cease.




Payment of PBS concessional entitlements on date of death 



The third change in the Bill is a technical correction relating to concessional entitlements.


Health policy has always been that concessional entitlements apply for PBS medicines obtained on the day of a person's death. Under social security legislation, where eligibility is decided, concessional entitlements cease on the day prior to death. This timing is to allow the payment of other social services benefits to apply from the date of death.


To account for this difference, claims for PBS prescriptions supplied for a concessional beneficiary on the day they die need to be adjusted. Since streamlined processing of claims was introduced in April 2015, this adjustment no longer occurs.


The proposed amendments modify the definitions of concessional beneficiary and dependant for PBS purposes to ensure that PBS entitlements apply until midnight on the day a concessional beneficiary or a dependant dies.


Over 146 million PBS prescriptions were supplied for concessional beneficiaries last year. Of these, less than a thousand were supplied on the date of death. For these prescriptions, there is a shortfall in the payment to the pharmacist equal to the difference between the general patient co‑payment and the concessional co‑payment. This is currently a difference of $32.10 per prescription. The amount that would be owing across all PBS pharmacies is estimated to be accruing at around $2,000 per month.


Retrospective commencement of the amendments from 1 April 2015 provides for back payment of outstanding amounts on prescriptions since then. 


There is no change to PBS costs as PBS policy and funding has always provided for subsidy of these prescriptions. There is no change to the operation of other social services entitlements.


I acknowledge the patience of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and its members in relation to these outstanding payments. I trust that this technical change will assist in resolving the situation as soon as possible. 




Summary and close



The changes proposed in this Bill will deliver efficiencies that will improve the operation of the PBS. I am confident they will be welcomed by PBS users.


The ability to use computerised decision‑making for PBS processes reflects the Government's commitment to e-Government and to using digital health services to improve health outcomes for Australians.


For pharmacists, the changes will reduce payment times and administrative red tape.


For prescribers and patients, online prescribing approvals will return precious minutes lost to telephone calls back to consultation time.

Senator STERLE
 (Western Australia) (19:06):  I am checking the clock because I am actually in continuation. 



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Well let's cut his time back to two minutes! There are two minutes left. 




Senator STERLE:
  I thought I would dob myself in because I am worried about my colleagues who might have a crack. 




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Bernardi
):  The clock will be set appropriately when we find out what the continuing issue is. 




Senator STERLE:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I wish to continue my contribution on the Transport Security Amendment (Serious or Organised Crime) Bill 2016. It was a few weeks or a month ago that I was talking about this. We take transport issues in our ports and our airports very, very seriously, and so we need to. We have seen some of the terrible events around the world, unfortunately. Touch wood—I am touching wood everywhere—Australia has been lucky that we have not been affected directly yet. Let us hope that we never will be.


I just want to make this point: unfortunately, the government likes to talk up a good fight. The government likes to say, 'Look how well we're doing and aren't we fantastic.' With the greatest of respect I want to direct my comments: the government have deaf ears. When you were in government, Mr Acting Deputy President, you would have had your views, and I hope that now you have broken those shackles you and your party would seriously consider the ramifications on another piece of legislation. You may say, 'What's it got to do with the bill?' It has a lot to do with this bill. We cannot say that on one hand everything is Mickey Mouse and on the other hand, 'Don't worry, there's nothing to see; move along.'


For the crossbenchers, there is a bill floating around out there—somewhere between Minister Chester's office here and the tactics team on the government side—that is waiting to land. There are conversations going on to reinvigorate turning over a piece of legislation that was unceremoniously dumped here prior to the last election—the double dissolution—because the majority of the independents saw how stupid and how short-sighted this piece of legislation is when we want to talk about transport security. It was a thought bubble that came out in Senate estimates the committee reported on. The title of this report that they presented to former Minister Truss, who is now off doing other things, was—it will come to me; I will remember. Anyway, it was virtually deregulation of the Australian shipping industry.


When I first came into this building along with other senators, another one of my early inquiries was the MSIC legislation going towards the wharf and maritime security card. There was a lot of work put into that with stakeholders from employers, unions, consumers and users of shipping and transport—all sorts of stuff. Anyway, the card is in there. We know why the card is in there: to strengthen it up.


Unfortunately, this bill picks on Aussies more than anything else, whilst leaving this serious gap on foreign seafarers—without bringing out the xenophobic horn. It needs to be told to crossbenchers that if the government has their way they will deregulate the Australian shipping industry. What that means now for our coastal port trading, which is predominantly done with Australian seafarers, is unfortunately a lot of Australian ships are disappearing. We know one of the high-profile ones was the MV Portland. The Australian crew were yanked off in the middle of the night and told they were not going to be going.




Senator Canavan:
  Don't you want a steel industry in this country?




Senator STERLE:
  I did not hear that interjection, but I would love to hear it. I would really love to hear this because this is the stupidity of that mob over there, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President. You talk a load of crap. You cannot wait to see Australian jobs go. You are guilty. You stand there and—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order, Senator Sterle!




Senator STERLE:
  I get wild on this.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I am not sure whether it is against the standing orders, but it is against mine. If you would not mind withdrawing that.




Senator STERLE:
  I will withdraw that so that you do not get all upset, Mr Acting Deputy President. I am passionate about Australian jobs and it really, really irks me that this lot over there cannot wait to bow down and say, 'Oh, yes please!' to the major donors of the Liberal Party whilst Australian jobs go. You lot opposite want to talk about getting rid of Australian seafarers and bringing in flags of convenience. You do not even know who half the people on the ship are. You want to clear your ears out, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President.


We have a high-profile case of a known gun runner—I am not making this up; my committee found this—who confessed he runs guns internationally, Captain Salas. Three people died on his ship. He is a Filipino captain. We are still going through the processes of finding out what the hell happened. I tell a lie; two died on his ship and one went overboard, nowhere to be found. This is how great this mob over here are. There are judicial inquiries going on. Where is Captain Salas? No-one knows where Captain Salas is, so in absentia—is that what you call it?—there was a criminal court case going on in Sydney.


One of the most diligent reporters in this nation, Owen Jacques, who is up there on the Sunshine Coast. Owen actually left the Sunshine Coast because he has been following what has been going on with Captain Salas, the disappearance of the one overboard and the two deaths on the ship. Have a listen to this; I am not making this up. He goes down to Sydney because he knows the criminal inquiry is on. He sits patiently in the back of the room while the high-profile, highly paid judges are all having their conversations about what would happen if they could find Captain Salas. Senator Lambie, have a listen to this: smoko comes on so up gets Owen Jacques. He walks up to the main prosecutor and he says: 'Mate, I can tell you where Captain Salas is. He's actually pulling into Gladstone today' on whatever ship it was. He is back in our waters. He has been plying his trade in our ports and in our waters. The AFP and Border Protection and Immigration had no damn idea. Can you believe this? They had no idea. All of a sudden, 'Whoops, we'd better pull the whistle out.' The lawyers all gather around and stop it. They put a hold on it for 24 hours and send up some of the black uniforms saying, 'Go grab this captain,' and they bring him down. Can you believe this?


And yet you lot opposite cannot wait. You are salivating to get rid of Australian jobs. You might think you are clever. How the hell can you be clever when you stand there and say, 'Aren't we doing such a fantastic job because we're going to make it a little bit harder for Aussies to get on the port and we'll make it a little bit harder for Aussies to get in the airport,' but you do not know who is coming into this nation half of the time. None of you can argue with me because—guess what—this is a joint fight. Senator Williams has been a fantastic ally on this committee in this inquiry, and so has Senator O'Sullivan. So it is not only the Labor senators who are absolutely concerned.


This is what really annoys me: last time I checked, we are an island nation whether we like it or not. The majority of the freight that moves on and off our shores is done through shipping. I have absolutely no qualms with Australian businesses plying their business trade along our coast.


Have a listen to this: our fuel is not even carted on Australian ships anymore, and it is not carted by Australian crews. We do not even know how much fuel we have. We have no idea. That is another inquiry, but I do not have to talk about that one. No-one could tell us how much fuel we have in this nation. So we want to talk to Defence and hear their concerns, whilst this mob continue to say, 'How can we get rid of Australian seafarers and Australian ships?'


When we talk about Australian engineers, these people do not—like some foreign and Indian truck drivers—get their licence out of a Weeties packet. I am not making this up; this is another inquiry I am doing. Mr Acting Deputy President, I am happy to come in here and do 20 minutes telling you all about that, too, if you have missed the other four or five I have done. They actually spend years and years learning their trade, plying their trade along the coast and doing the training along the coast in Australian ships—masters, chiefs, skippers and engineers.


All the while, that mob over there are desperately trying to push the Aussie ships and jobs offshore so Rio Tinto or someone like that can be more competitive. Are you listening, Senator Canavan? Where are our captains, our chiefs and our masters going to come from? Where are our engineers going to come from? Let us not forget that one of our closest friends in a wartime situation is the merchant navy. Where do you think they all come from? Do you think that the flags of convenience are going to come to our aid? This is how stupid it is.


Our Australian seafarers are out there trying to do their jobs, not getting hassled by you mob over there kowtowing to your donors. They all pay tax in Australia, they raise their kids in Australia and they pay GST and income tax in Australia. Everything stays in Australia, and it is not going offshore. Can someone give me a good, economical argument why it is so intelligent to have flags of convenience? Some of these seafarers are not making a lot of money. And I am not having a go at the foreign ones—them poor devils—but this is a stupid argument. They sit there and tell us they are going to put through a little amendment to a bill so that someone else can be escorted on with their red cards and walk along the port. But we are on the port. We are not worried about who the hell is bringing the freight in.


Before we start getting into national security and before we start arguing about environment issues, it is not Aussie ships and Aussie crews running aground on the Great Barrier Reef and it is not Aussie ships and Australian crews that break up at Cape Cuvier over in WA. None of them were Australian. They were foreign seafarers on flag of convenience vessels.


But I want to talk about another thing, and this is just how bad it is going. Minister Chester does not talk a lot to us. I do not know what is going on over there, but he has brought back the report that is all to do with the deregulation of the Australian shipping industry. It hit the ground today. I had the pleasure of catching up today with Mr Bill Milby. All of us in here who have been following this argument know who he is. Mr Bill Milby was at a forum with department officials when this new piece of legislation for deregulating the Australian shipping industry was first raised. Mr Milby queried it with the pointy heads down there at the department.


First I had better tell you what Mr Milby does. He is with North Star Cruises. He is the CFO and he works for two Australians, one of whom started North Star Cruises 30 years ago out of Broome—and this is going on my bucket list for when I retire. I want to cruise all the way from Broome to Darwin. The owner, who has brought another owner in, has been there for 30 years. Mr Milby has been with North Star Cruises for 15 years. There are 60-odd Australians or more—




Senator Lambie:
  More. They are getting another ship and employing more Australians.




Senator STERLE:
  employed on this beautiful cruise ship that travels up and down the coast, except for in the wet season. The decision has been made by the owner, the chairman of the company, to spend $32 million—I hope you lot are listening over there—on another cruise ship to be built in Henderson. Henderson is south of Fremantle. It is a shipbuilding area in WA. There is some defence stuff and a lot of private stuff there.


We are going to have a $32 million spend. Senator Lambie is right over this and will correct me if I am wrong, but I think it is an 18-month build and then there will be another 60-odd Aussies employed. There will be young Australians employed on this ship as the skipper, the master or whatever. Mr Milby is the person who raised this concern. He said: 'Hang on. If we deregister, what about my Aussie crew? I will not be able to compete with international ships coming down from Asia.' He was told by the officials—and they know who they are, from doing this at estimates—'Well just get foreign workers.' But Mr Milby does not want foreign workers. He quite clearly said it is not a case of him sacking his Australian crew. He is not going to sack his Australian crew, but he will be forced out of business.


There are about 20 of these companies that operate out of Broome, between Broome and Darwin. It is not just Mr Milby and North Star, or True North. We can see what will happen. They will come down from Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia or wherever, and the rates of pay will be nowhere near what they are here. They will supply the vessels up there with all their food and maintenance and they will head back there. We will farewell 60-odd Aussies from one ship. If this happens, it will be 120 Aussies from two ships—'Get lost. Go away. Bye.' There are another 19 companies out there. This is just stupidity.


It is alright for Mr Truss to start this nonsense. He is off enjoying his parliamentary pension. What makes it worse is that the young ones coming through seem to be just as silly, naive or uneducated—can I say that, Mr Deputy President? They just do not give a damn about Aussie jobs. How can any Australian sit there and say that this is a good idea? They did it on the Portland. They got rid of the Aussies from the Portland. They got them off in the middle of the night and replaced them with foreign seafarers. I know they are under a bit of pressure and I get all that. So we think this is just fantastic that we are going to get rid of every—

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2017-03-21,"



Senator STERLE
 (Western Australia) (19:06):  I am checking the clock because I am actually in continuation. 



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Well let's cut his time back to two minutes! There are two minutes left. 




Senator STERLE:
  I thought I would dob myself in because I am worried about my colleagues who might have a crack. 




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Bernardi
):  The clock will be set appropriately when we find out what the continuing issue is. 




Senator STERLE:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I wish to continue my contribution on the Transport Security Amendment (Serious or Organised Crime) Bill 2016. It was a few weeks or a month ago that I was talking about this. We take transport issues in our ports and our airports very, very seriously, and so we need to. We have seen some of the terrible events around the world, unfortunately. Touch wood—I am touching wood everywhere—Australia has been lucky that we have not been affected directly yet. Let us hope that we never will be.


I just want to make this point: unfortunately, the government likes to talk up a good fight. The government likes to say, 'Look how well we're doing and aren't we fantastic.' With the greatest of respect I want to direct my comments: the government have deaf ears. When you were in government, Mr Acting Deputy President, you would have had your views, and I hope that now you have broken those shackles you and your party would seriously consider the ramifications on another piece of legislation. You may say, 'What's it got to do with the bill?' It has a lot to do with this bill. We cannot say that on one hand everything is Mickey Mouse and on the other hand, 'Don't worry, there's nothing to see; move along.'


For the crossbenchers, there is a bill floating around out there—somewhere between Minister Chester's office here and the tactics team on the government side—that is waiting to land. There are conversations going on to reinvigorate turning over a piece of legislation that was unceremoniously dumped here prior to the last election—the double dissolution—because the majority of the independents saw how stupid and how short-sighted this piece of legislation is when we want to talk about transport security. It was a thought bubble that came out in Senate estimates the committee reported on. The title of this report that they presented to former Minister Truss, who is now off doing other things, was—it will come to me; I will remember. Anyway, it was virtually deregulation of the Australian shipping industry.


When I first came into this building along with other senators, another one of my early inquiries was the MSIC legislation going towards the wharf and maritime security card. There was a lot of work put into that with stakeholders from employers, unions, consumers and users of shipping and transport—all sorts of stuff. Anyway, the card is in there. We know why the card is in there: to strengthen it up.


Unfortunately, this bill picks on Aussies more than anything else, whilst leaving this serious gap on foreign seafarers—without bringing out the xenophobic horn. It needs to be told to crossbenchers that if the government has their way they will deregulate the Australian shipping industry. What that means now for our coastal port trading, which is predominantly done with Australian seafarers, is unfortunately a lot of Australian ships are disappearing. We know one of the high-profile ones was the MV Portland. The Australian crew were yanked off in the middle of the night and told they were not going to be going.




Senator Canavan:
  Don't you want a steel industry in this country?




Senator STERLE:
  I did not hear that interjection, but I would love to hear it. I would really love to hear this because this is the stupidity of that mob over there, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President. You talk a load of crap. You cannot wait to see Australian jobs go. You are guilty. You stand there and—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order, Senator Sterle!




Senator STERLE:
  I get wild on this.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I am not sure whether it is against the standing orders, but it is against mine. If you would not mind withdrawing that.




Senator STERLE:
  I will withdraw that so that you do not get all upset, Mr Acting Deputy President.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2017-03-21,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania) (19:20):  On 17 April the well-known Boston Marathon will be held yet again. What is not well known is that 50 years ago, in 1967, Kathrine Switzer donned bib No. 261. That of itself may seem unremarkable but for the fact Kathrine Switzer was the first woman to run the marathon and at the two-mile mark the race director tried to remove her from the race. You see, it was considered a men's only event.


Since then bib No. 261 has taken on special significance, with Kathrine Switzer establishing a charity, 261 Fearless, to help empower women globally through communication platforms, clubs, training opportunities, education, ambassadors, merchandising and events. Through these networking opportunities 261 Fearless breaks down barriers of geography and creates a global community for women runners of all abilities to support and talk to each other, encouraging healthy living and a positive sense of self and fearlessness. So from those humble beginnings has grown a celebrated network.


To mark the 50th anniversary of Kathrine Switzer's groundbreaking run, she will take part in this year's Boston Marathon with an extra 100 charity women running alongside her, chosen from around the world, including two from Australia. One of those 100 is our very own Sydney lady Lesley Mason, who will be lining up with Kathrine Switzer on 17 April in Boston. I am sure all Australians wish Lesley safe travels, energy to run the marathon and, above all, success in her fundraising target to contribute over US$7,000 to 261 Fearless, a target which Lesley has now well and truly exceeded thanks to her many supporters—in particular, Function Physio, her platinum sponsor, who deal with her aches and pains from her numerous marathon runs, and Fisiocrem, her silver sponsor.


To ensure all funds donated go to the benefit of 261 Fearless Lesley and her husband, Kilner, are covering all expenses from their own pockets. Such generosity deserves our support, let alone the commitment to run the Boston Marathon. Just google Lesley Mason 261 Fearless to donate—and it is not too late.


Both I and the former Prime Minister the Honourable Tony Abbott, whose presence in the chamber I note, recognise and salute the effort and endeavours of Kilner and, especially, Lesley, both of whom are in the gallery this evening. I also wish all the best to the other participant, Erica King, who is not known to me personally. I wish them safe travels, good running, enjoyable times and God speed.
