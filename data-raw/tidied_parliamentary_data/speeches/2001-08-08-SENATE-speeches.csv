"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-08-08,"—I refer the committee to schedule 1, item 11 on the running sheet, attended to by amendment No. 5 on my sheet No. 2000. With the permission of the committee, I would like to move amendment No. 23 on my sheet No. 2000 together with amendment No. 5, because they hang together.
Leave granted.
—I move:
(5)	Schedule 1, item 11, page 5 (line 21) to page 6 (line 10), omit the item, substitute:
11  At the end of subsection 170CE(7)
Add “, or within such period as the Commission allows on an application made during or after those 21 days.”.
11A  At the end of subsection 170CE(7A)
Add “, or within such period as the Commission allows on an application made during or after those 21 days.”.
Note:	In Brodie-Harris v MTV Publishing Ltd (1995) 67 IR 298 the Industrial Relations Court of Australia set down principles relating to the exercise of its discretion under a similarly worded provision of the Industrial Relations Act 1988.
11B  Subsection 107CE(8)
Repeal the subsection.
 (23)	Schedule 1, item 36, page 16 (lines 14 to 35), omit the item, substitute:
36  At the end of subsection 170CP(6)
Add “, or within such period as a court allows on an application made during or after those 14 days”.
Note:	In Brodie-Harris v MTV Publishing Ltd (1995) 67 IR 298, the Industrial Relations Court of Australia set down principles relating to the exercise of its discretion under a similarly worded provision of the Industrial Relations Act 1988.
36A  Subsection 170CP(7)
Repeal the subsection.
My amendments (5) and (23) refer to items 11 and 36 in the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2000 that refer to the discretion of the Industrial Relations Commission and the Federal Court to grant extensions of time to apply for a remedy. These items respectively amend subsections 170CE(8) and 170CP(7), which concern extensions of time to apply to the commission and to the Federal Court or a court of competent jurisdiction for a termination of employment remedy. The intention of the amendments is to tighten the discretion that these tribunals have to grant extensions of time so that it is similar to the discretion that applied under the termination of employment provisions of the former Labor government's Industrial Relations Act 1988.
In substance, the provisions state that the relevant tribunal may accept an application that is lodged out of time only if it is satisfied that it would be equitable to accept the application. Subsections 170CE(8A) and 170CP(8) then set out the factors to which the commission or court is to have regard in determining whether it would be equitable to accept the application out of time.
The tests proposed by items 11 and 36, in my view, should be deleted and replaced with the words in proposed Democrat amendments Nos 5 and 23. Those words are taken from the extension of time provision contained in subsection 170EA(3) of the former Labor government's Industrial Relations Act. I think our amendments are an improvement on the government's proposal.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2001-08-08,"—I seek to clarify—and you may well have done so in your introductory remarks—that the test you are setting down here provides a broader discretion.
—Yes, it does.
—Senator Murray, could you explain for us how you think that that actually applies? In working through the various provisions last night, I had been able to follow that, but if you could give your explanation I think it would be useful to also have it on the record. ",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-08-08,"—I will look for the assistance of the parliamentary secretary as well, because that is a fairly lengthy provision in the original bill and can be assisted by discussion. Essentially, we have suggested that the commission can allow an application made during or after those 21 days for an application to the commission. We have referred to a note of assistance in this matter that sets down the principles established by the Industrial Relations Commission relating to what is reasonable and equitable to establish. That really is the advice I had in drawing together these extensions.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2001-08-08,"—Perhaps I can indicate, for the benefit of the committee, my understanding of the situation. Your amendment—and you can correct me if I am wrong—
 (Senator Knowles)—Senator Collins, would you mind addressing your comments to the chair, please.
—Sorry, through you, Madam Temporary Chair: Senator Murray's amendment, if I understand it, will allow or give the commission the ability to consider matters in an exhaustive manner. In other words, were the commission mindful to adjust their principles in relation to considering these sorts of issues, that option would be open, whereas the government's original amendment would not have allowed that scope through simply reflecting the principles in Brodie-Harris v. MTV Publishing Ltd. I think that is my understanding. If it is the case, it is likely that Senator Murray's amendment provides for a wider discretion, and we would support it. In our view, it is entirely appropriate that the commission's discretion be as wide as practicable in such instances. They hear the evidence from the parties, they are able to judge their veracity and they have the material before them to make an appropriate decision, whether or not we trust them to make the right calls. In our case we do, and we would support an amendment that provides for a broader rather than a tighter discretion.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-08-08,"—I thank Senator Collins—it is a bit of a stuttering start for me this morning. I agree broadly with Senator Collins's interpretation. The question put by Senator Collins is whether what I propose would provide for an exhaustive examination of possible grounds. I am wary of the use of the word `exhaustive', because I can never foresee that, but, yes, it is certainly an intention to expand and improve upon what the government offered.
Amendments agreed to.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-08-08,"—by leave—I move amendments Nos 6, 7 and 8 on sheet 2000:
(6)	Schedule 1, item 13, page 6 (line 32) to page 7 (line 9), omit the item, substitute:
13  At the end of subsection 170CF(2)
Add:
; and (d)	if the Commission considers, having regard to all the materials before the Commission, that the application has no reasonable prospect of success, it must advise the parties accordingly.
 (7)	Schedule 1, item 14, page 7 (lines 15 to 17), omit paragraph (3)(b), substitute:
(b)	the Commission has indicated that the applicant's claim in respect of the ground so referred has no reasonable prospect of success;
 (8)	Schedule 1, item 14, page 7 (lines 27 and 28), omit “a substantial prospect of being unsuccessful”, substitute “no reasonable prospect of success”.
These amendments relate to items 13 and 14 of the bill and, effectively, they substitute the words `no reasonable prospect of success' and omitting `a substantial prospect of being unsuccessful'. The intention, as those senators who recall my minority report way back when, was to ensure that both employers and employees recognise that they should enter the jurisdiction of the Industrial Relations Commission with regard to these matters only if there was a reasonable prospect of success—in other words, to omit items which, on the balance of probabilities, would be unlikely to succeed at arbitration. The effect of our proposed amendments will be to prevent an applicant from proceeding to arbitration if his or her claim in respect of harsh, unjust or unreasonable termination were to be applied where the commission would find that the application does not have a reasonable prospect of success. Before making its findings the commission would be required to give the applicant the opportunity to provide further material in support of his or her claim in respect of the grounds of harsh, unjust or unreasonable terminations. These really cover the field all the way up to item 22 of the bill. ",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2001-08-08,"—Currently, with respect to these amendments, the act provides for the commission to assess the merits of a claim and it may, if it thinks fit, recommend that the applicant elect not to proceed. The government, in the bill, wants to get the commission to indicate that in every case, whether or not it thinks on the balance of probabilities that the claim is likely to succeed. The Democrats' amendments would mean that, if the commission believes that the application has no reasonable chance of success, it must advise the parties accordingly. The effect of putting so much import on the conciliation proceedings, in our view, will be to turn them into a mini arbitration. This was the matter I was referring to yesterday when I took up Senator Campbell's reference to the Australian Industry Group as an area where they also had some level of concern. 
At this stage I would like to indicate again for the record the Labor Party's concern with what is occurring here in relation to what I think is an abuse of what the conciliation process is meant to be. In doing so, I would like to take the Senate to submissions by Maurice Blackburn and Co. in their submission to the Senate inquiry into the `more jobs, better pay' legislation, where I think they gave a very good explanation as to why this would occur:
The Commission's assessment of the merits of the applicant's case must be made without the benefit of hearing evidence under oath from the witness box. Clearly the Commission's ability to make such an assessment will depend on the evidence produced. In our experience, the factual positions of the parties at conciliation are often polarised. If applicants stand to lose their entitlements, to elect to go to arbitration, their advisers will have a duty to effectively run a trial at the conciliation conference which will prove the applicant's claim on the balance of probabilities.
Or, in the Democrats' case, a different test. To continue:
This approach guarantees that the costs involved for both parties proceeding to conciliation will increase dramatically. The focus will also inevitably move from the current objective of conciliation to settle the matter in a relatively non-legalistic and informal settlement process. In our experience, the accessibility of the current conciliation process provides applicants with an opportunity to confront their grievances with the employer and come to terms with the fact of the termination. We see this process is critical to an effective resolution of the matter.
The proposed amendment will inevitably result in conciliations becoming more legalistic and adversarial as arguments on the merits of the applicant's case become the central focus of proceedings. This threatens to marginalise the key players in the conciliation process—that is, the employee and the employer themselves. With the focus likely to move away from pragmatic options for settlement of the matter, conciliators in the Commission will take an entirely different role in the process. We anticipate that the proposed amendment will result in fewer claims settling prior to arbitration. Both parties stand to incur significantly increased legal costs.
This view was in part also mirrored by the Australian Industry Group in relation to the conciliation measures. We think that under either of the tests there will be a poor outcome. However, in this instance, the Democrat amendment is vastly preferable to the government's proposal. In changing the test from `likely to succeed on the balance of probabilities' to `no reasonable chance of success', as I read it, the Democrat amendments, at the very least, will ameliorate the tendency for mini trials to occur and costs to be incurred. However, Senator Murray, some of my colleagues have indicated they are in a quandary over whether your test is really a better test. I am curious to see how you rationalise that particular wording, on the record, with respect to it providing a better test.  ",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-08-08,"—I am of course familiar with the arguments that Senator Collins has put. This is an area of some difficulty for all of us because I believe, on a cross-party basis, we are all of the view that as far as possible the processes of the Industrial Relations Commission should be as cheap and as quick and easy to access as possible. The problem we face is that in the pursuit of fairness or justice that particular objective can get out of reach. The evidence put to us consistently over time has been that there has been an abuse of process which has resulted in employees being stretched out and forced to back off and terminate their claims unreasonably by employers, and there has been a similar attitude of employee representatives doing it to employers. 
Our assessment of the issue is, therefore, that an early indication to the parties by the commission as to reasonable prospects of success would be desirable because it would mean that, if subsequently it was found that the issue was without merit, that would be a consideration in the resolution of the issue. I accept that there are always difficulties in tests. We know that. Senator Collins as a practitioner of the art of industrial relations negotiations knows that; hence, her justified hesitancy when a new test is brought up. My difficulty was that I accepted the case that somehow you needed a pre-arbitration determination to alleviate what seemed to be, from the evidence given to us, abuse issues in the process of these things. However, I thought that the government's test was too legalistic and likely to restrain the matter too far. Having accepted the proposition, I therefore had to find a way to express it in a more flexible manner which gave greater discretion to the commission. So that was the consequence of the words. `Reasonable', as you know, is a word which is commonly used in law and has some common law history and understanding; therefore, I thought that `no reasonable prospect of success' was in the end a useful summation of that intent. Quite frankly, as we all know as legislators and as you get more experienced in this business, you design some things with the best of intentions and sometimes the results may not be quite as you would expect. So I accept that you, or some of your colleagues, may be a little wary of this. ",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2001-08-08,"—Senator Murray's wording provides a less containing test in relation to the circumstances. I believe the words `no reasonable chance of success' indicate that, if you have any reasonable chance, you are okay. Whereas, if you look at it on the balance of probabilities that the claim is `likely to succeed', that test provides less scope for people who might still have some, perhaps very slight, reasonable chance of success. On that basis, we will support this amendment.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2001-08-08,"—How does that work out? Do the two parties go down and have a preliminary hearing and have another hearing after that? If Senator Collins were to return to industrial relations negotiations—not that she will now because she will go on to be a minister— would she have a preliminary hearing and have another hearing after that? It is a very interesting concept: you have a decision maker making a decision as to whether or not he ought to make a decision of a different nature later on. Will you have different people hearing it or will the same person hear it? If the same person is going to hear it, why do you make the distinction in any event?",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-08-08,"—I know that Senator Cooney has great experience in law. He would know that, whether it is a tribunal or a court or a commission, there are frequently proceedings prior to the main event, if you like, whereby it is established that there is a case or there are grounds or there are justifications and where advice is proffered on those grounds by registrars in a formal sense and, quite often, in an informal sense.
The intent here is to try to weed out those defences to applications which are patently manufactured for the wrong purpose, in other words, to pressure the other side such that they submit even when the case is unwarranted. My understanding of law—and I do not have the same experience as Senator Cooney—is that preliminary hearings or meetings of this sort are not uncommon. Personally I think it is a useful addition to the process if the commission is able to assist the parties with an early first summation of the situation. It does not prevent applicants pursuing it further if they wish, but then the commission will have regard to their motives.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2001-08-08,"—The government will be supporting these amendments. The debate has already taken place on the other side of the chamber, so I feel rather superfluous here this morning. The government believes that the amendments, although they do not take the issues as far as we would like, move them in the right direction. So we will support the amendments. Just for the record—I did not dare interrupt the debate that was taking place between the Labor Party and the Democrats on the last amendment—honourable senators will have noted that the government supported the previous amendment that was made on the basis that the Democrats' amendments that we have now agreed to were consistent with the sentiment of item 11 of the bill as originally proposed. 
Amendments agreed to. ",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-08-08,"—I refer to amendment (9) on sheet 2000, which addresses item 15, schedule 1. I also refer to my amendments (10) to (13) on sheet 2000, which oppose items 16 to 24 in schedule 1. I ask by leave that all those matters be dealt with together.
 (Senator Knowles)—You are going to speak to them all together; is that correct? 
—I will do that if you wish or, if the Senate prefers, I can deal with amendment (9) and then we can deal with amendments (10) to (13).
—We will deal with amendment (9) first and then with amendments (10) to (13) because we have to put the question separately, anyway.
—I move:
(9)	Schedule 1, item 15, page 7 (line 35) to page 8 (line 12), omit the item, substitute:
15  At the end of subsection 170CFA(1)

This amendment relates to item 15. If you look in the explanatory memorandum, it says that item 15 repeals existing subsection 170CFA(1) and replaces it with a new subsection. That would apply where the commission indicates that on the balance of probabilities the applicant is likely to succeed in arbitration on the ground referred to in paragraph 170CE(1)(a), that is, that the dismissal was harsh, unjust or unreasonable. In that circumstance the applicant could elect to proceed to arbitration to determine whether the dismissal was harsh, unreasonable or to discontinue the application. All we have added is a qualifying note in relation to the certificates which we believe improves the process, if you like. It is on that basis that I support the amendment.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2001-08-08,"—My reading of this amendment—and I am hoping that Senator Murray will be able to confirm this—is that it is aimed at clarifying or ensuring that it is clear that a subdivision C matter or element of a case would be kept alive contra to a 170CFA(2) certificate—that an employer can make that such an action. Is that the case, Senator Murray? 
—That is correct. 
—On that basis the Labor Party will support the amendment.

— Senator Murray, that matter has already been resolved. We are now on your amendment No. (15). 
—I thought you had resolved it. I just thought I should put on the record what the matter was about because I had not done so. If you recall, I was asked to deal with the matters respectively, but I am more than happy to proceed as the committee advises. Everybody knows what is happening, so that is fine. 
— Senator, you can still put your view on the record if you so wish. 
—I have said enough. I just wanted to make sure that everyone knew that it was stopping the elections for arbitration or court proceedings from being further truncated. I move:

	(db)	the degree to which the absence of dedicated human resource management specialists or expertise in the undertaking, establishment or service would be likely to impact on the procedures followed in effecting the termination; and
This amendment relates to schedule 1, item 26, of the bill. It adds, at the end of the item, a qualification. This section of the act deals with the nature of the employer's undertaking. We believe that the absence or presence of dedicated human resource management specialists or expertise impacts on the procedures followed in effecting the termination. We think that there is a superficiality in regarding the size of a business as relative to liability or ability in the area of human relations. For instance, somebody may come out of a major company having been the human resources manager and start up a small services business. Frankly, those persons would be equipped at all times to know the proper procedures and how they should have dealt with an employee; whereas somebody who comes from a different environment may not be as cluey, if you like, about how you establish matters of process regarding appointment, warnings and eventual dismissal. This is just a qualification of the government's proposal.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2001-08-08,"—The government's bill includes the size of a business in the criteria to determine whether a dismissal is unfair by reason of procedural fairness. From our point of view, that is just an alternative means of introducing the exclusion criteria of perhaps the size of the business. It is clear that these amendments, which unfortunately the Democrats support, add a factor to this. The Democrats also want to include the degree to which the absence of dedicated human resource management professionals impacted on procedures followed in effecting a termination. We oppose this. With respect, Senator Murray, we do not believe that ignorance is an excuse. We think there is a pretty clear indication of that principle generally at law. Even with what you propose here, clearly there still will not be a fair go all round. The worker, in effect, is still wearing the cost of the employer's ignorance.
Procedural fairness and natural justice are fairly fundamental human rights, harking back to Senator Murray's speech at the second reading stage of the bill. Employment is a fairly important legal and contractual relationship and deserves the application of these principles to it. We ask: to what other contractual or statutory duty would a government even contemplate applying a similar standard? I do not think it is okay to say that you do not have to pay tax because you do not have an accountant. Natural justice and procedural fairness are not difficult principles. If we start giving people excuses for not applying them, they only start taking them. I think this is a bad proposal in both the government's and the Democrats' form and, therefore, we will not support the amendment.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-08-08,"—I refer to items 25, 27 and 46 of the bill. Item 46 is an applications and savings provision—the other two are the substantive provisions—and it relates to my amendments 14, 16 and 32 on sheet 2000. The amendments seek to omit the operational requirements of the employer's undertaking, establishment or service. Item 27 states that if the employment of a particular employee or group of employees was terminated on the grounds of the operational requirements of the employer's undertaking, establishment or service, the termination is not taken to be harsh, unjust or unreasonable, unless the circumstances are exceptional. We oppose that diminution of grounds.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2001-08-08,"—The items that the Democrats are opposing, and are seeking to have removed from the legislation, would have the effect of preventing the Australian Industrial Relations Commission from making a finding of harsh, unjust or unreasonable termination where the employer demonstrates that the reason for the termination was operational requirements, unless the circumstances were exceptional. The amendments would not allow dismissals that are unfair to be passed off as terminations for operational reasons if the facts show otherwise. However, where an employer establishes that decisions to terminate employment are based solely on the ground of operational requirements, that employer should not have those decisions exposed to review through the unfair dismissal process. However, where a termination decision is based on operational requirements, an employee will retain the right to seek a remedy if he or she was selected for redundancy on discriminatory grounds.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2001-08-08,"—For the record, the government's view is that remedies in respect of termination of employment should either be reinstatement or compensation in lieu of reinstatement. The remedy should be confined to the damage suffered because the employee has lost his or her job. The Democrat amendment would allow further compensation relating to the manner in which termination is affected. Accordingly, we will be voting against this amendment.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-08-08,"—I move amendment No. 18 on sheet 2000, which refers to government amendment of item 30 in their bill:
(18)	Schedule 1, item 30, page 13 (line 27), omit “a reasonable opportunity”, substitute “reasonable notice and a reasonable opportunity”.
This relates to the dismissal of an application. We have expanded the grounds established in line 27 which state that `a reasonable opportunity' should apply, and we have substituted `reasonable notice and a reasonable opportunity', which we think improves the process side of the matter. Item 30 of the bill intends to insert a new section 170CIB, which would give the commission, after giving the applicant a reasonable opportunity to be heard, the power to dismiss an application where the applicant fails to attend a proceeding. Proposed section 170CIB should be amended to include the wording `reasonable notice and a reasonable opportunity' to be heard before deciding whether to dismiss the application.

I am not even sure of the constitutionality of that, as indeed of some other matters later in the bill.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-08-08,"—My view is that as much disclosure, openness and transparency in law as in other things is desirable. One of the allegations made about practice in this field of law is that there are ambulance chasers. I believe that is so in other fields of law as well. I think it is perfectly proper for defendants to have friends in the court who are there as a result of their relationship, such as unions of employers or employees. I think it is perfectly proper, obviously, for people to pay for whatever the advice is. But, if people are there on spec, if you like—a contingency fee, generally speaking, means there is a share in the proceeds or a reward for success—that should be apparent as well, because that indicates the basis on which people are presenting themselves. 
I note that in a recent proposition in Perth—Senator Campbell would be aware of this, as would Temporary Chairman Knowles—the finance brokers are going to be challenged by investors on a contingency fee basis where the firm providing the funds will take a 30 per cent—I think it is—cut on success, and I think the organisation for investors will take a five per cent cut. Frankly, I say `good on them'. It is out there and in the open, and everybody knows the terms, including the judge. Despite the objections of some in the legal fraternity, I do not think it is a bad thing for everybody to know exactly where they stand when people are presenting themselves as friends, paid advisers or on spec, so I do not object to it at all.

 (Senator Knowles)—Move (19) at this stage and we will deal with (20) and (21) later.
—Amendment No. 19 relates to schedule 1, item 31, pages 13 and 14. Item 31 is tests for the making of costs orders. Item 31 of the bill proposes to amend the provisions governing the commission's power to award costs against parties' determination of employment applications to widen the circumstances in which costs can be awarded.
The amendments proposed by the bill are complex and do not directly address the issue of parties who continue proceedings or refuse to settle proceedings despite adverse indications from the commission about their prospects of success. Accordingly, the amendments proposed by item 31 of the bill should, in my view, be deleted and replaced by my proposed amendment, with a set of what I think are more straightforward provisions which spell out that the commission has the power to make costs orders in the following circumstances: where a termination of employment application or proceedings in relation to such an application are commenced without reasonable cause; where unreasonable failure to discontinue such applications or proceedings exists; and where a party engages in unreasonable conduct during proceedings. Further, there should be a provision which specifically provides that the commission may have regard to any certificate or advice given under section 170CF—and you will recall the earlier discussion—and whether a party pursued a course of action contrary to that certificate or advice. I therefore move Democrat amendment No. 19 on sheet 2000: 
19)	Schedule 1, item 31, page 13 (line 29), to page 14 (line 36), omit the item, substitute:
31  Subsections 170CJ(1), (2), (3), (4) and (5)
Repeal the subsections, substitute:
	(1)	If the Commission is satisfied:
	(a)	that a person (first party):
	(i)	made an application under section 170CE; or
	(ii)	began proceedings relating to an application; and
	(b)	the first party did so in circumstances where it should have been reasonably apparent to the first party that he or she had no reasonable prospect of success in relation to the application or proceeding;
the Commission may, on application under this section by the other party to the application or proceeding, make an order for costs against the first party.
	(2)	If the Commission is satisfied that a party (first party) to a proceeding relating to an application under section 170CE has acted unreasonably in failing:
	(a)	to discontinue the proceeding; or
	(b)	to agree to terms of settlement that could lead to the discontinuance of the application;
the Commission may, on an application under this section by the other party to the proceeding, make an order for costs against the first party.
	(3)	If the Commission is satisfied:
	(a)	that a party (first party) to a proceeding relating to an application made under section 170CE caused costs to be incurred by the other party to the proceeding; and
	(b)	that the first party caused the costs to be incurred because of the first party's unreasonable act or omission in connection with the conduct of the proceeding;
the Commission may, on an application by the other party under this section, make an order for costs against the first party.
	(4)	In making a decision under this section, the Commission may have regard to any certificate issued or advice given under section 170CF and whether a party pursued a course of action contrary to any such certificate or advice.
	(5)	An application for an order for costs under this section must be made within 14 days after the determination, discontinuance, settlement or dismissal of the application under section 170CE or proceeding relating to an application under section 170CE (as the case may be).
	(5A)	A schedule of costs may be prescribed in relation to items of expenditure likely to be incurred in respect of:
	(a)	an application to the Commission under section 170CE; and

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2001-08-08,"—What we are dealing with here is, essentially, the government's key amendments in the bill in relation to costs, a regime that the Labor Party does not support. In respect of this particular amendment, our understanding is that the Democrats pick up the lot, except for clause 4, dealing with the effect of a conciliation certificate on the decision to award costs. We generally oppose in principle the provision for costs in this jurisdiction. The purpose of this jurisdiction was to have a no cost, low formality jurisdiction to deal with industrial issues. Perhaps the first mistake was to let the lawyers in, but there is no way we should be countenancing the trend towards legality that legal costs awards encourage. The reality is that the commission loses the very things that make it attractive with this trend towards legality, and the Labor Party at least will try to defend the informal and accessible nature of our industrial tribunals. 
We respect the fact the Democrats are attempting to provide some balance, but our position in this particular instance is that this attempt will only have a fairly marginal—if not somewhat questionable—effect and so, on this occasion, unlike the next two amendments, we will not support the change.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-08-08,"—We should note that it is a discretion to the commission; it is a `may' clause and not a `must' clause. Secondly, we have also used the language `no reasonable prospect of success' throughout, so that the more expansive test is available for consideration in those matters. So we have made some adjustments throughout on item 19.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2001-08-08,"—The government's view is that the Democrats' amendment, although it does not go as far as item 31 in the bill, which is the government's preferred position, does move things in the right direction. It says that costs can be awarded in most types of proceedings in the commission which relate to the termination of employment and, by lowering the threshold test for determining costs applications, the proposed amendments will increase access to costs and further deter proceedings that are instituted without any reasonable cause.
To pick up what Senator Collins said earlier in relation to keeping costs down and trying to keep the process informal and also in relation to what was probably a bit of a throwaway line about lawyers getting involved, I think that we all respect the fact that these sorts of proceedings are, for both the employer and the employee, matters of high stakes. Regardless of what sort of employment you are talking about, you are dealing with people's lives, so clearly people need representation, and some people will obviously feel a lot happier having a lawyer present. I am sure that Senator Ludwig, who is sitting immediately behind Senator Collins, would think that lawyers could and should be involved in these proceedings on occasion. I do not want to encourage Senator Ludwig to speak, but I am sure that lawyers have a place in these situations. Where there are costs, clearly it is appropriate that the commission be able to make an award of costs. I think the Democrats' amendment is quite reasonable, particularly to the extent that you do need a reasonable deterrent in relation to cases being instituted without reasonable cause. I think awarding of costs is a fair mechanism, not only to do that but also so that the parties have some respect and some knowledge and understanding of the costs that are involved.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech

Sometimes you learn in this place that you should not do that. Senator Collins said that I had almost picked up the government amendment in toto and just amended, I think, clause 4. I indicated that I had actually carried on the language we had used elsewhere in here. For instance, the government's language did not include the phrase `no reasonable prospect of success'.

I do not think if you have been directed to attend something you should have to pay the costs for it, so we have knocked that one out. I think that is a reasonable one. We have also knocked out paragraph 170CJ(8)(a), which ends with the statement: `This list is not an exhaustive list.'

The Democrats propose to allow the commission some discretion in determining whether to allow an application, and this we would support. As far as I am aware, there is no evidence of any problems arising from second applications. If there is a problem, the commission is best placed to determine whether there is good reason to allow a second application.

"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2001-08-08,"—I would like to speak very briefly on Democrat amendment (25) and indicate that Pauline Hanson's One Nation will support the addition of this section. The reason I rise to speak on this is to highlight one of the problems I believe are endemic in the family law legislation. We only have to go to part A applications, which is what is purported to be a revision process within that act, to find that they are without precedent knocked out, based on the fact that there is no indication that allows an application that was incorrect to be corrected. So we have a parallel situation in the Family Law Act where the section could be clearly defined as the Democrats are clearly defining this one by adding the words `unless the second application corrects an error in the previous application'. The point I am making is that, if a similar amendment had been moved to the Family Law Act, it would have assisted an enormous number of applicants who for some reason or other had made an error in their application. I believe it has merit in this application, and I indicate that Pauline Hanson's One Nation will support the Democrat amendment.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-08-08,"—by leave—I move amendments (26) and (27) on sheet 2000:
(26)	Schedule 1, item 40, page 17 (line 26), after “applicant”, insert “or a respondent”.
 (27)	Schedule 1, item 40, page 18 (line 2), after “applicant”, insert “or a respondent”.
These amendments refer to schedule 1, item 40 of the bill. That deals with unmeritorious or speculative proceedings. Item 40 of the bill is another of the major provisions in the bill. It would introduce a new series of provisions to give the Federal Court the power to issue penalties to lawyers and other advisers who encourage an applicant to institute or pursue in the commission a speculative or unmeritorious claim in respect of harsh, unjust or unreasonable termination. The prohibition on the encouragement of speculative or unmeritorious claims and proceedings should also apply to lawyers and other advisers of respondents to claims. This change deals with that matter. 
But we are also dealing here with quite a fundamental issue. For those who read about alternative law systems with interest, for as long as this country persists with the adversarial mode of law and does not attend to any of the inquisitorial traditions, we will have to pay more attention to the behaviour of lawyers and advisers than we perhaps have to in inquisitorial jurisdictions. That is my belief. This provision attends to that, but it should attend equally to those who advise applicants and respondents and to the applicants and respondents themselves.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2001-08-08,"—I should indicate that it is here that essentially we part ways with the Democrats in their amendments. Whilst the one amendment that sat within the contingency fee arrangements did not quite deal directly with those issues, these matters do deal quite directly with the government's agenda on unmeritorious and speculative proceedings, although I think this was probably one of the areas where you indicated your thoughts some time ago. All of these amendments, if I am correct, as we go through to the remainder of the bill—or perhaps, from our view of its worth, I should refer to the entrails of the guts of the bill—deal with unmeritorious and speculative proceedings, penalties for advisers and who can make such applications. In our view, the government want to punish worker advocates for encouraging what are in their view unmeritorious or speculative claims by allowing costs to be awarded against them. The Democrat amendments here will extend this regime to apply to employer advocates.
On this point, I want to refer to the submission of the ACTU to the inquiry into this bill, which puts the argument against the government's proposals, I believe, fairly well. For the record, Senator Campbell, you are probably aware that I am not a lawyer, so it is an argument with which I am dealing with some element of distance. The ACTU's submission indicates that the Industrial Relations Commission already has the power to issue costs orders against parties who make applications without reasonable cause and/or act unreasonably in connection with the proceedings. The commission has proved itself prepared to make these orders in roughly equal numbers against applicants and respondents, so the power already exists to some extent.
The proposal for fines for representatives who encourage unmeritorious or speculative proceedings, with the onus on the representative to prove that this does not occur once a prima facie case has been made out, is an outrageous interference in the relationship between representatives, whether they be lawyers, union officials or other persons, and their clients or members. In no other court or tribunal do advisers face the threat of fines for giving advice, nor are they required to make an independent assessment of the facts of the case other than the instructions received from their client. The proposal can have no other intention than to discourage lawyers and union officials from assisting applicants in proceedings related to alleged unfair dismissals. 
The ACTU submitted that the considerations raised by the Law Council of Australia in its submission should lead the committee to recommend that this proposal not be passed by the Senate. We draw on these issues which, in summary in the ACTU submission, are that, while a case may not appear winnable on law as it currently stands, law is a process of continual development and there should not be a prohibition on suggesting new interpretations to tribunals. Where a client is advised that a case should not proceed but the client wishes to do so, there are costs orders available for vexatious or unreasonable claims. There will be situations where advisers are forced to disclose what ought to be confidential communications with clients, whether or not these are subject to the law of legal professional privilege, and there is no evidence that unmeritorious claims are made in spite of the availability of costs orders against applicants.
I appreciate that Senator Murray in his amendments is attempting to achieve a balance by extending these provisions to respondent advisers. I think, however, that this approach is wrong. An unfair burden is not made fairer by spreading bad policy more evenly. It still makes bad policy. In our view, this is bad policy. In the committee hearing, there was no evidence that the general process of dealing with legal misconduct is not working, and there are also some quite serious constitutional concerns about proceeding down this path.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2001-08-08,"—We support the amendments moved by the Australian Democrats. They will broaden the operation of the subsection so that the prohibition on the encouragement of speculative or unmeritorious unfair dismissal claims and proceedings applies to the lawyers and advisers of applicants and respondents.
I think Senator Murray referred to `ambulance chasers' in debate on a previous amendment. It is clear from submissions from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry to the Senate inquiry—they provided a number of case studies on that but it is also anecdotally the case—that this seems to be a growing practice in Australia, where some advisers and lawyers are basically encouraging people to make claims under the unfair dismissal provisions. It certainly is a problem that small business have brought to the attention of the government on a number of occasions. Recently in the review of the federal unfair dismissal laws, the government noted:
... the concern of employers and small business about the increasing likelihood of inappropriate or speculative applications arising from legal practitioners operating on a `pay if you win' basis or lawyers or other service providers inappropriately advertising the ease of access to the unfair dismissal process.
I will also quote from one of the ACCI's case studies that I understand were provided to the Senate committee:
In one particular instance, the respondent's human resources manager was told by the applicant, three days prior to conciliation, that he wished to withdraw his application. However, the applicant stated that he was advised by his solicitor that he was obligated to proceed with the matter under the engagement agreement with the solicitor.
The applicant was distressed by this direction from the solicitor but proceeded with the matter out of intimidation.
That is one example but, from the range of case studies that I have been able to use over the last few minutes, it is not an isolated example. I think the Democrat amendment should move in the right direction in trying to solve that problem.
Could I also correct something that Senator Collins has said. I think she was quoting the ACTU, and so it is quite possible that it is wrong and that she has been misled. Senator Collins is wrong when she says— and I think she was quoting the ACTU—that the AIRC can make costs orders. The fact is that it cannot make costs orders against third parties. The AIRC has called for the review of the costs provisions so it can have that power. It should also be made clear that it is not constitutional to give that power to the AIRC, so the bill proposes to give that power to the Federal Court. ",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2001-08-08,"—Perhaps I should clarify a couple of things from the basis of what Senator Campbell said. No, I was not seeking to indicate that the commission could apply costs orders to third parties. I do not think it is appropriate that that occur. The examples that Senator Campbell referred to were very interesting in the committee consideration, because—as I am sure the department representatives here will recall—on questioning about some of those examples and how the victims of such conduct had pursued resolution to matters, we discovered that essentially nothing had been done. There was no example of, for instance, a matter being taken to the Law Council and no action or appropriate redress being applied. It seemed that we had before the committee from organisations—principally ACCI, I think—a list of grievances on which the employers had taken no action. I think that to take such a significant step in our Westminster legal system, a step quite inconsistent with what applies in any other jurisdictions, on a matter that may not be constitutional needs more than just ACCI's complaints, to which they cannot indicate that they have sought redress through the appropriate channels and had no success. The case might have had some merit to us if the government had been able to indicate some examples where redress had been sought and no success had been achieved, but if I am correct in my recollections I cannot think of one case to which that process could be fully applied.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-08-08,"—The National Crime Authority Legislation Amendment Bill 2000 [2001] represents a number of changes to the National Crime Authority Act 1984 which will significantly increase the ability of the National Crime Authority to conduct investigations into serious and organised crime. In fact, the bill adopts a number of amendments which were put forward by the opposition on 13 March 2000—over a year ago—in the form of a private member's bill introduced by Mr Duncan Kerr, the shadow minister for justice. At that time, the government could not bring itself to endorse opposition legislation, even though it knew that the legislation was both necessary and appropriate. It is a shame that we now have to revisit this legislation some 12 months later: there has been a 12-month delay in putting into place these reforms.
On this basis, the opposition support the thrust of the bill in seeking to improve the National Crime Authority's efficiency and effectiveness. In particular, we accept the need to amend the National Crime Authority Act so as to remove the defence of reasonable excuse, to remove the derivative use of immunity and to increase penalties. However, the opposition are acutely aware that there is a fine balance to be struck between giving law enforcement agencies effective investigative tools and protecting the rights of individuals. This bill, we believe, goes too far in a number of provisions, and the opposition will not be supporting those. We also think that the overview provisions are not sufficient, and we will be moving amendments to strengthen the oversight and accountability of the National Crime Authority—indeed, the oversight and accountability of Commonwealth law enforcement as a whole. I will come to the detail of those provisions later. 
It is becoming almost a matter of notorious information to those people advising potential witnesses who could come before an NCA hearing that witnesses can effectively avoid the consequences of compelled testimony by using one of two routes: making a frivolous claim for immunity on the basis that an answer might incriminate them or simply refusing to answer such a question at all, knowing that the penalties, if any, that will be imposed when the matter is prosecuted are on the very minor part of the scale of criminal responsibility.
This has become an almost unsurmountable impediment to the NCA, which is tasked with investigating serious and organised crime. The bill addresses this problem by removing the defence of reasonable excuse, removing the derivative use immunity and increasing the penalties for refusal to answer. In the view of the shadow minister, this is the way to go. At the moment, witnesses at NCA hearings are able to refuse to give evidence if they have a reasonable excuse. If a witness refuses to answer questions on this ground, the only way that the NCA is able to pursue the evidence is to obtain a court order requiring the witness to give the answer. In practice, this is time consuming and a costly process which is rarely pursued by the NCA. As a result, quite often witnesses are exculpated and avoid the obligation to answer reasonable questions by refusing to answer questions at all.
There have been parliamentary inquiries on the bill. During the joint parliamentary committee hearing on the bill, the ex-chair of the NCA cited a case where a witness before the NCA refused to confirm a family relationship on the grounds that to do so would be self-incriminating. The NCA then had to test whether or not this was a reasonable excuse not to answer a question in the Federal Court. This bill removes the ability of witnesses to refuse to answer a question based on a defence of reasonable excuse. The defence of reasonable excuse will be removed and replaced with the defences set out under the Criminal Code. We will be supporting this direction.
In respect of selfincrimination, currently a witness before the NCA who raises a reasonable claim that the answer to a question or the production of a document may tend to incriminate him or her is entitled to refuse to answer the question or produce the document or thing unless he or she receives an undertaking from the appropriate DPP that the answer, document or thing, or anything derived from them, will not be used in evidence against the person in any later proceedings. The bill removes derivative use immunity. Immunity was an issue that was negotiated on hard at the time this legislation first appeared in the parliament when the National Crime Authority was set up. Under the amendments in the bill, a witness who raises a claim of selfincrimination will be required to answer the question or present the document, and it will be an offence if he or she fails to do so. The evidence then given will not be admissible in any future proceedings—without the need for the DPP to give such an undertaking. However, evidence derived from the evidence given can be used. So this legislation will bring the NCA legislation and powers into line with ASIC, the ACCC and the New South Wales Crime Commission. There will be increased penalties for refusal to answer, and they are supported.
This bill also proposes to extend to state and territory magistrates the authority to issue search warrants sought by NCA members and certain staff members under sections 22 and 23 of the NCA Act. These provisions currently apply only to judges of the Federal Court and state and territory judges. At the time when the NCA was set up this was something that would never have got through the parliament. It is getting through now after some 15 years or so of experience of the operation of the National Crime Authority. The opposition's position is that it is not appropriate that state and territory magistrates have the authority to grant warrants for NCA activities. We will move an amendment which will limit the extension to federal magistrates only. If the government will not accept this amendment, the opposition will support the amendment that we believe will be moved by the Democrats which will oppose the extension to all magistrates.
The proposed extension of the NCA's contempt regime has been the subject of adverse comment in several submissions and extensive discussion at the committee's public hearing. Even the majority report of the committee commendably expressed reticence about this proposal. Unfortunately, government members then took the soft option of agreeing to its implementation for a trial period of five years. In this respect, we share the concerns which have been expressed by people such as the Attorney-General of South Australia, Trevor Griffin, and the former NCA chair, Mr John Broome. Their arguments were essentially twofold: firstly, that as a matter of general principle it is inappropriate to seek to liken an investigatory body such as the NCA to a court and, secondly, that the contempt provisions are unnecessary if the proposals contained in the bill in relation to removing the `reasonable excuse' concept and the substantial increases in penalties are enacted. 
Let us make it clear that the NCA is not a judicial body; it is an investigative agency of the federal executive. In our view it is therefore a seriously flawed breach of the separation of powers concept to imply that hindering or obstructing an investigatory body can be equated to contempt of court. On these grounds we reject the inclusion of a contempt regime for the NCA. We believe that it would be prudent to monitor the success of the other provisions, and if the need is still there in, say, five years time then the parliament can revisit the matter.
There are also provisions in respect of Australian Public Service employees. The bill proposes new subsections 47(3) and (4) to the NCA Act, giving the chairperson the power to employ persons outside of the Public Service Act. The NCA's justification for seeking these additional powers is that it perceives a need for more flexibility than the act provides. We do not have any quarrel with the need for flexible employment provisions, but they already exist in the National Crime Authority's current legislation and in the Public Service regulations.
We believe much weight should be given to the opinion of Mr John Broome, who was NCA chair for a period of four years from 1995 to 1999. He told the NCA committee that the reasons advanced in the second reading speech for these proposals were `clearly spurious'. He stressed that he had regularly faced uncertainty about the NCA's budgetary situation but that he was always able to achieve the necessary degree of staffing flexibility within the NCA chairperson's existing statutory powers. The opposition do not believe that the expanded employment powers provided for in the bill are either necessary or desirable. We will move amendments to oppose them.
I mentioned earlier the need for oversight. The flip side of giving our law enforcement agencies effective tools is ensuring that these tools are used appropriately. At the moment there is no independent overview of the NCA, and the question can fairly be asked: who is policing the police? This is by no means intended to reflect on the integrity of the authority or to suggest that corruption within the authority exists. However, history has shown that it is enormously naive to leave police or investigative organisations to supervise themselves.
In this respect, we have been working with the government to achieve some sort of compromise in the role of the Ombudsman. The government proposes to amend proposed section 9(3)(e) to remove the last two grounds for denying the Ombudsman access to information. After negotiation, the opposition have agreed that we will support a modified version of this amendment which will provide that the Attorney-General may certify that the Ombudsman may be denied access to NCA information if such actions may endanger the life of a person or create a risk of serious injury to a person. That would be allowable.
In conclusion, this bill contains a number of provisions which are necessary in order to ensure that the NCA has the capacity to investigate serious organised crime. Labor have always supported the need for and the role of the NCA—in fact, it was Labor that set up the National Crime Authority—and we will continue to do so. However, in the realm of law enforcement there is always a balance to be struck between law enforcement powers, accountability and civil liberties. We believe that the position we are taking with respect to this legislation strikes that balance, and we urge the Senate to accept the amendments that I will be moving in the committee stage.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2001-08-08,"—I am privileged to be a member of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. My only regret with that is that I do not have enough time to spend on it. The committee has full Democrat support and is clearly interesting and productive. In that context, it might be helpful, before I enter into the second reading debate on the National Crime Authority Legislation Amendment Bill 2000 [2001], just to sketch an outline of exactly what the NCA is and what it does. I would like to do that by borrowing directly from the Bills Digest and commend again the work of Jennifer Norberry from the Parliamentary Library. In summary, Ms Norberry has said:
The National Crime Authority ... describes itself as being conceived as `part royal commission, part police force.' The Australian Law Reform Commission describes it in the following way:
The NCA is a national law enforcement body whose main role is to counteract organised crime often by working in partnership with other agencies. The NCA's working definition of organised crime is `a systematic conspiracy to commit serious offences.' Generally, the NCA investigates relevant criminal activities and collects, analyses and disseminates information and intelligence relating to those activities. Where appropriate it establishes and co-ordinates task forces with other law enforcement bodies for the investigation of those matters. It may also make recommendations for legal and administrative reforms.
The NCA uses multi-disciplinary teams of lawyers, police, financial investigators, intelligence analysts and support staff to investigate organised crime. The Act gives the NCA coercive powers to compel people to produce documents and to give sworn evidence. Those powers are not available to traditional police services. The NCA can only exercise its coercive powers in matters which have been formally referred to it for investigation. These characteristics are meant to enable the NCA to co-ordinate national investigations against major organised crime by complementing the efforts of other law enforcement agencies and by working co-operatively with them.
Section 7 of the Principal Act provides that the Authority consists of a Chairperson and members who are appointed by the Governor-General. The Chairperson must be a judge or a legal practitioner who has been enrolled to practise for at least five years.
The Principal Act enables the Authority to investigate `relevant criminal activity' an expression which is in turn linked to the concept of a `relevant offence' against Commonwealth, State or Territory law. The term, `relevant offence' is defined as an offence involving two or more persons in substantial planning and organisation using sophisticated techniques. Further, it must involve an offence such as theft, fraud, tax evasion or illegal drug dealing which is punishable by imprisonment for at least three years. This definition attempts to confine the Authority to the investigation of organised criminal activity.
According to the Authority's Annual Report 1999-2000, the most commonly investigated offences include drug importation, cultivation, manufacture and trafficking and associated money laundering, theft, fraud, tax evasion, bribery, extortion and violence.
Under the Principal Act, the Authority has two types of functions. General functions are set out in subsection 11(1) and can be exercised on the Authority's own initiative. They include collecting, analysing and disseminating criminal information and intelligence, investigating matters of its own choosing, making arrangements for the establishment of task forces and co-ordinating their work. The Authority's coercive powers cannot be exercised in relation to its general functions.
Subsection 11(2) confers special functions on the Authority enabling it to investigate matters relating to `federally relevant criminal activity' referred to it either by the Commonwealth Minister or the relevant State or Territory Minister or Ministers. These investigations are often called special investigations. Before referring a matter to the Authority the Commonwealth Minister must consult with the Inter-Governmental Committee. The Inter-Governmental Committee consists of the Commonwealth Minister and a Minister from each of the States and Territories. A State or Territory Minister must obtain the approval of the Inter-Governmental Committee before referring a matter to the Authority. Once a matter has been referred to the Authority either by the Commonwealth Minister or a State Minister the Authority can investigate that matter using its special coercive powers. These powers include `hearings, including compulsory appearances and production of documents, imposition of penalties and warrants for search and seizure, for arrest and for interception of communications'. 
Accountability mechanisms were inserted into the Principal Act because of concerns about the powers of the Authority. These mechanisms include the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority (PJC) which is established under section 53 of the Principal Act. Among other things, the Committee monitors and reviews the performance of the Authority.
Following the passage of the Principal Act and the National Crime Authority (Consequential Amendments) Act 1984, the States and Territories passed mirror legislation enabling the Authority to investigate offences against State and Territory laws. The Principal Act has been recently amended on a number of occasions to clarify its framework for inter-jurisdictional cooperation and respond to the High Court's decisions in Re Wakim and R v. Hughes.
That is the basic context in which we find the amendment bill before us today. The bill is offering a number of changes to the current powers of the National Crime Authority. We are supportive of the work of the NCA in combating organised crime and accept that it is a unique law enforcement body confronting a difficult task. It has a number of powers, such as I have outlined, that are not normally available to law enforcement bodies. It can, for example, compel people to produce documents and to give sworn evidence. This bill proposes to further expand the powers of the NCA and, while we Democrats are supportive of efforts to combat crime, we are wary, we are cautious, of conferring excessive powers on any law enforcement body.
The crucial issue is to ensure that there is a balance struck between the imperatives of dealing with serious criminality on the one hand and protecting basic standards of accountability and civil liberties on the other. While aspects of this bill are appropriate, we do have an ongoing concern about a number of the proposals that it contains. In particular, we oppose the proposals to expand the category of people who may issue search warrants. We are also concerned about the new contempt regime and the selfincrimination provisions contained in the bill. We note that these provisions attracted criticism during the committee inquiry into this bill and, in our view, these criticisms are reasonable and well founded. I want to pursue those issues in greater detail in the committee stage and I foreshadow that I will be moving amendments to address some of those Democrat concerns.
The government has circulated a range of amendments, some of which offer a compromise in relation to differing views held by the parties in this chamber. Others simply relate to technical drafting matters. We are supportive of a number of government amendments but in some cases feel that they do not adequately deal with the problems raised by the bill. The opposition will be moving several amendments to address a range of matters considered by the committee examining this bill. The ALP amendments reflect a number of concerns shared by the ALP and the Democrats, and I foreshadow Democrat support for some of those amendments. Greater detail can be found in the minority report to the committee inquiry, which the Democrats were in large agreement with Labor on. However, we had one additional comment, and I will speak to that further when we get to the committee stage.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,2001-08-08,"—As a member of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, I propose to speak briefly on this important legislation which will greatly strengthen and refine the powers of the NCA. More importantly, it will enable it to more effectively reflect the changing nature of organised crime. Our committee unanimously endorsed the thrust of our government's legislation, and it was acknowledged that these reforms are greatly needed. The National Crime Authority Legislation Amendment Bill 2000 [2001] will reduce the opportunity for individuals to manipulate, frustrate and obstruct NCA investigations. One of the most obvious deficiencies is the low rate of penalties for people who obstruct the NCA's process of investigation. This bill will substantially increase the penalty for refusing to answer a question at a hearing from six months imprisonment and a $1,100 fine to five years imprisonment and a $20,000 fine. This is a long overdue reform, and I am glad we are now so close to seeing it become law. This bill will also help the NCA deal with those seeking to obstruct its investigations by creating a legal contempt regime to enable the NCA to go straight to the Supreme Court of the state or territory in which it is holding its hearing and apply to have the suspect's conduct treated as if it were a contempt of that court.  
To further reduce the opportunity for long and costly legal challenges, the bill ensures that this contempt regime will be exempt from the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. NCA agents will now also be able to use the self-incriminatory evidence of a person to find other evidence that verifies the admission already made. So, while evidence from their selfincrimination will not be used directly against them, it will be used to assist the NCA to find other evidence against the suspect. As Senator Ellison said this morning in his press conference, at which he released the NCA's commentary, detailing emerging threats, possible responses and achievements in a range of key organised crime activities, including illicit drug trafficking, people smuggling, fraud and tax evasion and money laundering, this government is doing all it can to ensure that criminals are brought to justice.
Another advantage that the NCA will gain from this legislation is that the often erroneous defence of `reasonable excuse'—for conduct such as refusing to answer a question—will at last be removed. In its place will be more clearly defined Criminal Code defences, such as a sudden emergency or an intervening event. If the NCA believes that a suspect does not have a reasonable excuse, this legislative amendment will prevent that person under investigation from challenging the NCA's decision and authority in the Federal Court.
The introduction of staff positions known as `hearing officers' will be another important reform. These people will be appointed by the federal government on the unanimous recommendation of the Intergovernmental Committee of the National Crime Authority. Hearing officers will be able to undertake hearings on behalf of the NCA and, while their numbers will rise, there will be no change to the number of `members'. This will greatly expand and strengthen the NCA's capacity to carry out a greater number of investigations. Other changes include extending the terms of NCA members from four to six years to allow greater continuity and expanding the class of persons who may issue search warrants to include magistrates. 
The committee inquiry heard very convincing evidence in support of the NCA from crime fighting agencies such as the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission, both of which are operating in a highly effective way. 
Finally, this legislation will deem the NCA to be a prescribed authority for the purposes of the Ombudsman Act to enable the Commonwealth Ombudsman to deal with complaints made against the agency. This will ensure that a greater level of accountability is introduced to complement the strengthening of the National Crime Authority's powers. This legislation will help enormously to equip the NCA with the greater power and accountability it needs to fight increasingly more complex and sophisticated forms of organised crime. Members of the committee have been very concerned that, no matter how quickly the NCA and its colleague bodies in the states are able to deal with organised crime, organised crime seems able to always stay a couple of steps ahead. The NCA has already proven its effectiveness in fighting the drug war, amongst other things, and I hope the additional powers it acquires as a result of the passing of this bill will assist it even further in continuing its commendable work.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2001-08-08,"—I thought I might take the opportunity to pass a few comments on the National Crime Authority Legislation Amendment Bill 2000 whilst my colleagues come to the chamber. I want to address, at short notice, some of the legal issues raised in the bill. These issues go to reasonable excuse, self-incrimination, increased penalties for refusal to answer, people who may issue warrants, the contempt regime sought to be amended in the bill, the fact that the NCA has non-Australian Public Service employees, and some oversight by the Ombudsman, which is an emerging issue in this debate.
By way of introduction, I point out that the bill presents a number of changes to the NCA Act which will significantly increase the ability of the NCA to conduct investigations into serious and organised crime. In fact, the bill adopts a number of amendments which were put forward by the opposition on 13 March last year in the form of a private member's bill introduced by the then spokesperson, Mr Duncan Kerr, the shadow minister for justice. At that time, the government could not bring itself to endorse opposition legislation, even though it was both necessary and appropriate, as we repeatedly pointed out in the committee stage, in press releases and in public discussions arising from those developments.  
It is fair to say that it is a shame because it is now more than 12 months later that these reforms will be put into place. On that basis, I am pleased to advise that the opposition supports the thrust of the bill in seeking to improve the NCA's efficiency and effectiveness—worthy objectives, indeed. In particular, we accept the need to amend the NCA Act so as to remove the defence of `reasonable excuse' and the `derivative use immunity' and to increase penalties in this area. However, as always, the opposition is acutely aware that there is a fine balance to be struck between giving law enforcement agencies effective investigation tools and protecting the rights of individuals.

"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2001-08-08,"—I do not think I will be able to meet the standards just set by Senator Bishop, but I shall endeavour to do so. The National Crime Authority Legislation Amendment Bill 2000 makes very substantial changes to the National Crime Authority Act 1984. Prior to the National Crime Authority Act there was another act which set off a history, if you like, of law enforcement in this area. The National Crime Authority Act set up an authority which was intended to deal with major crime. It is in that context that this legislation might be looked at. It is said that the National Crime Authority does not look at crime that we would call street crime or minor crime, such as breaking and entering. I do not suggest for one minute that breaking and entering is not a serious crime, but it is not the sort of crime that the National Crime Authority is looking for. The NCA is looking for big drug crimes brought about by syndicates or for big commercial fraud—crime behind which there has to be some organisation in the sense that somebody has to plan it—and then it tries to do something about it. 
Because of the nature of the crime involved, this legislation gives law enforcement authorities some exceptional powers. Those exceptional powers are given on the basis that they are directed to the sort of crime I have just been talking about. In other words, the sort of person whom an investigator with the National Crime Authority is going to meet is going to be a person of some intelligence, with an ability to organise and to keep close to himself or herself evidence that might otherwise lead to a conviction of that person. It is now said that the act is not sufficient; that legislation has to be introduced to make the powers given under the National Crime Authority Act even more extensive than they presently are. 
The power given by the National Crime Authority Act that causes most concern is the power to question people. The investigation of crime depends upon the ability of the authority to question people who are accused of crime. But that itself brings problems, because you have an authority that has, if you like, a different ability to ask questions than, say, a policeman. A policeman cannot force a person to answer a question. He can invite the person to answer a question. He can take the person into custody on the suspicion that the person has committed a crime and question him for hours, but he cannot force that person to answer a question. The National Crime Authority can in certain circumstances do that. 
The problem with that is that the balance of power between the person who is asking the question and the person who is answering the question is stark. The person who has to do the answering is in jeopardy of not being able to do for himself or herself justice to the case that he or she wants to put. So that is the first worry about a questioning regime. The questioning regime set up by the National Crime Authority Act can be quite severe. It has been alleged over the years to have been severe, and some notable cases have been fought about that issue.  
The issues that are central to this legislation are pointed out by the amendments that the government wants to bring to the bill. I want to look in that context at amendment (2) of the amendments that are being suggested to the legislation before us. It sets up a person or a body to examine how this act is to work five years from now. It says: 
The Minister must cause a person (the responsible person) to review, and to report in writing about, the operation of the National Crime Authority Act 1984 as affected by the following provisions of this Act: 
Then it goes on to describe the sorts of things that must be reviewed. The review and report must include an assessment of the effect of the following provisions in facilitating the performance of the functions of the authority: the provision that removes the defence of reasonable excuse; the provision that removes the derivative-use immunity; the provisions that increase the penalties for non-compliance, the contempt provisions and so on. They are all provisions to be put into this act, if this legislation is passed, which will enable the authority to ask questions regardless of whether a person says that he has a reasonable excuse not to answer. So it is legislation that takes this idea of questioning much further than it has been taken hitherto. As the act now stands, if a person feels that he or she has a reasonable excuse not to answer, or there is some legal reason why that person feels that he or she has been badly treated, they can go off to the court in certain circumstances.
The basis upon which people are to go off to the court is to be much limited by this provision. This is an example of where the courts are to be again denied a jurisdiction that they presently have. This is another piece of legislation in which there is an attempt to reduce even further the jurisdiction of the courts. It has also been reduced in the migration area. In this context I will quote a passage from Sir Winston Churchill who made a statement in a debate in the House of Commons.
—A no-good conservative.
—It is said that he was a no-good conservative. I think there is a lot of truth in that, Senator, and it is on that basis that I now read the statement. Because he was so conservative, this resonates even more than it otherwise would. Talking about the need to keep the judiciary independent, he went on to say:
The judge has not only to do justice between man and man. He also—and this is one of his most important functions considered incomprehensible in some large parts of the world—has to do justice between the citizens and the State.
Senator Hutchins will forgive him for using the male gender in referring to the judges, but in those days there were very few women, if any, I think—
—It is a generic term.
—either in Australia or England, or anywhere else, Senator Abetz. He said:
The British Judiciary, with its traditions and record, is one of the greatest living assets of our race and people and the independence of the Judiciary is a part of our message to the ever-growing world which is rising so swiftly around us.
He then talked about the need for a judiciary that can do justice between the state and the individual. This piece of legislation seeks to modify that position even more than it is presently modified. To be fair to the government, I think that they see the problems that the legislation is going to present and are setting up this review, which is to take place five years from now, to see how the various amendments will operate. It is proper to have a debate about these issues now because I think that once they are in place it will be very hard to undo them. Once these amendments are set into legislation it is going to be very hard to take away the powers later.
Returning to what I was saying about questioning people, there are two things to be said. Firstly, if you are going to question a person you have to be sure that the question is fair in the sense that the person is able to do justice to himself or herself. Secondly, there are some procedures which are just so bad that you would not use them, whether the person can do justice to himself or not. I might add that a lot of good work has been done on this legislation. I see two people from the Attorney-General's Department present in the chamber. They have worked long and hard on this. It is proper in debates on legislation such as this to pay tribute to the public servants that do such work for the country. Not only that, they also have to withstand some fairly vigorous attacks— proper vigorous attacks—by members of this parliament who test them on the legislation they bring forward. I thank the gentlemen sitting in the box to the left of Minister Abetz—Mr Karl Alderson and Mr Geoff McDonald—for the help that they have given over the course of this legislation coming before the parliament. 
The other problem in the area of increasing powers—when increasing powers are given to authorities—is that there is very much a law and order campaign going on around Australia at the moment. This campaign is occurring for several reasons. Politicians always have to be very careful of the law and order campaigns. These campaigns tend to get people excited and they perhaps vote in a particular way. The media get people interested, tempers start to rise and that encourages things. We have to be very careful in that context that we do justice to the people who become subject to a law and order campaign.
Perhaps a good illustration of that at the moment is Christopher Skase. He conducted himself in a way that has brought opprobrium upon him, but he is now dead. I was brought up with the old-fashioned idea that, if you cannot say something good of the dead, say nothing. That does not seem to be the situation here. There has to be some dimension to society where people, if they do not forgive, at least do not remember with such harshness as they once did. We all have to go to our deaths and it is hoped that, when we do so, we will not be pursued forever.
—Go to confession.
—I would very much recommend that, Senator. The point I want to make is that this legislation must be looked at with a calm mind, a mind that assesses what is needed and what is not needed. It must be assessed in the context of our being a civil society, where we do not let authorities—and I used that word advisedly—use methods that are not civilised. We, of course, as a civil society want crime suppressed, because people should not be able to go around and arbitrarily damage this society. We should not have people who sell drugs on a vast scale when it is against the law. We should not have people perverting, in effect, the corporate world by doing all sorts of things within that corporate world that should not be done. We should not have corruption in public places. All these sorts of things happen and they should be eradicated. That is the balance we are forever seeking in debates such as this—the balance between what is reasonable and what is not reasonable.
We cannot as a civil society use the same sorts of methods that criminals use. Criminals attack the weak, hide their actions so as to obtain results and are oftentimes motivated by greed and ambition, et cetera. They do all sorts of things that we do not like which are destructive to society. But we cannot use those same methods to bring them to task and we cannot use them in ways that go against the dignity of people, because if we are in the sort of society we hope we are in we have to respect the dignity of everyone. We have to bring to task those who have transgressed our laws in a big way but we have got to do that in a way whereby we can, at the end of the day, say, `We've done this in a proper and right fashion.' I think some very interesting discussions will take place in this area during the committee stage, and I am looking forward to that.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2001-08-08,"—I rise to speak on the National Crime Authority Legislation Amendment Bill 2000 [2001], which is the government's version of Labor's National Crime Authority Amendment Bill 2000 introduced in the House as a private member's bill in March last year by the Hon. Duncan Kerr. As my colleagues have already outlined, Labor support the thrust of this bill and readily endorse the majority of the changes the bill will make to the National Crime Authority Act. We support the need to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the National Crime Authority. To that end, we support the measures in this bill that will remove the defence of reasonable excuse, remove the derivative use immunity and increase penalties. Again, as my colleagues have already indicated, Labor will not be supporting provisions in the bill that would appear to breach the separation of powers, or those that allow the NCA to employ persons outside the provisions of the Public Service Act. 
As I have already indicated, this bill directly adopts a number of provisions that Labor's shadow minister for justice and customs, the Hon. Duncan Kerr, introduced by way of a private member's bill in the House last year. The National Crime Authority Amendment Bill would have, exactly like this bill before us today, amended the National Crime Authority Act to remove the defence of reasonable excuse, to remove the derivative use immunity and to increase penalties. This is not the first time this government have engaged in this sort of policy stealing trickery. It is not the first time that they have run out of ideas, looked for inspiration or simply lost the initiative and looked through the pages and pages of Labor's policy that have been posted on our web site, picked out one they liked and introduced it as a bill.
Apart from this policy, which is now well over a year old for Labor, the government has also recently adopted our scheme for the civil confiscation of assets that are the proceeds of crime. Under this plan, which was again put to the House last year by Duncan Kerr in the form of a private member's bill, allowance would be made for the confiscation of assets on the grounds that, on the balance of probabilities, they are the proceeds of crime. This bill would target those who profit from crime, such as the so-called drug lords, and attack organised crime by striking at the heart of what drives the international criminal industry—that is, the massive financial rewards that can be reaped from illegal activity. Sadly, though, the government rejected Labor's Criminal Assets Recovery Bill 2000. But then what did we see almost a year later in February this year when Kim Beazley introduced his 10-point plan to tackle Australia's drug problem? We saw Minister Ellison, in an attempt to deflect attention from Labor's drugs policy, announce that he would take a proposal to cabinet for a civil confiscation scheme. Then, on 20 April this year, Minister Ellison announced that cabinet had approved our proposal for a civil confiscation scheme, although I must say that we are yet to see the legislation before the chamber.
We have also recently seen the government do tremendous backflips and adopt a series of Labor policies and plans on petrol and beer excise and the business activity statement. Under this government, it is a pretty safe bet that, if a member from the Labor Party introduces a private member's bill, or if a Labor shadow minister announces a plan or a new policy, you will inevitably see it pop up again a year later as a government bill in this chamber. After a year of the government neglecting this important issue, the provisions of this bill finally introduce into law a series of necessary reforms to the way the National Crime Authority operates in its vital task of combating organised crime.
This bill seeks, firstly, to remove the ground of defence of reasonable excuse used by witnesses refusing to answer questions or produce documents in a hearing. This rule can waste the NCA's time and resources, as the NCA is required to obtain a Federal Court order requiring the witness to give an answer when a defence of reasonable excuse is used. The bill replaces the reasonable excuse rule with a series of specific reasonable defence excuses contained within the Criminal Code.
Witnesses have also been able to frustrate investigations by refusing to answer questions or produce a document, on the grounds of self-incrimination, unless the Director of Public Prosecutions gives an undertaking that the answer given or document produced will not be used in evidence against the person in later proceedings. The bill abolishes this derivative use immunity rule, making it harder for witnesses to frustrate the proceedings of NCA hearings. The bill also substantially increases fines for refusing to answer questions, thus providing a proper deterrent to criminals who frustrate NCA investigations. The bill will also ensure proper accountability of the NCA through the Commonwealth Ombudsman, who will have the right to review complaints about the NCA or its members. 
As my colleagues have already indicated, Labor wholeheartedly endorses and supports these provisions, considering that these provisions have been part of Labor Party policy for over a year now. In some areas, however, the current bill goes further than Labor's original bill. In our opinion, some of the provisions in the current bill go too far and should be opposed.
In its current form, this bill will enable the NCA to detain persons who interfere with or obstruct a hearing and take them to the Supreme Court to have their conduct dealt with as if it were a contempt of court. Labor will be moving amendments to remove this provision, because we believe it would amount to a serious breach of the separation of powers. Many members of the government, in the conservative tradition of Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, have a serious problem getting their head around the constitutionally guaranteed separation of powers. The NCA is not a judicial body. It is an agent of the executive government, and its hearings should not be treated legally like proper judicial hearings.
Labor will also be moving amendments against provisions in the bill that allow for the NCA to employ persons on a short-term basis outside the requirements of the Public Service Act. These provisions, if implemented, will remove the process of public scrutiny provided for under the Public Service Act and thus create the danger that persons might be employed on the basis of nepotism or favouritism. Apart from these two provisions, which we believe are unnecessary and undesirable, Labor will be supporting this bill.
According to the National Crime Authority's annual report 1999-2000, the most commonly investigated offences included drug importation, cultivation, manufacture, trafficking and associated money laundering, theft, fraud, tax evasion, bribery, extortion and violence. Following that, a year ago we put up a policy to strengthen and improve the effectiveness of the NCA. That policy is a fundamental tenet of Kim Beazley's overall plan to fight drugs and crime. Senators would know that members of the government have grown very fond of getting up in this and the other chamber and accusing the Labor Party of having no policies. Kim Beazley has, however, released a series of policy initiatives and plans for Australia in the fields of health, education and banking, among others. These policy plans amount to a lot more than John Howard released before the 1996 election and provide to the Australian people a blueprint of what they can expect to happen when Kim Beazley takes the prime ministership later this year. One of the most detailed of these policy initiatives to come from Kim Beazley has been Labor's plan to put forward a national response to crime and drugs in Australia, of which the provisions of this current bill are a part.
Crime is a huge issue in Australia. It presents a daily threat to our personal and national security. Organised crime at both a national and international level affects our standard of living by threatening the peace and stability of our personal lives and our communities. In terms of the size and extent of organised transnational crime, the United Nations has estimated that organised crime earns $US1.1 trillion per year and that the international drug trade exceeds the value of the international oil trade, which eams about $US500 billion per year.
In terms of its impact in Australia, the IMF has estimated that international money laundering costs the world $US500 billion, of which Australia would have a significant share. In Australia, over 100,000 people have used heroin. In 1999, 958 people died of heroin overdose. Therefore, a national approach to fighting crime and drugs is urgently needed. As well as providing plans for many of the provisions contained within this bill to strengthen the National Crime Authority, Labor also has, as I have mentioned, detailed plans for a civil confiscation scheme to deny the profiteers of crime access to their assets. We have also released plans for a national coast guard, to improve Australia's coastal security and protect our borders from criminal activity. Kim Beazley has also outlined a program for establishing community safety zones to stop crime at the source and to work with communities to fight crime at the local level, and he has promised to provide the Federal Police with better funding, to put more of them in the field with the community. 
We have also indicated that a Labor government would provide for the national coordination of law enforcement by undertaking a white paper process, similar to the process that is undertaken to determine defence priorities and resources. Labor would also provide national leadership in the fight against drugs by unifying the states and non-government sectors behind a broadly based strategy. The parts of this bill that implement into law the changes proposed last year by Duncan Kerr in his private member's bill are only a small segment of Labor's overall strategy to fight drugs and international crime in Australia. As well as strengthening the NCA, which this bill already does, Labor has, thus, promised to implement a broad strategy against drugs and crime.
In conclusion, Labor supports the thrust of this bill, on the grounds that what we are seeing before the Senate is a rehashing of good Labor policy. There is a real need to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the NCA, as part of a much needed national approach to the fight against crime and against Australia's drug problem. However, a number of new provisions in this bill are both undesirable and unnecessary, and we will be moving amendments to modify and oppose those provisions. Only Labor will provide this national approach and implement further reforms to fight crime and drugs in Australia. To that end, I support this bill, with amendments.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,2001-08-08,"—I feel obliged to speak for a very short time on the National Crime Authority Legislation Amendment Bill 2000 [2001] due to the previous speaker's rather biased approach. Like Senator Hutchins and previous speakers, I support this bill. As a member of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, I am well versed in the bill and in the opinions of the Labor members.
As previous speakers have said, the bill implements the full powers that the National Crime Authority needs. For example, it strengthens the fines in regard to not answering questions. The point is that the crime bosses have been able to wheel in their legal representatives and tie up and frustrate so many of the investigations of the National Crime Authority. This is in fact a very legalistic piece of legislation. In a nutshell, that is its purpose. It is a very welcome one, and all on the committee support its thrust. It gives the National Crime Authority the full powers that it needs to investigate in particular the drug trade and organised crime in this country.
It is significant to know that this body began, established by a Labor government and supported by the parliament, in 1984. It is true to say that at the time it was established with caution, because society is always balancing civil liberties against the legitimate pursuit of organised crime and the illegal drug trade. In 1984 it was probably true to say that the balance was for civil liberties, that in many ways the National Crime Authority was handicapped in its ability to properly investigate organised crime and the drug trade in this country. It was something new in Australia to set up such a single-minded police force, and there were those initial concerns.
Some 15 years later, I am pleased to be able to say—and I believe it is welcomed by society—that we are now giving the full powers so necessary for such a body to undertake its investigations, powers that are equivalent to the extraordinary powers given to the FBI in America to investigate organised crime. Here, 15 years on, we now have faith in the National Crime Authority, because it has produced. Over those 15 years, it has gained the confidence of society to the point where this parliament is able to give it extra powers to be able to untangle the often legal complications and frustrations visited upon it by the crime bosses and their most expensive lawyers during investigations. That is the nub of this legislation.
It has always been the case that you have had to balance the civil liberties in society against the legitimate pursuit of organised crime, but those in society who so often defend to the hilt civil liberties must realise that the crime bosses impinge on society's civil liberties by the pushing of their drugs and all the scourge that that brings upon society. As I said, we have reached a point where the National Crime Authority has been successful in being the only real federal body that has been able to pull together the state police authorities, the Customs officers and the Australian Federal Police under one umbrella to investigate organised crime. It has had stunning success in being able to get all those police bodies to cooperate in particular investigations. It has had stunning success in drug busts—heroin busts, cocaine busts—in cooperation, of course, with other authorities. It has had stunning success in being able to get the confidence of the parliament to establish other bodies such as CrimTrac and AUSTRAC that feed into the National Crime Authority's investigations. 
AUSTRAC is another unheralded body that supports our national crime body. AUSTRAC was established with full powers to follow the money trail. Next to surveillance, following the money trail is the most successful way of bringing down these big crime bosses and the drug barons, and there has been enormous success in AUSTRAC being able to follow the money trail all the way through bank accounts, different companies and different Asian or Colombian connections. It is a very centred trail, as much as the hard drug trail itself. This is but one prong of this government's Tough on Drugs approach to be tough on law enforcement. It has had enormous success, as mentioned by the Minister for Justice and Customs yesterday in question time, in drug busts. That has filtered all the way down to the streets.
I remember that in my state of Victoria the Melbourne Herald Sun ran a heroin overdose poll, or chart, every day alongside the road toll, and it was phenomenal to think that at one stage a year or two ago there were as many heroin overdoses as there were road deaths. Today, for different reasons—and none less than the drug busts that have been carried out by these enforcement bodies— you can basically count the heroin overdoses on one hand. There has been a phenomenal reduction in this area. They are the successes.
The previous speaker said that we have pinched some of their policies. To start with, I think this is somewhat of a bipartisan approach. I can tell the previous speaker that Duncan Kerr's private member's bill was far different to the legislation that we have here. In a nutshell, in fact it was far more civil libertarian. He did not actually agree with the tough components of this legislation. He was not willing to go all the way to track those crime bosses down, and that is to be expected—that is Duncan Kerr's politics: to be expected to be respected, but not agreed with. That is what Duncan Kerr's private member's bill has amounted to. In all, it probably is a half measure; in fact, it is a half measure. This is a full measure and it shows the determination of this government to track down those crime bosses, the drug barons, as part of its three-pronged Tough on Drugs approach.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2001-08-08,"—I thank senators for their contributions to this debate on a very important bill dealing with the National Crime Authority. At the outset, I acknowledge the great work done by Peter Nugent, the former member for Aston, who chaired the parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. I think all senators here would acknowledge the great work that he did, which was also reflected in the often bipartisan support that he had. I think he carried out his duties in a most dignified and professional manner. I think it is also fair to say that he had a very keen interest in this area, and that was shown by his dedication to the job.
In relation to the bill before us and, of course, the comments made by senators, one has to look back to the genesis of the National Crime Authority in 1984 when it was given special powers to investigate organised crime. We needed a national body which could deal with the federal system that we have in Australia, and that is precisely what the National Crime Authority does. Back in 1984, it received across-the-board support. I know that there have been some comments about the special powers that the National Crime Authority has—I think Senator Cooney mentioned that—but, of course, these special powers are there for a very good reason, and that is to assist the National Crime Authority in tackling organised and serious crime in Australia today. 
There were comments by Senator Bolkus and Senator Bishop that we should have endorsed the Kerr bill a year ago, but I would say that there are important measures in this bill which were not put forward in the bill sponsored by the member for Denison. These include the removal of reasonable excuse defences that can be abused, hearing officer provisions to improve the National Crime Authority's flexibility and more detailed provisions to govern oversight by the Ombudsman. The government has also sought in this bill to introduce an important contempt regime to reinforce the National Crime Authority's hearing powers. So we have here a very different bill, a much more strengthened bill, in relation to the NCA fighting organised crime.
Senator Cooney mentioned that there is always a prospect of law and order campaigns having an undue influence in the passing of this sort of legislation. But I think that when you have had a bill like this looked into by the parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority—in fact, I think there were two such inquiries—and it has had this kind of exposure, it has been dealt with in an appropriate manner. In fact, Senator Bolkus said that we should have rushed it through last year, if I understood his comments correctly. The government has given this bill priority, but it is also cognisant of the fact that this is an important piece of legislation dealing with the powers that go to a law enforcement agency and that you have to keep in mind the checks and balances that go with it.
This government is totally committed to resourcing law enforcement agencies to fight organised and serious crime. Since coming to power, this government has funded the National Crime Authority with an additional $79 million to pursue matters which are of serious concern. Today, we are confronted with such things as money laundering and people smuggling, which were not matters that were previously uppermost in the community's mind, but bodies like the National Crime Authority have to be resourced in relation to that. At the bottom of this, you have the overall problem of the drug situation in Australia. The government, with its Tough on Drugs policy, has demonstrated a clear intent to fight that on the three fronts of law enforcement, education and health.
In relation to this particular bill, there are some amendments which the government is proposing. I realise that some senators have taken up the opportunity of a briefing on this and I acknowledge their involvement—the Democrats certainly have done that—and I acknowledge the contributions made to this by the parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. I think that the comments in relation to the various amendments proposed by the government, opposition and Democrats are best left for the committee stage. Suffice to say that I endorse the comments made by Senator Ferris in relation to increased penalties and accountability and also the comments made by Senator McGauran, who gave a succinct outline of the role of the National Crime Authority and the importance it plays on the national stage. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2001-08-08,"—On 1 July this year the government brought into operation significant streamlining of the overseas student visa processing system. This was the second part of a two-part reform program to deliver growth and integrity to the overseas student market. As both Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I am doubly aware of the importance of getting the export education industry right. It is a question of getting the balance between the commercial aspects of the industry and the need for immigration integrity. The export education industry is estimated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics to be worth $3,717 million to Australia. This means that it is now our 10th ranked export after tourism, petroleum, gold and minerals. 
Before I explain exactly what the reforms mean, I think it is important for the record that I put the reforms in their proper historical context. In order to understand the magnitude of the effort required by the Howard government to reform the overseas education industry in this country, it needs to be remembered that the industry is only now recovering from the situation created when the greed for numbers drove Labor government policy against all expert advice from its own immigration department. At the end of the eighties, then education minister John Dawkins was one of those who saw education as a potential multibillion dollar milch cow. All Australia had to do was free up the immigration system to admit large numbers of students and the economy would go `gang busters', to use a memorable Keating phrase. But as T.S. Eliot wrote, `Betwixt the idea and the reality falls the Shadow'. Some parts of Labor have failed to learn any lessons from what has proved to be an enormously costly mistake. It is obvious from Senator Peter Cook's statements only last week that he has not learned the lesson. 
The unpalatable truth for Senator Cook is that, under the Howard government's skilful husbanding of the overseas education industry, student numbers are at record levels. In the year to 30 June, Australia attracted 146,577 new overseas students—a 23 per cent increase in total visa grant numbers over the previous year, 1999-2000, which showed a nine per cent increase over the 1998-99 year. Offshore grants for the undergraduate sector were particularly strong, showing a 47 per cent rise to 38,555. The irony was that Labor's `get rich quick' approach to the industry nearly killed it off altogether and left a shemozzle that required between $60 million and $100 million of taxpayers' money to fix up, and that was for only a small part of the mess. Other unfortunate decisions by the last Labor government concerning overseas students have cost this country hundreds of millions of dollars, but that is a story for another time. Fortunately, most reputable education providers understand that Labor's `get them in at any cost' mentality does not work in the long run, although I have to admit that there is a small number who are still dazzled by visions of gold at the end of the student rainbow.
The results of the Labor Party's policy became horribly apparent at the end of the 1980s when the chickens came home to roost. Encouraged by Labor's lax, open door policy, large numbers of intending students came here, and shonky colleges sprang up overnight to service them, with many offering completely non-existent courses. Not uncommonly, they would register with the state education authorities—I must say that some of them also had dollar signs in their eyes—for, say, 400 students but provide only 10 desks. Rolls would be marked, even though the students were not in attendance because they were out working full-time in many positions, some of them in brothels, on construction sites, or wherever they could find work. So, unofficially, Australia's student visas were seen to be a soft target for those wanting a backdoor entry to working in Australia or becoming a permanent resident, and extremely cheap at the price. This was hardly likely to promote Australia's reputation as a quality education destination for genuine overseas students.
While this backdoor entry suited most pseudo students, there were other student visa holders who actually wanted to study in Australia , who were distressed to find that they had no teachers, little equipment and Mickey Mouse classes, if they got any, and went home badmouthing Australian education. Bob Hawke's response to Tiananmen Square, when we saw him crying in the Great Hall, led to his unilateral decision to allow all People's Republic of China students, including those already in the pipeline—over 40,000 of them—to become permanent residents. This skewed Australia's immigration program towards one country, and the effects, financial and otherwise, of that are still there today. But, with regard to student policy, it was all over by the time Bob Hawke cried. His decision merely brought to a head a situation that was already out of control. Labor had to move from doing nothing to manage student entry responsibly to attacking problems created by their mismanagement with a sledgehammer. Overnight, the Labor government shut down the English language education market for China by introducing a special visa requirement for the PRC, which only ended on 1 July this year. The English language education providers had to be compensated with millions of dollars of taxpayers' money, and overseas students, whose providers had gone to the wall because the Labor Government had shut up their market like a telescope, had to have their education costs subsidised by the Australian taxpayer. 
In the first part of our two-pronged reform program for the overseas student education industry, and after years of inaction by state governments, the Howard government introduced a code of practice to force out the shonky providers still in business by, for example, setting strict parameters for registration, such as having adequate facilities— which is not an unreasonable request—for the numbers registered, and being obliged to inform the immigration department of student non-attendance. The second part of the reform process put into operation on 1 July this year has been the product of many months of working closely with the peak education bodies from every sector of the industry. We have made the overseas student visa system more transparent and objective by publishing, for the first time, our requirements for the granting of student visas. This is now available on the departmental web site: www.immi.gov.au in `What's New'. This also makes the process of assessment, in its turn, more objective and less susceptible to the use of discretion by departmental officers.
The categorisation of gazetted and non-gazetted countries was a very blunt instrument introduced by the last Labor government in its desperate bid to staunch the flow of non-bona fide students. It has been replaced by a much more responsive assessment of risk. Countries are now divided into four levels and into education industry sectors based on statistical data as to the incidence of fraudulent documentation, overstaying, student visas, cancellation of visas for various reasons and students who breach their visa conditions by working more than the allocated time. This means that if compliance is high in one sector—say higher education—although in other sectors compliance with visa conditions is poor, the students of higher education in that country are rewarded with less onerous requirements for obtaining a visa. Where compliance levels improve significantly in any sector, risk also falls and students will benefit. 
The new rating system recognises that the incidence of students becoming unlawful in some markets is still unacceptably high: 17.6 per cent of students from Vietnam had their students visas cancelled in the year to 30 June and 16.8 per cent of students from India had their visas cancelled. This represented a doubling of the visa cancellation rate for India, notwithstanding that over half the student visa applications in this market under the old rules were rejected for fraud, incompletion and failure to satisfy the bona fides test. Rates of cancellation were also high for Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Korea. 
The Howard government is mindful of the need to husband our extraordinary growth in students numbers after the debacle caused by the unmanaged growth during the last Labor government. Here I would like to pay tribute to Senator Kim Carr who, because of his knowledge and interest in this area, has taken a positive and cooperative approach to these reforms. On many occasions it is seen as important to be able to work with others of a different political persuasion to do what is in Australia's long-term interest. 
I have sometimes heard it said that it does not matter if students do not come here to study. It matters a great deal. They take jobs from Australian workers if they work full-time. They often cause grief in their own national communities here by getting up to mischief. Some of those communities report that to us and say that if reflects badly on them. At the end of the day they cause a loss of reputation for Australian education because, when they return to their countries with no improvement in their language skills and no qualification, it is the Australian education system and market that they blame. Over time, this incremental loss of reputation has enormous economic and diplomatic ramifications for this country. 
Australia has many attractions for overseas students which are reflected in the extraordinary growth in numbers. The relatively competitive dollar, the great climate, a laid back culture and quality education are all important factors. On the government side we work hard to facilitate the entry of students with generous working conditions. Students are able to work 20 hours a week and longer during the holiday times and they are not restricted, as elsewhere in the world—for example, the US and Canada—to working only on their own campuses. The Howard government has also been farsighted in allowing overseas students who achieve high level qualifications in this country to become migrants immediately on completion of their courses, without going offshore. They now comprise about 50 per cent of our skilled migrant intake.  
I would like to end today by referring to a recently released draft OECD study on the mobility of international students. The study points out that student mobility provides a potential flow of qualified workers either in the course of their studies or through subsequent recruitment, allows economies of scale in education systems and brings additional resources to finance them. The immigrants we receive by this means are much more readily absorbed into our work force by dint of their qualifications being obtained in this country. The report points to the ways in which the Australian government has adopted measures to facilitate the entry of foreign students, particularly in information and communications technology. From July they do not have to have professional experience or an employer sponsor in order to apply as skilled migrants. The immigration department is also developing an online immigration application procedure to speed up the process. 
The report notes that Australia is one of a group of countries which stand out for their very high intakes of foreign students—over 110 per 1,000 enrolled. Australia rates third on this measurement, at 125 per 1,000 enrolled, after Luxembourg 304, and Switzerland 159 and before Austria and the UK. The OECD study notes: 
While the effective size and diversification of education provision can explain why the large industrialised countries are most often host countries to foreign students, the presence at the top of the list of smaller, industrialised countries like Australia, Switzerland and Austria suggests that high levels of economic prosperity are reflected in per capita educational resources and high levels of technology which attract foreign students in certain areas of excellence. 
In the reception of non-OECD students, Australia, France, the UK, Denmark and Switzerland are the leading OECD countries in that order: 80 per cent of foreign students overall go to only five countries—Australia, France, Germany, the UK and the US. In Australia, three-quarters of foreign students come from Asia or the Pacific—that is, our major trading partners—and most are enrolled in commercial disciplines. The study goes on: 
Concerning the dynamics of the student mobility phenomenon, a comparison at the interval of three years shows that the proportion of foreign students in the OECD countries rose by 4.6 per cent between 1995 and 1998. This trend reflects a process of internationalisation of education which is growing in the OECD countries. This overall rise, however, masks some significant divergencies between countries: among the major host countries, Australia comes top with almost a 40 per cent rise over the period concerned, followed by Switzerland, the UK, Denmark and, a long way behind, Germany and the US. 
An article in Forbes magazine last year lamented that Australia, with less than one tenth of America's population, is beating the US at attracting foreign students, and that it is countries like Australia that will be reaping the next crop of entrepreneurs. 
The overseas education industry brings us huge benefits in terms of international goodwill and influence when the students we educate go on to become the next generation of leaders in their countries, but it is also a fragile market which needs to be managed well. We will continue to listen to industry and to make changes where necessary to finetune the process. Unlike the last Labor government, this government will not stand idly by while problems become so overwhelming that a sledgehammer approach becomes the only one available. The student visa changes will assist the Howard government to continue to manage overseas student growth prudently and to enhance the value of the Australian education industry.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Visas: Students</title>,Matters of Public Interest,2,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2001-08-08,"—My question is directed to Senator Hill, representing the Prime Minister. Can the minister confirm that the Westfield Tower Sydney office of Senator Heffernan, the Parliamentary Secretary to Cabinet, has access to CabNet, the secure online distribution system of classified cabinet documents? Can the Leader of the Government also confirm evidence he has previously given estimates committees that Senator Heffernan has no restrictions on access to cabinet documents? If so, has the Prime Minister therefore initiated an investigation into whether any cabinet documents were accessed on the CabNet system at any time that the well-known Liberal Party operative, Mr Jonathon Seyffer, was using Senator Heffernan's office, including the many after-hour visits he made using his own set of keys?

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2001-08-08,"—I thank the senator for the particular insights that he has brought to this question. It is an important question. I think I have drawn to the attention of this chamber many times before the attempts of the Labor Party to talk down the Australian economy—the constant carping and attacks that have been launched on the Labor Party about the economic performance of the government. Have I got some good news for the Labor Party! The Australian economy is one of the world's best performing economies. It is one of the world's best performing economies because of the major reforms that this government has put in place, including tax reform.
Let me share with the senator some important statistics. Since we were elected to government Australia has had an enviable record. It has enjoyed an annual growth in the economy of well over four per cent, compared with an annual average of around three per cent for the OECD. Australia, as I have said, is one of the fastest growing economies in the industrialised world. What does this mean for Australian families? It means more jobs, matched with higher wages. It means lower interest rates, and it follows that there will be higher living standards for Australian workers. Let me mention some statistics which demonstrate this point. During the long dark years of Labor's time in office, the average Australian worker experienced a real growth in wages of about 0.4 per cent per year. In some years real wages fell. What an appalling record for a party that goes under the name of the Australian Labor Party. 
—Taxes also went down and prices were contained.
—Senator Cook chips in. The fact of the matter is that the Australian Labor Party is not a labour party, a workers party or an employees party; it is a trade union party and, more particularly, it is a trade union bosses party. The fact of the matter is that virtually 100 per cent of members of the Labor Party in this Senate are trade union bosses. One in five Australian workers belongs to a trade union, but in this Senate virtually 100 per cent of Labor senators are trade union bosses. How this party can hold itself out to represent the Australian worker beggars belief. It had a shocking record on growth of real wages while in office. While it was shovelling trade union boss after trade union boss into this chamber, real wages in this country were performing appallingly. The Labor Party was looking after the unions, but it certainly was not looking after the Australian worker.
Let me contrast the pathetic performance in real wages under the Labor Party with what has happened under the coalition. Real wages under the coalition for the average worker have grown by around 2.5 per cent a year—vastly in excess of the pathetic performance that we saw under the Labor Party. We have delivered lower interest rates, major tax cuts and very strong growth in jobs for Australian workers. This is the party that delivers for the worker. We are not a trade union party, unlike the Labor Party. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Economy: Growth</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,answer
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2001-08-08,"—My question is to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Alston. What new and improved services are being delivered as a direct result of the coalition government's unprecedented commitment to a strong and independent ABC? Is the minister aware of any alternative approaches on the ABC and do they pose a threat to the future of Australia's largest national broadcaster?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Australian Broadcasting Corporation: Services</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1,question
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2001-08-08,"—That is a very important question from Senator Eggleston. As he would know from his role as chairman of the relevant Senate committee, we do have a strong commitment to the ABC. Today is a very good news day for all true friends of the ABC and it has been a very good week indeed for millions of Australians who cherish the ABC. Today the ABC has announced two new regional radio stations, one in Ballarat and the other in the great southern region of Western Australia—so, again, getting services outside the metropolitan areas.
—Oh, really, the marginal seat of Ballarat!
—We will put that on record: Senator Carr is strongly critical of the ABC extending services into Ballarat.
—I am very critical of you!
—Order! Senator Carr, don't shout.
—The ABC has also announced today that it will employ 50 new radio program makers in regional Australia who will provide more than 10,000 hours per year of local programming—a tremendously important step forward. Of course, this is possible only because the coalition, rather than talking about extra funding for the ABC, is actually providing in the budget an additional $71.2 million—real money, Senator Carr—for the ABC. Today's announcement, of course, comes hot on the heels of the news that the ABC is also receiving an additional $90 million over five years to provide an Australian Asia TV service. Compare that with the miserable $7½ million they got from Labor for ATV. Yesterday, a number of us were there when the ABC launched ABC Kids—Australia's first digital television channel. It was also announced by the managing director that they would soon have another four digital channels.
So a lot is happening with the ABC. All those present at that last Senate hearing saw the despicable performance of the Australian parliament's in-house bully, Senator Faulkner, when he ridiculed, humiliated and embarrassed the ABC as best he could by suggesting that they had no new programs and that they were not interested in quality. Of course, now we have had the ABC announcing nine new Australian television programs. As a result, its level of prime time Australian content will now be nearly 70 per cent.
So the ABC is actually getting in excess of $2 billion in federal government funding in this triennium. In real dollars, total ABC funding is over $100 million more than it was in 1995-96, under Labor, and the same goes for discretionary funding. So all the myths spread by Labor, by its union masters and by the union affiliated so-called Friends of the ABC, which has now been comprehensively exposed as a union front, are absolutely wrong. Labor run around saying they will increase ABC funding but, of course, their record in government was that they cut funding by some 30 per cent. The commitment they gave at the last election was entirely for tied funding. In other words, they are very much into the business of interfering, telling the ABC how to run its business and threatening and intimidating journalists they do not like.
Mr Stephen Smith has achieved an absolute world first. Not only did he get Brian Johns to criticise him for interference, but he also managed to get criticism from the Chairman and from the Managing Director of the ABC recently over that disgraceful interference on the Four Corners program. As the Chairman said, the only political pressure relating to the issue came from Mr Beazley himself, from the shadow minister for communications, from the Friends of the ABC and from the unions, all commenting on a non-industrial matter. Here we have the stark contrast: we are in favour of a quality alternative to the commercials; what Labor wants is a government controlled, compliant lap-dog. We are committed to a strong and independent ABC. We are providing real funds, not tied funds.

"Crowley, Sen Rosemary",ALP,2001-08-08,"—My question is to Senator Alston, the Minister representing the Minister for Small Business. Is the minister aware of recent results from the Yellow Pages Business Index which found that, of the seven most important reasons cited for criticism of the federal government's policies, six were directly related to the goods and services tax and completion of the business activity statement? Can the minister also confirm that none—not one—of the proposals contained in the leaked cabinet submission will in any way address these broad small business concerns with the GST and the new tax system? When will the Howard government actually listen to what all small businesses are saying loud and clear: that they are drowning under the Howard government tax compliance burden?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Small Business</title>,Questions Without Notice,9,1,question
"Crowley, Sen Rosemary",ALP,2001-08-08,"—Madam President, I think the minister mentioned nothing of what the question was about but, in spite of that, I will proceed to ask a supplementary question. Is the minister aware that the provisional figures from the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia show an overall rise in business bankruptcies in the 2000-01 financial year of 13.6 per cent, and that Dun and Bradstreet data shows that bankruptcy has increased by over 30 per cent in the first quarter of 2001? Isn't this conclusive evidence that the coalition's GST is having a negative effect on small businesses in Australia, particularly in light of the fact that bankruptcies typically claim firms with a turnover of $1 million or less? When will the government effectively address these concerns instead of spouting the rhetoric and meaningless waffle contained in the leaked cabinet submission? Minister, do you agree with the Liberal Party's Western Australian state director, Peter Wells, who says about the Liberal Party's proposal to make the GST paperwork easier for the Liberal Party—
—Order! The time for asking the question has concluded.
—Why mess around with the GST if—
—Senator Crowley, I call you to order. The time for asking the question has concluded.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Small Business</title>,Questions Without Notice,9,1,question
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2001-08-08,"—This is what happens when you are obsessed with the GST. I do not suppose that there are many left here who were supporting it all those years ago, back in 1983. Anyone from the Labor Party still here who was in favour of it in 1983? No. I suppose a lot of them were quietly in support of it—
—That is untrue.
—What, you weren't around or were you simply off the air? 
—It is not true. He is not telling the truth.
—Senator Cook, you are shouting. Senator Alston has the call.
—Poor old Senator Cook—a serial offender. As we said many years ago, it is a great shame that Senator Cook did not accept that unique job offer as a cleaner at the ILO prior to the 1993 election. It would have done him a lot of good and he might have actually made some progress.
As far as Senator Crowley is concerned, Senator Crowley seems to think that the GST is the be-all and end-all of small business concerns, which is simply not the case. Small businesses have a range of concerns. They want to keep interest rates down, and I bet you they know what will happen to interest rates if you are in the business of roll-back, in the business of $35 billion worth of Knowledge Nation and in the business of giving all sorts of grants and largesse out to your friends. They are very concerned on that front alone. 
They have always been concerned about your unfair dismissal laws. They have never known why you hate them so much. There are a lot of other issues that need to be addressed apart from tax, and that is why that working document canvassed 24 measures to help small business, including simplified rules for AWAs. I know that you stand for simplicity there, because you just want to abolish them. That is a nice simple solution, but it happens to be not the preferred path of the small business sector. They actually find it a much more efficient way of getting genuine productivity gains out of their work force. They do not like pattern bargaining, they do not like people to simply get a standard level of remuneration irrespective of performance, and they do not like many of the union intrusions. So, if you really want to do something for the small business sector, get your patrons to back off. Get them to be a bit more understanding of the need of small business to make a serious quid so that they can pass some of that on to their workers— not just see how much you can screw out of them by way of union membership fees.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Small Business</title>,Questions Without Notice,9,1,answer
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2001-08-08,"—Sorry, you are out of time, so I will just give you some quick facts. The fact is that the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia has stated quite clearly that the GST has not been reported by respondents as being the cause for insolvencies. The fact is that the number of new incorporations has increased significantly since May—in fact, up 29 per cent. Senator Crowley wants to run some pathetic ideological line that every time a business goes broke now it is because of the GST, even though we all know that about 20 per cent of small business a year go to the wall. There is a whole variety of reasons why. Not everyone is a perfect business manager, not everyone calculates how they will conduct their business operations. But I can tell you one thing, Senator Crowley: they know that you are not going to roll back the GST. They know that it has been costed at about $85 million, and every one per cent would cost you $2.7 billion. They know that you are a fraud. They know that all you are going to do is make life even more difficult for them, and they will not have a bar of it. 
—Order! Senator Alston, you should withdraw that reference to Senator Crowley.
—I withdraw it, whatever it was.

SENATOR O'BRIEN asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Aged Care, upon notice, on 31 October 2000:
(1)	Has the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) received an application seeking the listing of Aricept on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS); if so, on how many occasions has an application been made for the listing of the above drug on the PBS.
(2)	(a)	When was each application lodged; (b) when was each application considered by the PBAC; (c) when was a final decision made by the PBAC in relation to each application; and (d) what was the outcome.
(3)	If the above applications were rejected by the PBAC what was the basis for the rejection.
SENATOR HERRON - The Minister for Health and Aged Care has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question: 
(1)	The PBAC has received applications seeking the listing of Aricept for the treatment of mild to moderately severe dementia of the Alzheimer's type on the PBS. An application has been made for the listing of the above drug on the PBS on four occasions.
(2)	(a)	The applications were lodged in December 1997, December 1999, June 2000 and October 2000.
(b)	These applications were considered by the PBAC in March 1998, March 2000, September 2000 and December 2000 respectively. 
(c)	A final decision in relation to these applications was made by the PBAC at the time of its consideration of each application at PBAC meetings held on 5-6 March 1998, 2-3 March 2000, 31 August - September 2000, and 30 November - 1 December 2000 respectively.
(d)	At the March 1998 and September 2000 PBAC meetings, the Committee declined to recommend the listing of Aricept and deferred making a decision on the application considered at the March 2000 PBAC meeting. The committee recommended approval of the application at its December 2000 meeting.
(3)	The PBS is the way in which the Government subsidises the cost of drugs and medicinal products to the Australian community, providing reliable and affordable access to a wide range of necessary medicines. 
Before a medicine can be subsidised via the PBS, it must be assessed by the 
PBAC - an independent expert body whose membership includes doctors, health scientists, other health professionals, and a consumer representative. The PBAC advises the Government regarding which drugs and medicinal preparations should be listed as pharmaceutical benefits. When considering applications to list drugs on the PBS, the Committee is required to take into account a number of criteria, including the medical conditions for which the medicine has been approved for use in Australia, and its medical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and safety compared with other treatments.
At its March 1998 meeting, the PBAC declined to recommend listing of Aricept because it did not accept that the cost-effectiveness and health benefits measures for Aricept were adequate to support PBS availability for all patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease.  
The PBAC deferred making a decision on the application considered at the 
March 2000 meeting pending the outcome of a meeting of relevant stakeholders, including expert clinicians, to develop prescribing criteria which would ensure that Aricept could be directed to those patients most likely to benefit from treatment.
At its September 2000 meeting, the PBAC decided not to recommend listing because the Committee considered the prescribing criteria and guidelines proposed by expert clinicians attending the April 2000 stakeholder meeting were impractical and too complicated to administer. Although the criteria for initiation of treatment were appropriate, the PBAC was concerned that the cessation of treatment rule would not target Aricept to those patients who experience an unambiguous clinical improvement on treatment. 
In making this decision, the PBAC also encouraged the manufacturer of Aricept to re-submit a listing application which proposed a simpler cessation of treatment rule and also included descriptions of the meaning of improvement resulting from treatment with Aricept in terms of the impact on a typical Alzheimer's patient and their carer.
The PBAC subsequently recommended approval of the application to list Aricept on the PBS at its December 2000 meeting and listing occurred on 1 February 2001.
No.  3137
SENATOR O'BRIEN asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Aged Care, upon notice, on 31 October 2000:
 (1)	Has the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) received an application seeking the listing of Exelon on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS); if so, on how many occasions has an application been made for the listing of the above drug on the PBS.
(2)	(a)	When was each application lodged; (b) when was each application considered by the PBAC; (c) when was a final decision made by the PBAC in relation to each application; and (d) what was the outcome.
(3)	If the above applications were rejected by the PBAC what was the basis for the rejection.
SENATOR HERRON - The Minister for Health and Aged Care has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question: 
(1)	The PBAC has received applications seeking the listing of Exelon for the treatment of mild to moderately severe dementia of the Alzheimer's type on the PBS. An application has been made for the listing of the above drug on the PBS on two occasions.
(2)	(a)	These applications were lodged in June 2000 and October 2000.
(b)	The first of these applications was considered by the PBAC at its meeting on 31 August - 1 September 2000. The second application was considered by the Committee at its 30 November - 1 December 2000 meeting.
(c)	A final decision in relation to these applications was made by the PBAC at the time of its consideration of the applications
(d)	The Committee declined to recommend the listing of Exelon at the September 2000 meeting, but subsequently approved the application at its December 2000 meeting.
(3)	The PBS is the way in which the Government subsidises the cost of drugs and medicinal products to the Australian community, providing reliable and affordable access to a wide range of necessary medicines.

When considering applications to list drugs on the PBS, the Committee is required to take into account a number of criteria, including the medical conditions for which the medicine has been approved for use in Australia, and its medical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and safety compared with other treatments.
Listing was not recommended at the September 2000 PBAC meeting because the Committee considered the benefits of Exelon appeared to be small and the clinical importance of such benefits to patients and carers to be uncertain. In addition the data submitted by the manufacturer of Exelon showed the level of cost-effectiveness to be unacceptable. 
In making this decision, the PBAC also encouraged the manufacturer of Exelon to re-submit a listing application which proposed a simple cessation of treatment rule which could target the drug to those patients who experience an unambiguous clinical improvement on treatment and also included descriptions of the meaning of improvement resulting from treatment with Exelon in terms of the impact on a typical Alzheimer's patient and their carer.

Proposal to refer a bill to a committee
Name of Bill:	Taxation Laws Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2001
Reasons for referral/principal issues for consideration:
The Bill implements a raft of changes to the R&D tax concession as announced in the Government's Innovation plan in January 2001 and comes in an environment of declining business expenditure in R&D. 
There are significant concerns with the consequences of the change of definitions and requirement for eligible activities to meet both the `innovation' and `high technical risk'. There does not appear to be anything in the legislation or EM that limits the changes to the thresholds from being interpreted as near patentability. 
There is confusion with some of the proposals - AAT and Federal Court “interpretations of the R&D legislation have established low thresholds for both the `innovation' and `technical risk' criteria” (EM 1.15) but this is contradicted elsewhere by the claim that “the changes are about `closing the gate', not `raising the hurdle' and are not expected to have a significant impact on most claims”.
There is a need to consider and examine how this legislation addresses the concerns of the proposed definitional changes if they do not raise the `hurdle' for innovation and technical risk; the modelling assumptions and net impact on the budget quantum and BERD; the consequences of the proposed changes to treatment of R&D plant, including deeming of trading stock; the absence of consideration of where conceptual design activity ceases and the expenditure that contributes to the cost basis of the R&D plant starts; the effects of the anti-avoidance measures which may penalise, for instance, individual extraordinary years; and concerns with retrospectivity with both R&D plant and arrangements for R&D projects that straddle both regimes.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2001-08-08,"—Madam Chair, at the outset, could I take care of some resulting business from the successful amendment by the opposition which resulted in the removal of the contempt regime? As a result of that, the government would move to omit items 111 to 121 of schedule 1. That relates to the reference to hearing officers in the contempt regime which, of course, is now redundant. I have an amendment which deals with that particular proposal, and I ask that that now be circulated to senators. 
The other variation is in relation to government amendment (33). That requires the omission of part 1 of that amendment. We will come to that in due course, but I foreshadow that the government will be seeking to modify its amendment (33) by omitting part 1. That dealt with telecommunications intercept information being used in contempt proceedings, which is now redundant. In part 2 of amendment (33), reference to the chair should be inserted, so that alteration should be made as well. Those are the two amendments that result from that previous contempt provision.
In relation to government amendments (29) and (30), the government seeks to withdraw its amendment to the Ombudsman access provision as it will support the opposition's new amendment, which represents a compromise to restrict access in cases involving a risk of death or serious injury. I understand that is the situation with the opposition now. There has been a change in relation to the opposition's position on that, and the government agrees with that. On that basis, the government would seek to withdraw its amendments (29) and (30) and also to make those other variations to the amendments before the Senate.
—We will deal with the further amendments to your amendment No. 33 when we get there. The question before the chamber is that items 111 to 121 stand as printed. 
Question resolved in the negative.
—The government has withdrawn amendments (29) and (30) on sheet DY289. That now leaves us with opposition amendment (7) on sheet 2212.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-08-08,"—The minister is right to a certain extent. The opposition had an amendment. My understanding is that we have managed to work out an agreement with the government in respect of our amendment and we now have a commonly agreed amendment, opposition amendment No. 7, in respect of the Ombudsman. I probably do not need to talk to it, other than to indicate that we have been able to work out this compromise and, as a consequence, the amendment should be supported by the Senate. I move amendment No. 7:
(7)	Schedule 3, item 8, page 45 (lines 3 to 13), omit the item, substitute:

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2001-08-08,"—The explanatory memorandum indicates that this bill is intended to make a clarifying amendment to avoid any doubt about the application of the Ombudsman Act to complaints against members of the authority. However, the bill also allows the Attorney-General to exempt certain material from disclosure to the Ombudsman. The Democrats' concern is that this provision is too broadly drafted and would allow the Attorney-General to require the non-disclosure of almost any information relating to the National Crime Authority. People are entitled to have recourse to an effective complaints mechanism in respect of the NCA. We are wary of curtailing the Ombudsman's ability to obtain information to the extent that the complaints mechanism is rendered ineffective. Under this amendment, the Attorney-General will be able to exempt information from disclosure where its disclosure would endanger the life of a person or would create a risk of serious injury to that person. This is a reasonable limitation, but the Democrats are mindful of the need to monitor the use of this provision to ensure that it is not abused. On that basis, we are supportive of this amendment.

Schedule 5—Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority
National Crime Authority Act 1984
1  Part III
Repeal the Part.
These amendments are designed to establish a single parliamentary joint committee on Commonwealth law enforcement. This is to be a committee that will subsume and replace the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the National Crime Authority. Our proposed Commonwealth law enforcement committee would exercise scrutiny across the whole ambit of Commonwealth law enforcement agencies. It would include the AFP, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Australian Customs Service, the National Crime Authority, the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence, AUSTRAC, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and other Commonwealth agencies having a law enforcement function which exists or may be established. 
We are driven by a deep understanding that Commonwealth law enforcement is of vital importance. Criminal activity poses serious threats to the stability of our society and its institutions, so we need a sophisticated, cooperative, integrated national and international approach to law enforcement. We believe that this approach needs to exist in our law enforcement agencies, in law enforcement itself, in its policies and in parliamentary processes. The proposed parliamentary joint committee will, we propose, be tasked to oversight all law enforcement agencies. It will inform the national parliament, it should build on an extensive store of knowledge and it should play a vital role in the development of an integrated structure of law enforcement, with integrated tactical and planning strategies and processes. Establishing this committee is a real attempt to put mechanisms in place which will provide for national oversight and a parliamentary process which enables and provides the basis for good strategic planning. 
This is the third time that the opposition have attempted to have such a committee established. We believe that it is in the national interest to do so, and we will continue to pursue this objective. A single committee with a good understanding of the totality of our law enforcement needs should ensure that no political party is caught up just in short-term political debate about where funding ought to be directed. It will also strengthen the oversight role of the parliament and will help guard against improper use of power by any Commonwealth law enforcement agency. We believe that we need parliamentary scrutiny of all law enforcement agencies, not just the NCA. There is currently no committee which has jurisdiction to scrutinise the AFP in the way that the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the National Crime Authority can oversee NCA budgetary, employment, legislative and operational matters. The AFP, for instance, conducts controlled operations. It uses listening devices and other surveillance mechanisms and it has powers of arrest, detention and questioning. It is a police agency and we believe that it should have parliamentary oversight. I have moved these amendments in the belief that such oversight is quite desirable for our national system and would also provide a good mechanism for policy formulation for the national parliament.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2001-08-08,"—We Democrats acknowledge the value in establishing a committee to monitor Commonwealth law enforcement bodies. The proposed committee would subsume the existing National Crime Authority committee and would continue its existing role in monitoring the NCA. However, it would also monitor other Commonwealth law enforcement bodies such as the Australian Federal Police. We would welcome an increase in the accountability of other Commonwealth law enforcement bodies; however, we are wary of reducing scrutiny of the NCA by having the focus of oversight bodies elsewhere. We note that the new committee would continue to scrutinise the NCA but that would only be a part of its responsibilities. We do not feel that we are able to support these ALP amendments on this occasion.
Given that a number of changes are proposed by this legislation, we believe that a specialist oversight body of the NCA is needed at this time to monitor the effect of the new provisions. We note that the increased role of the Ombudsman is strengthened by Labor Party amendments and is supported by the Democrats. We hope that this will provide an effective avenue for complaints against the NCA. Hopefully, the enhanced complaints mechanism, through the Ombudsman and other mechanisms, will provide adequate accountability, making a committee wholly devoted to the work of the NCA unnecessary. However, this is not the case at present, and we feel that the existing committee should remain in place for the time being.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2001-08-08,"—The government opposes these amendments. Effectively, the amendments would do as Senator Greig said: diminish any scrutiny of the National Crime Authority. The parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority was set up for a very good reason: because of the powers given to the NCA and the special place that the NCA enjoys. The government is of a firm view that there should be a joint parliamentary committee which is devoted to scrutiny of the NCA. 
This proposal would result in looking at other aspects of law enforcement and would give the new committee an extraordinarily wide application and, in broadening that application, would no doubt diminish its ability to pay due scrutiny to those aspects that require it. You would be looking at all sorts of areas, such as the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, the Australian Taxation Office, Immigration and even the Department of Family and Community Services. We have a Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee which, although very hard worked, does a very good job in looking at legislation which deals with these areas, and we have a particular joint parliamentary committee which deals with the NCA. 
There is also the question of the relevance of this proposal to this bill. The title of this bill is `A Bill for an Act to amend the National Crime Authority Act 1984 and the Ombudsman Act 1976, and for related purposes'. I question whether the amendments proposed by the opposition have relevance to the title of that bill, bearing in mind the provisions of standing order 111(3), which says:
... no clause shall be inserted in a bill which is irrelevant to its title.
The subject matter of this bill is really for the NCA and not for a compendious approach to scrutiny of all law enforcement, which is something that should really be reserved for another time and another place.

	(1)	The Minister must cause a person (the responsible person) to review, and to report in writing about, the operation of the National Crime Authority Act 1984 (the NCA Act) as affected by the following provisions of this Act:
	(a)	items 1, 3, 5, 11 and 13 of Schedule 1 (the provisions that remove the defence of reasonable excuse);
	(b)	item 12 of Schedule 1 (the provision that removes the derivative-use immunity);
	(c)	items 7, 12 and 15 of Schedule 1 (the provisions that increase the penalties for non-compliance);
	(d)	Part 15 of Schedule 1, and Schedule 4 (the contempt provisions).
	(2)	The responsible person must be someone who, in the Minister's opinion, is suitably qualified and appropriate to conduct the review and make the report.
	(3)	The review and report must relate to the 5 year period (the review period) beginning on the commencement of Part 1 of Schedule 1.
	(4)	The review and report must include an assessment of:
	(a)	the effects of the following provisions in facilitating the performance of the functions of the Authority:
	(i)	the provisions that remove the defence of reasonable excuse;
	(ii)	the provision that removes the derivative-use immunity;
	(iii)	the provisions that increase the penalties for non-compliance; and
	(b)	the extent (if any) to which persons have been unjustifiably prejudiced because of the enactment of:
	(i)	the provisions that remove the defence of reasonable excuse; and
	(ii)	the provision that removes the derivative-use immunity; and
	(c)	the extent (if any) to which courts have imposed increased penalties allowed for by the provisions that increase the penalties for non-compliance.
	(5)	The review and report must also include an assessment of any other matter that the responsible person considers relevant to the operation of the provisions of the NCA Act as affected by the provisions referred to in paragraphs (1)(a) to (d).
	(6)	The report must not:
	(a)	identify persons as being suspected of having committed offences; or
	(b)	identify persons as having committed offences unless those persons have been convicted of those offences; or
	(c)	reveal the identity of a person, if doing so might prejudice:
	(i)	the safety or reputation of a person; or
	(ii)	the fair trial of a person who has been or may be charged with an offence. 
	(7)	The Authority must give all reasonable assistance requested by the responsible person in connection with the carrying out of the review and report.
	(8)	The following activities by a current or former member of the Authority (within the meaning of that Act) or a current or former member of staff of the Authority (within the meaning of that Act) do not constitute a contravention of section 51 of the NCA Act, if they are carried out for the purposes of assisting the responsible person to carry out the review and report:
	(a)	divulging or communicating information to the responsible person;
	(b)	recording information;
	(c)	providing a record of information to the responsible person.
	(9)	The responsible person must provide a reasonable opportunity for members of the public to make submissions to him or her about matters to which the review and report relate. However, the review process must not include any hearings.
	(10)	The responsible person must give the report to the Inter-Governmental Committee no later than 6 months after the end of the review period. The report is then to be considered by the Committee and given by the Committee, together with such comments on the report as the Committee thinks fit, to:
	(a)	the Minister; and
	(b)	the appropriate Minister of the Crown of each participating State.
	(11)	After the Minister receives the report and comments from the Inter-Governmental Committee, the Minister must cause a copy of the report to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House.
This amendment deals with the review in proposed section 4 of the bill. This proposed section sets out the requirement for a five-year review of the provisions that remove the defence of reasonable excuse and derivative use immunity, and increase the penalties for non-compliance with the National Crime Authority Act 1984. It is appropriate that, these provisions having attracted some attention and comment, there be a review in relation to that.

	(2)	Schedule 1 (other than Part 17) and Schedules 2 to 7 and 9 to 12 commence on a day to be fixed by Proclamation.
	(3)	If a provision of this Act to which subsection (2) applies does not commence under that subsection within the period of 6 months beginning on the day on which this Act receives the Royal Assent, it commences on the first day after the end of that period.
	(4)	Part 17 of Schedule 1 commences, or is taken to have commenced, immediately after the commencement of Part 15 of Schedule 1.
	(5)	Schedule 8 commences on a day to be fixed by Proclamation.
This amends the commencement clause in proposed section 2 of the bill so that provisions that are subject to the five-year review will commence at the same time; therefore, there will be one concurrent review period and it will not be staggered. Previously, the clause gave the option of commencing different parts of the bill on different days.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-08-08,"—The Superannuation Contributions Taxes and Termination Payments Tax Legislation Amendment Bill 2001 is designed to improve the equity of the termination payment surcharge and the superannuation contributions surcharge tax legislation. It makes permanent the transitional provisions that have applied since 20 August 1996. These are measures which were announced in the budget on 22 May this year. We should also note that this particular piece of legislation is the 16th bill that has been presented to the Senate that deals with issues relating to the so-called surcharge.
The bill will ensure that only the post-20 August 1996 amount of an employer eligible termination payment taken as cash will be taken into account for the purposes of the surcharge tax. This reverses the current situation that makes all of the retained amount of an employer eligible termination payment, including amounts relating to pre-20 August 1996 service, accountable for the surcharge tax. This particular provision has been roundly—and, I might say, rightly— criticised as being inequitable. This criticism commenced with the announcement of the so-called surcharge provision in the budget of 1996. I was amongst the many critics of this particular aspect of the legislation.
The bill also provides that only a notional amount of an employer eligible termination payment is included in the calculation of the employee's adjusted taxable income for surcharge tax purposes. This will benefit employees or former employees who would not normally be subject to the so-called surcharge but could become liable to pay the surcharge in a given year as a consequence of receiving an employer eligible termination payment.  
The bill will also ensure that employees will not have to pay an effective tax rate higher than the top marginal tax rate plus the Medicare levy when taking their ETP as cash. Currently, some people may face a higher effective tax rate, due to the interaction of the termination payment surcharge and the reasonable benefit limits provision. The estimated cost to government revenue is $14 million in 2001-02, $21 million in 2002-03, $17 million in 2003-04 and $21 million in the next financial year. 
Whilst we are on the issue of revenue— and I would like the duty minister to take this matter back to the Assistant Treasurer—there was a second reading amendment passed to a piece of superannuation legislation earlier in the week requesting that the Senate be provided with the revenue details in the forward estimates from the so-called surcharge. At the moment, they are hidden in general tax revenue collected from superannuation. The Senate has requested that these figures be provided.
The Labor opposition will be supporting this legislation. Indeed, it takes up—as I referred to earlier—one of the Labor Party's suggestions and original criticisms of this measure. Of course, it is not just Labor opposition members who have been calling for change in this area. This aspect has been criticised by many reputable and respected organisations who have knowledge of superannuation in the general community, including some members of the government. I referred earlier in the week to the very effective role that the Western Australian Liberal senator Senator Lightfoot has been playing in Western Australia. At the recent Liberal Party conference he was successful in ensuring that the conference unanimously condemned the introduction of the surcharge tax. Congratulations, Senator Lightfoot. Keep up the good work.
The termination payment surcharge came into effect on 20 August 1996. It is imposed on what might be described as golden handshakes paid on termination of employment of so-called high-income earners. Termination payments are the retained amounts—that is amounts not rolled over or transferred into a superannuation fund—of eligible termination payments made by employers on the termination of an employment of an employee. This is generally in circumstances of redundancy. So we had a double whammy here. Not only did many employees go through the harshness of redundancy but then they were being slugged retrospectively with the so-called surcharge. In many cases, they were employees earning less than the surcharge tax minimum threshold level—an absolutely outrageous situation. I will refer to a couple of practical examples a little later.
The Liberal government announced in the 1996-97 budget that a surcharge would apply to contributions that are subject to a tax deduction, including employer contributions and those made by members, where there is no employer contribution and the deduction had been claimed and where the assessable income and superannuation contributions exceeded $70,000. This $70,000 figure has been indexed and it is now, I believe, approximately $85,242. Since 1999-2000, the so-called reportable fringe benefits of an employee are taken into account in working out superannuation surcharge tax liabilities.
The government introduced a transition period that was scheduled to expire at the start of July. Following the expiry of the transition period, all of the termination payments accrued after 30 June 1983, even entitlements accrued prior to the introduction of the surcharge tax legislation, were to be subject to the surcharge. Criticisms of the surcharge have been subject to significant debate, particularly here in the Senate. I might refer here to the 23rd report of the former Senate Select Committee on Superannuation titled Superannuation surcharge legislation, which sets out in very comprehensive detail many of the concerns that have been raised. I acknowledge in the chair here in the Senate today the chair of that committee. I do not want to embarrass Senator Watson unduly, but I know that he has raised concerns about the adverse impact of this surcharge in the number of ways in which it is applied inequitably to people in the Australian community. 
One of these concerns is the question of inequity in the transitional provisions for the termination payment surcharge. The definition of assessable income includes termination payments or golden handshakes. But inclusion of termination payments can result in lower income persons, not simply high income people, being liable for the surcharge. I referred earlier to someone losing their job as a result of redundancy. In their working life up to the point of redundancy they might earn $50,000 or $60,000, but in the year of redundancy, because of the impact of the surcharge tax, their income may be inflated due to the redundancy payout and that then takes them into surcharge tax territory: they cross the minimum threshold.
Despite the Liberal government having been made aware of these sorts of problems—not just through me, not just through industry organisations, not just through well-informed government backbenchers but also through the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation—it has taken these past four years for some of these issues to be addressed. We were going to face the situation where the full 15 per cent surcharge would apply to most substantial taxable separation payments so that before the age of 55 the normally unfunded super tax of 31.5 per cent for post-1983 benefits and the 15 per cent surcharge, a total of 46.5 per cent tax, would apply on taxable separation payments. There would have been thousands of Australian employees—or former employees, after redundancy—who would have been caught in the surcharge net, and thousands of these employees would not have been earning anywhere near the minimum commencement income for the application of the surcharge tax.
The Department of the Parliamentary Library's Information and Research Services, as we know, produce papers and analyses from time to time. I was reading through one of their reports recently, and they referred to the surcharge legislation. I could not put it better myself when they stated:
... the surcharge legislation remains on the statute books. Many of the witnesses to the 23rd report of the former Senate Select Committee on Superannuation provisions will still be dealing with the complex administration, clumsy assessment procedures and on-going administration costs that are born not just by high income earners, but by all superannuation fund members.
I am indebted to my colleague in the other place Mr Kelvin Thomson, our shadow minister for superannuation, for outlining the particular problems of a former bus driver who worked for the Brisbane City Council. He was earning a modest $17 an hour. Over the course of 22 years, he had built up in his superannuation account some $70,000. People who know something about superannuation know that $70,000 over 22 years is not such a significant amount in the context of superannuation. On the closure of that defined benefit fund that he was a member of and the establishment of an accumulation fund in its place, he and other members rolled over their money into that new accumulation fund. Bear in mind the closure of the fund: he was not taking his money out at that point in time or not technically taking it out; he was taking his money out of the closed defined benefit fund and transferring it into the accumulation fund. That bus driver earning $17 an hour was presented with a tax bill of $10,000. That sort of anomaly highlights all too well the sorts of problems with this surcharge tax that is claimed to be an equity measure. It has impacted far beyond high income earners. 
My colleague Mr Thomson also outlined some interesting examples of other problems that have emerged with the application of the tax to defined benefit funds. He refers—and I will not have time to go into the detail here—to some interesting examples provided to him by the Australian and International Pilots Association. Regrettably, the government has had its head in the sand on the issue for the last four years, and some of these issues are now only just being dealt with.
I would also like to refer to another problem drawn to my attention by the Labor member for Charlton, Ms Hoare. This involves shiftworkers at the Eraring power station. They are entitled to the employee's base wage and have superannuation guarantee payments based on that base wage. When they are assessing income, they have the base salary plus 20 per cent allowances, so their income is well below the superannuation surcharge tax levy lower limit. But the Australian Taxation Office applies the superannuation surcharge levy to the state government employee's base wage plus actual allowances of 37.7 per cent plus employer superannuation contributions, which puts the income above the superannuation surcharge levy upper limit for the purposes of the surcharge tax. You could understand that a worker in a situation like that, where their entitlements are calculated on one salary but their taxation liabilities are calculated on a different salary, would be very unimpressed. I have referred in the Senate to another example in my home state of Tasmania in respect of mine workers working at Roseberry on Tasmania's west coast. Having regard to these sorts of anomalies, Labor has indicated that we intend to have a review of superannuation. 
This Liberal-National Party government has no vision whatsoever in relation to superannuation. In fact, all the evidence that has emerged and the stated intention of the Prime Minister in recent weeks indicates there is an ideological problem there. I noted an on-the-public-record comment by one of the Prime Minister's advisers, Mr Morris, at a recent IFSA luncheon where he expressed concerns about the government not agreeing with compulsory superannuation. Not only is the government opposed to superannuation but every action it takes actually cuts the final retirement income outcome for people from their superannuation funds.
The importance of superannuation is that it is, together with the age pension, the primary income vehicle for our ageing population. The Prime Minister recently discovered that the ageing population is going to be a problem. Superannuation and the interaction with the age pension are the major ways of preparing for this ageing population. This is an extremely important issue. At the moment, just over one in 10 Australians are over the age of 65. By 2025, almost one in four Australians will be over the age of 65. The objective of superannuation is not just to provide an additional income over and above the traditional age pension but to ensure that the moneys needed to pay for that ageing population are put aside and are there ready for retirees to draw down on when they reach that age and that we do not put too much of a burden on the existing taxpayers—our children and our grandchildren—yet the government remains, it seems to me, implacably opposed to superannuation.
We have only to look at some of the other actions of this government in the last five years. It failed to deliver the three per cent co-contribution into Australian superannuation accounts. It attempted recently to reduce the protections in the event of theft and fraud. If a member's money is stolen—and that is a very rare occurrence in our system, fortunately—the Labor Party ensured that there was a compensation mechanism to pay back 100 per cent of the moneys that were stolen. The Liberal-National Party wanted to reduce that protection to 80 per cent of the moneys. And there is the new surcharge tax, which is the subject of one aspect of this legislation today. The Prime Minister in the 1996 election said `no new taxes; no increase in existing taxes'. Rightly, there has been significant focus on the promise the Prime Minister gave about the GST. But he and the Treasurer and this government introduced a massive new tax on superannuation. To some extent they have succeeded in hiding that. I do not think the community has woken up to the fact that they introduced this new tax on superannuation, although slowly but surely more and more people are waking up to it. They did it so that they could hide the tax, so that people would not immediately notice it. You would notice it only when you got the assessment notices. More and more people are receiving those. You would notice it when you went to collect your retirement income, when you looked at your statement and saw that you had been surcharged and taxed. This is this government's approach to the ageing population.
—You said you would support the superannuation legislation.
—The prime architect of this legislation, and all the errors and problems, has just walked into the chamber—the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp. I would like him to acknowledge that I did in fact criticise and point out the problem that we would have to deal with in this legislation today. The bottom line for this government is they have not added one dollar to the superannuation savings of Australians. They have added administrative complexity, added tax, failed to deliver the increased contributions that they promised and attempted to reduce protections in the event of theft and fraud. What a record! The hypocrisy when we had last week the Prime Minister discovering we have an ageing population and we have to be doing something about it—when the very income we need for people who are entering into retirement is being slugged in this way by this government. We will support this legislation. It corrects one of the errors and one of the problems that we pointed out to the government at the time when they introduced this new tax.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2001-08-08,"—The Democrats also support the Superannuation Contributions Taxes and Termination Payments Tax Legislation Amendment Bill 2001, which is designed to enhance the equity of the treatment of the termination payment surcharge and superannuation contribution surcharge legislation in accordance with the measures announced in this year's budget. The bill has three objectives. It makes the existing transitional mechanisms permanent where they relate to the portion of a termination payment that is subject to surcharge, it changes how a taxpayer's adjusted taxable income is determined under the surcharge legislation in certain circumstances and it exempts the excessive component of an employer eligible termination payment from liability to the termination payment surcharge.
The termination payment surcharge is imposed on golden handshake payments if the taxpayer's adjusted taxable income for the financial year in question is in excess of the surcharge level for 2001-02. The surcharge begins to be levied when assessable income and superannuation contributions for the year exceed $85,242. The maximum surcharge of 15 per cent is payable when assessable income and superannuation contributions reach $103,507. This legislation will improve equity by ensuring that lower income earners who receive termination payments are no longer eligible for the surcharge. At present, redundancy payments are included in the determination of adjusted taxable income for the year. Such a classification can result in a longstanding low income employee being classified in the surcharge category.
Whilst the Democrats support this legislation because it attempts to increase equity, it is also important to point out that this government continues to refuse to consider the equitable treatment of same sex couples on matters of superannuation. Whilst this individual measure is desirable, it does not seem to flow from an underlying desire to ensure that all Australians are treated equitably.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTIONS TAXES AND TERMINATION PAYMENTS TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2001-08-08,"—I appreciate the brevity of the last contribution. Senator Sherry raised a couple of issues, some of them in his usual ungracious fashion. I have to make this preliminary comment, even though I am a man who is not usually provoked: for a person who has spent so much time thinking about superannuation, which I encourage—I think you, Mr Acting Deputy President, are an individual who spends a lot of time thinking about super—so little ever emerges from Senator Sherry's area. Senator Sherry has complained and moaned about super for five years, and one would have thought that, as we go to the next election, he would have had a host of ideas about how to improve superannuation.
—I have.
—He has a host of ideas but the truth of the matter is this: what is the Labor Party policy on superannuation? Let me just quote the shadow Assistant Treasurer, who said, `We are going to have a review after the election, if the Labor Party happens to win.' After all this long period of thought and debate and concentration, nothing has emerged whatsoever. Senator Sherry is back on the old superannuation surcharge. As Senator Conroy commented once, Senator Sherry spends about 90 per cent of his time thinking about the superannuation surcharge. You would have thought that there would have been some decent proposals coming forward. It is not unreasonable to expect that someone who thinks so hard and so long about this topic could have come up with some proposals. The astonishing thing is that nothing has happened. 
Senator Sherry has gone around and consulted with people, and he has got up and made speeches attacking the surcharge—although, just for the record, the Labor Party supports the superannuation surcharge as part of its policy. Senator Sherry goes off on these frolics. He cannot convince the Labor Party, no proposals come forward and the truth of the matter is, as the Treasurer, who has a nice turn of phrase, has said, the ALP stands for the Australian lazy party. I think that is exactly the truth. It is a very sad reflection on this chamber and on Senator Sherry directly. As a person who is a self-proclaimed expert on super, he has produced so little policy over such a long period of time. It is a very ordinary performance. 
Let me return to the Superannuation Contributions Taxes and Termination Payments Tax Legislation Amendment Bill 2001. The measures in this bill have been widely welcomed because they will improve the overall equity and operation of the surcharge legislation in relation to employer eligible termination payments such as redundancies. I note that the opposition recognise the benefits provided to terminating employees by the bill and will support it. We welcome that support, Senator Sherry.
The three measures contained in this bill were announced by the government on 22 May 2001 as part of the 2001-02 federal budget. The first measure ensures that only a proportion of a termination payment received that relates to service after 20 August 1996 will be subject to the surcharge. Without this change, transitional provisions covering surcharge on retained termination payments would end on 20 August this year and the full amount of such payment would be subject to the surcharge. When the legislation went through, Senator Sherry, there was significant debate on this particular issue, if I remember rightly.
—There was. This is where you should be apologising. You got the bill wrong.
—You have to apologise to your constituency because over five years you have produced nothing. Never has there been so much talk for so little policy, Senator. You are the person who has held himself out as the world's expert in this area. 
 (Senator Watson)—Through the chair, please.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. It is a very ordinary performance from Senator Sherry. He has lifted the expectations of people with his promises but he has failed to deliver to his own party and failed to convince his own party. And, I might say, he has failed to declare, on numerous occasions, a direct personal interest in all this, to be quite frank. 
—I would not get into that one—we all have an interest.
—Senator Sherry, I think it is an important issue and, frankly, I will get into it if I am provoked.
—Just like you have an interest in it, too.
—But, Senator Sherry, we have proposed a superannuation surcharge—your party has accepted that. You are proposing to remove it.
—I am not saying that.
—Oh, you are not saying that! That is an interesting concession from Senator Sherry—that has never before got in the Hansard. The second measure will benefit low to middle income earners who receive modest termination payments. Currently, taxpayers who are not ordinarily subject to the surcharge may become liable in a given year if they receive a redundancy payment. This is because the whole payment is included in the calculation of their adjusted income for surcharge purposes. This measure will ensure that only a proportion of the redundancy payment, based on the employee's length of service with the employer, will be included in the calculation of their adjusted taxable income. 
The third measure will ensure that the maximum rate of taxation payable on any part of an eligible termination payment taken as cash is the top marginal rate plus the Medicare levy. The measures in this bill significantly enhance the fairness and operation of the termination payment surcharge and the superannuation contributions surcharge legislation. 
Senator Sherry raised a number of issues, to which I now turn—I hope to Senator Sherry's satisfaction. Senator Sherry raised the issue of the application of the superannuation surcharge to the transfer of superannuation benefits from a defined benefits superannuation scheme to an accumulation scheme. Senator Sherry took some time on this.
—They were Mr Thomson's comments.
—Do you want me to respond or not?
—Just making sure you understood.
—Thank you, Senator Sherry. Every time I get into my `trying to assist Senator Sherry' mood, I get an abusive comment. It never ceases to amaze me. Senator Sherry, you are a singularly ungracious senator.
The issue that was raised is, I understand, in respect of a Brisbane City Council bus driver. The advice that I have received on this matter is that, when benefits are transferred from a defined benefits scheme to an accumulation scheme, the value of the benefit entitlements of the member is determined at that point of time. Where the trustee calculates a member's benefits using a different method from that required for surcharge reporting purposes, any amounts in excess of the previously reported contributions are assessable in the year that they are transferred.
Frequently when a member converts from defined benefits to accumulation benefits—I think this is very important—there will be an offer of an increase in the member's entitlements to be transferred to the accumulation membership as an incentive to accept the accumulation benefit. In other words, I am putting before the Senate that in this case there is an incentive, an increased benefit, over and above the benefit that would have been offered in the defined benefits scheme as an incentive when you move to an accumulation scheme, and any increased benefits represent contributions in the year that they are received. That may not have been clear in Mr Thomson's comments. I do not know if Senator Sherry has any other information in relation to Mr Thomson that he would like to present to me, but my understanding is that the new schemes, the accumulation schemes, offer increased benefits. This causes the result in Mr Thomson's case that Senator Sherry cited in the debate.
Senator Sherry raised an issue on behalf of shiftworkers at the Eraring power station relating to the superannuation guarantee earnings phase and the surcharge, and I have some information to lay before the Senate. As is well known, the SG legislation requires employers to make compulsory contributions to a superannuation fund for their eligible employees at a certain level based on the employee's earnings base. In the case of award employees, the contributions are generally determined by reference to the award earnings base; that is, the ordinary time earnings. The earnings base for employees not covered under award arrangements would be the SG default earnings base. My advice is that in most cases this is simply the employee's salary or wages, excluding overtime. The surcharge applies if a person's adjustable taxable income exceeds $85,242 in the current financial year. Employees whose adjusted taxable income exceeds $85,242—that is, they are regarded in this legislation as higher income earners—because of a variety of allowances may be subject to the superannuation surcharge even though the earnings base on which their compulsory superannuation contributions is determined is relatively low.
I do not know whether Senator Sherry can shed any light on the Labor Party position. There will always be an argument as to the level at which the superannuation surcharge cuts in. The level that the government has determined is reflected in this year's figure of $85,242 as the level which is marked out for higher income earners. We are saying that in calculating this income there may be a variety of allowances that may be subject to superannuation surcharge even though the earnings base on which the compulsory contributions are determined is relatively low. 
I commend this bill to the Senate. The bill reflects a very important aspect of this government: this is a consultative government, a government which goes around listening to people. Some issues were raised with this government; as a result, some changes were made in the legislation. I think this reflects the fact that this bill has—as I understand it—the support of all members in the chamber, which I welcome. I urge a speedy passage of the bill so that the wider public can have greater certainty in this matter.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-08-08,"—I might start by saying that at last—after three years of waiting—the government is finally allowing us an opportunity to debate its so-called choice measure. The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 1998 is about anything but choice. This legislation is about the deregulation of the retail distribution of superannuation. It is about providing greater opportunities for the banks. It is about wrecking existing corporate and industry funds.
—Union funds.
—I will take that interjection—and I will come back to that later—that you have made in your total ignorance, Senator McGauran, on this issue. It is about increasing fees, charges and commissions paid to the people who distribute superannuation products. It is about lessening the protections that, currently, members of superannuation funds enjoy in Australia. Labor supports informed choice and in particular its preferred option of investment choice. 
Let me briefly outline the existing superannuation structure, particularly for Senator McGauran's edification. Australia has a number of different types of superannuation funds: so-called do-it-yourself, DIY; corporate funds, mainly big business—Senator McGauran, this impacts on them—industry funds, multi-employer funds, as they are commonly known; public sector funds; and retail funds. All except for the latter are governed by nonprofit trustee structures, and these nonprofit trustees generally tender for the administration, investment and insurance provided.
Industry funds are multiemployer funds. They have joint employer and employee trustees. Some of the employee trustees are union officials, just as some of the employer trustees are officials of various industry organisations, just as some of them are executives in the business structure of those organisations. So there is joint trustee membership. And, more importantly, for Senator McGauran's information, it requires a two-thirds vote of the trustees to make any decision. So they have effectively a joint veto over each other.
We saw the extensive spread of industry funds in the late 1980s following what is known as the three per cent productivity award superannuation case. This case required employers, in lieu of a wage increase for employees, to contribute three per cent of ordinary time earnings into what emerged as largely industry funds. At the same time, corporate funds were allowed to continue to exist. I acknowledge that, and I acknowledge generally the very good work they have done over many years.
The fund to which superannuation moneys are contributed is generally determined by industrial awards and agreements. This was for a very good reason, Senator McGauran, because at the time there was a call from business, particularly small business, that they did not want to have to pay into more than one fund. I think even Senator McGauran can understand that an employer—who might have 20, maybe 100, employees— does not want to have to pay contributions, because of the administrative cost, into separate funds. If you think that the backlash from the business activity statement was significant, you wait and see—we are not going to see this, because I understand this legislation will be defeated—what happens if this legislation is passed and small business have to start contributing superannuation contributions into many different superannuation funds. 
There is a more important reason for the continuation of the current system. A feature of Australia's system is that there is extensive regulation of the retail distribution through the mechanism that I have just outlined. This is important because, generally, the administrative fees decrease as the size of a fund increases. Through the massive size of some of these funds—including corporate funds—they are able to negotiate very effective administrative charges as well as funds management fees and insurance rates, certainly far better rates for administration than we see in the traditional retail product.
There are still quite a few of these traditional retail products around. They are the real dinosaurs of the industry. These products were characterised by an individual purchasing a superannuation product and often paying the first year's contributions in commission and then often paying one, two or three per cent of future contributions as commission, supposedly to cover administration costs. That is the system that this government wants us to return to—the individual will have to go and purchase a superannuation product—and this is in the name of choice.
This system has been introduced in two countries: Chile and the United Kingdom. A former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Margaret Thatcher, deregulated the existing superannuation industry in the United Kingdom. Individuals had to go out and make a choice about where their superannuation contributions were to go. They had to go and buy a product. What occurred was—even amongst people who are educated, and I include in that teachers, for example, and public servants—that people were required to do this and when they went out to buy the individual products following the deregulation of the system, frankly, they got ripped off.
There was an extensive study done about this, and many of the big insurance companies in the United Kingdom were ordered to repay moneys to people who invested. Unfortunately, a very significant proportion of people do not have sufficient financial literacy to make these decisions. They pulled out of existing funds; they were convinced, often by agents on commission, to go and join an alternative product at a very significant—
—How are you going to keep administration costs down?
—I have touched on administration costs and I might return to the issue for the benefit of Senator McGauran. The highest costs occur where you have a transient work force such as in the hospitality industry or casual employees—employees of that type. The cost of multiemployer funds in this country, including corporate funds, is generally about a dollar a week or $50 a year. You cannot get cheaper—it is a very effective system. Indeed, the United States with, I acknowledge, a very right-wing President Bush is examining the Australian system because the right-wing Republicans are impressed by the efficiency of the delivery of superannuation vehicles in Australia, particularly when you are dealing with compulsory superannuation applying to just about the entire Australian work force.
Deregulation was a catastrophe in the United Kingdom. And likewise in Chile. Chile introduced compulsory private retirement savings accounts under the Pinochet regime. These are characterised, again, by the requirement for an individual to go and purchase their own retirement product. There have been surveys of fees, charges and commissions which have been found to generally take 10 per cent of the contributions flowing in to these particular funds. Indeed, it is a common feature of the Chilean system that incentives are provided for employees to switch from one fund to another: free bikes, free mobile phones and the like are offered to people to switch from one fund to another. This is the outcome that this government would want to see in Australia through this legislation. 
The government has stated that this so-called choice legislation will deal with the proliferation of accounts. This is a legitimate problem in Australia: we have eight million members of superannuation funds with 22 million accounts. Most Australians do not know that they can transfer and consolidate their accounts. But this government legislation does not solve that problem. The theory is that you have an individual account and you take it from workplace to workplace, but this legislation confers the power on the employer and, as an employee moves from one workplace to another, their account may not be acceptable to the employer—so it does not solve the problem.
—It is choice for the employer, not the employee.
—It is choice for the employer, as my colleague Senator O'Brien has remarked. The employer is going to resist genuine choice where an individual wants to place their money in their own fund because of the administrative costs. My personal suggestion for dealing with the proliferation of accounts is automatic consolidation at the end of each financial year, and this is achievable. 
Why are fees, charges and commissions important? Why is it important to contain the cost of a private superannuation retirement system? It is very important because superannuation is not an employment generator for the agents and the retail distribution system. Its objective is to maximise the retirement income of the individuals who are part of the system. The government obviously has an important interest in maximising the retirement income of Australians, particularly given the ageing of our population. 
Let me touch on that. Up until the late 1980s, superannuation was mainly the preserve of higher income earners, public servants and the like. The majority of Australians had no superannuation whatsoever. It was the Labor Party that introduced universal superannuation in the late 1980s. We are proud of having introduced universal superannuation, because it showed a vision to deal with the problems of the ageing population that are starting to emerge now and will fully emerge by the year 2020. There will be one in four people over the age of 65 by the year 2025; at the moment it is one in 10. How is this to be paid for? To a significant degree, it will be paid for by universal superannuation introduced by a Labor government in the late 1980s and the subsequent introduction of the superannuation guarantee and the extensive revision and rewrite of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 which, among a variety of measures, included 100 per cent protection in the event of theft and fraud, which this government sought to water down recently and was fortunately defeated. 
The interesting dichotomy of the Australian system is that retail distribution is heavily regulated but that investment takes the most liberal, if I can use that term, free market approach in the entire world. Again, that is of great interest to the American government because, under the Australian system, the trustees, subject to what is called the `prudent man' principle—excuse the sexist terminology but that is the industry terminology—have to spread the investment to ensure that risk is minimised. Subject to that, the moneys are not just invested through the Australian economy—I think about 20 per cent of the investment is overseas—but also through various categories of the Australian economy. That has served Australia well, because under that system we have seen average returns over the last 13 years that have been very impressive. This is not just in one or two funds; right across the industry with only a few exceptions we have seen extremely impressive long-term average returns. It was the Labor Party's superannuation guarantee policy and the Labor's Party's regulatory structure that have seen superannuation grow from about $40 billion in the late 1980s to $497 billion, according to the last APRA superannuation funds trend survey.  
This is all about an ideological campaign to deregulate the superannuation industry. There is a common misconception, and I do believe a genuine misconception on the part of Senator McGauran—not in the case of his colleagues but in his case—that they are union funds. They are not. I heard allegations in the last election being made by the former director of the Liberal Party that these funds contributed to the Labor Party. This was checked and it was found that a big fat zero was contributed by industry superannuation funds to the Labor Party's election coffers. It was a false allegation.
The trustee system has served Australia well. The investment approach has served Australia well. We need to not be distracted by false issues that the government raises in this legislation but look at how we are going to improve on the superannuation system, how we are going to add to superannuation savings, to prepare for the ageing population. It would be very unfair to spread the cost of retirees in 20 or 25 years back to our children and our grandchildren. The requirement to increase taxes to fund this would be enormous without the superannuation. Labor have an alternative option. The option we put forward—and I am glad to see it has spread through many of the superannuation funds— is investment choice. You have a menu of investment options: you can pick equities, you can pick overseas investment, you can pick ethical investment. There are a whole range of investments, some riskier than others, some returning higher or lower. The fund member can tick a box and indicate where they want their money to go. 
Interestingly, when we get to the issue of choice, very few people in funds to date have actually exercised an investment choice. The superannuation system that we have is admired by most overseas countries. They wish they could have done the same. They are facing increasing economic, social and political consequences as a result of the ageing population. I do not think Australia will be free of some of that conflict, but at least we have a firm starting base with our pension system funded from budget and our now universal superannuation system. 
It is often argued in the context of choice that we should just leave it to the individual. The argument is that the individual can decide what the complex financial options are for their future. The argument put forward by Senator Kemp and others is that we will educate people to make these decisions if they do not have sufficient knowledge at the present time. Even if you could educate people, it would require a massive education campaign, and any education campaign run by this government would be in the form of a propaganda campaign, telling us how great choice is rather than actually educating people to make sophisticated financial decisions. I put a lot of faith in my pub test. I go down to the local Forth pub and people raise these issues with me.
—I thought it was your local hairdresser.
—My hairdresser has raised it with me, too, Senator Kemp. He gets a general cross-section of the public through his salon. He has since retired. 
—Is that Stefan or Johann?
—No; it is Barry, for your information—as trivial and trite as your contribution is on this debate.
 (Senator McKiernan)—Minister, you would be aware that interjections are unruly, and you are not in your seat.
—When the public ask about these sorts of issues, frankly, the public are lost when it comes to superannuation— not all, but the vast majority of people see the word `superannuation' and the last thing they want to be doing is sitting down and reading up on all the prospectuses and making decisions about where their money is going to be invested. All the evidence shows that is the public attitude. I would concede that you can turn some of that around. You can educate some people, but I would submit the majority of people in our community simply do not have those skills at the present time. There is a simple practical problem, too: how do you educate people who are functionally illiterate in our society? The population of employees who are functionally illiterate is about 15 per cent. That means they cannot read a road map; they cannot follow a phone book. How on earth are they going to follow the sophisticated financial prospectuses that are being offered under the government model of choice?  
I would predict a total disaster with this. In some ways, if you wanted to play the devil's advocate and create mayhem, you would allow the government to pass this legislation, and we would see a very similar outcome to the one in Chile and the United Kingdom. The Labor Party are not going to do that. Our primary concern is to protect Australian superannuation savings, a well-designed system that has served this country well, and we will be voting against the second reading of the bill.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHOICE OF SUPERANNUATION FUNDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2001-08-08,"—I rise to oppose the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 1998, along with my colleague Senator Sherry. I think this is a very important issue. Whilst I understand that it is most likely that this bill will fail at the second reading, I believe it is important to get a few issues on the Hansard record in respect of the issue of choice of funds. As Senator Sherry said, this is an ideologically driven issue and one that we are completely at odds with. If one looks at the issue of superannuation, you realise that superannuation is there to give people security in retirement. On a number of occasions here, I have outlined the three things: security in youth, security at work and security in retirement.
—What was the first one?
—It was security in youth: when you are young. People are entitled to feel reasonably safe and secure in those three phases of their life. Of course, one of the burgeoning areas is security in retirement, which cannot be afforded by the age pension, as Senator Sherry quite rightly said, with our ageing population. The advent of superannuation on a broader basis than what it was originally operating was welcomed indeed. Historically, superannuation was the preserve of executives and people in the corporate sector. It was also extended to public servants. Outside of those people, very few others enjoyed the benefit of superannuation. They had no assurance whatsoever that there would be security in their retirement other than by receipt of the age pension. Those who were excluded included skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled workers— white-collar and blue-collar workers alike— and full-time, part-time and casual employees. 
Historically, these people had been denied, or did not have made available to them, access to superannuation and security in retirement. So their only prospect was to receive the age pension. Of itself, that was never a bright prospect. In the case of my parents, my father was a blue-collar worker. My father did not have access to superannuation. My father did not have access to a secure income retirement benefit when he retired. Today, we are on the threshold of seeing the younger generation gaining the benefits of lifelong superannuation through a compulsory superannuation scheme that will give them at least some prospect of having security in their retirement. As my colleague Senator Sherry quite rightly points out, that is still with a compulsory superannuation system which is short of the mark. Even when it moves to nine per cent next year, it will be well and truly short of the mark when one considers that, to get a reasonable benefit for retirement, one would need to contribute in the order of 15 per cent. Of course, that will not be achieved by choice of fund. It will only be achieved through an extension of the requirements under the superannuation guarantee. 
As Senator Sherry rightly pointed out, we do have an ageing population. We do have this stress on the public purse. We do have this need for security in retirement, for a policy that guarantees people that the payment they will receive will ensure their safety and wellbeing throughout their retirement years. This gets to the very heart of the issue of choice of funds. Under this proposed bill, in my view, people would be subject to a deal of pressure to choose which fund they were to belong to. That pressure could come from high-pressure salespersons; it could come from the employer; it could come from a number of sources. People may feel under adverse pressure to transfer into products that are marketed in a slick and very flash manner—products which might look appealing to the eye in the first instance but which, at the end of the day, offer a hollow return, with those who promote the schemes being the real beneficiaries of those schemes. That is the difficulty that lies ahead with this issue of choice of fund. 
If you go back and look at how we ended up with a retirement policy at all in this nation, you will see that it was certainly no thanks to this government and that it was certainly no thanks to the employers. Whilst I said that they were prepared to look after those who were in a privileged position within employment, they were certainly never of a mind to look after those who were not in a privileged position. In the 1980s the trade union movement's push for award superannuation was the initial breakthrough for workers in this country to get superannuation on a broader basis. 
As a trade union secretary at that time, I was heavily involved in the gaining of superannuation for my members, many of whom were women, many of whom were part-time and casual employees, who had never had any access during their working life to superannuation. So this was a major achievement indeed. But there was monumental resistance from employers to employees gaining access to that superannuation. We spent countless hours in the industrial commission arguing the pros and cons of superannuation, arguing what sort of fund it should be. My union, the Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association, was not the only union that was involved in a loggerhead battle with the employers to achieve that minimal breakthrough of three per cent. The three per cent that we were seeking at that stage was nothing more than a deferred wage increase. 
We were not seeking that the money be put into a union fund, because none of these funds were union funds. They have been quite wrongly tagged and labelled over a long period of time as union funds. They were industry funds where there were equal representations of employers and employees. The reason for that was that the employees— whose contributions were being paid not voluntarily but in a compulsory scheme, because it was an award provision and later on was covered by the SG—had some confidence that their investment was being protected such that they could reap the benefits of that in their retirement. I recall the rigorous argument that went on as to the merits and demerits of different funds in the state industrial commission in which I was involved at that stage. It got down to not one single fund but a number of funds. But, at the end of the day, the commission in its wisdom, even in Queensland, recognised and limited the number of funds that people could have access to. That was an important thing indeed. 
The next step that became of paramount importance was that the representatives appointed by both the employers and the employees were there to represent the interests not of the employer and the employee but of the person whose contribution had been made to that fund, to maximise the return for that person and to ensure, at the end of the day, that there was a reasonable retirement fund and benefit for these people. Part of this argy-bargy at the time was the clamouring by the major superannuation firms to try to claw back and get their greasy fingers into the cut of the superannuation cake and, of course, they were excluded. They whinged and whined about that forever and a day because they knew that there was an ageing population. They knew that the superannuation pot would grow and they wanted to get into the action. They wanted a slice of the action. We have already seen a reasonable attempt by the government to appease the banks, which also wanted a slice of that action, by including retirement savings accounts in previous legislation before this chamber. This really boils down to choice of fund, trying to let the snake oil salesmen and saleswomen out there, who over a long period have preyed off other people's prospective benefits, pocket it themselves, line their own pockets and make a killing. Of course, they have been basically excluded by the operation of industry funds. This is an attempt to claw back. Claw-back in this case has a lot of connotations for employees.
When we look at some of the difficulties to which Senator Sherry alluded—and I will deal with a couple of those in a moment—we need look no further than at the educational issue. Senator Sherry referred to the fact that somewhere in the order of 15 per cent of people are basically illiterate. They are not able to read these much-vaunted key feature statements which are supposed to enable a person to take a considered view as to which fund they should or should not belong to. Mr Silk from the Industry Funds Forum gave evidence to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services. He said, at page 70 of the Hansard: 
The Australian Bureau of Statistics' last survey on this—
and this is on functional illiteracy—
was released in 1997. They surveyed 9,000 adult Australians, aged between 15 and 74. Forty-six per cent of the Australian population within that age ranked at level 1 or level 2 on a five-level scale of numeracy and literacy. Level 5 is very good, level 4 is pretty good, level 3 is satisfactory. Levels 1 and 2 are unsatisfactory. Forty-six per cent of adult Australians ranked at level 1 or 2. The percentage of people in the work force would be less than that, but it is still very great indeed.
It is not the people who are able to cope with the system who will have the difficulties under this legislation, it will be those who are vulnerable. These are the people that are vulnerable—the people who do not have the reading skills, the mathematical skills, the business skills. It is not going to affect the corporate end of town. The corporate end of town have at their disposal the technology, the advice, to assist them to make a value choice—and a proper choice—and they have the ability to pay for it. If a couple of dollars go missing in some speculative investment, they are not put on their backside for the rest of their lives. What we have here is the sort of experience that Senator Sherry referred to. He referred to the UK and Chile. When people had the access, they were exposed. They blew everything and found themselves not prospectively in receipt of a benefit on which they could retire with any security.
So we have a difficulty with this piece of legislation. It is going to make a large group of people who are vulnerable more vulnerable. Currently these people have the right and have the access to choice of investment but, through their own choice, they do not go down that path. One only has to look at the evidence that came before the committee to find that choice of investment has not been taken up in any serious way in the community. This may well be a reflection that account balances have not reached a sufficiently high enough level for people to be stirred into action, but it may be that many people do not feel confident or competent enough, or do not understand the system or the information that is put before them, to enable them to make a value judgment as to what would constitute a reasonable investment for them. I quote from page 75 of the Hansard, reporting the roundtable of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services on Tuesday, 14 December. A witness before the committee, Ms Rubinstein from the Australian Council of Trade Unions, told us, and this refers in part to a witness who had appeared earlier in the day:
... I think Peter reported some figures from JMI—
that is, Jacques Martin—
15,000 members out of two million members had exercised choice. In a large fund that I have something to do with, I think over 1,000 people have exercised choice out of 350,000 members, or 150,000 to 200,000 active members.
I am not being selective here but, given the time for the second reader, one can find other examples of where there is no clamouring because people do not have the skills, the education, the capacity or the desire to make a choice about their investment. Yet we have the government going down the path of putting this bill before the Senate. They want to open up the field; they want to deregulate the retail superannuation market and open it up to God only knows who. We do not know their credentials, we do not know the push selling that would take place. We do not know what would happen. The consequences, of course, would be borne by those people who are most vulnerable and who would suffer the greatest effects.
Part of the discussion that we had before the Senate committee was in respect of the key feature statements, which are supposed to be the guiding light for people to make the choice. Having sat through that hearing on 14 December, I cannot recall there being any agreement as to what would constitute a reasonable key feature statement that would allow people to make an informed choice. At the end of the day, we have something that is completely useless to the populace at large. The government should be focusing on ensuring that there is security in retirement for people, and that we do not have people appearing before the Senate select committee telling us how their superannuation retirement benefit had been invested in a scheme that collapsed. We want to see a decent superannuation scheme for Australian people.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2001-08-08,"—The Democrats have always been somewhat ambivalent about providing choice of superannuation funds to employees. For many reasons, some of which have already been raised in this debate, we opposed the government's Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 1998 almost three years ago now. However, it is hard to oppose the principle that all workers should choose where their superannuation goes, especially when some workers are already making quite sophisticated choices and financial decisions. In many instances the choice is being made for them by their employer who, I would argue, in many cases has no more understanding of how our superannuation system works than employees.
Regrettably, after considerable discussion with the government and considerable effort to turn this legislation into an acceptable form, I must advise that we cannot support the bill, even with the government amendments that have been circulated. An argument supporting choice is that employees offered choice will be much more interested in the adequacy of their superannuation retirement income if they have greater control over those funds. This greater level of interest should also encourage higher levels of superannuation savings. We have always said that we believe most workers are better off in corporate and industry superannuation funds, and a choice regime would need to reflect that.
Industry funds in this country have served Australian workers extremely well. Over recent years industry funds have delivered an averaged 9.6 per cent return; corporate funds, even higher at 10.7 per cent return. That has been with the consistency of 97.5 per cent of funds paying returns of over nine per cent. By contrast, a wide range of private sector commercial funds have not delivered such high returns and have done so with higher fees. In short, the vast majority of workers would, in our judgment, receive better retirement incomes by being members of industry funds than by being pushed into public office schemes. That has been our judgment and that has been at the forefront of our discussions with government over the last period of time. It is very obvious that the majority of workers are not currently equipped to make decisions about where their superannuation should go, and certainly very few workers are in a better position of knowledge than their trustees about the way to invest money.
The Democrats do not share the pessimism of the ALP about whether in the future this will be the case. We do have faith—I guess you could say—in the opportunities to communicate to workers what superannuation is all about. In fact, the industry, governments and all players in the superannuation sector have failed to get across a very important message to employees about superannuation. It has been my experience that the information provided to employees has been couched in jargon impossible to relate to individuals. It is only in very recent times that the industry has turned this around and is now making great progress. I know there are a number of funds now where members can look on the Internet to find out what their savings are and really engage in that process. We need reform and we need to inform members of superannuation funds about what savings they have and about adequacy. As we all realise, even SG is not likely to deliver the sorts of retirement incomes which most people imagine they will receive.
As I said, we have been engaged on and off for more than a year in discussions with the government, and we had reached an accommodation on the framework of the choice regime. In order that people understand what we think is necessary for an acceptable choice regime, I want to go through the key principles that were discussed, many of which are reflected in the amendments that have been circulated. The industry was very concerned that choice would be imposed on them, on top of a whole range of other amendments to our superannuation scheme over the past two years, and so the start-up date for this scheme would need to have been well after the financial services reform legislation had been bedded down. The scheme would have encouraged collective agreements, and this certainly was not part of the scope of the original legislation. We would have insisted on a very strong disclosure regime, with long and short form statements which would have been accurate, simple and devoid of jargon and which would have allowed employees to properly compare schemes one with another, looking at fees and charges, exit and entry charges, commissions, death and disability insurance, rates of return and estimated payout figures, together with investment choices available. 
I was very pleased to hear Senator Sherry's remarks about investment choice because, as people in this place will know, the Democrats have been arguing for a long time for employees to have investment choice. We think there are a lot of great advantages in providing investment choice. This is not just about whether the scheme is a managed growth scheme or another type of scheme; it is also about allowing people to make choices about ethical investment, about environmentally sound investment and about putting into place the three stools—the economy, the environment and social good. We think that superannuation offers a great opportunity for us not just to see that retirement savings are there but also to act for good in our community. Investment choice would have allowed people some involvement in the way that money is invested in this country. So, as I said, I was very pleased to hear those remarks from Senator Sherry. It was not the case when the Democrats initiated an inquiry back in 1996, as I remember, into superannuation investment. At that stage, both major parties said that providing choice would be too complex and unnecessary. I am glad to hear that there is a change of heart with regard to the opposition.
A disclosure regime would have been developed by what was called a `choice consultative committee'. That would have been made up of those with the very best expertise in this field. It is a very complex field indeed, and I certainly do not have the necessary knowledge and expertise to determine what exactly a disclosure regime should look like. There were a lot of different views about this in the industry, but we acknowledge that there were people much better equipped to do that. However, key features statements would have fully disclosed all the fees, charges and commissions, the funds' rates of return, the levels and types of insurance cover and the general risk profiles of the funds, and the statements would have had to be clear and understandable. To promote a more transparent disclosure regime on the impact of fees and charges on earnings, the use of a management expenses ratio or some better alternative, calculated using a clearly stated and compulsory standard, would have been considered.
The states would have been encouraged to put in place consistent regimes as well. Disclosure in some states is not adequate, in our view, and so it would have been desirable for each state to have a consistent regime and one which provided a safety net for employees. The default fund would have been the fund that the majority of employees were in, or the award fund. A notice to new employees would have clearly spelt out all the options. No third line forcing would have been allowed. There would have been a code of conduct for selling superannuation in the workplace. Quarterly payments would have been required, instead of the current annual payments. As we know, the huge fund of so-called `lost accounts' is to a large degree created by the fact that no employer is required to make payments more often than annually. Many do pay quarterly, and some pay monthly, but the payments of the vast majority of workers out there are made annually and, of course, if a business is having financial difficulties, it very often happens that workers' entitlements are not paid for a whole 12 months, if the company goes bust.
The education campaign that the government originally proposed would have been significantly increased. As has already been said, there is a need not only for much more education for people but also, I think, for support for employees. To this end, a consumer education centre, seed funded by government, could have provided continuing education for members, as well as advice on the use of the key features statements and on other matters to be taken into account by employees in choosing a fund. It could have assisted consumers in taking complaints to the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal and it could have provided independent analysis of choice and other superannuation issues. I think that is a big gap in our current system. Certainly, the inquiry that we are currently conducting in the superannuation committee is demonstrating that it is not clear to those who have got problems with superannuation where they should go and how they should get advice. A consumer centre specifically set up to deal with superannuation issues is very necessary, we think. 
It would have been necessary to limit churning and to make greater efforts to solve the issue of members' lost accounts. This is an urgent matter that should be addressed, with or without a choice regime. We would urge the government to pick up on that issue and see that this money is redistributed.
At the end of the day, in spite of many discussions, a great deal of consultation and a lot of talking, the government was not prepared to accept our condition that such major change to our superannuation system would have to fix the problem of discrimination against same sex couples. That was a fundamentally important condition for the Democrats, and it was stated at the outset. The Democrats cannot, therefore, support this legislation.
I understand that the government has great difficulties, and that has been demonstrated time and time again over the last few weeks when we have put up amendments which neither the coalition nor the Labor Party has been prepared to support. To us this is fundamentally a human rights issue and it is not something we are going to give up on. We think it is time that the federal government faced this issue fairly and squarely as a human rights issue. It is about discrimination and it is time the federal government took a lead on it. Instead of that we in this place are behind many states and other organisations that have come to understand why this discrimination is unacceptable. So in conclusion I say it is regrettable that we have reached this point and have not been able to finally reach agreement. At the end of the day I would ask why this group should not have legislative protection and certainty about their entitlements being transferred to their partner when they die.
 (Quorum formed)",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHOICE OF SUPERANNUATION FUNDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2001-08-08,"—I rise to conclude the second reading debate on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 1998. I might say it is a disappointing conclusion to a very important public policy issue which has been brought before this chamber. The Labor Party attitude to choice has been well known. The Labor Party, for reasons which I think we all know, has set its mind against choice, and I think the arguments that Senator Sherry put forward show the utter thinness and poverty of the Labor Party position. The Labor Party position is essentially that workers should not have choice in relation to superannuation: the workers' funds should be directed into particular funds whether those funds are performing well or poorly.
—They are performing.
—Senator Sherry, the reality, as you know, is that there is a variety of performances.
—They're very happy with them.
—No-one complains about a well performing fund, but members whose superannuation is tied up in a poorly performing fund have a lot of reason to complain. In fact, unless this Senate can progress this debate—as the awareness of superannuation, the importance of superannuation, moves on—a lot of people will be asking why they are not allowed to direct contributions to funds of their particular choice. That would be a very valid question, and until this bill goes through the answer will be: because the Senate—and the Labor Party in particular—was opposed to giving them choice. 
—No, giving the employer the choice. 
—Senator O'Brien shows his complete lack of appreciation of this issue. Senator O'Brien is the spokesperson, as Senator Sherry is, for particular interests, but the fact of the matter is the interests which are important in this debate are employee interests.
Honourable senators—Hear, hear!
—Employee interests are the interests here, and the trade union ALP does not speak for employee interests, I might say. What the trade union ALP speaks for is, of course, union interests. The Labor Party's approach to this is extremely unfortunate, to be quite frank. We can apparently allow an individual to choose his employment, to determine where his investments are, whether to purchase a house or not, whether he gets married or not and indeed to determine whether he wishes to have children or not and take on huge commitments. But, according to the Labor Party, we cannot allow that employee to choose where his superannuation contribution should go. That is the patronising nonsense that the Labor Party puts forward.
This debate will continue for a long period of time, but I point out to the Labor Party that they will be constantly reminded when there are complaints from employees about poorly performing funds and how their contributions continue to be directed to those funds. Letters will be sent to Senator Sherry, who will be kind enough to take particular responsibility for what has happened in this case. Senator Sherry, I point out to you that, in your speech, you showed no understanding of what had been proposed. What you did today will come back to haunt you and the Labor Party.
Let me now turn to the Democrats' position. It is true that we have had a very long period of discussion with the Democrats. It is true that those discussions were difficult, but we stayed at the table and we kept working at it. I think we came to a very good result— an excellent result—a result which would be welcomed by the industry, employees and, I believe, the Australian community. It is a great shame that, because of an issue which is quite separate from choice of funds, the Democrats find themselves unable to proceed to implement an agreement which they were a party to, which they worked on as hard as we did and which developed, I believe, a very satisfactory model for choice in order to move this debate further forward. I think it is a great pity that this has happened, to be quite frank.
I receive a lot of letters in relation to superannuation, but I cannot recall a letter that I have received from a same sex couple telling me that an individual, because of the death of his or her partner, has not been able to access dependency arrangements under superannuation. I think Senator Greig should carefully reflect on that. I do not know whether Senator Greig has fully appreciated that. There are a lot of issues in superannuation, Senator Greig, but I have to point out to you that this is an issue of how an individual is affected. As I said, I cannot recall a letter—there may have been one, but I cannot recall a letter. I receive letters about a whole host of issues. Senator Greig, as a result of your own interest in this matter, I have briefed you on it to try to indicate to you how the current arrangements work. It seems to me that you have failed to appreciate how the current arrangements work and you have taken this particular step which has inclined your colleagues to act in this particular manner. It is not a light matter that has occurred.
This is a very important policy; I believe that this is a very important issue in superannuation. It provides the freedom and the choice that individuals are quite entitled to exercise in relation to where their superannuation contributions go. I believe that you do not understand how the superannuation system currently works, and I think that is a great pity. The fact of the matter is that you have persuaded your colleagues, despite all the efforts and all the work that went into this to produce what I believe is an excellent model which will benefit the workers of Australia—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Senator Conroy and Senator Sherry are having a little giggle over there. As the debate goes on in the years to come, Senators, and people complain that their contributions were stuck in particular funds—the contributions that they were saving for their retirement—when they did not have the freedom to direct those contributions into the areas that they wanted, we will say that, in this important debate, it was Senator Sherry and Senator Conroy who were laughing and giggling in the front row. It is pathetic. It shows, frankly, the paucity of the Labor Party position. It shows you the authoritarian nature of the Labor Party. The one thing that the Labor Party hates is choice. Whatever public policy you get into, the one thing that the Labor Party cannot take is choice. This is another example where the Labor Party has shown its true colours. 
I think it is a great pity that the Democrats have not felt that they are able to proceed with an agreement which we negotiated in good faith. I think the model which we produced, after many tortuous hours, was a good model. It was good for employers, it was good for employees and it was good for the industry. It had a lot of advantages; it set up arrangements for proper consultation and monitoring; it made sure that there was an education program that would properly inform employees. It achieved all those things and it provided time for the scheme to be brought in so that employers, employees and the industry would have time to adjust. But that has not eventuated. I have to say that, to me, that is a great pity, because this was an opportunity for the Senate to grasp an important public policy which could have an important effect on superannuation for the good of this nation. It happened for reasons which I think have been explained and, as I said, it is a great pity.
I understand that Senator Allison and I negotiated in good faith. I did not doubt the commitment of Senator Allison. It is true that Senator Allison has been unequivocal about this issue. Nonetheless, I think we went to the table in good faith, we negotiated in good faith, we reached an agreement in good faith and, for reasons which have now transpired, this agreement now cannot be put into effect. To me, that is a great pity, to be quite frank. It is a great pity not because of the effort that people might feel is wasted, but it is a great pity for Australian employees.
I hope that in a comparatively short period of time we will be able to move forward on this issue. I think that the model that has been established is the way to move forward. Every party has to examine its own conscience on this and every senator has to examine his or her own conscience. A very bad decision has been made, in my view—not based on the facts, not based on how superannuation in the vast majority of schemes works, but based on an ideological view that was going to be proceeded with regardless of the facts of the matter. As I said, this model would have provided real choice for employees.
Senator Sherry got up and said what a dangerous thing this was. I was in Western Australia recently, where they have choice and it works extremely well. It is not an issue with employees—they like it—and it is not an issue with employers. It works.
—Quote some evidence, Rod.
—You have not been over there, Senator Sherry—you have been thinking too much about the surcharge. You have never been able to get your mind off the surcharge. Let me tell you: it works well. One of the options that is available in that scheme is unlimited choice—exactly one of the options which is available in the scheme which we have put before this chamber.
What has happened here today is a disappointment. Those senators in the Labor Party were always predictable on this. The Labor Party never came to the table with any sign that they were prepared to think constructively. The Labor Party's position is: `We tell you, the employee, where to put your money, and don't you dare protest.' That is exactly what the Labor Party's position is. That is the contempt with which the Labor Party continue to treat workers. That is your position and it is a disgraceful position, in my view. Frankly, Senator Sherry, the Labor Party, Mr Simon Crean and Mr Kelvin Thomson will find out that a lot of people in the coming months and years will be extremely unhappy as a result of this decision that the Labor Party have made. 
I have been through the actions of the Democrats. Again, Senator Greig, I am very happy to take you through exactly what happens in this area, and that would explain to you why I do not receive letters on this issue about people who are adversely affected. What have you achieved? You have prevented large numbers of Australian workers having the right to determine where their contributions go—that is what you have achieved. Senator, if you look at how superannuation works for the vast majority of funds, I do not believe that the concerns that you have are at all justified.
The government will continue to want to progress choice in superannuation. We are always open to negotiation and discussion. We have given up on the Labor Party. The Labor Party has no policy.
—You won't even talk to us.
—What is the Labor Party's policy on superannuation? `Oh, we'll have a review after the election.' Five years of effort and they came up with this brilliant policy: `We'll have a review after the election.' What a truly pathetic effort; and Senator Sherry, because you spend so much of your time on superannuation, you must bear a heavy responsibility for that. I conclude the debate, but I make the point once again that this government will certainly continue to pursue the policy of choice in the interests of Australian workers.
—I seek leave to make a few short remarks.
Leave not granted.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHOICE OF SUPERANNUATION FUNDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2001-08-08,"—I seek leave to make a short remark.
Leave granted. 
—I thank the senators for the opportunity to make a brief remark. I realise that it is not the usual protocol to speak after the minister has spoken, but I did not give a speech in the second reading debate. Also, in his concluding remarks the minister mentioned me several times and threw several rhetorical questions at me which I felt ought to be replied to. The key question that the minister asks is: what have I achieved? Of course, the assumption in that is that I personally, as an individual, am responsible for this bill dying. That is not true. Every single Democrat senator is fully behind the notion that we fully recognise gay and lesbian people as fully human. It is not a fringe issue for us, it is not an eleventh-hour issue for us: we are deadly serious about this. What I hope I have achieved in part, through my advocacy on this issue, is that you might actually take it seriously.
The other thing I have achieved is that I have proved that the coalition is hostile to the recognition of same sex relationships. When I had a debate with Senator Sherry in the discussion on the superannuation of MPs, I made the claim that the coalition was hostile to the recognition of same sex relationships. There was a chorus of outcry from the coalition. I particularly remember Senator Jeannie Ferris calling out, `That's not true.' Well, hello. A bill valued at $10 trillion over the next few decades is about to die because the coalition will not recognise the humanity of gay and lesbian people and the justice inherent in recognising same sex relationships. All we are talking about here is allowing a lesbian or gay person in a relationship to unambiguously leave their superannuation to their partner, to have the right to a death benefit to their partner or to have the right to a reversionary pension where that applies. The coalition is not prepared to demonstrate that basic element of humanity, to the point where it would rather sink a bill. Do not blame the Democrats or me for allowing a bill—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of clarification. I do not wish to interrupt the debate. What relevance have the statements being made by either the minister or Senator Greig? I cannot find in this bill any reference whatsoever to homosexual couples. Am I right or am I wrong? Where in this piece of legislation is the issue that Senator Kemp raised or the one to which Senator Greig is responding?
 (Senator Watson)—The minister concluded the debate. Senator Greig sought leave of the Senate to make some short comments. The Senate provided him with that opportunity and he was speaking to it. The question of relevance is the point of order that I presume you were raising. I believe that relevance is important because it would appear that the matter is going to be voted down at the second reading. The questions of the debates between the various parties with the minister had been raised during the discussion and I presume that they are the matters that Senator Greig is referring to. To that extent, in terms of the debates—and the passage or non-passage of the bill—I think they are relevant. 
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I will conclude, because I realise that I asked to speak only for a short time. If Senator Kemp so desperately wants this legislation, he has our support. All he needs to do is concede the point on recognising same sex relationships. I am not delaying or frustrating this legislation, nor is Senator Allison and nor are the Democrats as a whole. The coalition is doing so as it digs in on bigotry and intolerance. All it has to do is let go of that, as most states have already done, and the bill will pass.
Question put:
That this bill be now read a second time.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHOICE OF SUPERANNUATION FUNDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-08-08,"—It is not my intention to speak at length on this superannuation legislation, because the core issue, if I can refer to that, is relatively simple, and also because we have had a great deal of debate about superannuation matters, not just today but during this week, with seven bills before the Senate. The four bills we are dealing with go to closing the existing Public Service superannuation funds to new entrants. Further, they go to effectively reducing the level of employer contribution into public sector superannuation funds from—depending on individual circumstances—an average of about 17 per cent to 18 per cent employer contribution down to the superannuation guarantee, which is currently eight per cent and is going up to nine per cent next year. That is the impact of the legislation that the Senate is considering. 
One interesting point I note is that it is not to apply to all federal government employees. There is a class of employees that has been excluded from the legislation we are considering and that is employees who are in the employment of the military. The military have two currently operating superannuation funds and they have been excluded. No explanation has been given about why the military have been excluded from the current legislation that the government has put forward. Another group of employees—people employed in universities and CAEs, which are substantially funded by the Commonwealth—have also not been included in the legislation we are considering.
There is one important reason why the Labor Party will not be supporting this legislation. In the lead-up to the 1996 election, the Liberal Party issued a policy manifesto that included a range of commitments, a number of which are quite infamous now. The commitment with respect to the GST is well known. There was also a commitment with respect to the surcharge tax—that there would be no increase in taxes, no increase in existing taxes. That promise disappeared as well.
Also, the Liberal-National Party made an ironclad commitment that they would not reduce or change existing Public Service superannuation arrangements, including contribution levels. In this case the Prime Minister went one step further: the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, issued a letter, personally signed, to every public servant in Australia. In that personally signed letter, which I have tabled in previous debates in this chamber, the Prime Minister said that he would not change and reduce the contribution levels into public sector superannuation not just for existing employees but also for prospective employees, for future employees. There could be no clearer commitment given by the Prime Minister of the country than to send a personally signed letter to every public servant in the country giving them that assurance. That is a very significant step further than a published election policy manifesto.
So the Prime Minister entered into that commitment—very clear—and we intend to hold the Prime Minister to that promise that he made in that personally signed letter that he circulated that he would not seek to change the prospective superannuation arrangements of federal public servants in this country. He signed the letter. I suppose that if the Labor Party wanted to create a level of political mayhem we could let the legislation pass and draw the attention of the public servants to this correspondence from Mr Howard. What happens to the standing of a Prime Minister when he personally signs a letter giving an undertaking to public servants and then seeks to break it? Of course, he did not seek to break it this year; he sought to break it back in 1998. This legislation we are dealing with is almost three years old and the government has refused to bring it to a concluding vote.
We were warned—it touched on a threat—by Senator Kemp earlier about our attitude to so-called choice in respect of superannuation. If the Prime Minister wants to make an issue of this in the election, let him. We will produce the personally signed letter by Mr Howard promising not to do it. So if he wants to make it an issue, let him do that, because there can be no greater reduction of the credibility of the political leader of the country when he has personally signed a letter to public servants and then attempts to break that commitment two years later, and here we are three years after the original introduction of the legislation finally bringing it to a vote. The Labor Party's position on this is very simple: we will hold the Prime Minister to that personally signed commitment not to reduce the contributions into superannuation for public servants. We are going to hold him to that commitment. As far as I can recall, this is the only occasion in recent Australian political history when the Prime Minister of the day has sent a personally signed letter to such a significant number of Australians. We intend to hold him to that promise and we will be voting against the second reading of the package of four bills that go to this issue. 
The bills also relate to the debate we have just had in relation to so-called choice. Effectively, with the ending of the current public sector superannuation funds for new entrants, the market would then be totally deregulated and new public servants would have a choice, so-called, imposed on them. The Labor Party makes no apologies for having indicated three years ago that we would vote against that legislation then. We have held it up for three years—we make no apologies for that—and the government has finally decided to bring it to a vote. I might say that I believe the bills will be defeated, but certainly those new entrants to the Public Service in the last three years do enjoy superannuation entitlements that were promised by the Prime Minister, and the Labor Party has held him to that promise.
What is it about this government with respect to superannuation? Why do they dislike superannuation so much? We had an indication from one of the Prime Minister's advisers, a Mr Morris, in a public forum that was reported in this week's Financial Review that the government object to the compulsory nature of superannuation. In Australia up until the late 1980s we had a superannuation system that was largely for privileged or wealthier Australians. Australians who were on lower and middle incomes, who worked in industries such as hospitality, retail and other sectors of the economy, had no superannuation whatsoever. The Labor Party is rightly proud of its extension of superannuation to all employees.
What is it about this government that continually wants to reduce superannuation in a whole range of areas? We have had a long debate on two occasions this week fixing up the surcharge mess. We have had two bills, Nos 15 and 16, in respect of the so-called surcharge, fixing up problems, problems that not just the Labor Party—not just I—warned the government about time and time again over the last four years. The impact of the surcharge tax is to reduce the final account balance of many Australians' superannuation. In the last financial year it reduced the account balances by $570 million. That is another $570 million taken by this government out of the retirement savings of Australians. That is the impact of it. The Liberal-National Party failed to contribute the co-contribution savings to superannuation. It repackaged it as a savings rebate and that lasted for approximately six months. That was supposedly to encourage savings. Again, that should have gone to the superannuation system.
This government presented a bill last year, which was fortunately defeated, to reduce compensation in the event of theft and fraud in respect of superannuation from 100 per cent to 80 per cent. They wanted to reduce superannuation protections! We have just had a debate about so-called choice and all the problems that that would have led to. What is it about this government when it comes to superannuation? I can only reasonably conclude that they have an ideological objection to compulsorily preparing for the ageing population. It is not as though the current age pension is not compulsorily funded through the tax system. This is very necessary because history has shown that, throughout the entire world, people will not save voluntarily for their retirement. They just will not do it and, if they do do it, they start too late and they do not save sufficiently.
This is the importance of Australia's approach to preparing for the ageing population: a decent age pension funded from the budget with superannuation built on top of that. This is a model widely admired throughout the world. We have delegations coming regularly to Australia—I have met some of them—from Europe, from China recently and from the United States, for example, who come to look at what we have done. What we have done is not perfect—there are still areas and issues that need to be resolved—but we have put in place a system that is far better developed than that of any comparable advanced economy. It is a system to provide a decent, secure retirement income for all Australians. At the moment, one in 10 Australians is over the age of 65; by the year 2025, one in four Australians will be over the age of 65. It is not fair and reasonable to put a question mark over the retirement income of Australians. It is only a government with true vision that can actually start to prepare Australia for the ageing population, as the Labor Party did in the late 1980s with the introduction of compulsory superannuation. 
The Prime Minister discovered the issue of the ageing population in a speech a week or two ago. He has since tried to argue that the GST was necessary. Interestingly, countries around the world with VATs or GSTs have increased the rate considerably to help pay for the ageing population. They are being hit with this problem now. Australia will be hit with this problem in 20 to 25 years. Yet the Prime Minister denies that they are going to increase the rate of the GST. Well, we will see. 
There is also clear evidence that the Prime Minister has no interest in building superannuation savings. How are we going to deal with the ageing population? I would suggest that the Liberal-National Party has only one other way of dealing with this issue, and that will be to increase the pension age. Some countries have already started doing that. That is what you have to do if you have insufficient superannuation savings—the inadequate private provision of retirement income. That is not fair or reasonable either, but inevitably that is where this government is leading us. 
These bills represent yet another attack on the accumulation of superannuation savings in this country. It is yet another attempt to reduce these savings. For those reasons, and for the reasons outlined earlier in relation to the personal commitment and the signed letter given by the Prime Minister, the Labor Party will not be supporting these bills and we will be voting against the second reading.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION (COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYMENT) REPEAL AND AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2001-08-08,"—I am not on the list to speak—Senator Allison, I think, is the next one—but rather than having to call a quorum I will take this opportunity to raise a matter which should be discussed and no doubt will be discussed tomorrow. This group of measures before us deals with questions of superannuation for Commonwealth employees. There are other bills coming forward that will deal with members of parliament. Since the matter was addressed briefly by Senator Kemp and responded to by Senator Greig, I wanted in this second reading debate to advert to a raft of amendments that will be moved by the Democrats and to have an in-principle look at those.
One proposal being put forward by Senator Greig for the Democrats is to have superannuation death benefits paid to a homosexual partner living with the member of the superannuation fund. I put to the chamber: what about all those people living together— those maiden aunts, for example—one of whom is employed and is a member of a superannuation fund and dies? There is no provision in the Democrat proposal for her sister, who is doing an enormous amount of good in the community. No, there is nothing for her—unless she is having sex with her sister! If ever I have seen sex discrimination, this is it. I suggest that the Democrats come and defend that, if they can. They have got it all the wrong way around. I believe that we should seriously have a look at this question and no doubt we will during the committee stage tomorrow.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION (COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYMENT) REPEAL AND AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2001-08-08,"—I rise very briefly in this matter to declare an interest. I am absolutely confident that I can rely on Senator Sherry to represent my interests as a member of the opposition in this matter. I have been informed that the Superannuation Legislation (Commonwealth Employment) Repeal and Amendment Bill 1998 validates the previous payment by current members of parliaments of partial transfer value into our superannuation scheme. In 1995, I was inadvertently allowed to pay to the Commonwealth a partial transfer of my previous superannuation arrangements, and I wish to declare that interest.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2001-08-08,"—Given the hour, I will keep my comments very brief. I thank honourable senators for their contribution to this debate. It is clear that senators have made up their mind in relation to this legislation. We believe that the reforms in these proposals are worthy of support. Unfortunately, it looks as though they will be voted down. We as a government will seek to pursue them on another occasion. The importance of superannuation reform is in the forefront of a lot of people's minds. There is the need for this legislation to be carried. It is unfortunate that the Labor Party and the Democrats will combine to break down these important proposals.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2001-08-08," asked the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 29 May 2001:
(1)	What is the definition of `item' as used in the report. For example, when a URL (eg. http://www.somewhere.com.au/page/) displays a single Web page containing 10 prohibited images on that one Web page, is this counted as 1 item, 10 items or 11 items.
(2)	Given that the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) complaint form states `Note: You can complain about only one item of Internet content in each complaint form', why do the figures show that 67 items were investigated for 6 complaints about prohibited content hosted in Australia.
(3)	What is the reason for the large difference in average number of prohibited items found per complaint about Australian-hosted content (67 items from 6 complaints) as compared to those about overseas hosted content (136 items from 133 complaints).
(4)	In relation to the 6 of 221 complaints investigated by the ABA that resulted in finding 67 items of prohibited content hosted in Australia: (a) did the ABA issue 67 separate final takedown notices, with each particular final takedown notice notifying of only one item of content; if not: (i) how many final takedown notices were issued, and (ii) how many items of prohibited content were notified in each of the final takedown notices; (b) (i) how many Internet content hosts were issued with a final takedown notice, and (ii) how many Internet content hosts were issued with more than one final takedown notice; and (c) for each of the 6 complaints that resulted in a finding of prohibited content hosted in Australia, how many final takedown notices were issued regarding: (i) items classified `R' (and how many items), (ii) items classified `X' (and how many items), and (iii) items classified `RC' (and how many items).
(5)	In relation to the 45 items of `Australian-hosted serious Internet content' that the ABA referred to the relevant state or territory police service: (a) how many items were found on Australian-hosted World Wide Web sites (excluding Web-based interfaces to Usenet newsgroups); (b) how many items were found in Usenet newsgroups (including Web-based interfaces to Usenet newsgroups); and (c) how many items were found elsewhere (ie. `other files that can be downloaded from an archive or library').
(6)	Why did the ABA report in an answer to questions on notice to the Senate Estimates Committee (30 November 2000) that there were 91 items referred to state or territory police from 1 January to the end of November, while the official report states 89 items from 1 January to the end of December.
(7)	In relation to the 89 items referred to state or territory police, and the 156 items referred to the Australian Federal Police, in the full year, has the Minister inquired about the prosecution rate of offenders and received information from police that would support claims that the Internet has been made safer; if so, how many prosecutions have commenced in Australia.
(8)	In relation to the ABA's discretion to defer action about prohibited content or potential prohibited content at the request of police in order to avoid prejudicing a criminal investigation: (a) during the period July to December 2000, how many Australian-hosted items were the subject of deferral of action by the ABA at the request of police; (b) does the number of completed investigations include instances where the ABA's investigation of content is complete but action (eg. issue of a takedown notice) has been deferred by the ABA at the request of police; if so, in relation to completed investigations as at 31 December 2000, how many Australian-hosted items had not been the subject of a final takedown notice due to deferral; and (c) of the 15 incomplete investigations as at 31 December 2000: (i) how many concern Australian-hosted content and how many of the latter were incomplete due to deferral by the ABA at the request of police, and (ii) how many Australian-hosted items were involved.
(9)	In relation to the statement in the report that: `The Government considered it a logical step to legislate to extend the existing classification system for film, television and other media to the Internet. This system was established to provide guidance to the community, and particularly to concerned parents, on the suitability or otherwise of content. The classifications are based on contemporary community values and are well understood and accepted by the community', what system is in place to enable members of the public to receive guidance on the suitability or otherwise of Internet content, that is, to find out the classification that has been given by the ABA or the Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC) to particular Internet content. 
(10)	During the 12 months, January to December 2000: (a) how many complaints and/or investigations were initiated by the ABA itself and/or its staff; (b) how many complaints were initiated by government agencies (other than the ABA); (c) how many complaints were initiated by members of Parliament; and (d) how many complaints were initiated by persons who are not Australian residents.
(11)	During the six months, July to December 2000, how many different individuals or organisations initiated the 290 complaints.
(12)	What is the total cost for the 2000 calendar year of the Internet regulatory activities of the ABA and the community activities of NetAlert.
(13)	How many items of Internet content were referred to OFLC for the year; and (b) what was the total amount of fees levied by OFLC for classification services for: (i) Australian-hosted content, and (ii) content hosted overseas.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Internet Content</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,27,1,question
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2001-08-08,"—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
(1)	In the second Six Month Report for July to December 2000, `item' means Internet content viewed as a single page using a standard browser, or a single Usenet newsgroup message or `posting' as viewed by a standard newsreader. A page containing 10 images is counted as one item.
(2)	The ABA's online complaint form is based on international practice, adapted to take account of the particular requirements of the Australian law. The ABA asks complainants to lodge a separate complaint for each item of content. In this context, `item' means a single page of World Wide Web content, a Usenet newsgroup, or a single posting to a newsgroup. 
In some instances the simple equation between complaint and item is not easily made. For example, where a complaint relates to an entire newsgroup, rather than a single posting on it, the ABA investigates a sample of the postings contained in the newsgroup, asks the Classification Board to classify the content concerned and takes appropriate action according to the classification. For the purpose of reporting, each of the postings sampled is then counted as an item in the statistics. Similarly, the ABA may investigate a sample of the content on a World Wide Web site about which a person has complained, and each page would be counted as an item in the statistics. However, investigations relating to complaints about World Wide Web content are less likely to involve more than one item of content, as complaints relating to such content generally pertain to a specific page of content.
(3)	Three of the six complaints about Australian hosted content related to Internet content in Usenet newsgroups hosted on Australian servers. As noted above, investigations relating to content hosted in Usenet newsgroups may involve two or more items of content.
All complaints about content hosted outside Australia related to World Wide Web content. A complaint about World Wide Web content is likely to involve only one item of content.
(4)	(a)	When the ABA investigates a complaint about Internet content that is hosted in Australia, and is satisfied that the content concerned is prohibited content, one final take-down notice is issued to the relevant Internet content host. 
In the period 1 July to 31 December 2000, the ABA issued six final take-down notices, related to 1, 15, 10, 10, 1 and 27 items of content respectively. 
	(b)	(i)	5
		(ii)	1
	(c)	The following table shows the number of notices issued per complaint and the number of items classified R, X or RC covered by each notice.

(5)	(a)	Thirty-six per cent of items referred to State and Territory police services were items hosted on World Wide Web sites.
	(b)	Sixty-four per cent of items referred to State and Territory police services were items from Usenet newsgroups hosted in Australia.
	(c)	None of the items referred to State and Territory police services were items hosted in other formats.
(6)	The discrepancy appears to relate to misclassification and/or double-counting of some items in the ABA's complaint database at the time the November 2000 statistic was calculated. The complaint data are regularly reviewed for accuracy and the inaccuracy was corrected prior to calculation of the December 2000 statistic. It is anticipated that such inaccuracies will be eliminated when the interim, prototype complaint management system currently in use is replaced as part of the upgrading of the ABA's information management infrastructure, scheduled to be complete by the end of June 2002.
(7)	Law enforcement investigations relating to Internet content that the ABA has referred to a State or Territory police service are matters to be determined by the relevant agency in question. 
The issue of feedback on content referred to the Australian Federal Police (AFP) will be addressed in a new service level agreement to be negotiated between the ABA and the AFP, replacing the current Memorandum of Understanding between the two organisations. As part of the new agreement, the ABA will receive regular reports on action taken in relation to matters it has referred to the AFP. Where appropriate, the ABA will report on the feedback it receives.
(8)	(a)	Nil.
	(b)	No; Nil.
	(c)	(i)	1; Nil.
		(ii)	1
(9)	In determining the definition of prohibited content under Schedule 5, the Government had the option of applying existing classification guidelines or creating new guidelines, which would take time and may create confusion and uncertainty, not only for users and providers of online content, but also the broader community and the Internet industry. In this context the Government chose to apply the existing classification system for films and computer games.
The Guidelines for the Classification of Films and Videotapes and the Guidelines for the Classification of Computer Games are developed by the Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC) in consultation with the community and are approved by Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers with Censorship responsibilities. The guidelines, which are reviewed regularly, are readily available from the OFLC and set out in detail the nature of the content in each of the classification categories (eg R, X).
Unlike traditional media, where Australia can largely control the import and distribution of material refused classification or subject to legal restrictions, the Internet presents a more complicated medium. Publishing information about the classification of prohibited online content may entail the provision of information that would enable members of the public to access that prohibited content, thereby undermining the policy intent of the scheme.
(1)	(a) The ABA initiated 33 investigations during the period 1 January - 31 December 2000. All 33 investigations were initiated following receipt of information which could not be formally considered to be a complaint (because the person was not entitled to make a complaint or the complaint did not contain all the required information), but which the ABA considered warranted investigation due to the apparent serious nature of the content concerned. 
Thirteen investigations were initiated as a result of information received from persons who were not Australian residents, mainly from overseas complaint hotlines.  The remaining 20 investigations were initiated after receipt of anonymous complaints. The ABA requires complainants to provide their name and contact details when lodging a complaint and it is the ABA's policy to investigate an anonymous complaint only where the complaint appears to relate to child pornography or similarly serious content. 
(b) No complainants identified themselves as government agencies.
(c) Seven complainants identified themselves as members of Parliament.
(d) Twenty-nine complaints were received from persons who identified themselves as not being Australian residents. As noted above, the ABA initiated investigations in relation to 13 of these complaints, due to the apparent serious nature of the content concerned. No further action was taken in relation to the remaining 16 complaints, as they appeared to be outside the scope of the co-regulatory scheme.
(11)	The ABA received complaints from a broad range of members of the community who encountered online content about which they had concerns. Some 132 different individuals lodged complaints during the period 1 July to 31 December 2000, excluding investigations initiated by the ABA. 
(12)	The ABA's functions in relation to Internet content regulation are specified in Schedule 5 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 and include the following:
·	investigating complaints about Internet content;
·	registering and monitoring compliance with codes of practice for the Internet industry;
·	advising and assisting families about supervision and control of children's access to Internet content;
·	conducting and/or co-ordinating community education programs about Internet content and usage;
·	conducting and/or commissioning research into issues relating to Internet content and usage;
·	liaising with relevant overseas regulators and other bodies in relation to co-operative arrangements for regulation of the Internet; and
·	informing itself and advising the Minister and developments and trends in the Internet industry.
Detailed information about the performance of these functions is set out in reports tabled by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts on 5 September 2000 and 19 April 2001.
For the calendar year 2000, the costs of these activities were as follows:
Administration costs (1), $294,825
Salary and superannuation (2), $323,494
Total (3), $616,319
Notes:
1. Administration costs relate to the activities of the Online Services Content Regulation Section and relevant costs incurred by the Director of Policy and Content Regulation Branch and Deputy Chairman.
2. Salary and superannuation costs relate to the staff of the Online Services Content Regulation Section only.
3. The following items are not included:
other direct labour costs such as employer superannuation contributions, long service leave and separation payments;
indirect labour costs;
corporate overheads; 
indirect administration costs; and
