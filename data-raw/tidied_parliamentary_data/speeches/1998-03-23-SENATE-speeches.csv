"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-03-23,"—This package of legislation is one of the most important to come before this parliament in the taxation area during the period of the Howard government. It is important for two distinct and clear reasons. Firstly, it is important because the measures that it contains are necessary to improve the equity of the tax system—however, I acknowledge that they are vehemently opposed by many in the tax and legal professions—and, secondly, it is especially important because the process leading to this debate today is indicative of the approach of the government in dealing with tax avoidance.
On the subject of tax avoidance, the government has squibbed the challenge. The government has chosen not to come down as heavily on tax avoidance as Labor had originally proposed. This is despite the fact that the Treasurer has repeatedly told the parliament that he is tough on tax avoidance. It is my intention to move at the conclusion of my remarks an amendment to the second reading motion on the  Taxation Laws Amendment (Trust Loss and Other Deductions) Bill 1997 
 which has been distributed in the chamber and deals specifically with this point: that the government has caved in to its trust-owning backbenchers on the issue of these bills. On 20 June 1996, on page 2423 of Hansard, when promising to be tough on tax avoidance, the Treasurer said:
I make it clear on behalf of this government that where anomalies and exemptions are being unfairly exploited they will be addressed.
On 2 September last year he stated:
The government takes such measures as are required to prevent legitimate taxation liabilities being avoided.
Furthermore, the rhetorical charade continued with Mr Costello saying on 2 October last year:
This government is serious about making sure that corporations—and, indeed, individuals—pay their fair share of tax.
Despite these brave words and many others of the Treasurer, the legislation before us has an extraordinary, possibly unprecedented gestation period for tax avoidance legislation. Labor recognised a significant problem and announced a wide-ranging package to deal with the abuse of trust losses in the 1995 budget. This announcement was made on 9 May 1995, almost three years ago. We duly announced legislation and introduced it into the parliament in 1995. The opposition—now the government—sent the legislation to a Senate committee and achieved its objective of delaying consideration of the legislation by the Senate until the election intervened. No doubt there were some in the coalition who hoped that the issue would be dropped after the election.
The issue has not been dropped completely but it has been fumbled repeatedly over the last 22 months. After a deafening silence for the first five months of the government on the issue, we saw an announcement in the 1996 budget which affirmed that the government would pursue the issue but with modifications—beware the modifications. Six months later, draft legislation was released. Then a further three months later, a subsequent announcement was made in the 1997 budget which contained further changes from the draft legislation released in February. It then 
 took a further five months for this legislation to be presented to the House. Now here we are, a further five months later, finally debating what is essentially a non-controversial measure between the government and the opposition.
Ironically, it was introduced in the House at the end of the last two-week sitting period and the government immediately said that they wished to have quick passage into the Senate. The opposition obliged with swift passage through the House and this legislation has sat in the Senate for an unnecessary further three months because the government refused to put it through last year, even though we indicated that this could be achieved.
The process leading up to this debate has been ridiculously delayed. The opposition sympathises with the business community's anger at this delay. There is only one reason for it—that is, the procrastination of the government.
I speak today in the context of the broader agenda of tax reform. The government is currently undertaking a secret bureaucratic exercise, crunching the numbers to develop various options for tax reform. It has repeatedly refused our invitation to make the information public so that the people of Australia can be truly informed as to what the options are. Yet the government pretends that Labor is against reform. Nothing could be further from the truth.
The only basic matter of principle that Labor has ruled out is the adoption of a GST. This has infuriated the government because, as we have always known, the implementation of a goods and services tax is the only real objective of the tax reform exercise which they are undertaking.
We have heard the Treasurer repeatedly in the parliament and in public debate carefully saying that all tax options are on the table and that everything will be considered by the government. Whilst this rhetoric is obviously designed to appease interested stakeholders such as ACOSS, we know that the government has already decided what it wants to do and is simply stringing along welfare sector participants to try to get some chimera of 
 consensus in the proposals it will release. We know as well that all of the options that it has committed its task force to come up with involve a GST—none of them does not.
The time has now come for the government to release the various options that have been generated by the tax reform task force. This would enable a truly informed debate on the full range of options that have been presented to the government. Instead, we are getting a constant stonewalling from the government on even the most basic details of what they propose. They will not even admit that they are planning a GST as the centrepiece of their package.
It is important that the full options generated by the bureaucrats be released, because that will mean that the public will be able to evaluate the policies announced by the government in the context of which options were possible. The strategy of the government is obviously to present its own package as late as possible in the electoral cycle to not allow more than rudimentary scrutiny—in other words, to ambush the electors of Australia with a predigested package on a take it or leave it basis.
Why would any government pursue such a strategy unless it was concerned that debate and analysis of its policies would show them to be seriously flawed? Exactly what is the government afraid of? I wonder what the welfare sector thinks about this type of approach. I wonder what the churches think about this type of approach.
We are constantly being told that the tax system is broken, that it is in crisis and that it must be remade. The opposition has taken the responsible position of agreeing that the tax system needs constant repair and some occasional renovation. It is not fundamentally broken, but all sensible options outside of a GST can be looked at. Accordingly, we have not attempted to derail the reform task force procedure at all. We have not availed ourselves of the many opportunities that could have been taken to beat up taxation related issues, nor have we sought to use the procedures of the parliament to delay or frustrate important tax matters which have arisen. By contrast, the government has been delaying 
 important reforms like the trust loss measure before us today, because it cannot control its backbench.
I provide some examples to buttress the point that I have just made. Firstly, the resolution of the half-decade-long problem concerning the impact of the petroleum resource rent tax on Victoria was dealt with by the shadow Treasurer in conjunction with the Treasurer as it should have been—on a completely apolitical basis. The necessary legislation was dealt with swiftly in the national interest and no attempt was made to derail the settlement nor to misinform the public. The result was a successful outcome to a difficult public policy dilemma.
Secondly, in the aftermath of the Ha & Lim and Walter Hammond judgments an immediate fiscal crisis arose for the states and territories. Around one-sixth of the revenue base of these governments was eliminated, and the prospect of gigantic repayments of past tax collections loomed. Quite literally, the financial solvency of the states was on the line. Here, surely, was a heaven-sent opportunity for politics to override good governance and for the opposition to wreak havoc. A huge tax rescue package—of around one per cent of GDP—was needed quickly to shore up confidence in the financial position of the states and territories. The opposition gave the legislation immediate passage through both houses of this parliament—because it was indisputably in the national interest to do so.
Indeed, I note in passing that the government so badly bungled the compensation payments issue arising from new safety net arrangements that the Queensland situation was solved only months after the original announcement. Again, federal Labor did not in any way undermine that process—even though there were significant opportunities for us to do so.
Furthermore, all of the other tax bills which have come before this parliament in the term of this government dealing with tax avoidance have been passed by the opposition. Unlike the coalition, Labor has been a constructive and honourable opposition in the area of taxation. Our record, I submit, is about as good a record on supporting clamping down 
 on tax avoidance as any opposition has had in recent decades at least. Contrast this with the various coalition oppositions over the past 13 years. These people opposed every decent taxation measure—capital gains tax, fringe benefits tax, proper taxation of foreign source income, improving the equity of retirement benefit taxation et cetera. Those opposite are the wreckers of decent tax reform, not Labor. We come to the tax reform debate with clean hands.
Having dealt with the history of these bills I turn now to the substance of the measures before us today. These bills will insert rules into the income tax law to limit the circumstances under which trusts can deduct current year and prior year losses and debt deductions. Labor supports such an approach without any reservations.
The reason for introducing these limitations is to ensure that the persons who bore the economic effect of the tax losses are the persons who obtain the tax benefits associated with recouping of those losses against other income. The public policy behind this approach is simple: people should not be able to avoid their proper tax liabilities by sheltering their income through the use of tax losses incurred by other taxpayers. This has long been accepted in the context of losses incurred by companies. In the case of companies,  losses can only be recouped if the company passes a majority underlying shareholding test or if the company passes the same business test. Bearing this in mind, the introduction of a regime to regulate the claiming of losses incurred by trusts is an important and overdue step in securing the direct tax base in Australia.
Obviously, the proposed rules that are to apply to trusts differ somewhat from the regime which applies to companies. However, this generally reflects the differing legal relationships which apply in the case of trusts rather than a fundamentally different approach to the question of the legitimacy of recoupment of losses.
However, the key issue now for these bills is not the differences between the treatment of companies and trusts but the treatment of family trusts under the Labor legislation and 
 the treatment in this legislative package. I borrow from the Treasurer's press release of 13 May this year. Press release No. 42 opens with the words:
On 10 February 1997, the Government released an exposure draft legislation on trust loss measures. After receiving comments and submissions, the Government has decided to modify the draft legislation to restrict its application.  The income injection test will not apply where entities and individuals within a family group inject income into a family trust with losses. This modification will have effect from 7.30 pm AEST 9 May 1995 . . .
These words sound innocent enough to someone not familiar with the very complex legislation before us today—but they represent a huge change in the effect of this legislation.
Under the original Labor legislation, the income injection rule did not apply to family trusts where a beneficiary of a loss trust introduced income into the trust to be offset against the losses. This concession was allowed because the beneficiary actually bore the economic effect of the loss as he or she was a beneficiary at the time when the losses were incurred. This is a perfectly appropriate concession.
However, where a family member—for example, a brother—who was not a beneficiary of the trust injected income into the trust to derive the tax benefit of the losses within the trust and then got the income tax back free, then these anti-avoidance provisions would apply to that scheme. For examples of these two separate situations I draw members' attention to page 171 of the explanatory memorandum for Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) of 1995, examples 3 and 4.
The rules under this legislation propose that any member of the family group as defined—which includes spouses, children, grandparents, nephews, nieces and their spouses—can inject income into any other family member's trust and thereby gain the benefits of the losses.
Clearly this is a huge change and is not one that the opposition is happy about. Senators could just imagine that the wealthy families of Australia, where many members of the broader family have significant assets, will be 
 able to traffic in trust losses between themselves, and hence be largely, if not completely, exempt from these new provisions.
Now that is not fair by any reasonable analysis. This change is simply dressed up as being a family friendly change but it is really a tax avoidance friendly change. That is one of the key reasons why we are moving the amendment to the second reading motion. There is no doubt Liberal Party backbench pressure has forced the Treasurer down this course.
The Prime Minister, speaking to Alan Jones on 14 August 1997, summed it up rather well when he said:
I mean, it is aggravating in the extreme if you are a PAYE tax battler, you're having your money taken out each week when you hear of people through all sorts of dodges, the cash economy as well as some people at the big end of town not paying their fair share.
I doubt that many PAYE tax battlers will be very happy to learn about this brand new tax dodge now available to the big end of town. Most families, of course, will not benefit from these new rorts for family trusts—because they do not have any connection with a family trust.
The Treasurer was asked about this matter on several occasions in the other place. He consistently dodged the questions, and refused to acknowledge that his changes had quite deliberately weakened the legislation and that this would be reflected in lower collections of tax.
When the Senate Economics Legislation Committee examined this legislation last year, naturally some of the committee members were interested to find out what the officials thought would have been the effect of the family trust loophole inserted by Mr Costello.
Evidence from very senior Taxation Office officials confirmed that this policy change will cost revenue, although it cannot be precisely quantified. So the pious position of the Treasurer has been proven to be completely bogus. He has deliberately weakened his own anti-avoidance proposals in the full knowledge that it will cost revenue. This leaves the opposition in a difficult position. Given the delay in this legislation, if we were 
 to try to amend the bills back to the previous position, it would involve a significantly retrospective measure which would be unreasonable on taxpayers. Accordingly, we consider on balance that it is better to support the legislation as it is and that is what we will be doing here today.
Some of this legislation has been delayed in an unprecedented fashion and has been watered down in some key respects for family trusts. The delay shows a lack of political will on behalf of the government. The watering-down shows a lack of fairness and commitment to treating all taxpayers equally. When both of these events occur, the opposition is entitled to ask why.
A cursory examination of the pecuniary interest register of ministers and parliamentary secretaries is very instructive in this regard. These publicly available documents show that 12 of the 30 ministers and six of the 11 parliamentary secretaries in the coalition government have family trusts. Suddenly the delay and the watering-down become readily understandable. The interests of almost half of the executive government are directly affected by the legislation. Clearly, the question of conflict of interest screams in this context.
I wish to place on record that the Treasurer does not have a family trust, nor is it illegal or wrong to have a family trust. But it is undoubtedly a conflict of interest for members of the government to consider such legislation in cabinet or in other processes of approval where they have such a clear conflict of interest. Did the relevant members of cabinet with family trusts exclude themselves from the consideration of these issues? With such a level of conflict of interest, how can this government fairly and properly evaluate revenue issues?
Was this the same reason why the Prime Minister promised, last year, to members of the government in the party room that trusts would be okay in the context of the tax reform process? He then took the extraordinary step of coming into the House to pretend that he really did have an open mind on the issue of trusts and tax reform. Nobody believed him because there was no evidence of 
 such commitment. In relation to the  Taxation Laws Amendment (Trust Loss and Other Deductions) Bill 1997  I move:
At the end of the motion, add "", but, while strongly supporting the passage of this bill, the Senate deplores the fact that, due to pressure from trust-owning members of the Coalition, it has been significantly watered down compared to the bill presented to the Senate by the then Labor government in 1995.""

—I raise a point of order, Madam Acting Deputy President. I want to draw your attention to page 144 of the Senate Standing Orders which says, in short, that any senator shall declare any relevant interest before they speak or vote on a matter in which that interest may have a bearing.
—I am sure senators are aware of that standing order Senator Brown.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (TRUST LOSS AND OTHER DEDUCTIONS) BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-03-23,"—Senator Brown stole my thunder because I was about to make a declaration, as I did at the public hearings, as I did with my minority report and as I now do. I declare that I am a trustee for a family trust. I also declare that the family trust has no trust losses and is therefore not affected by this bill.
Trusts are an extensively used legal mechanism for conducting family and business affairs and have long been so used in Australia. There are varying kinds of trusts. All trusts have characteristics which make them less transparent and often more complex than corporations. Tax benefits are derived from the use of trusts. These tax benefits have less transparency than corporations and make trusts a legitimate target for reformers. For some, trusts have a reputation that they can be used in a manner which is not conducive to good social conduct. However there is no proof that the majority of families and businesses that use trusts operate in this way or that they operate outside the law.
Successive federal and state governments have continued to support the use of trusts by Australians. There are those who take a very dim view of trusts. The eminent economist Professor John Quiggin, in an article in the 
Australian Financial Review, 16 April 1997, said:
There are almost no trusts in Australia established for legitimate purposes . . . The vast majority of trusts are set up with the primary purpose of avoiding tax that should be paid by high-income earners, thereby transferring the burden onto the rest of us. It is these trusts that are typically referred to as `legitimate family trusts'.
In the article, Professor Quiggin does not indicate what research informs him on the vast majority of trusts.
Those characteristics of trusts which distinguish trusts from corporate entities may be summarised as follows: that the beneficial and ultimate control of the trust is shielded from public disclosure; that the distribution of income in a trust is generally discretionary and can vary between the beneficiaries year by year; that the beneficiaries of trusts are shielded from the public eye, and that trusts may be used to maximise tax effectiveness and tax planning in ways which are not available to incorporated bodies.
In a trust arrangement there is a separation of the management powers of the trustee and the beneficial interests of the beneficiaries. The trustee holds the legal interest in the trust property and has a fiduciary obligation to the beneficiaries. Interestingly, legislation for the control of trustees is a matter for the states and territories and not for the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth largely derives its control over trusts from its taxation power. Depending on the trust concerned, however, the corporations power, the pensions power and the marriages power may also come into play. Nearly 28 per cent of small business proprietors surveyed use trusts. The executive editor of the Business Review Weekly, Robert Gottliebsen, described income splitting trusts as `the cornerstone of the structure of a large number of the country's very small businesses'.
I have had sight of the 1994-95 taxation statistics. The Treasurer would have relied on such statistics in making his trust losses announcement of 9 May 1995. Those statistics do not identify the number of family trusts or other trust types and do not distinguish between trust types. Partnerships and trusts are analysed together. Consequently, it is 
 difficult to draw conclusions on the nature of trustees, beneficiaries, income, losses and taxation from those statistics, not only on trusts generally but specifically by type of trust.
In 1997 the Australian Taxation Office still, somewhat surprisingly, did not have complete analytical data concerning trusts. They knew that in the 1995-96 tax year there were 372,000-odd trusts that lodged tax returns. On this number, it would be safe to assume that one million to two million Australians are therefore involved in trusts, which is a substantial number of Australians. In May 1997 I asked the ATO  a question concerning family trusts. As a result of my question, the ATO randomly selected 224 trusts out of 16,000 trusts in Sydney and Melbourne which used `family' in their title. They reported that there was an average of 2.49 beneficiaries per trust; 87 per cent of individual beneficiaries were adults; 87 per cent of beneficiaries were individuals; eight per cent were companies and five per cent were trusts. Of the 224 trusts, 109—or about half—had business income. The total average business income was less than $1 million.
—Stop justifying trusts and start talking about the bill.
—The average net business income was $103,000.
—Talk about the bill.
—Average assets were $1.2 million and average liabilities were $966,000. I take the interjection from Senator Conroy who knows nothing about trusts and very little about anything else.
—Income splitting—that's what they are about; that's all you need to know. You are just playing with the tax threshold.
—Senator Conroy deals with trusts like the coalition deals with unions—he sees one and he wants to kick it. Of the 115 trusts that were investment trusts and did not have business income, average assets were $542,000 and average liabilities were $211,000. While better off than the average, these trust statistics do not seem to reflect the high wealth individuals and trusts 
 on which publicity has focused. Practitioners in the field do not have analytical data available on trusts either.
I believe that neither the ATO nor the practitioners and representative organisations have a clear analytical picture by type of trust, of trustees, beneficiaries, assets, liabilities, income, taxation, and so on. Neither does the coalition, neither does the ALP and neither do the Democrats. That, surely, must make it difficult to develop appropriate policy responses, and it makes it problematic for government or parliament to reach firm conclusions to substantiate some trust policy legislative intentions.
Significant legislative change has been initiated since 1980 under the Labor government to curb the legal minimisation or legal avoidance of tax by the use of trusts and discretionary trusts in particular. Illegal tax evasion is subject to the full force of the law. Trusts gained particular attention in recent years as a result of Treasurers' Willis and Costello both rightly highlighting tax avoidance by high wealth individuals.
A proposal to tax trusts as companies was made in a Treasury submission to the Tax Summit of 1985. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration in its report Follow the yellow brick road in March 1991 recommended that the government should examine the feasibility of taxing all trusts in the same way as companies. Regrettably, the Labor government of the time did not pursue that. The Australian Democrats believe that these are sound reasons to favourably consider a common taxation structure for all entities engaged in business activity. That means individuals, trusts, partnerships and companies that participate in business activity should be taxed on an equivalent basis.
The Treasurer and the ATO are presently conducting a review of trusts, but do not intend to make it public. I will move a second reading amendment, which I have already circulated and it is No. 868, to oblige them to do so. There is undoubtedly a momentum for tax reform of trusts. In fact, all parties in this Senate, as I understand it, support that position. 
These bills are complex and lengthy. One of the witnesses at the hearing was quite rude to us all by describing how ignorant we were about the bill, how stupid we were and how complex the bill was. In respect of this bill he was probably right because very few of us could get to the bottom of it and neither could most of the witnesses.
—Speak for yourself.
—And I do include myself, Senator Conroy. It is an exceptionally complex bill. I will be very interested to hear Senator Conroy explain it fully to all of us. I am sure he understands every aspect of it.
The  Taxation Laws Amendment (Trust Loss and Other Deductions) Bill 1997  alone is 142 pages long and the explanatory memorandum on all four bills is 187 pages long—this from a government supposedly committed to less red tape and which proposes substantial tax reform to deliver a simpler and fairer tax system. This lot is not simple. It seems to me that it would have been best if the government had evaluated these bills against three criteria: its current review of trusts, analysis by the ATO and practitioners, and the place this legislation should have in overall tax reform. I believe that significant changes to trust taxation should have been made in conjunction with overall tax reform.
Trafficking in trust losses means that a person or entity who did not bear the economic loss gains a tax benefit by buying a trust loss from another unconnected person or entity who did bear the economic loss. The ATO identified for us two types of trust loss trafficking. One is where a trust with a loss is bought and the new owner injects otherwise taxable income into it to set the income against the loss and to produce a tax benefit. The other is where a fee is paid to a trust so that otherwise taxable income can be injected into it by an unrelated party, it is set against the loss and then extracted tax free. The ATO did not provide the committee with empirical evidence or hard data to outline either the prevalence or extent of these types of trust loss trafficking.
It is apparent from the public debate and from the evidence to the committee that there was no disagreement between the political 
 parties, the government, the ATO, accountants, lawyers and the private sector on trafficking in trust losses. All are in agreement that trafficking in trust losses must be outlawed, and you heard Senator Cook strongly emphasise that. In the public hearing, evidence was led that in this respect trafficking in trust losses had been outlawed by Mr Willis as Treasurer and that the legislation was largely unnecessary. I do not agree, but I think a few pages would probably have resolved that particular problem.
The witnesses to the hearing were all in agreement that trafficking in trust losses had ended as a result of Treasurer Willis's announcement on 9 May 1995. All anyway were of the opinion that the anti-avoidance provisions of part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 already gave the ATO ample powers to prevent trafficking in trust losses. The ATO was of a contrary opinion.
What was surprising at the hearing was that only one witness seemed to have any real knowledge of how the market for trafficking in trust losses operated. Every other witness claimed that they did not know anyone who was or had been trafficking in trust losses and none had or would advise their clients to engage in the practice. That being so, it is irrelevant because we are all agreed that it must go and, in fact, it has gone.
When questioned as to the size of the market in trust losses there was again no hard data available. The evidence was that trafficking in trust losses had largely been achieved by advertising. It emerged that the extent of advertising was actually very small. This implies that trafficking in trust losses might not have been significant in terms of the number of trusts affected. It is possible, of course, that it could have been significant in terms of the quantum of loss trafficked in just a few trusts.
Once again hard data from the ATO would have been useful. I am always suspicious when there is no hard data and there is just a bit of head kicking going on. Most telling of all, the ATO has not identified any improvement in its revenue as a result of trafficking in trust losses ending on 9 May 1995. All witnesses agreed that trafficking in trust losses 
 did cease on 9 May 1995. If there was significant trust loss trafficking prior to that date, then there should have been a revenue improvement after that date.
The witnesses to the committee did believe that the $550 million gain to revenue projected by the ATO to accrue in the six tax years from 1995-96 to 2000-01 as a result of these bills arises from attacking trust losses, not from attacking trafficking in trust losses. As you know, the setting off of losses against income is a standard business technique used by private individuals, companies, trusts and partnerships. For the record it should be noted that the Australian Democrats support legislation that outlaws trafficking in trust losses.
It is a worth repeating the majority report's summation of evidence. The majority report said: `Each witness held similar views that the legislation is flawed, manifestly unfair and that it focuses on the loss rather than the trafficking.' I have seldom experienced a committee where the evidence offered in submissions and by witnesses was so opposed in content and conclusions from that of the ATO and the government. The submissions of witnesses universally were that the legislation targets trusts and trust losses rather than trafficking in trust losses and that the net effect was similar to extensive tax penalties being wrongly imposed.
Further, evidence was offered that this legislation treats trusts detrimentally, relative to companies. The evidence was persuasive that the government has moved from the consideration of tighter anti-avoidance measures to regulatory measures designed to change tax policy and the tax regime for trusts. We have got no quarrel with that. It is just disguised in something else.
The nub of the non-ATO evidence is that some categories of trust losses legitimately incurred, which should be capable of being set off against future profits, with legitimate connection between persons and entities will now lose that tax benefit because of this legislation. These bills are seen as aimed at legitimate non-traffickers and as using the excuse of trafficking legislation to attack trusts at large.
In passing it is worth noting that the ATO cannot necessarily be relied on to get its revenue estimates right. That is quite understandable. Sometimes the ATO's miscalculations are spectacular, such as with the introduction of FBT and CGT, and the precedent for ATO error in this difficult area of revenue forecasting does require us to be cautious.
Critics contend that the ATO figures are unsubstantiated and are derived from limited sample and field audits. To go through the figures: a $550 million gain to revenue is projected by the ATO to accrue in the six tax years from 1995-96 to 2000-01 as a result of these bills. It is not known how many trusts will fund this revenue gain and how many will be spared. The gain to revenue for 1995-96 is projected by the ATO at $90 million. Since the evidence was that trafficking in trust losses ceased as a result of the Treasurer's announcement on 9 May 1995, these revenue gains must presumably be as a result of other measures now introduced.
We are advised by the ATO that, out of over 372,000 trusts, the number of trusts with prior year losses in 1995-96 was 54,802. The total amount of prior year losses in 1995-96 per the tax returns is computed by the ATO at $5,160 million. Dividing the one into the other gives us an average of nearly $100,000 trust losses per trust. If we revert back to the analysis that I provided earlier, that loss per average trust seems unlikely. It appears that most trusts do not carry forward losses, and most trusts with losses are at the lower end of the scale. It may therefore be that high losses are accumulated in a few trusts only, which have been the target of the activities of the treasurers of both Labor and coalition governments.
We have no way of knowing whether the ATO has underestimated the revenue effects of these measures. The ATO advises that it expects to raise $550 million out of $5.2 billion trust losses, and out of 55,000 trusts. That money raising represents about $10,000 additional revenue, based on the average from each of those 55,000 trusts.
Other issues raised in evidence to the committee included compliance costs, family 
 definitions, family trust elections, interposed entity elections, the distribution test, the income injection test, the definition of benefit, the continuity of ownership test and the effects on joint unit trusts. Discontent was strongly expressed in terms of cost, complexity, unfairness and bad policy. With regard to unit trusts, evidence was led that, with regard to the business test, it was inequitable for publicly listed unit trusts to receive a tax concession not available to unlisted unit trusts.
The Australian Democrats recognise that, with our limited resources, it is impossible for us to deal with all these problems. Consequently, I will only be moving amendments in the committee stage that affect retrospectivity and definitions. Retrospectivity is something which has always attracted the ire of parliament.
—And of the coalition, too.
—Usually of the coalition too. The majority report correctly summarised the fact that the legislation before the Senate differs considerably from the original announcement of 9 May 1995 and, as Senator Cook clearly outlined, differs considerably from the intentions of the Labor bill. In submissions and evidence to the committee, witnesses showed that they universally believe that the bills before us are far different in intent and consequence from what was foreshadowed by Treasurer Willis on 9 May 1995. They felt that the bill was so materially different from the original announcement that people would be unfairly prejudiced if the legislation were effective retrospectively. The ATO does not agree with those views, and that makes for a very difficult analysis for us to determine between the two contending views.
The claimed consequences of this legislation are as complex as the legislation itself. Evidence was offered that the retrospective effects could extend back to the late 1980s and forward for a number of years. It is claimed that losses legitimately incurred prior to 9 May 1995 that were not as a result of trafficking in trust losses will be detrimentally affected by this legislation. Making the 
 legislation retrospective from 9 May 1995 could mean that many trusts would be unable to claim a deduction for losses legitimately incurred during the years from 1995 onwards as well, when there was no trafficking in these losses.
In conclusion, I doubt whether any party within this parliament or the ATO can clearly forecast the consequences of this bill. Its complexity and difficulties are such that we are left to deal with some legislation which is very difficult indeed. (Time expired)
—Senator Murray, the Senate notes that you have foreshadowed an amendment in the second reading stage.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (TRUST LOSS AND OTHER DEDUCTIONS) BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-23,"—The trust loss issue has returned. Unfortunately, the new legislation raises more issues than it resolves. In the previous incarnation of the Taxation Laws Amendment (Trust Loss and Other Deductions) Bill 1997 , the issue that was supposed to be motivating the change in legislation was the beginning of trafficking in trust losses. This was something that a small group of wealthy individuals could take advantage of. It was something normally done by small businesses, which were set up as trusts, often under advice from government agencies, in order to isolate possible losses from family businesses so that business losses would not mean the loss of, for example, the family home.
It was also not something that was normally done by unit trusts and other superannuation type vehicles where a large number of people may have been involved and moved in and out of unit trusts. The problem with the former legislation was that, in attempting to prevent slick operators from manipulating the law, a great many trusts were penalised and treated as though their primary objective was to run trust loss scams. The target of the legislation seemed to be any trust trying to carry a loss forward, rather than trusts involved in loss trading schemes. The solution therefore seemed to penalise many legitimate schemes.
Unfortunately, while there are improvements in this incarnation of the legislation, it still seems to be an approach which penalises 
 trusts for claiming deductions on losses, rather than targeting the loss trading schemes. The onus seems to be on the wrong thing: it is on the trust to prove that it is not involved in a loss trading scheme rather than simply making such loss trading schemes illegal, and leaving the work and onus of proof on the Australian Taxation Office to make a case against trusts suspected of this.
A further issue appears here, which I hoped the committee would have come to grips with. What is the basis of trading trust losses? It is a justified concern that losses in one area are being used to offset profits in another, thereby benefiting both the loss making investment and the profit making investment, at the expense of public revenue. This had certainly not been done much until a few years ago as an explicit deal in terms of trading trust losses by the clever buying or selling of trusts, or by injecting funds—that is, profits—into loss making trusts. But it is hardly a new concept or practice.
The essence of the ethical argument by government and the tax office is that the purpose of carrying forward losses is to allow for a single business, engaged in a real, productive activity, to take account of the fact that there are good years and bad years, and that investing in a business, especially in establishing a business, may involve some period of expenditure and investment in excess of income. In other words, a business may either when being established or when going through a period of re-tooling or expansion, make a loss, perhaps for two to five years, before the investment begins to pay off as a profit.
That loss would be seen as part of the process of establishing a business and should be able to be carried forward and used to balance the profits made in later years. This is before things like the multilateral agreement on investment and other aspects of the international free market. I guess things are changing somewhat. Real businesses may take several years to establish but should then exist for decades, run conservatively for the long haul. This was certainly the traditional economic model, though it sounds dreadfully old fashioned today. Losses were also intended to 
 be carried forward in situations where the economy went into recession and sales may have fallen off drastically while overheads had not.
The principle in either of those cases was that a business had a natural life cycle and process of maturation that was not bound by the financial year. Businesses were there to make long-term profits, to provide at least a slight profit most of the time, and should be run cautiously enough in good times to assure that it could survive through hard times. Running a business in that context could be seen as a commercial investment but often was seen as investing in a vision of production of a certain type of product or service. The idea of carrying losses was built on the idea of evening out annual taxation over the life of a single business. Modern businesses do not fit that model quite so well.
Since financial deregulation in the early eighties, businesses begin to work more intensively in a global economy and global speculation took off in a massive way. Until then, the globalisation process had been proceeding slowly since the sixties, bound by national regulation of economies. But with the rapid opening up of national economic borders, the race was suddenly on for market share in the global big pond. One way for a company to finance rapid expansion was to turn its productive assets into financial assets, negative gear and debt finance expansion. Everyone was doing it and not to take that jump meant not to have that global presence.
Suddenly older monopolistic practices, such as vertical or horizontal integration, took on new meaning and companies began swallowing overseas companies in takeovers and leveraged buy-outs, and the whole thing being used as assets for further loans to finance another round of expansion. It was the era of the entrepreneur shark, the snake-oil flash businessman with attitude, here in Australia and various other figures in the bigger realms overseas.
We loved them. We praised them. They engaged in their ruthless expansion game and we did not look too hard if some of that cash stream went off in odd directions. It all went swimmingly until around 1987 when we saw 
 the bubble burst and the first major period of `shake-out'. The card houses of debt financed expansion collapsed and the trick was to see whether you were big enough to ride out the collapse, gobbling up fire-sale assets and divesting of peripherals, and whether there would be enough real income and assets to survive by the time the tsunami of financial collapse reached your conglomerate empire.
Unfortunately, a lot of Aussie businesses, famous old businesses, with nothing wrong with their core structures did not make it. The entrepreneurs all developed memory problems or vanished to Spain for health reasons, leaving the husks of the companies they had violated. But the heritage of those times is still with us. The speculative boom did not stop after 1987; it just developed. It developed into ways of diversifying speculative investment for risk management. It developed devious derivatives and business remains as something pretty fluid.
A real business making widgets, good high-tech widgets, may also have a significant investment portfolio. It gets reported in the annual reports. In fact the investment section which might engage in a bit of currency speculation, hold various stocks and various derivatives may still be more lucrative than the business of making widgets, which, after all, requires a real plan to enter markets and sell product competitively. There are high-tech companies which seem to primarily survive on their speculative investments while they try to interest someone in their admittedly good innovative technology.
The problem is: business has become very clever, too clever by half. They are, with their diversified portfolios, quite good at playing losses in one sector of their investments against profits in another. Of course this also translates down to the personal, with financial advisers advocating negative gearing and property investments to reduce tax liability. The use of losses in one field of investment to reduce tax liabilities in areas of more profitable investment are not new at all. The only new wrinkle in the last few years is that someone twigged to using loss making trusts as a new means of reducing tax while maintaining or requiring assets—assets which may 
 appreciate in value. Some financial advisers figured out this was a good scam and sold it openly as such.
I wonder why, after the long committee hearing and several years of thought, there has not been more fundamental consideration of this issue of losses. I think the principle that the Australian Taxation Office, through both this government and the last, is trying to get on to is to say that a loss on investment really should only be allowed to reduce tax on subsequent profits on the same investment. Really, who cares who owns the investment?
Why should we say that someone who owned the loss making investment can use it to reduce tax on their other profit making investments but someone else cannot buy that loss making investment to use against their profit making investments? I think no-one should be able to use the losses on one investment against the profits on another investment. I think if someone buys a loss making investment, say, a loss making business, they should be entirely able to carry those losses and deduct them against future profits on the same investment.
In other words, in terms of this bill, I think the government has basically got it wrong. I am glad it has taken some measures to address some of the worst aspects of the earlier legislation. I do not really see why it thinks exempting family trusts, which are just as liable to be on the Dallhold model as on the model of a small family trust set up to run a small business, will solve anything. I believe it is more likely that it will simply mean that anyone with enough money to see value in playing at trading trust losses will simply assure that they have a family trust with which to do so. I hope people are taking note of the mention made by Senator Brown in terms of the conflict of interest when this bill comes to a vote.
I believe that whatever the Greens or Democrats do at this point the bill will pass in essentially its current form. I think it is highly likely because it is fundamentally legislation introduced by the ALP and now reintroduced by the coalition. They will have the numbers, and I am not going to bother 
 with a lot of amendments because it is quite clear what will happen.
I will, however, push for one particular amendment. In the section on family trusts, `members of the family group' is a defined term. It is set as the siblings, parents, children, children of children and children of siblings for both the elected person and their spouse. It states that by spouse it means either a married or de facto spouse. This brings us to a point where it seems once again we are going to create a discriminatory situation. If we are going to give people the ability to create trusts that allow benefits to be paid out of their de facto's mother's adopted son's ex-nuptial daughter, why on earth can we not include somebody's same sex domestic partner—the person they live with and who may have spent years with them, bought a house with them, established a business with them and so on?
They cannot legally marry according to the Marriage Act. It does not matter how committed they are, how loving they are and how much they may have tried to provide for each other in their wills. It does not matter that they may have had a ceremony blessed by religious clergy. They cannot legally be married.
Why should this mean that they are also excluded from consideration of each other in a family trust? That is what this particular section, in defining what a family member of a family trust is, does to everyone in a same sex relationship. It says, yet again, that they will be excluded from a legal form which may actually work, in the absence of the action of any section of the Family Law Act, to recognise and formalise some financial obligation between partners and possibly to provide for their children and parents.
Why should we prevent same sex couples from a legal means of making such provisions for their families? This does not prevent them from trading in trust losses. Each could set up independent family trusts, if trading trust losses were the main purpose. This law does not prevent them from trading. It prevents them from having a family trust together as a family. Consequently, I am following my general course of action and foreshadowing an 
 amendment to change the definition of de facto spouse to include same sex spouses.
Since the last time that I moved such an amendment, we have seen the report of the committee looking into the Sexuality Discriminatory Bill finally tabled in the Senate. It was tabled on the second to last day of last session in the middle of the Wik debate and with virtually no real comment. Aside from Senator Brown's comments, we got to read the views of everyone else in Hansard a day or more later when there was no chance it would actually generate any more notice or discussion. Nonetheless, the majority report of the committee absolutely not dominated by the Democrats or the Greens recommended:
That a consistent and gender neutral definition of . . . domestic partnership or relationship be established and used . . .
That all couples and personal partnerships achieve legal recognition at Commonwealth level . . .
As I have indicated in the past, the broad spectra of submissions to the inquiry included that of the Catholic Bishops Conference and other major Christian churches. While often opposing same sex marriage, they supported the idea of treating same sex couples at least in the same way as de facto couples.
I understand that the ALP has been considering its position on the issue of the recognition of same sex couples. Since they participated in this report one would like to see them acting consistently with the report they signed. Hopefully, Labor senators will be able to clarify their position on this issue and say whether or not they actually support such recognition, or whether it is only for report on anti-discrimination, and, if so, what they intend to do to ensure that there is such recognition and when they intend to do something about this inequity.
I would like to speak briefly to the second reading amendment moved by Senator Cook on behalf of the ALP. It is on record the severe flaws the Greens (WA) found in the legislation when it was presented by the previous government. It would be hypercritical of me to support an amendment which says, `while strongly supporting the passage of this bill'. As I have mentioned, many of the flaws that existed still exist now or have 
 not really been dealt with. I would not be able to support the second reading amendment moved by Senator Cook unless we deleted the words `while strongly supporting the passage of this bill'. I will be moving an amendment to that amendment which would read:
""but while strongly supporting the passage of this bill, the Senate deplores the fact that, due to pressure from trust-owning members of the Coalition, it has been significantly watered down compared to the bill presented to the Senate by the then Labor Government in 1995"".
This, I believe, does not indicate that the Greens were supportive of the Labor government's 1995 bill because we quite clearly saw huge flaws in that bill. Many people in the small business sector in Australia agreed with us. The issue in relation to deleting the specific section of family trusts is bizarre, to say the least. I would consider supporting the opposition's second reading amendment with that deletion. Therefore, I move:
Omit, ""while strongly supporting the passage of this bill,"".
I also indicate that the second reading amendment to be moved by Senator Murray is acceptable the Greens (WA). I think it is reasonable. The Greens (WA) were certainly pushing to make sure that these issues were looked at carefully by the bodies that could look at them, whether in the Senate or the Australian Taxation Office, at the time of the original debate and we, therefore, think it is not unreasonable for the community and the Senate to have access to those reports on revenue from such issues as tax trust losses. I will be making further contributions during the committee stage of the debate.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (TRUST LOSS AND OTHER DEDUCTIONS) BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,1998-03-23,"—From the outset it is important that I acknowledge the support of the Labor Party for the principle inherent in this package of bills. The stated intent of cracking down on tax avoidance is worthy of support and any legislation that takes a step towards the same is both important and valuable. However, while we will be supporting the crackdown on tax avoidance, there are a number of concerns with this package of bills that the government would be wise to address.
The government and, in particular, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have had much to say about their commitment to cutting down on tax avoidance. The government's much spoken of commitment to reducing tax avoidance has been central to their cynical campaign at wooing Australia's battlers. The government has made plenty of noise on this issue to ensure that they present themselves as defenders of equity within the tax system.
Nothing could be further from the truth. This package of bills, while acceptable in principle, provide an illustration of the deception this government is placing over the Australian community. The Prime Minister said on 14 August:
. . . it is aggravating in the extreme if you are a PAYE tax battler, you're having your money taken out each week when you hear of people through all sorts of dodges, the cash economy as well as some people at the big end of town not paying their fair share.
The Treasurer has made many comments regarding his commitment to cracking down on tax avoidance. It is worth repeating his comments, as was done during this debate in the House of Representatives. On 20 June the Treasurer said:
I make it clear on behalf of this government that where anomalies and exemptions are being unfairly exploited they will be addressed.
On 2 September he said:
The government takes such measures as are required to prevent legitimate taxation liabilities being avoided.
Again, on 2 October he said:
This government is serious about making sure that corporations and indeed individuals pay their fair share of tax.
However, this package and the way it was introduced fails to meet the commitment of both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. This lack of follow through on commitment by the government is disappointing but not unexpected. The coalition has been ducking and weaving around the issue of tax avoidance for many years.
While the issue is clearly an urgent and important one, it would appear there are significant pecuniary interest reasons why the 
 coalition has backtracked and avoided this issue for so long. It is worth discussing the history of attempts to cut down on tax avoidance. The challenge to cut back on tax avoidance, particularly through the tightening of regulations on family trusts, was instigated by the previous Labor government and in particular the former Treasurer, Mr Willis. This resulted in legislation proposed and introduced by the former Treasurer in the 1995 budget. That legislation was introduced two years ago. While the legislation passed through the House of Representatives with the support of Labor Party numbers, the legislation was blocked in the Senate by the coalition and other non-government parties.
—What other non-government parties didn't support it, Senator Bishop? I would like to know. The group that's been lecturing us all day about this?
—I think they may well be, Senator Quirke. The then non-government senators sent the legislation to a Senate committee which succeeded in delaying the Senate dealing with the legislation before the calling of the 1996 election. That is why comments made by the coalition regarding a crackdown on tax avoidance during the 1996 campaign were such a farce. The now government was promising during the campaign to introduce the same kind of legislation they had just blocked in the Senate. This reveals the true hypocrisy of the coalition when it comes to tax reform.
Upon winning the 1996 election, the now government took five months to introduce legislation they had claimed during the campaign was so vitally important and equitable for all. Another six months later draft legislation was produced for consideration and comment, with significant modifications to that of the previous government's legislation. Further modifications to that draft were announced in the 1997 budget. It has now taken another five months for this piece of legislation to be brought before the parliament. Then after all of this, particularly prime ministerial procrastination, the government called on the House of Representatives to immediately pass the legislation without appropriate review and comment.
This scenario illustrates the true commitment of this government to a crackdown on tax avoidance. This delay, however, could have been overlooked if the end product had been one that met the promises of the Prime Minister and Treasurer with regard to tax avoidance and led to a significant shift towards greater equity in the taxation system. Unfortunately, the much awaited legislation has not achieved this. This is most obvious in the application of the legislation to family trusts.
Before discussing this government's lack of commitment to cracking down on avoidance through these trusts, I will briefly explain the history and purpose of this legislation. This legislation will bring about a situation whereby rules will come into force that limit the circumstances under which family trusts can deduct current year and former year losses and debt deductions. This type of legislation means that only those people who bore the consequences of a loss are able to receive any tax benefits in recouping those losses. Such a piece of legislation will ensure that those who do not bear the burden of a loss are not able to benefit financially from any avoidance. This is the same approach applied to company tax law and, in that sense, it is a welcome reform.
However, in tightening up the variation between company tax law and trust tax law the government has avoided the real issue—that is, the difference between general trusts and family trusts. In this regard, there is a significant variation between the former Labor government's proposals and the current proposals in this legislation. The difference is centred around the application of an income injection test and this government's unwillingness to make it apply equally to all trusts. The Treasurer outlined the coalition's position in a press release on 13 May. The press release stated:
On 10 February 1997, the Government released an exposure draft legislation on trust loss measures. After receiving comments and submissions, the Government has decided to modify the draft legislation to restrict its application.
The income injection test will not apply where entities and individuals within a family group inject income into a family trust with losses. 

The impact of this decision is to allow family members who are not directly bearing the cost of losses in the trust to inject income into the trust to offset against losses, thus receiving the benefit of the losses incurred by the trust.
There are two ways in which this trust trafficking occurs. The first option is where an individual purchases a trust with a loss and then injects income into that trust that would have been taxable under current taxation laws. The result is to offset the previously taxable income against the loss of the purchase trust. This results in a tax windfall for the purchaser. The second option is the use of a fee system to inject previously taxable income into a trust that has made a loss, have that income offset against the loss and then retrieve the money without paying tax. By failing to close this loophole, the government is allowing family members not incurring a loss in a trust to receive a tax benefit from a family member's trust that has incurred such a loss.
This is the type of tax avoidance that the coalition pledged to stop during the last election campaign. This will mean that, while PAYE families continue to pay high levels of income tax, wealthy Australian families will be able to avoid paying their tax share by injecting income into trusts of other family members purely so they can financially benefit from the trust losses even though they do not bear the burden of those losses themselves. This is hardly fair to ordinary battling Australians who do not have access generally to family trusts.
To add insult to injury, the government claims this to be a family friendly change rather than straight out tax avoidance. This shift in policy by the coalition is a significant watering down of the original legislation and the rhetoric offered in the election campaign. Equally, it will cost the government a significant amount of money through revenue losses. The willingness of the Labor Party to cut down this type of tax avoidance should not be confused with the ALP's policy on family trust concessions. The Labor Party accepts that family trusts should be treated as a separate category. Additionally, as our minority report outlines, we also support the 
 system of the trustee making an election for the family trust provisions to apply. As the minority report stated:
This simple system will avoid the need for costs to be incurred in amending trust deeds to comply with the definition of a family trust.
This concessional nature should also apply to family trusts in the situation of income being injected into the trust by the beneficiaries of the trust. The coalition's legislation, however, goes well beyond this criteria and allows family members not benefiting from the trust to inject income and receive a benefit. Use of this loophole is illustrated by the ATO's admission that tax revenue is reduced as a result of such a law. For these reasons, the issue of an inquiry was always worth considering. While the legislation in broad principle is supportable, there is a wide range of amendments to be considered, and all need to be examined fully.
I would now like to specifically address some other concerns with this package as they arise in the committee's report with particular focus on the minority reports. Firstly, retrospectivity is a significant concern. A vast majority of submissions to the inquiry called on the Senate to amend the legislation so that the proposed commencement of the legislation would be delayed. Retrospective legislation is not uncommon when dealing with tax.
This accepted and commonly practised rule ensures that tax loopholes are closed immediately upon being identified and announced by the Treasurer, rather than waiting for the legislation to be passed by the parliament, often at some considerably later time. This practice has the effect of protecting government revenue by solving problems identified as against policy objectives. If retrospectivity did not apply, the parliament would have been in a position of allowing trafficking in family trusts and other avoidance measures to have continued well beyond that which is necessary. This would have cost the government $435 million in revenue from trusts alone.
While the government prolonged the problem by procrastinating on this legislation, the Labor Party sees no reason to further aggravate the problem. Indeed, any procrastination would only establish a precedent that would 
 allow future, and as yet unidentified, tax loopholes to avoid immediate closure by affected peoples arguing for government inattention. This is not in the best interest of reducing the tax burden for PAYE earners.
However, while the opposition cannot support attempts to have the commencement date of the legislation delayed, we do recognise the confusion that exists within the community as a result of the government's poor management and lack of commitment to meaningful tax reform. The government has unnecessarily delayed the passage of this legislation. Rather than making it a priority, as its rhetoric would have us believe, the government has waited over two years to address the issue of tax avoidance.
Senator Murray in his minority comments has alluded to the lack of detailed information on family trusts in Australia. The lack of such information makes it very difficult for policy makers to accurately form assumptions on the impact of particular policy changes. It is agreeable that this deficiency should be rectified.
It is worth noting that, while the government is performing a backflip on tough sanctioning of tax avoidance that is exercised by some wealthy people in our community, it is pursuing vigorously other tax reforms that will hit at the family budget for the battlers of Australia. This is most noticeable, of course, with the attempt to introduce a GST.
As I mentioned at the outset, any legislation that heads down the path of reducing tax avoidance is worthy of support. For this reason, the opposition supports the intent of this package of bills. However, we note that the legislation is significantly less tough on tax avoidance than the rhetoric the government would have us believe. The consequence of this is to deprive the Commonwealth of revenue that could have been used to offset government cutbacks. More importantly, though, this backflip by the government in cracking down on tax avoidance is another reason why the Australian community is becoming so distrustful of Mr Howard and the coalition government.
—I call Senator McGauran.
—Senator McGauran is not on the list.
—I will yield to Senator Conroy.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (TRUST LOSS AND OTHER DEDUCTIONS) BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1998-03-23,"—I have to make a declaration at the beginning that I do not have a family trust, but that actually magically does not mean I do not know anything about them. If you listen to Mr Moore, the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, who is in that other chamber, I guess I fall into the category of a public sector bludger. That is what this debate is about. John Moore stood up in that other chamber and said, `If you don't have a unit trust, you're a public sector bludger.' I plead guilty, on his own words in Hansard . This debate is about fairness and equity.
Senator Murray wanted to talk about how trusts work and why the Labor Party is opposed to them. Senator Murray, as you well know, they are nothing more and nothing less than income splitting to take advantage of the tax free threshold. That is what they are about. `How does it work,' you ask.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order, and I would ask you to use your discretion, if not the black and white reading of the standing orders. I know I yielded to Senator Conroy at the time but, as you are aware, it was the government's right to take up a speaking position. Having now listened to Senator Conroy speak to this point, he is not only irrelevant but also not focusing on the true nature of this debate. He has just launched into another one of his diatribes. So, therefore, I would ask you: can I now reconsider my position of yielding initially to Senator Conroy?
—There is no point of order.
—Senator McGauran probably does not realise that there have been a number of amendments moved, particularly by the Democrats. So I am actually speaking to the bill and the amendments, Senator 
 McGauran. I invite you to have a look at the papers in front of you.
—Mr Acting President, I rise on another point of order. I accept that you ruled on that point of order but, just as an assistance, I ask: can I reconsider my yielding to Senator Conroy on the speaker's list?
—You can reconsider it, but it is not within the standing orders for me to reconsider it. Senator Conroy has the call, and he now has something like 18 minutes to finish his deliberations.
—How does a trust work? I am indebted to Phillip Hudson from the Age  for what he wrote on Saturday, 28 February. I will take Senator Murray through it just in case he is confused on this issue. If a company earns an income of $50,000, the tax it pays is $18,000. If a PAYE individual earns $50,000, the tax paid is $14,000.
—Fourteen thousand dollars?
—But, if you have a family trust—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Are the existing laws we are talking about those laws which obtained under Labor's rule for 13 years?
—You have risen on a point of order, Senator Murray. That is not a point of order.
—If you have a family trust with two beneficiaries, you are able to split the income. Beneficiary 1 receives, say, $29,000 and that individual pays $5,984 in tax. Beneficiary 2 receives $20,000 of the $50,000 and pays $3,060 in tax. That is a total tax paid for the trust of $9,000.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: is it permissible for me to sit behind Senator Conroy so he can appreciate that he is talking to the government about their bill and not to me—
—I am talking about your amendment.
—That again, Senator Murray, is not a point of order. I call Senator Conroy.
—The reason what I am saying is relevant, Senator Murray, is that you have foreshadowed that you will move an amendment. You will move to reinsert extra family members into this. What I want to ask you is that you declare when you vote on your amendment—
—On a point of order: isn't it more appropriate to consider this in the committee of the whole?
—Senator Murray, this is the second reading debate. It is appropriate that the matters contained in the bill are canvassed at this particular point in time, so there is no point of order.
—You may well squirm, Senator Murray, because what your amendment does—
—Mr Acting Deputy President—
—You may well want to waste more time.
—On a point of order going to relevance: Mr Acting Deputy President, could you rule that the amendment and the matters that Senator Conroy is referring to are not appropriate for a second reading debate?
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on the point of order and just to add something further at the same time: perhaps if you asked Senator Conroy to address you rather than Senator Murray, the debate would proceed much more generally, rather than with the personal conversation which seems to be happening between the two people involved.
—On the point of order, it is the practice during the second reading debate to canvass all issues associated with the debate and with the matter before the chamber. I call Senator Conroy.
—I take Senator Macdonald's point. What I would like Senator 
 Murray to declare—and he has been declaring that he does have a trust—is whether or not his family trust includes parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, brothers and, importantly, the beneficiaries that he is adding back into this bill. Does his family trust reinsert beneficiaries that were not in this bill? That is a very important issue, Senator Murray: are you putting back into this bill beneficiaries that are in your family trust but would be excluded in this bill?
—On a point of order: I rise to inform the Senate that none of those inclusions refer to me and the family trust which I refer to has four people—two parents and two children.
—That is not a point of order again, Senator Murray. I will be very careful in calling you again. I think this is the fourth occasion that I have called you for a point of order and they have not been points of order.
—I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-03-23,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer), to questions without notice asked today relating to the financial interests of Senator Parer.
What Senator Parer has done today is come into the parliament a few minutes before question time and table certain documents relevant to the travails he has at the moment, the troubles he has at the moment. But you have to read Senator Parer's letter to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). That letter is dated today, 23 March 1998. You have to flick through the first few pages. You have to get to page 9 before you find out what Senator Parer is up to. It comes under the subheading `Revised arrangements'. Senator Parer's letter says this:
Accordingly arrangements were made last Friday by Brisbane lawyers, Corrs Chambers Westgarth and our accountants Howarths, for my wife and I to renounce any interest as beneficiaries in both family trusts, to resign all offices and directorships, and to vest complete authority in our seven adult children under an amended trust arrangement.
What that says is that Senator Parer's decision to divest means he is guilty as charged by the opposition of a conflict of interest. He is guilty as charged. What he has done is make a final admission that his shareholdings place him in an impossible position—a flagrant conflict of interest, a conflict between his public duty and his personal interests. Because of that, he has made a decision to divest through this mechanism. But look at the mechanism he uses. Let me quote it again. It says:
. . . vest complete authority in our seven adult children under an amended trust arrangement.
That is what Senator Parer's letter to the Prime Minister says today. But what do the Prime Minister's own requirements say about this particular matter? Let us not forget from 
 day one—not when Senator Parer failed to disclose these shareholdings and his interests in his family trust but since the opposition has exposed his deceit in this matter and exposed the fact that he did have interests, very substantial interests, in a mining company in the same area where he has ministerial responsibilities—we have always pointed to the Prime Minister's discredited guide on key elements of ministerial responsibility. We have always pointed to that clause that says this:
Ministers are required to divest themselves of all shares and similar interests in any company or business involved in the area of their portfolio responsibilities.
That is what Senator Parer is supposed to have done. He has failed to do that. He has failed to declare those interests to the Senate register of pecuniary interests. He has failed to comply with the Prime Minister's own guide. Now he tries to slime and sneak and snivel his way out of this by proposing this form of divestment of his company to his adult children. He now says that he will vest authority in his seven adult children under an amended trust arrangement. The problem is that that is a clear breach of the Prime Minister's own guide. That is a clear breach of what the Prime Minister said he must do. The same clause of the Prime Minister's guide to ministerial responsibility that says that a minister who has business interests in the area of their portfolio responsibilities must divest them also goes on to say this:
The transfer of interests to a family member or to a nominee or trust is not an acceptable form of divestment.
What Senator Parer has done is propose a form of divestment that is disallowed under the Prime Minister's own guidelines. That is what the minister here has done.
We now have a brief opportunity to have a look at the material that Senator Parer tabled prior to question time today. He does not come clean at all. We do not know what all the details are in relation to his interests and his shareholdings. We have never believed that Senator Parer has been telling us all of the details before the Senate. What we say now is that this proves that Senator Parer is guilty as charged. The only issue remaining is the sentence, and there is only one appro 
 priate sentence—that is, that Senator Parer should resign or should be sacked by the Prime Minister. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Minister for Resources and Energy</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,1998-03-23,"—Senator Faulkner has lost it. He knows it, and so do the people behind him. Everybody in this chamber, everybody in the parliament, knows that Senator Parer is as honest as the day is long. There has been absolutely no conflict of interest. In spite of two weeks of muckraking and guttersniping by the Labor Party, they have not come up with one piece of concrete evidence about any personal benefit to Senator Parer over this matter. People are seeing this as simply another slimy Labor Party muckraking effort.
The Labor Party were not so outraged as they are pretending to be now when Senator Bolkus, as the then Minister for Administrative Services, negotiated to move the audit office into the ALP-owned Centenary House. Where was all this feigned outrage at that particular time? Where was the outrage of the Labor Party when their leader Bob Hawke, a personal friend of Sir Peter Abeles, used the armed forces to crush a union at the time of the pilots' strike? Where was all of this feigned outrage at that time?
Where was the outrage when Mr Hawke used his position as Prime Minister to collect $1 million from four Western Australian business leaders? Why were you not objecting to that, Senator Forshaw, at the time? What about when then Senator Evans wrote the blue book on diplomacy using ANU academics without giving acknowledgment of their contribution? Where was the outrage with that? That was genuine fault. In the case of Senator Parer, there is not a thing wrong, nothing has been proved. We could go on to Mr Keating, of course, and his conflicts of interest which are absolutely legend.
—Good old Warren!
—As my colleague says, there was Mr Warren Anderson. We all know about the length that Mr Keating went to and the conflict of interest at the time, and not a word from these people who are so vocal today.
It is a pity that Senator Alston, the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts, has gone because I want to raise an issue for him to clarify for me. There were a couple of serious questions today. The Labor Party have not asked one question this session on jobs, on tax reform, on the real issues that are important to Australian people, but there was one that came from the Democrats about the ABC. If there is this question about supposed conflict, I want Senator Alston to have a look at the former general manager of the ABC. You will remember David Hill, lovely fellow. He used to be involved with the North Sydney Leagues Club. He was not a bad fellow. Do you remember that he got his contract paid out?
—That's right.
—He got his contract paid out. Everybody thought that the ABC had sacked him because he was pretty hopeless at the job.
—Like Grahame Morris?
—He was sacked. Do you know what the ABC board did? They paid out his contract because his term had been terminated before time. We all thought that was probably fair, but then we found out in the estimates committees—and I remember asking about this—that in fact Mr Hill was not sacked; he resigned of his own volition. That is fair enough. Nobody wanted him and he knew the time was up, but he resigned.
Tell me, Senator Cook, you are the alternative finance minister, why if you resign does your employer still pay you out for the balance of your term? What was it—$300,000 or $400,000 that Mr Hill got? We should look into that. You have spent a lot of time going through the ASC records and Senator Parer. You will probably want to go back and have a look through the ABC records and at this guy who resigned of his own free will, according to him and according to the Senate estimates Hansard. Who pressured the ABC board to pay him out? This is all in this New South Wales Right stuff, Senator Forshaw. You perhaps would know the answer to that. Did anyone pressure the ABC board into 
 paying out Mr Hill $300,000 or $400,000 when he, of his own volition, resigned from a position? (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Minister for Resources and Energy</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-03-23,"—That was a big red herring. If there is something wrong, investigate it, set it right, but do not try to change the focus of this debate. What do we have here? We have Senator Parer looking much like the bloke who has been pulled aside by the speed cop who says, `You were speeding,' and he says, `I wasn't driving,' and then the cop says, `But you're the only one in the car.' That is what you have here. Senator Parer gets sprung, and then he confesses. Then he puts out a notice saying that all the things we have been saying are right. That is what we have here. Let us not confuse the matter. Do not blame us. These are your guidelines imposed on you by your Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who now disobeys them.
There is a clear conflict between public duty of a minister and private interests of this minister. That is a conflict of interest that not only should not be the case but also should not be seen to be the case. The Prime Minister is on the record often enough saying, `It's got to be not only a conflict but also an apparent conflict.' Other people went on that basis, why doesn't Warwick Parer go?
The whole situation here is quite simple. Just before question time we had a pre-emptive strike, an attempt to try to clear the air by dropping a massive paper on the table and saying, `That clears it all up.' We are told it will take an hour to photocopy these documents before we can actually look at them, but it does not clear the air. What we have seen now in fact complicates the issue. What is the whole truth here? Remember, when you talk about the truth, you do not just talk about the truth—you talk about the whole truth and nothing else but the truth. What we got was never the whole truth.
Let us have a look at what the whole truth is here. We, of course, know that he is a minister in charge of an area where he owns a private company and he regulates the behaviour of companies in the area which he controls. We know that he has $2 million 
 worth of shares in one of the companies in the industry he regulates. We know as a minister he is in regular contact with the chairman and managing director of his company. We know that he visited Japan and spoke to two other partners associated with his mining company. We know he sat through the native title debate in this chamber and did not declare his interest, despite the fact there was a clear conflict of interest between his ownership of that company and native title claims.
Now the web of deceit widens even further. Enter the company Pan Australian Resources NL. Who is Pan Australian Resources, the new entry into this debate? It is a company listed on the stock exchange worth $11 million.
—Madam Deputy President, on a point of order: during question time, Madam President made Senator Cook withdraw certain words. He has now flagrantly, in disregard of her request, repeated those words during his speech and you, Madam Deputy President, ought require him to withdraw.
—Senator Cook, if you have said anything unparliamentary, would you please withdraw it?
—I said `web of deceit'. That is what we have here but, if you rule those words unparliamentary, I will withdraw them. The plot has thickened to the extent now that very serious suspicions are raised about deceit. Do you prefer that, Senator?
Let me go to Pan Australian Resources. It is a company listed on the stock exchange worth $11 million. The Parer family trust holds 16 shares in QCMM Pty Ltd, and QCMM Pty Ltd in turn holds 100 per cent of Kiskin Pty Ltd, and Kiskin in turns holds $3.7 million or 4.9 per cent of the issued capital of Pan Australian. That is the truth, the whole truth.
The truth was, `I don't have any interest in a mining company.' When you go through the blinds and who holds what in whom, who holds what in whom and who holds what in whom again, you find that Kiskin holds $3.7 million or 4.9 per cent of the issued capital of Pan Australian, and Kiskin is Pan Australian's 
 third largest shareholder. It is not insignificant.
Also, Minister Parer directly holds 44 shares in QCMM Group (ESP) Pty Ltd. QCMM Group (ESP) Pty Ltd in turn holds 726,355 shares, or 0.96 per cent, of the issued capital of Pan Australian Resources. Collectively, he holds over five per cent of Pan Australian. Pan Australian is involved in major gold, nickel, copper, lead, zinc and silver exploration projects in Western Australia and Queensland. At no stage has Senator Parer declared his indirect interest in this mining and exploration company, yet he regulates activities in all those areas of gold, nickel, copper, lead, zinc, silver and so forth. He is not just the minister for coal; he is the minister for resources. Why didn't he fess that up? Why didn't he tell the whole truth? Why did he just tell that truth which he knew we had found out and argue that as a protection? Why did he say that he did not know he had to put it in his declaration? Ordinary Australians cannot get away with not knowing what the law means.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,1998-03-23,"—On 3 October 1995, Senator Faulkner was awarded the Dr Meredith Burgmann award for the most hysterical outburst at an ALP conference. I think he should also receive an award for his hysterical outburst today. What we know about Senator Faulkner is that, whenever he does not have the facts on his side, he becomes hysterical because he thinks that somehow noise is going to obviate the need for evidence and facts.
The reality is that nothing at all has been pinned on Senator Parer. The reality is, as was so very well put in the Australian Financial Review of 19 March 1998, that the Labor Party are bereft of policies. They have no policies, no solutions and no alternatives, so what do they do to try to create an atmosphere of activity? They engage in muckraking. They have defamed people who have been dead for half a century—the Baillieu family—but when they are proven wrong, when their researchers are shown to be wrong, do you think they have the good grace to come back into this chamber and apologise and say, `We made an honest mistake'? No, 
 it is beyond them, because there is no sense of decency about their attacks on this government. As former Senator Richardson said about the Labor Party's modus operandi, they do `whatever it takes'. They will do whatever it takes to try to score an easy, sleazy point.
This article that I referred to in the Australian Financial Review of 19 March 1998 was very telling, and allow me to quote from it. It states:
And does the opposition usually ask stupid, nitpicking questions? Well yes, actually.
Of the 67 questions asked by the Opposition in the House so far this year, 22—
or pretty well one-third—
had nothing to do with policy, and only five dealt with the economy, 12 with employment and four with industrial relations. The Opposition Leader, Kim Beazley, asked one question on the economy and one on employment.
That ought to tell the Australian people that these are the priorities of the Leader of the Opposition, the would-be Prime Minister, the alternative Prime Minister. In all that time, he asked one question on the economy and one on employment.
But what about all the sleazy allegations that have been made against Senator Parer and others? Mr Beazley is in there fighting thick and hard but, when it comes to alternative policies for this country, he is nowhere to be seen. Of course, the situation is no different in this place. As the article stated:
Of 583 questions asked in 1997, only 79 dealt with jobs, debt, inflation, budget issues, small business and the general economy.
And guess what it said about Senator Faulkner?
The Senate Leader, John Faulkner, asked three questions on unemployment.
That was what he asked for the whole year. That is his commitment to creating jobs in Australia
What is Senator Faulkner doing? He is attacking a man who, by his own investments and by his own diligence, has created jobs for Australians—something Senator Faulkner has never done and something Mr Beazley has never done. Senator Parer has earned export dollars for this country—something Senator Faulkner and Mr Beazley have never done. 
 Indeed, Mr Beazley's record is creating the huge foreign debt that the Commonwealth faces and that we, in a very appropriate manner, are seeking to repay.
So if the Labor Party wants to talk about standards, let it just reflect on who would be the Attorney-General under its regime. It would be Senator Bolkus. He would have direct responsibility for the Skase matter—the man who deliberately leaked Federal Court documents that prejudiced the whole action. That is the Labor Party's standard. While Senator Bolkus remains on the front bench of the Labor Party, the Labor Party has no right in any shape or form to seek to attack the propriety of our ministers, let alone someone who is so highly regarded as Senator Parer.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Minister for Resources and Energy</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1998-03-23,"—I am very pleased to be able to join in this process today of taking note of Senator Parer's answers and, in particular, to note his answer to me regarding this government's stance on greenhouse. Since Senator Parer became the minister for resources, it has been, much to the Democrats' annoyance, really a ministry focused on the coal industry, a ministry focused on the past. Yes, it is focused on an industry that is very important, but in emphasising this one particular part of his portfolio he has deliberately ignored—indeed, I would go so far as to say he has not just ignored but has undermined, de-funded and actually worked against—alternative energy sources.
If we look at his answers to questions asked today, again he seems to wish to completely avoid and indeed pretend, I suspect, that he does not really understand the link between our stance at Kyoto and the interests in his industry. Let us just look at the position that the Australian government took. We were the only country to go over there and argue for an increase. That was certainly an embarrassment to those people in Australia who care about these issues, to the conservation movement, to indeed the many scientists who have worked for many years and I believe have shown this government very clearly where our future should lie.
Senator Parer suggests today that he does not understand the link between coal exports 
 and the fact that we went to Kyoto trying to destabilise the world agreement, trying to pull the world back from the 10 per cent or eight per cent reductions. We then went down even below that to the point where we have managed to get it to where we can actually increase ours, and the rest of the world got away with a lot less, particularly Europe, than those of us who care about the environment had hoped for.
Let us look at the link. If the world is not pushed to do something about alternative energy—in other words, people are going to be allowed to rely on coal into the future year after year—if people are going to be allowed to continue using coal, then our coal exports, which are the minister's priority, will flourish.	It is no good, Senator, to stand up in this place and say it is all about jobs. Firstly, the ABARE model has been debunked. It has been shown to be the nonsense that it really is. No-one else in the world believes it. It has never been substantiated by any other modelling exercise anywhere. We see very clearly that this government's emphasis on coal has detracted from the adoption of a range of alternatives. For every percentage point we managed to pull back at Kyoto—away from that 10 per cent reduction which was I believe the minimum—we see the benefits to Australia of coal exports and not the benefits in jobs. The coal industry is rapidly shedding jobs. I suggest that if this minister does not understand that he should read the daily papers for a few weeks as we see coalmine after coalmine closing down and many of those that are staying in business shedding workers.
I also suggest that this minister does some reading on alternative energy; that he looks to Europe, particularly to Denmark and the new jobs being created there in wind energy; that he looks at the papers that have been prepared on what Australia could be doing in the solar industry area, particularly the fact that we are leaders in a range of different facets in this field at the moment and that we should now be exporting this technology far more than we are doing. Part of the reason that we are not able to have the strong base here in this country on which to build and to export is because this government is simply not encour 
 aging that industry, amongst others. Just look at the penetration of solar hot water services in this country. We see an appalling rate of somewhere around four per cent for a country where 65 to 70 per cent of our landmass is suitable for solar technology.
If we can see the direct link between this minister's mind-set on the coal industry, how it has to be protected to the detriment of all other industries, and we now understand what his personal links are to the coal industry, I have to ask him: what is a conflict of interest, if this is not? I look forward to the opportunity later on in the MPI to go through other areas, other decisions of this government, that are directly linked to the support for the coal industry and against alternative energy sources.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Minister for Resources and Energy</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1
"Calvert, Sen Paul",LP,1998-03-23,"—I thought that was a very interesting contribution from the Leader of the Australian Democrats. Senator Lees talked about solar energy and all the rest of it. The fact is that when Senator Parer has been attacked for his so-called conflict of interest, no-one has accused him of a direct conflict of interest. I say that sincerely because there is no direct conflict of interest. One thing I know about Warwick Parer, and I have known him for 10 years, is that he is not a dreamer like the Democrats—he is a realist.
The realism in this case is that if Senator Robert Hill had gone to Kyoto and succumbed to the world pressure, with the Democrats and Duncan Kerr running around and working against the national interests of Australia, the couple of mine closures that we have seen with the loss of a few thousand or a few hundred jobs in Australia would have been something like 90,000 to 100,000 jobs. If the Democrats are serious about being interested in jobs, they would have taken a different view and proposed different criteria to what they are pushing now. The only alternative they can come up with to the reality of coal power is solar power. We all know how expensive that is. Sure, there have been a lot of investigations and the like into solar power, but the realistic view is that, at this point in time, if we had not got those concessions in Kyoto 100,000, Australian jobs 
 would have been lost in Australia. That is the reality of the whole thing.
I was most disturbed to hear the word `deceit' being used about Senator Parer. There is one thing about Senator Parer: he is not deceitful and he is an honest man. There is no question about that. Senators opposite should take the time to look at the documents that he tabled today. In the letter to Prime Minister, he establishes where he is coming from when he says:
Starting with no special privileges I worked hard to establish and develop business interests and I make no apology for my success.
And neither should he. Neither should anybody who is a successful businessman. It seems to me, all that ever happens in this place, if you are a successful businessman, is that the minute you put your head up it is the old tall poppy syndrome—knock them down! I think the taxpayers out there who are subsidising politicians to act on their behalf should look at the value they are getting from Senator Parer who has that business acumen. He is a self-made man who has shown his ability to make a dollar, which is more than we can say for senators opposite. All they know is how to spend money.
When they come in here and start talking about conflict of interest, I start thinking about some of the people on their side over the years. Alan Griffiths owned a sandwich shop while he was the minister for industry. Was that a conflict of interest? They would probably say no. Graham Richardson: remember him? He was a director of radio station 2HD while he was a minister. He did not declare his interest. I do not suppose he thought it was necessary. He used his position as minister to try to influence the President of the Marshall Islands on behalf of his cousin. Do you remember that? Talk about conflict of interests!
We all knew that former Prime Minister Bob Hawke was a great personal friend of Sir Peter Abels. What happened when the pilot strike was on? Who put the defence forces in to help Ansett and Qantas? Really and truly, these people on the other side are criticising someone who is a self-made man, who has come in here and tabled all the documents 
 and has not been proven to have any conflict of interest whatsoever. As some of these documents from his sharebrokers show, he gave instructions when he was appointed as minister, without any question at all, concerning Kathi Parer. I says here:
Upon Senator Parer's appointment as Minister in 1996, she instructed us to review the share portfolio held . . . where there may be an appearance of conflict of interests—
They have gone ahead to do that in good faith and I believe that Senator Parer did exactly that. He is a man of honour and trust and, as the Minister for Resources and Energy, he would want there not to be any doubt at all that he had any conflict of interest. I do not believe that has been proven, nor will it be proven. I am sure he will continue to be a very good Minister for Resources and Energy for this country.

"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,1998-03-23,"—On behalf of Senator Woodley, I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, he will move:
That further consideration of the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 [No. 2] be postponed till after the Government has complied with the order of the Senate of 11 March 1998 for the production of legal advice on how the bill satisfies the requirements of section 57 of the Constitution.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES OF MOTION</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Notices,4,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-03-23,"—This is an important matter. Public debate on federal politics over the past couple of weeks has been dominated by the imbroglio that surrounds Senator Parer. But what the opposition would like to do this afternoon in this debate on a matter of public importance is to focus on the role of Mr Moore-Wilton, who is the Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Prime Minister's right-hand man. He is the nation's most senior public servant, and it appears that he has committed either a massive sin of commission or a massive sin of omission in his scrutiny of Senator Parer's investment arrangements.
As you know, 30,000-odd Australian public servants who have become unemployed as a result of the decisions of the Howard government describe Mr Moore-Wilton as `Max the Axe'. But I think we have to say that, when it comes to checking out Mr Howard's millionaire row of ministers and the process of scrutiny that Mr Moore-Wilton has engaged in, you really would have to describe Mr Moore-Wilton as, `Max the Lax', because he has been closely involved in the Parer shares affair from the outset. From the start, Mr Moore-Wilton was appointed as the gatekeeper for the Prime Minister on ministerial pecuniary interests.
In April 1996, the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, circulated his now completely discredited document A Guide to Key Elements of Ministerial Responsibility. In the very puffed up foreword to this particular document, he gave a warning to ministers and staff. He said, `The emphasis in the guide is on the necessity of adherence to high standards by people occupying positions of public trust.'
Mr Howard tabled this guide on 30 April 1996. He announced at that time that ministers would be required to make declarations to him by 27 May 1996. What occurred was that later in that same year Mr Howard's own guide and his failure to properly police and implement it led to the careers of Assistant Treasurer Short and Parliamentary Secretary Gibson being claimed. Following that, Mr Moore-Wilton was required to scrutinise all ministers' declarations for compliance with the Prime Minister's much touted new ministerial standards.
In a press conference on 16 October of that year, Mr Howard stated that Mr Max Moore-Wilton had carried out certain examinations of trust holdings and had had further discussions on the matter. It is worth recalling that, at that press conference, Mr Howard put the onus on his own ministers to be `above reproach'. He said that he had `forcibly reminded'—could you imagine Mr Howard forcibly reminding anyone to do anything?—his ministers, who, of course, included Senator Parer, of their obligations under these ministerial guidelines.
It was in that same month that Mr Howard in fact commissioned a report on blind trusts to see whether that particular device might make it easier for the coalition frontbenchers, ministers and parliamentary secretaries to meet what seemed to be increasingly impossibly high standards. That report on blind trusts was, of course, authored by the same Mr Moore-Wilton, with the assistance of a couple of other departmental secretaries. It was released for public comment early in February last year. Of course, it has not been heard of since.
—They have got a search party out.
—I think you have to conclude, Senator Hogg, that blind trusts are obviously not a favoured option for millionaires row over there, the government front bench. On 20 March last year, the Senate Standing Committee on Senators' Interests clarified again the rules for disclosure of shareholdings in trusts, and that followed a similar clarification that occurred in the House of Representatives.
We ask the question: how could the Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Mr Moore-Wilton, possibly have been oblivious to that process taking place? We know that a letter clarifying the disclosure guidelines was hand-delivered by a senior parliamentary officer to Senator Parer's office on 20 March. A further letter was sent on 26 March, together with a copy of the revised guidelines. All that followed a statement in the Senate by Senator Denman as chairman of the committee.
We must say that some coalition frontbenchers, some ministers and some parliamentary secretaries did respond. We know that Senator Alston responded to the correspondence. We know that Senator Newman responded to the correspondence. Even poor old Senator Ian Macdonald responded to the letter that was hand-delivered and which bore Mr O'Keefe's signature. They amended their declarations of interest accordingly. But, in May last year, Mr Howard again asked his probity gatekeeper, if you like, to check his ministers' confidential disclosures, presumably in the context of some sort of annual updating. These disclosures, including Senator Parer's, were passed to Mr Moore-Wilton on 7 May 1997. Mr Howard tells us that Mr Moore-Wilton reported back on 9 May—two days later.
Mr Moore-Wilton had just devoted two days to this very complex task of working through the mire, the myriad, the web of financial arrangements that much of the Howard government frontbench seemed to have, at a time when the trust shareholding rules had been tightened in both chambers. Mr Moore-Wilton took only two days to examine the investments of 36 ministers and parliamentary secretaries in the Howard government, but he 
 was able to very confidently provide Mr Howard with an assurance that `Senator Parer's statement was in accordance with the guidelines'. We assume that is the same confidence that he expressed in relation to other frontbenchers from the coalition.
On 10 March this year what do we find? Senator Parer has not conformed with the guidelines and certainly has not conformed with the ministerial code of conduct that Mr Howard brought down with such fanfare in the early days of his government. It was left to the opposition to reveal that Senator Parer controls an investment company which runs his family trust. He has got 16 shares worth over $2 million in a coalmine which sells to Japan. We know he visited Japan in an official capacity in June last year. He met executives from both the Marubeni Corporation and Nissho Iwai, which were both his business partners, joint venturers, and coal customers. Senator Parer also has direct shareholding in Queensland Coal Mine Management (ESP), which in turn has 706,000 share interests in Pan Australian Resources—this was exposed in question time today—which is a company that has numerous and diverse mining interests in Queensland and Western Australia.
This is not just a perception of a conflict of interest; this is an open and shut case of a conflict of interest and a vertically integrated conflict of interest from Senator Parer. Yet on 10 March, again the Prime Minister referred the matter to whom? Whom do you reckon? Mr Max Moore-Wilton. Again Max Moore-Wilton gave Senator Parer the big tick. He advised in early March—on 11 or 12 March—that he had taken into account the following issues: first, the Parer family trust vehicle, IMPL, has been in operation for a considerable time predating Senator Parer's appointment to the ministry; second, that the shares held are non-voting shares; third, the company QCMM Pty Ltd is a private company whose shares are neither listed nor traded; and, four, that Senator Parer and his wife have not received income from the trust holdings in either 1995-96 or 1996-97.
That is just nonsense, absolute nonsense. The shares were worth well over $2 million. 
 They provided the family trust with an income stream of over $800,000 over the past three years. There was income derived from the trust in 1995. The shares are tradeable. Senator Parer mused aloud on television last week that he might sell them. But Mr Moore-Wilton certified this whitewash. He has certified it in writing and he has sent it off to the Prime Minister.
Senator Parer said on A Current Affair on 12 March: `I have in all the time I have been in parliament made full disclosure for years. Everyone knew we had a family trust for years on the Senate records and this is why full disclosure was given to the Prime Minister and was ticked off.' It was ticked off by Mr Moore-Wilton. That is the truth. On the television news on the morning of 14 March, Mr Moore-Wilton was there saying that Senator Parer had complied with the guidelines.
Mr Moore-Wilton must have examined Senator Parer's affairs at least three times: in October 1996 when Senators Short and Gibson lost their jobs; in May 1997 when ministerial declarations were updated; and on 10 or 11 March this year when Senator Parer's own shares became public. Mr Moore-Wilton was formerly a senior director of the Australian Stock Exchange. He had an intimate knowledge of investment structures. But he could have missed the significance of the minister for coal having such interests in a coalmine through an investment company in which the minister has eight out of the nine shares! That just beggars belief. He either missed it—in that case we are dealing with monumental incompetence on the part of Mr Moore-Wilton—or he was fully aware of it—and in that case how on earth could he have approved it?
We have to say that even Senator Parer now has come to the conclusion that he should divest himself of these interests. He is proposing to divest complete authority in seven adult children under an amended trust agreement. He wrote to that effect to the Prime Minister, even though the Prime Minister's own guide says that the transfer of interests to a family member or to a nominee 
 or trust is not an acceptable form of divestment.
What is Mr Moore-Wilton up to? He is up to knocking out the walls of bus shelters, redeveloping the departmental foyer, approving substantial allowances for himself, getting the taxpayer to pay for a cleaning lady in his Canberra flat, and chasing departmental officers about why he found out about a Public Service commission inquiry into himself only recently. That is what he is up to. He is not doing his job.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-03-23,"—That was an extraordinary contribution. When I was advised this morning of this matter of public importance as alleged by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, I was puzzled that it was directed against Mr Max Moore-Wilton, the Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. I understand that the opposition has been trying to establish a case against Senator Parer. That is within the nature of politics. The opposition has clearly alleged and is attempting to prove that he was conducting the business of a minister subject to some conflict of interest.
However, today, the opposition has headed out into left field, lashing out at the head of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. It was not until the last few seconds of Senator Faulkner's speech that he said that the objective was not only to get the resignation of Senator Parer, but also to make Mr Max Moore-Wilton resign—to bring them all in the net and make everyone resign.
One thing you learn pretty quickly about Senator Faulkner is that, firstly, when he is a bit short on evidence he starts to shout. When he is shouting you know that he does not have a strong case. Secondly, instead of making allegations, he always states the allegations as fact. For example, he shouts that Senator Parer is the owner of $2 million worth of shares. He repeats it—and, of course, Senator Parer is not. Most of the questions asked in question time today were falsely premised, but it does not matter to the members of the Labor Party. They will make 
 the allegation and they will repeat it often. They will shout it as if to demonstrate its accuracy when, if you explore the matter, you will see that their case is wanting.
Similarly, Madam Acting Deputy President, you might have noticed that the Labor Party is interchanging the two sets of rules to suit its circumstances. The Senate has applied a set of rules to senators in relation to potential conflicts of interest, and they are different from the set of rules that the Prime Minister has applied to his ministers. If you were listening to Senator Faulkner, Madam Acting Deputy President, you would have noticed that he was attacking Mr Max Moore-Wilton for not applying the Senate's set of rules in his analysis—not the Prime Minister's set of rules.
I will remind you of the detail. Senator Faulkner referred to Senator Parer failing to meet the extra terms of the latest explanatory memorandum. Some little time ago, the chairman of the committee sent around a new explanatory memorandum. Some senators got it and, apparently, some did not. Senator Parer did not get it, and therefore he failed to act upon it.
—It was hand delivered to his office.
—Senator Faulkner said that Mr Max Moore-Wilton failed to keep Senator Parer to that explanatory memorandum.
—What was he doing?
—The next thing Senator Faulkner will be suggesting is that it was hand delivered to Mr Max Moore-Wilton as well. I did not pick that up, so he must have missed that in his address. Mr Max Moore-Wilton was asked by the Prime Minister to check off ministers' returns against the ministerial guidelines. He did that in relation to all ministers and parliamentary secretaries. He reported that, in relation to Senator Parer, he had met the terms of the guidelines—job done, and job done correctly. The Prime Minister has said exactly the same thing: Senator Parer has met the requirements of his guidelines.
We have been at this for over a week now, and we still have not had any allegations of 
 any specific conflict of interest. There has been no allegation that Senator Parer has in any way abused his position for personal advantage. Some of those on the other side have even had the decency to say that they see Senator Parer as an honourable man. He is not only an honourable man, but I must say that he is doing his job very well as a minister.
Therefore, one wonders what is behind this attack. What is the real motive of the attack? Senator Faulkner hinted at it today when he talked about the `millionaire row of ministers on the other side'. A little while later he talked about the `web of arrangements on the other side'. This is the politics of envy.
—When are you going to talk about Max Moore-Wilton and what an incompetent, useless dope he is?
—What the Labor Party cannot cop is that some ministers in this government have been financially successful in their lives—have built up assets and are interested in the welfare of their seven children, even if they happen to be adults.
—What about Max Moore-Wilton? What about the Prime Minister's code?
—When the Labor Party was in office, its ministers were nearly all either ex-trade union or ex-party officials—
—What's wrong with that?
—There is nothing wrong with being an ex-trade union official. Generally speaking, with a few exceptions, they had not built up large capital assets. I do not mind that. Good luck to them. But what you do not like is that there are some on the other side who have. You do not believe that there should be successful people within the ministerial ranks of an alternative government. Fortunately, this government is proud that its ministerial ranks are made up of people with a range of skills and experience—which includes experience in business and includes successful business people.
—There are very few with any skills.
—Senator Parer has done his job well as a minister. I remind you of his record as a minister. Forty new projects have been commissioned in the last 12 months, with $7 billion worth of investment. Some 120 resource and energy projects currently under construction are being committed—
—What about Max Moore-Wilton?
—Senator Faulkner, you have constantly interjected. I ask you to stop.
—$20 billion will create 7,000 direct and 20,000 indirect permanent jobs. One hundred and sixty additional projects are currently under consideration, which of course will create thousands of more jobs. Since I am going to be followed in the debate by Senator Lees, I must say that her attack on Senator Parer in question time today was extraordinary because what Senator Parer was interested in in relation to the greenhouse debate was not only a good environmental outcome—
Senator Ferris interjecting—
—Madam Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: I draw your attention to the fact that Senator Ferris interjected.
—There is no point of order.
—But Australian jobs as well. Senator Parer, as a successful resource minister, is interested in growing the Australian work force.
Senator Crane interjecting—
—Madam Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: I point out to you that Senator Crane has just interjected. Could you call him to order, please?
—Senator Faulkner, I would ask you to try to maintain some semblance of order in the chamber. Stop taking points of order of that nature.
—On a point of order—
—Can't take it.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I would hope that you would not be calling people to order in a transparently partisan way. I think it is reasonable to call senators who are interjecting to order. Unfortunately, as is the nature of the chamber, given that it is adversarial, senators on both sides of the chamber interject. That is the point I am making.
—Senator Faulkner, you were constantly screaming your interjections across the chamber. I did not hear Senator Ferris and I did not hear Senator Crane. I simply asked you to cease screaming across the chamber.
—Senator Faulkner has taken most of my time, but I think it can be summed up in this quote from the Courier-Mail  of 21 March this year. It said:
The opposition has yet to mould itself into an alternative government. What the debate shows is that two years after its defeat Labor is lacking policy depth and credibility.
That is what this is all about. If they cannot develop policies as an alternative government, if all they can do is knock and seek to undermine the existing government—attack it in its attempts to bring expenditure under control; attack it in its reforms on industrial relations that have actually resulted in the best industrial relations record in some 70 years; oppose this government on Wik which is designed to give some certainty to Australian investors as well as justice to indigenous people; oppose the reforms that we are seeking to introduce on the waterfront because they support the rorts of the Maritime Union on the waterfront; and oppose any attempt for sensible reform of Australia's outdated taxation system—if all they can do is knock and oppose, what else can they do to camouflage their inadequacy and failure but simply attack Senator Parer and if that is not working then attack the head of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.
This was a pathetic contribution by Senator Faulkner. He should hang his head in shame. I can only hope his successors will do a better job.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Minister for Resources and Energy</title>,Matters of Public Importance,11,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1998-03-23,"—The 
 Prime Minister in the other place has challenged us to demonstrate where Senator Parer has had a conflict of interest and in particular where he has failed in his job as a minister. This means that we have to show where the minister has failed to objectively consider any issue because his judgment was compromised by the need to protect his own private or personal interests.
Before question time Senator Parer tabled a number of documents. I think the way in which they were tabled was designed to make sure that none of us actually managed to read them before we got to our feet during the MPI today. But in skimming through them I have managed to find that on page 7 of this document he makes the assessment that, `An examination of all the decisions I have taken as Minister demonstrates no conflict of interest.' There is an 11-page attachment from his department to that letter. That outlines all of the executive decisions taken by the minister to support this claim. That attachment is basically only relating to his role as minister for coal. It does not refer at all to his real job, and that is minister for energy.
The approach is an incredibly narrow view of what this minister does, and this has been the Democrats' complaint all along. If the duties of a minister consist merely of exercising administrative functions, then we should pension the whole cabinet off, I would argue, and replace them with just a few administrative officers. I would argue very strongly that the real job of a minister is policy work—the development of policy. Despite all the paperwork that Senator Parer tabled today, his extensive policy work to prop up and protect interests in the coal industry is not documented at all. The whole area is ignored. This is the key failing of Senator Parer, the Prime Minister and the head of the Prime Minister's department in defining what is a conflict of interest.
If the minister directly owns a large share of a large coalmine and he deliberately sets out, as Minister for Resources and Energy, to ruthlessly reduce government support for energy conservation and promotion of renewable energies that would directly affect the demand for coal, then surely this is a conflict 
 of interest. The minister's private interest basically is to sell more coal, prop up the coal industry, promote other industries, promote anything that will actually help to sell more coal. Yet the public interest—indeed the public interest that the minister swore to uphold—is to cut greenhouse gas emissions, reduce global warming, improve energy conservation and promote low cost renewable energy sources. What way did this minister go? I will let his actions speak. I will list five of them.
Firstly, the move to lift the export controls on coal was one of his first acts as the Minister for Resources and Energy. This basically means that the Commonwealth no longer has any lever to protect the environment where a coalmine is concerned. We cannot ask now for a federal assessment. Secondly, there was the abolition of the ethanol fuel bounty. This renewable energy resource would have been a boom in rural Australia. So along with the abolition of the fuel bounty went the abolition of the jobs that were there waiting to be done depending on the waste that industry was going to use—whether it was from the sugarcane industry in Queensland, or from growing wheat in western New South Wales or from growing rice in the Riverina. The small local facilities that would have been developed are gone.
Thirdly, there was the abolition of the Energy Research and Development Corporation which was at the forefront of developing renewable energy sources and had enormous support. Within Australia and overseas it was highly successful but it was in direct conflict with the coal industry. Fourthly, he refused conservationists a position in his round table working group on sustainable energy. He stacked 10 of the 11 places—and I repeat that this group was working on sustainable energy—with representatives of the fossil fuel industry.
Fifthly, we had the abolition of the white paper on sustainable energy. This was an election commitment. But it turns out that it was not a core commitment. It was a document that this parliament had been waiting on and was promised several times in this chamber. All of these decisions were made by 
 Senator Parer or promoted by Senator Parer as a minister. All had the direct effect of helping to maintain the value of his mining interests.
Senator Parer has been somewhat disingenuous in his approach to dealing with conflicts of interest. Today he told us that as Minister for Resources and Energy he had little role in developing the government's greenhouse gas position. This will come as news to his department which trumpeted in its 1997 annual report that it has been `very active in developing policy for and negotiating support for an approach to climate change that protects Australia's interests'. Those interests were defended very strongly by Senator Parer as minister.
Australia's position on greenhouse gases, coordinated by Senator Parer and his department, was criticised by every other western country. President Clinton, on his visit last year, directly criticised our stand, as did Chancellor Kohl and the British Prime Minister, Mr Blair. It was, and still is, an embarrassment.
What did industry stand to lose most from a stronger position on greenhouse gas emissions? In response to a question in question time on 29 October last year, Senator Parer said that there was no doubt that the majority of job losses talked about by ABARE would relate either directly to the portfolio he represented or to the downstream processing that comes from energy and minerals. He identified three areas of Australia that would be most adversely affected by any concentrated effort to cut greenhouse gas emissions in this country—Yallourn, the Hunter Valley and the Bowen Basin. We now understand that the Bowen Basin is the home of the Jellinbah mine which is partly owned by him.
It now emerges that the Prime Minister and his department chief knew all the time that Senator Parer had a personal interest in the coal industry and, therefore, a personal interest in not seeing a strong decision on greenhouse gas emissions. Was he removed from this area of policy making? No.
Let us look back in history. We saw Geoff Prosser removed from the portfolio dealing with retail leases as he was a shopping centre 
 owner. That was okay for Mr Prosser. He was removed from an area where he stood to benefit. It now seems that there are very different rules for Senator Parer.
At this time, was this interest made public? No, it was not. Senator Parer continued through 1997 to take a direct interest in energy matters and in the greenhouse gas question in particular. I wish it were true that the environment department won out. If the advice from the environment department had won out, Australia would have gone to Kyoto with a different position.
Last year the Democrats called for conflicts of interests to be regulated by an independent commissioner of ethics. The fact that we have gone so far on this issue and that this issue continues to rumble on shows us that it cannot be policed by ministers and policed by the Prime Minister and there must be an independent body out there that looks at this once and for all. We have been calling for that for many years. We called for that right through the list of scandals that went on at the time the Labor Party was in government. We will continue to insist on this and we believe it is the only way that the public interest, as opposed to any private interest, however we define them, can come to the fore.
The public must have confidence in this chamber and in parliament generally. I think that confidence is being undermined by what is happening now. We must make sure that there is an independent body to oversee this whole area and that an independent commissioner for ethics steps back away from parliament so that we do not spend hours in this chamber or the other place debating these issues. Once matters are raised there needs to be somewhere they can be taken and the public can be confident that their interests are at the top of the list as an independent body is dealing with them.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Minister for Resources and Energy</title>,Matters of Public Importance,11,1
"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,1998-03-23,"—I find the selective memory of the Labor Party purely and simply breathtaking. Yesterday, to hear Simon Crean, a member of the other House, say that the interest that the former Prime Minister had in a piggery was declared is simply a case of 
 rewriting history. Our former college Senator Michael Baume pursued this issue for years, and who defended the former Prime Minister incessantly—his Labor colleagues. He refused to declare what was happening in a multimillion dollar scheme of a multimillion dollar company.
The Labor Party has the audacity to come in here and, through the politics of envy, pick on what Senator Faulkner called before `millionaires row'. The problem the Labor Party and, unfortunately, the Australian Democrats have is that they believe that every minister in a coalition government should be a failure like their own—a person who has never employed people, a person who has never had to pay the rent, a person who has never had to pay the wages of other people, a person who has never had to pay other people before they pay themselves. To have self-made successful people in a coalition government is somehow a sin.
The other standards that they failed to comply with are also the standards that they are now asking our government to comply with. I want to run through a couple of things. In 1992 Senator Richardson was censured by the Senate. But let me start before then: 1973, Senator Murphy; 1974, Senator Gair; 1974, Senator Willessee; 1984, Senator Walsh; 1989, Senator Cook; 1989, Senator Richardson; 1989, Senator McKiernan, who at that stage was the Government Deputy Whip; 1990, Senator Tate; 1991, Senator Richardson again; 1992, Senator Richardson again; 1992, the Prime Minister; 1993, the then Senator Gareth Evans; 1994, Senator McMullan; 1994, Mr Brereton, the then Minister for Transport; 1995, the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Gareth Evans, and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Collins, were all censured; 1995, Mr Lee and then Senator McMullan; 1995, Senator Bolkus; 1995, again Senator Gareth Evans; and of course most recently—only last sitting week—Senator Bolkus for giving out the Skase material.
These are all Labor Party senators and members who have been censured by the parliament who did not walk the plank. Why 
 didn't they walk the plank? Here we have a case where no case has been proven of any conflict of interest. Senator Parer has put the information into his declaration, unlike Prime Minister Keating, and they are wanting him to go.
—And still hasn't done it.
—Senator Ray is someone for whom I have a great deal of respect. Senator Ray, I believe it is up to you now to explain to the Senate why your colleagues did not walk the plank when they should have. Why was it that Minister Lee refused to abide by the Westminster tradition by refusing to resign after knowingly misleading the parliament about an alleged secret deal to change the cross-media ownership rules? Why did Senator Faulkner and Mr Beddall refuse to resign after the woodchipping debacle? Why did Minister Tickner refuse to resign after the Hindmarsh Island bridge court decision? Why did Minister Brereton refuse to resign after the scandals of Seaview, the Australian National Line and the third runway debacles?
Minister Collins should have also resigned over the pay television decision and the failed drought policy. He also failed to live up to his commitment to resign if waterfront reform did not continue. We are still waiting for that because he still has not gone. He is still hanging on the payroll here, but he certainly did not resign after that. Mr Crean refused to resign after comparing AIDS patients to child molesters and paedophiles. It is just beyond a joke. Senator Cook refused to resign after altering a Hansard answer. Senator Bolkus refused to resign after appointing a Labor candidate to the Immigration Review Tribunal.
The list goes on. Unfortunately, I probably do not have time to finish it. Former Prime Minister Keating refused to resign despite having told untruths to the Australian people at the 1993 election. Do you remember what he was saying? He said, `The l-a-w tax cuts. You don't need a GST. We'll give you the tax cuts that the coalition's offering, but you don't have to have a GST.' He got elected and then said, `Whoops, sorry, you're not 
 going to have the l-a-w tax cuts.' What is Mr Beazley doing today? He is saying, `We'll give you the tax cuts but we won't give you a GST.' Here we go again.
Former Treasurer Dawkins refused to resign after covering up the Victorian and South Australian loan affairs deal. Senator Beahan refused to resign from the parliament after his involvement in the Brian Burke affair. Minister Baldwin did not resign after a $2 million fraud in the Department of Social Security. Prime Minister Hawke refused to resign after misleading the parliament over gold tax. In 1992 Carmen Lawrence refused to resign after the Notre Dame scandal in Western Australia. She still refused to resign even after the royal commission in Western Australia said she was untruthful. And here is the Labor Party saying that Minister Parer should resign purely and simply because he has been successful and is successful. He is doing the correct job in his portfolio and for the people of Australia.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Minister for Resources and Energy</title>,Matters of Public Importance,11,1
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,1998-03-23,"—We have come to expect low standards from this government in their approach to public life. But we did not expect the secretary of the premier department, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, to seminally endorse those attitudes. The real question in this matter of public importance today is: why didn't the secretary pick up the problems in Senator Parer's declaration? When you read Senator Parer's declaration to the Prime Minister today, there is an admission of guilt. Senator Parer and his spouse are fully divesting themselves today, something they should have done on 18 March 1996 but they are finally doing today. That is an absolute admission of guilt by Senator Parer that these shares that he owned involved a conflict of interest.
However, it is not just Mr Max Moore-Wilton that should have picked this up. What about the Prime Minister? Senator Hill came into this chamber on 15 October 1996 and said in addition to an answer that the Prime Minister required that all ministers provide their returns—disclosure of interest—to him by 27 May 1996 and that the Prime Minister had indicated that he had looked at those 
 returns when they came in. Here we have the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, back in May 1996 saying that he examined all the forms of his ministers. So he knew 21 months ago. He knew what Senator Parer held 21 months ago, several months before Mr Max Moore-Wilton came into the job at Prime Minister and Cabinet. So John Howard knew 21 months ago.
It is not as though Senator Parer did not get the hint. When he was pinged on Meet the Press on 26 May 1996, he proudly said, `There'll be no conflict of interest. I've got rid of my BHP and Santos shares.' He did not let us in on the secret that he had coal shares, just that he had got rid of those in public companies, those which have a register that we could discover his shareholdings on. So he gets rid of those—not great performers at the time—but he keeps the key performance ones.
For whatever transparency that might exist in this system, the one way that we are entitled to know whether a conflict of interest exists or not is on the Senate register. He has failed to declare his coalmining interests on the Senate register. This was revealed 12 days ago, so what does he do when he comes in here today and is asked? He has not even bothered to update it in the last 12 days. He has had 12 days to get his affairs in order. What is he eventually going to do? Having divested himself of all this, is he then going to virtually put in a nil return to the registrar of pecuniary interests or not? Is he going to go back and detail what he should have done in the last two years so everyone can have a look at what he has been up to for the last two years? I think not.
The Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet had all this material. He did not have all the testimonials that have flooded in today. Why did he not ask for them? Why over that critical period 7 May and 9 May did he not query Senator Parer's holdings and challenge them? After all, he is a former member of the Australian Stock Exchange. That was his last job before he came over to the department. Surely he knew the implications of that. Surely he knew that having a minister for energy and minerals 
 holding coal shares is simply not on in terms of the Prime Minister's guidelines.
But, to make matters worse, today we have Senator Parer, having admitted guilt in his letter to the Prime Minister and on Friday divested himself of all these interests, again breaking the prime ministerial guidelines which specifically say you cannot divest to family members or a nominee. Having embarrassed the Prime Minister by having shares that involve a conflict of interest, his very disposal of those shares breaches yet another prime ministerial guideline. How long is this to go on? How long is Senator Parer going to be in a position to defy his Prime Minister?
We have the unseemly timing today of Senator Parer coming into this chamber and tabling certain documents. We knew about this. We knew about this at about half past 12. Why? Because Senator Parer's office had got on to the media and said he was going to do it at 10 minutes to two simply so we could not examine those documents before question time. That did not help him much. None of the stuff covered in those documents reflected on the very questions we were going to ask here today—not one of them reflected—although it gave us material for question No. 7; there is no doubt whatsoever about that.
So we have a position, but Senator Hill comes in here and says, `This is all class envy. This is all envy of someone who has been successful.' We have the old lines run: this family trust is 28 years old. For heaven's sake, this deal, this issue of 16 shares, was done in 1993 when Senator Parer was a shadow minister. We go back to 1990 when he gets out of Gashbah, the other company, and his spouse says, `He's got out of that.' That was not because they owed East Court $250,000 on call—no, that was not the reason. He got out of that because of increasing pressure of parliamentary duties, but he still has time to chair this company. He still has time to pay $16 for 16 C-class shares. They keep saying these are non-voting shares. For heaven's sake, the dividend on these shares is bigger than the ordinary shares. For Senator Parer to come in here today and say he has been advised that these shares may be worth $2 for the totality, having had an income 
 stream of $850,000 over the last five years, is laughable. The implication of that is, if he disposes of the shares, his mates who have been giving him the $850,000 are no longer going to give their new shareholders anything.
What has he done to earn this particular amount of money, $850,000 fully franked? What has he done, if he has had no contact with the company? They are non-voting shares and he does not play a role, but he still gets the money. They object to our saying these shares are worth $2 million. Because it is a private company, the only way of establishing the worth of the shares is to take the net asset of the company and divide it by the percentage held; then you get to $2.3 million. But, more importantly, go to the income stream and see what that tells you. If you had to get the same income stream fully franked from BHP, you would have to own $9 million worth of shares to get that money, or you would have to own 4.2 million Telstra shares or 1.2 million Santos shares to get that same dividend stream.
We have a position. This is not a matter of class envy or anything else; this is a minister who has been given the honour of representing himself in government, and what is involved there is the occasional small sacrifice. One of the sacrifices is you do not own shares directly within your portfolio area. That is a sacrifice you have to make if you come into government. If you are not willing to make it, do not serve on the front bench. The fact is he has survived not because there is not a conflict of interest but because we are told he is a nice guy. I agree with that, but Brian Gibson was a nice guy and Jim Short was a nice guy. What distinguishes Senator Parer from them? They were small time petty offenders. They owned $50,000 or $60,000 worth of shares, not $2 million worth of shares. So the nice guy defence simply does not work in this particular case.
Senator Parer has not come into this chamber and properly defended himself. He called one press conference last week. He excluded the radio journalists and excluded the print journalists. When the electronic television journalists filmed his press secretary throwing out a photographer, he then turned around and 
 said, `If any of you run that footage, you're barred from now on.' What sort of approach is that to public life? All this has occurred because Mr Max Moore-Wilton has ticked him off. He is a partisan political appointment. He should do the right thing: he should go in the library, write out his letter of resignation and go back to the Stock Exchange because he has been induced in some way to endorse this absolute sham of approach.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Minister for Resources and Energy</title>,Matters of Public Importance,11,1
"O'Chee, Sen Bill",NP,1998-03-23,"—If you had paid any attention to the media lead-up to today, you would have thought this was going to be one of the grand show trials of the century. For example, today's Canberra Times —which obviously relied upon the media statements of the opposition yesterday—has the headline `New Parer allegation: Crean', and the opening paragraph says:
The row surrounding Resources Minister Warwick Parer deepened yesterday with claims that he has failed to disclose another family company—
That was very interesting, because the family company to which the reference is made was a company in which the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer) had no shareholding. He had no shareholding, but that did not bother these people opposite. We have seen time and time again that they never bother to get the facts right before they run off with one of these allegations. I understand it was Senator Parer's son, but that has never bothered them.
We saw the conduct of Senator Faulkner in relation to the Baillieu family. He did not bother who he happened to name. These people just happened to be dead for 53 years, yet that was the basis of another Labor Party allegation. They were going to dump a bucket all over Senator Parer because they said he had not disclosed a company, and it turned out that he did not even have any shares in the company. That is how thorough their research is. Heaven help us! Thank goodness none of those people over there are practising medical doctors. Could you imagine going to Senator Faulkner if he was a GP? If you had bubonic plague, he would probably tell you to take an aspirin and go home because he would not bother to check properly. These 
 people never bothered to check once all of the allegations they went on with.
I think it is interesting to note the standard that they set in government. That is very interesting. Let us look at the former Prime Minister. These people on the other side want to talk about conflict of interest; let us talk about the former Prime Minister. What sort of disclosure did we have from the former Prime Minister in relation to his interests in a piggery? None. He mentioned—
—It will not get a run.
—You are right, Senator Ray; the piggery will not go away. Why won't the piggery go away? Because it is a gleaming example of the hypocrisy of the Labor Party and the hypocrisy of the former Prime Minister. What was his declaration of interest in relation to that piggery? He told the parliament via his declaration of interest that he had shares in a company called Euphron Pty Ltd. Of course, he did not mention that that company had interests in other companies and an interest principally in a massive piggery joint venture with a foreign company while he was Prime Minister. He did not make any mention of the fact that, during the period that this was all being planned, the Foreign Investment Review Board guidelines were changed so that this company would not have to apply for permission from the Foreign Investment Review Board to make that investment. That is the standard of disclosure we saw from those people when they were in government.
Isn't it interesting that it has all gone quiet over there? They are shamed by the actions of the people whom they elected to occupy the front benches when they were in government. When we were in opposition, we looked across here and it was like looking at rogues' gallery. Senator Knowles has already outlined to the Senate the number of Labor ministers who were censured by this parliament and who refused to resign. They could be censured for the most blatant misleading of the Senate and they would refuse to resign. They could be censured for the most outrageous conduct and they would refuse to resign. Of course, in every one of those cases, it was not just allegations that were made; 
 cases were built up over a period of time which were irrefutable. That is why censure motions were passed—because the cases were irrefutable. So these people were convicted by the court of the Senate, but they sat in here on the front bench.
In the Labor days, the front bench was like one long defendants' dock because every one of them had a charge sheet. Importantly, most of them were actually convicted, but they still sat in here on the front bench, they still received the title `The Honourable', they still received the salary and they still received all the perks because they never bothered about proper propriety. And why would you bother about proper propriety when your leader, the Prime Minister, was the biggest rorter of the scheme who ever existed? He was the biggest rorter of the scheme of parliamentary disclosure who ever sat in this parliament.
We had instances where the Prime Minister would deny that his interest in the joint venture piggery with Danpork had ever been subject to any ministerial discussions. We later unearthed—and Senator Crane was there and he is aware of it—minutes of meetings between Mr Crean, who is now one of the chief accusers of Senator Parer, and the Danish agriculture minister showing they discussed the joint venture piggery in which the Prime Minister of Australia had an interest.
—And remember the Commonwealth Bank?
—And the Commonwealth Bank. But, Senator Crane, the interesting thing is the subject of the discussions between then Minister Crean, now accuser Crean—he seems to think he is judge, jury and executioner all rolled into one—and the Danish agriculture minister. The subject of those discussions was the importation of pig semen and genetic material contrary to the then existing quarantine guidelines for the benefit of the then Prime Minister's interest in a joint venture piggery. Of course, none of the people opposite thought this was a bad thing at the time. They all thought it was rather good because they kept on coming in here and saying what a wonderful Prime Minister he was. His only interest as Prime 
 Minister was in himself and he flagrantly failed to disclose to this parliament at any time the depth of his financial interest in that venture—an interest that ran to millions and millions of dollars. I think it was a $50 million joint venture and he had a substantial interest in it. He did a substantial multimillion dollar deal with a foreign company whilst he was Prime Minister, and then that foreign company used the Danish agriculture minister to lobby this government to try to change the quarantine requirements which exist for the protection of this country—
—Prepared to put an industry at risk.
—Yes, he was prepared to put an industry at risk. Why? Because it would benefit himself. These people opposite have the audacity to come in here after trumpeting around this nation that they are going to bring new accusations against Minister Parer, and what happens? They got the wrong company. They got the wrong Parer. What is new? They have had it wrong, wrong, wrong, time and time and time again, and all it goes to show is that they are the ones who need the change in the front bench because they cannot perform.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1998-03-23,"—I am disappointed that Senator Murray has not rejoined us yet for the debate. I am hoping that he will get here because we were involved in a bit of a discussion about the amendments that the Democrats will be moving. Senator Murray was concerned that we seemed to have a lack of understanding 
 about both this legislation and trusts in general.
If I can re-cap where I was before. We were discussing how much tax a company, a PAYE individual and a trust with two beneficiaries was paying. The comparisons for $50,000 were: $18,000 for the company; $14,000 for the PAYE individual; and for the two beneficiaries of the trust, a grand total of $9,044. That is half the tax of a company and about a third of the tax less than a PAYE individual. And they say, `Why do we want to have trusts? Why is it such a big issue that anybody has got trusts? What is the problem?' As John Moore said in that other chamber, `If you have not got a unit trust, you are just a public sector bludger.' We will tell you who the bludgers are. That is what involved here.
The bigger the number of beneficiaries, the bigger the tax avoidance. That is why Senator Murray and the Democrats are reprehensible for the amendments which they are moving here. If a company earns $100,000, it pays $36,000 in tax. If you are a PAYE earner, you pay $37,000 in tax. But if you have a trust with two beneficiaries, the total tax paid is $28,204.
—On a point of order: Senator Murray is not here, but I ask whether it is parliamentary to say that moving an amendment is `reprehensible'. Is that not an unparliamentary reflection?
—They are sensitive on these trusts.
—Order! It is a debating remark.
—So a trust with an income of $100,000, with just two beneficiaries—perhaps a husband and a wife—pays $28,000 compared to $37,000 if you are a PAYE earner or $36,000 if you are a company. But if you have four beneficiaries—and Senator Murray stood up earlier today and said, `No, mine is just two beneficiaries; two children, me and my wife'—with an income of $100,000, the total tax paid is $18,000 compared to $37,000 for the same PAYE earner. Who are the bludgers, John Moore? Who is avoiding paying tax?
It gets worse. At Thredbo recently—you were there, Senator Kemp, and I am sure you were involved—Peter Costello said that the existing rules encourage the wealthy, and business, to chase tax breaks rather than real job creating investments. He also said:
Wage and salary earners do not generally have the opportunity to exploit tax loopholes in the same way.
. . .              . . .             . . .
The tax is paid by their beneficiaries, not by the actual trust. The key to their appeal is that they allow the well-off to legally exploit the $5,400 tax free income limit . . . 
In their simplest form, family trusts can turn a high income of $200,000 a year—
so here is a $200,000 example—
into a middle income of $50,000, split four ways—
—Just refresh my memory; R & D syndicates—how did you vote on R&D syndicates?
—Order!
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. Assuming there is no other income and that there are four beneficiaries—two children, the breadwinner and the spouse—each beneficiary pays $14,000 in tax, plus $750 for the Medicare levy. The total family tax bill comes to $59,408, or an effective tax rate of just under 30 per cent. So the trust with four beneficiaries—Senator Murray—pays tax, if earning $200,000, of just under 30 per cent. If that $200,000 were assessed in the hands of the chief breadwinner, the tax bill would come to $84,000, plus the Medicare levy of $3,000, that is, an effective tax rate of almost 44 per cent. That is right: you have a choice between a 30 per cent tax rate, if you are in a trust, and 44 per cent, if you are a poor mug PAYE earner.
What the government and the Democrats are doing today is opening the loophole further. They will tell you that the Taxation Laws Amendment (Trust Loss and Other Deductions) Bill 1997 is about being tough on family trusts. I say to ACOSS and those other welfare groups which are involved in discussions with the government and business over the GST and a tax package that this govern 
 ment is not serious about taxing trusts. The loopholes in this bill are a disgrace.
The government have already ruled out negative gearing—they will not touch it. They are opening the gap for families to traffic in trust losses in this bill. They say, `Trafficking in trust losses is a terrible thing. We'll stop it. but if you are a family, that's okay, you can turn around and open up all sorts of extra provisions under this legislation,' which was not our legislation. That is what is going on with trusts in this bill. And Senator Murray is making it worse. The Democrats' position is to open up further holes for families to traffic in trust losses—quite extraordinary.
The evidence given before the Senate committee contradicted the Treasurer who stood up and said, `We had the Labor bill and this is what the gains were going to be. This is the new bill and this is what the gains are going to be. We are going to gain more money than the Labor Party would have under the same bill.' That was an untruth. The Treasurer misled the parliament. We had a Treasury official say before the Senate estimates committee, `Actually, more money will be lost under the new bill than under the previous Labor bill.' That is the truth of this bill. That is what they do not want the public to know.
Senator Parer probably put the cat among the pigeons last week when he talked about effective tax planning. He had been advised to set up his share plan, as he described it, because lawyers had told him that this was the best way to effectively minimise his tax. It is completely legal, but I call it a rort.
—It is avoidance.
—It is avoidance. That is what this lot are about. They are about opening up the rules so that there is more tax avoidance. The irony is, as George Megalogenis pointed out in an article in the Australian  on 4 March, that the tax office has exposed this. Quite by accident, the tax office produced a report into the compliance costs of the taxation system. They found—I will quote from the article in the Australian —that:
The second headache for Howard arising from the ATO report was the evidence that a huge slice 
 of the present tax compliance costs suffered by small business was self-inflicted.
The report revealed that small businesses run through a trust structure faced double the tax compliance costs of those run as a sole trader, partnership or company.
Twice the costs. Why would you do that? Why would you voluntarily agree to pay twice the costs by setting up as a trust? The article continues:
The results shocked the ATO, which thought the red tape costs of a trust and company would be similar. The only conclusion that can be drawn is that small businesses using trusts are spending a lot of extra money on lawyers and accountants to get around the tax laws.
The whistle has been blown by the tax office. Trusts are being used by small business to avoid tax. Half your frontbench are avoiding tax. That is the reality.
—Oh, come off it!
—Nothing illegal. I am not accusing anyone of doing anything illegal. `Effective tax planning' I believe it is referred to as in the industry. That is what is going on here. And we have had the Treasurer claiming, `We will do a study. We will get Treasury, we will get Ken Henry with that magnificent memory of his. He is the head of that task force. We will get him in and he will do the report.' All of a sudden the report has vanished. Where is it? It has been subsumed. We do not want to see the study on trusts, do we? Half your frontbench would have to hang their heads in shame if that study came out.
—They know no shame.
—If they knew any shame. Thank you, Senator Bolkus. If they knew any shame, they would hang their heads in shame. You have seen the tax commissioner stand up and also blow the whistle on trusts. He recently said that he had discovered that massive tax avoidance was being used by people setting up trusts. I quote from Mr Carmody's speech to CIDA:
However, our examination does reveal that during the 1995 income year alone the total amount of tax free distributions from reserves to beneficiaries of the trusts was around $50 million. In one case, an amount of $19m was distributed to a wealthy individual.  

No tax—distributed from a trust. How did that happen? He continues:
In another case, a wealthy individual received distributions of $5m per annum over at least three years from trusts.
No tax. Our bill was moving towards dealing with these. You have opened up the loopholes again. Mr Carmody continues:
As noted these are extreme examples of the types of tax benefits available to taxpayers using trusts.
But he goes on:
It should be noted however that the tax advantages of trusts are not restricted to high wealth individuals.
To get away with this, you do not have to be one of the people earning millions and millions; you just have to be a small business. As the tax office report on compliance costs shows, you just have to be a small business. What has John Howard said? And what has Senator Kemp said? `Oh, we are not going to do anything about taxing trusts if you are a legitimate small business. No, that is way out of line.' Well, that is where the majority of the avoidance is.
So if you are fair dinkum when you meet with ACOSS and with the churches, and you want to convince them on a GST, you cannot duck the issues like negative gearing but you are certainly not going to get away with ducking the issues on trusts.
—Did he say negative gearing? I cannot believe that.
—You are not going to get away with family trusts. As I said, it is a pity Senator Murray is not here to respond. I would like to refer to a document I have just been passed which confirms the point I made before. In the Senate estimates committee, Senator Cook asked:
Does the new family trust concession mean that, for example, wealthy families can continue to traffic in losses incurred by their family trusts within the extended family group?
Mr Manoranjan answered:
. . . within that family group, and within companies and trusts that form part of that family group, you could transfer losses without falling foul of the legislation.  

What a fraud you lot are. This was a bill to stop trafficking in trust losses. And what do you see happening?
—You are supporting the bill; hasn't someone told you?
—Yes, we are going to support it, because this is at least going in the right direction. But it is not the bill we put up. I will be voting for it, because at least it is going to stop some of the traffic in trust losses. But what it does and what should be on the public record is that you have opened up a massive hole for families to continue to traffic. They do not even have to be two individuals; they can have a corporate entity set up in their trust and they can pass the trust losses around. I will just finish Mr Manoranjan's quote. Senator Cook went on to ask him:
What is the difference in the effect on revenue of the first proposal and now the second proposal?
—Why don't you quote everything Peter Cook said?
—I am quoting Mr Manoranjan—your tax office official, your Treasury official:
. . . but that positive impact is the sum of some negative impacts because of the fact that these trusts could not merge profits and losses and some positive impacts which arose from some adjustments that were made to the previous revenue estimates.
. . .              . . .             . . .
Subsequently, we realised that that the ongoing losses that were made by trusts could also be trafficked and therefore this gave to a positive figure, additional revenue.
. . .              . . .             . . .
Under the second set of proposals, by then we had refined the estimates because of information received and that again gave rise to an increase in revenue. The minus in revenue stems from the fact that there could be no transfers between trusts between the same family group and that gives you a minus figure.
He goes on:
Without going into an accurate estimation, I would say the general impact would be a slight reduction in revenue.
So there you are. The Treasury official who worked on this blew the whistle on your 
 rhetoric where you said that your bill would pull in more revenue than our bill. And you have tried to pretend that that is the case and you have maintained that for months, but you know it is not true. And you know it is not true because you opened up a massive avenue for tax avoidance within families under the guise of Senator Parer, for example, complaining, `Oh, I should be allowed to pass all my dividend income on to my children. I should be allowed to distribute it freely into the family trust so that my income can be called their income and I do not have to pay any tax on it.' Well, that may be how you see the world.
There are all these screams of `It's about envy', but no, it is about paying your tax when you should. That is why Carmody is leading the charge. That is why the tax office has blown the whistle on you. That is why the Treasury official has blown the whistle on you—because they have to sit and watch while you mouth the rhetoric to ACOSS and everybody else that you want to make the tax system fairer. This bill could have gone a lot further than it does. Senator Murray's amendment and your amendments to our original bill are a disgrace, and you should be willing to go back to the original Labor bill.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (TRUST LOSS AND OTHER DEDUCTIONS) BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,1998-03-23,"—I rise to make a brief contribution with regard to the bills before the Senate. Unlike Senator Conroy I have to declare an interest in this, because I actually do have a property trust.
—Oh, resign!
—I suppose you have one too, Senator Kemp; I wouldn't know. I wish that the measures we proposed with this legislation in 1995 were the ones we are debating now, because I think we would have at least taken some reasonable steps towards bringing about changes to taxation laws that would have some meaning. What is proposed by the government and, as pointed out by Senator Conroy, what is proposed by way of amendment by the Democrats, is going to achieve very little, if anything, in taxation reform.
 This government has been applying rhetoric to the debate about taxation reform. You 
 talk about introducing a GST—lumping that on the battlers of this country; but you are not prepared in any way, shape or form to address this question of tax avoidance through trafficking in trust losses. It is simply not acceptable. When this legislation does finally go to the vote I will be voting for it; but I wish that I was voting for something much stronger. I will not be supporting the Democrats' amendment. Hopefully, one day, we will see decent legislation brought into this parliament that will actually deal with the type of tax avoidance problems that do occur as a result of trafficking in trust losses.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (TRUST LOSS AND OTHER DEDUCTIONS) BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1998-03-23,"—I will respond briefly to the comments which have been raised on this legislation. First of all, let me make a couple of points in relation to Senator Conroy's speech. It occurred to me that there should be a standing order against overacting and, if there had been, Senator Conroy would have been warned, at least once or twice—and then thrown out. I have never heard such a lot of nonsense in all my life. I had to remind Senator Conroy that he was supporting the bill. He seemed to have forgotten that until I reminded him about two-thirds of the way through his speech, and a look of surprise came over his face. But Senator Conroy, that is your party's position on this.
And then Senator Conroy got into an absolute lather about tax avoidance. It occurred to me, as I thought back, Mr Acting Deputy President, that when we brought in, for example, the measures on R&D syndicates—which of course was a major hole and being exploited in the taxation system—the Labor Party, led by Senator Cook, fought us tooth and nail. When we brought in the measure on the superannuation surcharge—which was to bring greater equity to the superannuation system—we looked in vain for support from the Labor Party. This was a surcharge on higher income earners, and the Labor Party went missing in action. Then I remembered the debate on the infrastructure bonds: boy, were you blokes woolly on that one, too.
So, Senator Conroy, it is all very well to run these lines. It is good class war stuff, and 
 it might excite the troops back home when you post a copy of your speech to the local branches. But the local branches should be aware that when the Labor Party is tested on tax avoidance, it has always been my experience that they go missing in action. When we seek, as we did with the superannuation surcharge, to bring greater equity to the system, you guys are nowhere to be seen; in fact, you fought it tooth and nail. Then I thought that Senator Conroy—
—You are making the poor pay for it; you are making the poor pay to collect your tax.
—Oh, he is still opposing the surcharge on higher income earners—well, thank you for that; we will get that recorded as well.
And then, for reasons totally unknown to me and, I am sure, to my advisers—and I shall read the Senate Hansard closely—Senator Conroy brought up the issue of negative gearing. Last week the Labor Party made a total goose of itself over that issue, as you are well aware. Gary Evans raised this issue on the radio—
—Use his correct title, please.
—It's Roddy Kemp; go Roddy.
—Oh, sorry—Gareth. All I can say is when I went to university with former Senator Evans, he was called Gary. Then he became Gareth. If you feel that it is a name that we should be referring to him as, I will call him Gareth. I do not want to cause offence. But I have to tell you, in the days of yore—well before your time Senator Conroy, because you are too young—he was well known as Gary.
—The protocol, Senator Kemp, is to use a member's correct title.
—The shadow Treasurer did raise the issue of negative gearing and, as I said in question time, did we have an inkling here of a Labor Party tax policy! And what happened? Within 24 hours, there was another one of these ungracious backflips, a la death duties, as this was ruled out by the 
 shadow Treasurer. So Senator Conroy, the Labor Party has got form—and it is not form which gives anyone any confidence that the Labor Party is serious on the issue of tax avoidance because, as I said, you go missing in action each time these issues are raised.
Senator Conroy also said how upset he was about trusts; trust was such an important guiding issue to the Labor Party; and then there was what he sees as the misuse of trusts. Let me make two points on that: I do wish you would give a consistent message to all those people who come to see you, because I have to say that there are a lot of people around who thought the Labor Party was going to pick up some of their views and attempt to modify this bill.
—The battlers in Brighton? They are up in arms at you.
—No it was not the battlers. It was the big end of town, which so fascinates you people.
—The battlers of Brighton are up in arms at you.
—No, it was not the battlers. As they come to see you, you give them one message; then, of course, you came into this chamber and give a totally different message. I did make the point today that the Labor Party has this huge dilemma that because it believes in nothing it will say anything, and that is true on negative gearing, on death duties, on trusts. My second point on trusts I was going to make for you—
—Have you got one?
—This is so important to you. You are so opposed to trusts. The Labor Party, apparently, was so opposed to the use of trusts. It did occur to me to wonder how long it took the Labor Party—13 years in government—to bring in its legislation on trusts. Thirteen years—so there is this massive concern that Senator Conroy evinced, and how long did it take the Labor Party to do anything about it? Well, of course, they did not. By the time they had brought it in, the Labor Party was history as a government—as it should have been. We indicated, when that bill came in, that we would accept the starting date, but we wanted to make sure there was 
 proper consultation in the wider community, and that certainly occurred.
Senator Conroy, what I have to say about all this rhetoric and all this passion is that when you examine the history, when you examine the taxation system which you left to us—which we are now trying to repair—I would have thought a modicum of modesty would have prevented you from getting up and carrying on like a goose. It is not as though I have done much research on my response to your speech but, as you spoke, the lines were so desperately obvious.
It was an extraordinary speech. It struck me that it completely lacked any understanding of the history of his party on issues to do with trusts and issues to do with tax avoidance. Let me quote one further example. How dead serious is the Labor Party on tax avoidance? After 13 years in office, what did they discover during the election campaign? Remember all that? They discovered high wealth individuals. After 13 years in office, this was suddenly raised by the then Prime Minister.
The truth of the matter is the Labor Party is not serious on tax. The Labor Party has not got a clue where to go on tax. That is why you get yourself into such trouble. You have not got a clue what to do. It would be a good thing, rather than making these sorts of speeches, Senator Conroy, if you and your colleagues sat down and did some jolly hard work on taxation because the community is noting that, every time the contributions are made by your leaders and your senior people, they last for a brief period of time before they are reversed by Mr Beazley or reversed by the heavyweights in the party.
I listened to Senator Cook's remarks very carefully, as I always do, because he is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in this chamber. Senator Cook said:
. . . the tax system needs constant repair and some occasional renovation.
Was that correct, Senator Cook? I wondered if you were going to provide further enlightenment on the tax policy of the Labor Party, but you did not. Again, Senator Cook did not make it crystal clear to people listening that the Labor Party was supporting this bill before the chamber—as it should. I think a lot 
 of people will look with great interest at the remarks on trusts which a number of Labor senators have made in the course of debating this bill.
—Deny they are not true; come on. Deny it is about income splitting.
—Let me clarify that: on the pointers it gives to Labor Party policy. Let me make that quite clear, Senator Conroy, because people will examine very closely what you have said.
—What about Costello? Encouraging the wealthy to chase tax breaks. That's your Treasurer—your boss.
—You lost your right to take part in taxation debates when you voted against the superannuation surcharge. That was a fair measure to make sure that higher income people pay a surcharge. Senator Conroy, you opposed that. You strongly supported—
—They are not going to pay it. They have already packaged all of it. You have hit two million people by $70,000 paying the surcharge.
—We know why you are opposing it, Senator Conroy. This is a different debate, so I will not be so ungracious as to raise it in this chamber.
—Order! It would help, Senator Kemp, if you directed your remarks through the chair.
—Thank you for that advice, Mr Acting Deputy President. The purpose of the trust loss measures is to restrict the recruitment of losses and other deductions of trusts in order to prevent the transfer of the tax benefit to the losses. This occurs when a person who did not bear the economic effect of a loss when it was incurred by the trust obtains the benefit as a result of the trust's ability to deduct the loss. The proposed measures which are before this chamber will prevent a significant erosion of the tax base that would otherwise arise from the transfer of tax benefit of trust losses. There are no provisions in the income tax law similar to those which apply to companies which effec 
 tively regulate the deductibility of trust losses against current and future income.
`During the debate some non-government speakers raised concerns about the time taken to introduce this legislation into the parliament. I think that it is important to recall that the delay has largely been a result of the government's desire to consult widely on this important item of legislation, which the government did. The consultation has resulted in legislation that takes account of the legitimate concerns of taxpayers while preserving and, in some respects, improving the integrity of the measures.
In the debate, some non-government senators raised concerns about the government's decision to change the application of the income injection test to family trusts. People will look very closely to see what the Labor Party's policy is on family trusts as we go to the next election. I think that people will be reading very closely what was said. In making the change in relation to family trusts, the government has recognised a concern raised by small business—that not allowing family members to inject their income into their own family trusts was unfair.
We consulted very widely on this bill. It was a great pity that Senator Conroy was not better informed before he gave us that earlier performance this afternoon, which may well come back and haunt him, I suspect. The changes made to the income injection test fully implement the policy that the tax benefit of trust losses should be able to be transferred only within a family group. This policy was recognised in part in the previous government's legislation which allowed individual family members to inject their income into their family trust.
Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, normally one likes to thank senators for their contribution in the second reading debate. I am not sure that I could make that comment in all sincerity but, out of deference to you, we welcome the chance to debate this very important bill.
—Order! Senator Cook has moved an amendment to the second reading of the bill, to which Senator Margetts has moved an amend 
 ment. I put the question that the amendment moved by Senator Margetts be agreed to.
A division having been called and the bells having been rung—
—I am not quite sure whether this is necessary but, in view of everything, I am going to err on the side of caution by indicating to the Senate, as my register of interests shows, that I have one share in a private company, of which my wife is the sole director, which is the trustee of the Ian Macdonald family trust. I disclose that to the Senate.
—I advise the Senate of my interest in the family trust which is outlined in my registration of interests.
—Similar to Senator Ellison, I draw to the attention of the Senate my declaration of interests with regard to the Tambling family trust.
—I draw the Senate's attention to the family trust which looks after my farm.
—I also draw attention to my family trust, which is part of the family farm.
—I was the potential beneficiary of a family trust. I no longer am.
—I refer the Senate to my declaration of interests.
—I also draw the Senate's attention to my declaration of two family trusts.
—I also draw the Senate's attention to my declaration of interests.
—I likewise draw attention to the fact that I am the potential beneficiary of a discretionary trust, as declared in my declaration of interests, but I have no vested interest.
—I draw the Senate's attention to my declaration of interests.
—I draw the Senate's attention to my declaration of pecuniary interests.
—If it is necessary—and I do not think it should be—I draw attention 
 to my interest in the Bill Heffernan family trust. If Robert Ray would like to take a share in it, I would give serious consideration to putting him into it as well. He can have a share of the drought stricken farm.
—I refer to and repeat the particulars set out in my declaration of interests.
—I seek to do the same as Senator Alston.
—I draw the Senate's attention to my register of interests and the family trust therein.
—I draw the Senate's attention to my register of interests.
—I also draw the Senate's attention to my register of interests statements.
—Madam President, I should point out that every senator in this place is the potential beneficiary of a discretionary trust, depending on what decisions the trustees take in any particular year.

"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,1998-03-23,"—We are debating the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997 [No. 2] . This bill represents attempt No. 2 by this government to try to break yet another election promise. It represents attempt No. 2 by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Peter Reith, to deny a section of the Australian work force a fundamental right: the right to appeal against unfair, harsh or unreasonable dismissal.
The government's current unfair dismissal provisions apply to all employers, irrespective of size, but the government now wants to give some employers the power to sack some workers unfairly. Once again in this chamber we have an ideologically conceived piece of 
 government legislation which has no empirical, quantitative or qualitative evidence to support it, nor has it any moral or justifiable grounds for its enactment. As I said in the previous debate on this measure, it is nothing more than a con. It is a con on the small business sector and a con on the broader Australian community.
The government's propaganda machine has been working overtime to try to convince the Senate that this legislation is required to secure jobs. That is not right; it is a con. This legislation will add to what is already a concern amongst Australian workers—the issue of growing job insecurity. This legislation will create a two-tier industrial relations system; a system under which employees will be separated into two groups: one with the right to appeal against unfair dismissal and one without the right. The right to appeal against unfair dismissal is a right which, in a world of increasing job insecurity, is crucial for the protection of workers from the behaviour of unscrupulous employers.
The question needs to be asked: why are we revisiting this legislation? The Senate has already made a determination on this matter. Is it because the government truly and honestly believes that this legislation is important? No, it is not. This government is not, nor will it ever be, altruistic or genuinely concerned about the conditions and rights of average Australian workers. This legislation is here for one purpose and one purpose only: as a trigger for a double dissolution. That is the only reason why it is back here.
The government has carefully crafted a strategy whereby a number of pieces of legislation will be used as double dissolution triggers, and this is one of them. This legislation is being used to divert attention from the real trigger—the Wik legislation. The government hopes that this bill will camouflage its actual objective, which is to implement its Wik legislation unamended, via double dissolution, a plan which has been hatched despite the fact that 90 per cent of the Wik legislation has been returned unamended by the Senate.
We have before us a piece of legislation that is part of that strategy. In itself, this legislation is unfair and unjust—important 
 points which have been ignored by this government in what is a cynical attempt to ensure that its election plans are not derailed. In order to ensure that this election strategy works, the government is happy in the course of it to subvert and sabotage the rights of average Australian workers. More recently, the government has revealed another part of the election strategy: the complete sale of Telstra, with more jobs lost and more job insecurity. Another double dissolution trigger is looming.
Let me say from the outset that the Australian Labor Party opposes this bill. We have opposed it before and we continue to oppose it. I reiterate the view that we stated in the Senate minority report that inquired into this government's first attempt to abrogate responsibility to ensure that workers are protected from unfair dismissal. I will quote from what I believe was an excellent minority report. It says:
We have come to the very firm conclusion the proposal in the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill to exempt small business from the unfair dismissal laws is seriously flawed and cannot be supported.
In our view, there are numerous convincing arguments against the proposal, but in essence they can be grouped into 3 core concerns:
1.	 The exemption is an explicit breach of the government's pre-election commitments.
2.	 The exemption is unnecessary.
3.	 The exemption is unfair.
We held that view then and we continue to adhere strongly to it now.
I would like to remind the Senate of a number of undertakings given by both the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business and the Prime Minister concerning the rights of workers—undertakings that obviously we now know are in fact non-core undertakings or non-core promises. I do so to put on record the utter hypocrisy of this government. First of all, let us hear what the now Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business had to say before the last federal election on ABC Daybreak on 28 February 1996. He said:
Look, our position's very clear. If you've been unfairly dealt with at work, then you should have a right of appeal. 

An ambiguity there I would not have thought. That is pretty clear to me. It was certainly clear to him. The Prime Minister stated on the John Laws show on 23 January 1996:
I'm not going to have a law where an unreasonable employer can capriciously sack a decent, hard-working employee.
—Who said that?
—The Prime Minister, Mr Howard, said that. Again, the Prime Minister on the ABC on 25 January 1996 said:
I'm not going to make it open slather. I'm going to replace it—
that is unfair dismissal provisions—
with a law that's fair to both sides so that if you are doing your job properly you can't be capriciously dismissed.
That is what they said before the election. Perhaps the government could save everybody some angst if they indicated from the outset what is in fact a core or non-core promise. I am sure that the Australian people who have suffered from this government's decisions and policy backflips would probably appreciate it. To make this backflip even more questionable, when the unfair dismissal laws were changed over a year ago the government triumphantly heralded what they regarded as a new era with respect to unfair dismissal provisions. The Prime Minister in his 1996 progress report to the people stated:
I am proud to say that the previous government's anti-job unfair dismissal laws have gone. They have been replaced with a simpler, more balanced system that provides a fair go all round.
What is the Prime Minister talking about here? He is talking about the government's own legislation which they are now attempting to amend. I am not sure that those comments were worth making at that point. I go on to Mr Reith, the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, in his speech on the return of the bill from the Senate. He said on 21 November 1996:
We have delivered a workable system for dealing with unfair dismissal . . . and, in doing so, we have expressed an overwhelming community consensus that the previous Brereton system did nothing more than stifle employment growth and create division in the workplace. This was Labor's legacy, and the government has buried it. 

That is from the minister himself. I have restated government undertakings to highlight to the chamber that the government clearly did not see an exemption for small business as being necessary. Indeed, it is crystal clear, as I have pointed out, from the statements made by the Prime Minister and the minister that the purported anti-job effect of the previous law had been, as far as this government was concerned, dealt with and fixed. These undertakings show, I believe, the government's duplicity in introducing this measure not once but twice and shows the utter contempt that this government holds for Australian workers and for its own election commitments and core and non-core promises.
What this government is asking us to do by agreeing to amend its own unfair dismissal legislation—I would like to emphasise that point because I think it is a point that has been lost on the government—is to add to what is already a growing problem of job insecurity in the Australian economy. We are being asked to say to workers in the small business sector that we do not believe that they warrant the same level of protection as workers in other areas. So here we have the two-tier industrial relations system.
We are being asked to say to these workers, `If you are harshly, unreasonably or unfairly dismissed, we don't want to know. It is okay to be discriminated against. It is okay to be sacked capriciously. We just don't want to know about it. We are not going to give you recourse to justice in relation to appealing against what may well be harsh and capricious unfair dismissal.' We are being asked to take away the right of appeal against being unfairly dismissed from one huge section of the Australian work force, a highly significant section of the Australian work force. There will be no protection for those workers, no protection whatsoever.
My colleague in the other place Bob McMullan has highlighted a number of cases which show the importance of unfair dismissal legislation, which I will restate for the record in order so that it is reinforced in terms of our opposition here in the Senate again. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1998-03-23,"—Last week the government announced the winning bids for the Hobart and Launceston airports. The successful bidder in Launceston was Australian Pacific Airports Corporation—a consortium comprising the British airport operator BAA, Axiom, AMP and Utilities Trust of Australia with the Launceston City Council holding an option to acquire 10 per cent. There has been a very strong campaign, as you would know, Mr Acting Deputy President, run by the group called Save Our Airport, a group of local businesses aimed at maximising the level of local ownership in the airport in order that northern Tasmania does not lose out from the sale.
As with a number of federal issues like the Howard government's outrageous plan for aged care, child care cuts, cuts to other government services and a very high level of unemployment, the member for Bass, Mr Warwick Smith, found himself under attack again from his constituents. His response to this pressure appeared in today's Launceston Examiner. It is up to his usual standard, I am afraid to say.
Mr Smith has announced a plan to develop what he described as a Hong Kong style special economic development zone around the Launceston airport. He suggested the zone could contain special bond stores to encourage trade. He said that a committee could be set up to run the zone. Its members would include the Launceston and Northern Midlands municipalities, the new airport owner and the Commonwealth. Not surprisingly, there was a negative reaction from both councils to the Smith plan.
This is clearly another off the top of the head reaction by a politician who is under siege. For a start, there are no free trade zones in Hong Kong. The whole island has no barriers to trade and does not levy any tariff. If he 
 is referring to the Shenzen free trade zone, which is located near Hong Kong, then he had better find another example upon which to draw. That zone has been successful because factory owners who have set up there have been guaranteed minimal supervision of wages, working conditions and safety.
Mr Smith would have also been wise to look at the history of the economic development zone established in the Northern Territory before he launched his plan for the Launceston airport. The Smith type plan was implemented in Darwin with terrible results. There were many breaches of the basic rights and entitlements of the workers in that zone largely by companies from Hong Kong—the very place upon which Mr Smith has based his plan. Those Hong Kong based clothing and textile companies forced their employees to live in very difficult conditions, underpaid them and failed to pay them on time. It was a disaster in every respect.
There was also a plan for the establishment of special Queensland zones floated in the early 1990s. That was quickly replaced with a state wide strategy which, from memory, was called the state wide manufacturing industry scheme. The Queensland government obviously took the view at the time that all manufacturing industries in that state were worthy of government support, not just a select few behind a barb wire fence.
Mr Smith also failed to consult the Australian constitution which prohibits discrimination against states or parts of states and provides for free interstate trade. If Mr Smith was to give Launceston airport a free trade zone he would be required to ensure that anyone else who wanted one could have one. It also appears that Mr Smith has a fair way to go if he is going to convince the key members of the Howard government to support his plan.
The views of the Treasurer, Mr Costello, were spelt out very clearly in an article in the Australian Financial Review in July last year. Mr Costello is quoted as saying:
If I had my way I would not choose a small area here . . . to enjoy those benefits and a small area there. I would choose as much of the country as possible.  

Mr Costello said that the government would not be diverted into `quick fixes' in its management of the economy. For once I agree with Mr Costello.
This idea also received a negative response from Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, Mr Moore. Mr Moore said in relation to a proposal for such a zone in the Newcastle region:
Whether the special free trade zones are the answer or not I am not too sure. I think that is a bit difficult myself.
This is yet another example of Mr Smith not only failing the electors of Bass as their local member but also damaging his already badly damaged reputation amongst his colleagues in the cabinet room. I plan to pursue Mr Smith's free trade zone plan with the relevant ministers to ensure that all Launceston businesses and workers an not disadvantaged. I think that after the next election the electorate of Bass will be a Smith free zone.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Launceston Airport</title>,Adjournment,19,1
