That the time for the Joint Select Committee on Northern Australia to present its final report and recommendations be extended to 1 September 2014.


I understand that the committee have required an extension of time in order to complete some public hearings in the electorate of Lingiari. The government, in wanting to facilitate a bipartisan approach to this important issue of developing Northern Australia, has chosen to extend the reporting time to the beginning of September. I think it will be a good move for the committee and for the parliament.

Mr MORRISON
 (Cook—Minister for Immigration and Border Protection) (09:32):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


The Migration Amendment (Protection and Other Measures) Bill 2014 amends the Migration Act to make changes to the way asylum seekers are assessed, irrespective of their mode of arrival. These are necessary changes required to effectively respond to the evolving challenges in the asylum seeker caseload arising from recent judicial decisions and management of the backlog of illegal maritime arrivals. These changes will enable the Australian public to have confidence in the Australian government's capacity to assess all asylum seekers in Australia using enhanced integrity measures and increased processing efficiency consistent with our election commitments.


These changes to the current protection determination system will improve the integrity of decision making. Australians need to be confident that those who are found to be refugees are in fact who they say they are. If asylum seekers do not cooperate with the government to establish their identity they should not be given the benefit of a protection visa. These amendments will make it clearly the responsibility of a person who comes to this country seeking protection to establish their own claims to be a refugee and to do so at the beginning of the process. It is also time to stop compromising the overall integrity of the visa system by allowing exploitation of the merits review system by applicants who are not genuinely pursuing a protection claim but only interested in extending their time in Australia.


Schedule 1 of the bill improves integrity within the protection status determination process, starting with an amendment which sends a clear message that the ultimate responsibility lies with the asylum seeker to establish their claims for protection and to provide sufficient evidence to support those claims. The bill makes it clear that it is not the responsibility of the department or the Refugee Review Tribunal (the RRT) to make a case for protection on behalf of an asylum seeker. This change will put Australia on a par with like-minded countries including the United States, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. This responsibility will apply to any asylum seeker making claims for protection regardless of whether it is for the purposes of an application for a protection visa or for the purposes of an assessment undertaken as part of an administrative process such as a request for me to consider the exercise of my public interest powers. This responsibility will apply to any asylum seeker making claims for protection regardless of whether it is for the purposes of an application for a protection visa or for the purposes of an assessment undertaken as part of an administrative process such as a request for me to consider the exercise of my public interest powers.


Notwithstanding this amendment, the government acknowledges that there will always be a small number of vulnerable individuals including unaccompanied minors who may not be able to clearly present their claims without assistance. The government will continue to have arrangements in place in order to assist these specific individuals.


In tandem with this, the government is introducing a provision to allow the RRT to draw an adverse inference about the credibility of a protection claim, where an asylum seeker raises a claim or provides evidence at the RRT for the first time, without having a reasonable explanation about why the claims or evidence were not raised before the primary protection visa decision was made. This provision makes it clear that asylum seekers must have a reasonable explanation for presenting claims and evidence during the review process which they could and should have provided earlier. The goal is for all claims to be presented at the earliest opportunity to enable timely, efficient and quality protection outcomes, and to limit any unnecessary delays in finalising assessments. This change will not prevent asylum seekers raising late claims where there were good reasons why they could not do so earlier. What this amendment seeks to prevent are those non-genuine asylum seekers who attempt to exploit the independent merits review process by presenting new claims or evidence to bolster their original unsuccessful claims only after they learn why they were not found to be refugees by the department. In the past, this behaviour has led to considerable delay while new claims are explored. To make it clear, the purpose of this amendment is to ensure that any claim that can be presented at the initial application stage is presented at that stage.


Establishing an applicant's identity is a keystone of making a decision to grant or refuse any visa. This is especially the case for protection visa applicants because their identity, nationality or citizenship can have a direct bearing on whether they engage Australia's protection obligations. Identity in the global age is increasingly complex to determine and many people hold dual or multiple nationalities or seek an advantage from not disclosing their genuine identity. This bill introduces amendments that enhance the process of establishing identity for protection visa applicants, and addresses the ways in which that process has been frustrated in the past. Changes to section 91W of the Migration Act, and the introduction of a new section 91WA, introduce a power to refuse the grant of a protection visa unless the applicant provides documentary evidence of their identity, nationality or citizenship when requested to do so, or has taken reasonable steps to do so. Presenting bogus documents for the purpose of establishing identity will result in refusal of a protection visa application unless the applicant has a reasonable explanation for presenting them and either provides documentary evidence of their identity, nationality or citizenship, or has taken reasonable steps to do so. The same applies to an applicant who has destroyed or discarded identity documents, which has been a common practice of those who have entered Australia illegally, or has caused that to happen at the hands of another person such as a people smuggler.


It is appropriate to refuse a protection visa where an applicant fails or refuses to comply with a request to establish their identity, where it is in fact possible for them to do this. These measures make it clear that Australians expect protection visa applications to be made in good faith, and with full disclosure of identity. However, the proposed changes also respect the fact that in some circumstances, including some cases where a person is stateless, it may not be possible for a protection visa applicant to provide documentary evidence of their identity, nationality or citizenship, even if they want to and have taken all reasonable steps to do so. These changes understand and respect that position. Cooperation in these matters is the key in these cases.


This bill will also repeal the 90-day rule, which has been in effect since 12 December 2005. The amendment will remove both the 90-day time limit for deciding a protection visa application before the department and the RRT, as well as associated requirements for reports to be tabled in parliament giving explanations for those decisions which were not made within the prescribed period.


The bill also inserts section 91WB into the Migration Act. This section puts beyond doubt that an applicant for a protection visa, who is a member of the same family unit of an existing protection visa holder, cannot be granted a protection visa simply on the basis of being a member of the same family. It clarifies, for example, that a person who marries a protection visa holder years after the time they were granted their visa, will not, and should not, be granted that same visa. Family migration is the appropriate pathway in that case. The change also discourages family members of protection visa holders from arriving in Australia, particularly illegally, expecting to be granted a protection visa on the basis of being a family member. This amendment does not change the definition of a 'member of the same family unit'. Nor does it affect the existing ability of a member of the same family unit to apply together with, or have their application combined with, the eventual holder of a protection visa when they are present in Australia at the same time. This amendment simply encourages members of the same family unit of a protection visa holder to use established pathways for family reunion. 


This government remains committed to ensuring it abides by the non-refoulement obligations under the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights(the ICCPR) and schedule 2 of the bill contains amendments to clarify the threshold for assessing Australia's non-refoulement obligations under these treaties. In Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZQRB [2013] FCAFC 33the full Federal Court found that the threshold for assessing complementary protection claims is whether there is a 'real chance' of significant harm, the same low threshold that applies to the assessment of claims under the Refugee Convention. A 'real chance' can be as low as a 10 per cent chance of harm occurring. It is the government's position that the risk threshold applicable to the non-refoulement obligations under the Convention Against Torture and the ICCPR is 'more likely than not'. 'More likely than not' means that there would be a greater than 50 per cent chance that a person would suffer significant harm in the country they are returned to. 


Accordingly, this bill inserts a new section 6A into the Migration Act which makes it clear that this higher threshold is required to engage Australia's non-refoulementobligations. This is an acceptable position which is open to Australia under international law and reflects the government's interpretation of Australia's obligations. This new threshold applies to all assessments of complementary claims related to the Convention Against Torture and the ICCPR. The threshold will also be reflected in the complementary protection provisions under section 36(2)(aa) of the Migration Act until such time as the Migration Amendment (Regaining Control Over Australia's Protection Obligations) Bill 2013 is passed by the parliament. The bill also ensures that all complementary protection assessments are made with regard to a country of return that is relevant to the person seeking protection.


Schedule 3 of the bill will introduce amendments to streamline the operation of the current statutory bars placed on illegal maritime arrivals. It is inefficient and administratively complex for a person to be subject at different times to different provisions that prevent them from making a valid application for a visa when one would suffice. These amendments will significantly reduce complexity without impacting on the practical effect of the existing arrangements. Statutory bars are an essential mechanism which supports the orderly management of applications from illegal arrivals. 


The amendments will broaden the statutory bar in section 46A of the Migration Act so it will apply to unauthorised maritime arrivals who hold bridging visas or other prescribed temporary visas in addition to unauthorised maritime arrivals, as they are known within the act, who are unlawful. The amendments will also ensure that where section 46A of the act applies to an unauthorised maritime arrival, section 91K of the act will no longer apply.


Finally, the amendments in this schedule make the statutory bar in section 46B of the Migration Act, which applies to transitory persons, consistent with the amended bar in section 46A, to ensure that transitory persons are treated consistently with unauthorised maritime arrivals.


Schedule 4 of the bill contains amendments to improve processing and administration of both the RRT and the Migration Review Tribunal. The principal member will be able to issue practice directions to applicants at review and their representatives, including migration agents and legal practitioners, regarding the procedures and processing practices to be followed for reviews. The principal member will also be able to issue guidance decisions to tribunal members to reduce inconsistencies across decisions. The tribunal must comply with the guidance decisions unless a tribunal member is satisfied that the facts or circumstances of the decision under review are clearly distinguishable from the facts or circumstances in the guidance decision. The tribunals will also have a discretionary power to make an oral statement of reasons where there is an oral decision without the need for a written statement of reasons. This change has the potential to significantly reduce the administrative burden on the tribunals. However, a review applicant may, within a specified period, request a written statement of reasons to be provided to them.


The tribunals will also be able to dismiss an application where an applicant fails to appear before the tribunal after being invited to do so. This will stop applicants from using the merits review process to delay their departure from Australia. However, the government recognises that a review applicant may have a genuine reason for not attending a hearing and the tribunals will have the power to reinstate an application that has been dismissed for non-attendance where the tribunal considers it appropriate to do so, in the circumstances where the applicant has applied to the tribunal for reinstatement of the application within seven days after receiving notice of the decision to dismiss the application.


I note that in relation to the 90-day rule, which I referred to earlier, it was the intention of the government to bring that forward in this bill. I note, though, that that proposal has been postponed and that matter will not be addressed in this bill. But the government will be returning to consider that matter after reviewing the High Court decision of last week, and leaves the option open to pursue that change in a subsequent piece of legislation that we would seek to bring before this House.


This bill deserves the support of all parties. We need the tools to ensure public confidence in Australia's capacity to assess claims for asylum in the interests of this country, and against the interests of those who show bad faith. These changes uphold the importance of integrity, the establishment of identity, and increased efficiency in our protection processing system. This bill acts on the commitments that this government, when in opposition, made to ensure that those who destroy documents and those who do not engage in good faith of their identity will not be able to gain entry to our system.


I commend the bill to the House.

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2014-06-25,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (13:30):  In 1931, Labor member Jack Holloway became the first Australian to be Minister for Science. Eight decades later, the Abbott government became the first government in three generations to not have a science minister. The lack of a science minister has sat alongside another significant decision by this government: decimating the CSIRO. This government is literally sacking one in 10 CSIRO staff.


As members know, CSIRO is the organisation that created wi-fi, the hendra virus vaccine and Relenza, the first effective influenza treatment. And yet, despite CSIRO's successes, within my electorate, the Campbell and Crace sites of the CSIRO are being closed down, with staff being relocated to Black Mountain or losing their jobs. Specific areas of research which are likely to suffer include neurosciences, colorectal cancer, bioscience, carbon capture and storage, radio astronomy, efficient energy management and climate change science.


This government has never seen an expert body that it did not want to shut down or an expert that it did not want to get rid of, and the Prime Minister's attacks on climate science are of a piece with his attacks on science generally. Tomorrow, at the Black Mountain site, thousands of Canberrans will gather to voice their objections to the government's cuts to the CSIRO. (Time expired)

Fuel tax is a tax on distance. If ever there was a country that should not aggressively tax fuel, it is a vast country like Australia. It is a tax on doing business outside of the capital cities.


Does the Deputy Prime Minister agree with himself or with the Treasurer on making Australians in rural and regional Australia pay more for their fuel?

"Truss, Warren, MP",Nats,2014-06-25,"



Mr TRUSS
 (Wide Bay—Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development) (14:01):  The big difference between the way in which this government taxes fuel and the way in which the Labor Party addresses the issue is that this government refunds the excise that is paid by the trucking industry. The trucking industry pays its share of road construction costs through the road user charge, but, when it comes to the tax, the trucking industry receives a rebate in full. The major impact of the fuel tax on regional Australia is of course its impact on the trucking industry. It is a major impact on the cost of living and, obviously, the cost of doing business in regional communities. The reality is that that is fully refunded to the trucking industry.



The SPEAKER:  The minister will resume his seat. I call the member for Hunter on a point of order, and it had better be one.




Mr Fitzgibbon:
  On relevance—indeed it is, Madam Speaker, because it was clear that I was talking about—



The SPEAKER:  No, there is no point of order. The member will resume his seat.




Mr TRUSS:
  Labor's new regional representative, or whatever he is called at the present time, surely has heard of the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme. The Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme is pretty fundamental to regional Australia. That ensures that the cost of trucking to regional committees is fully refunded, and therefore the cost impact on regional communities is managed in that way. That is our approach to this issue.



Mr Snowdon interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Lingiari will withdraw that remark at the end of the question!




Mr TRUSS:
  We will continue to treat regional Australia fairly so that the cost of living in regional Australia is not artificially bloated by increasing the cost of transport fuel.

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Leader of the Opposition) (14:48):  My question is to the Prime Minister. Before the election, this Prime Minister promised to reduce cost-of-living pressures on Australians, but tomorrow will be the very last time that 280,000 seniors, including 29,000 veterans, will receive the seniors supplement, worth over $800 a year. Why should seniors and veterans pay for this Prime Minister's broken promises?

"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2014-06-25,"



Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Prime Minister) (14:49):  There are more than 10 million households in this country and each and every one of them, on average, will receive $550 of benefit by the abolition of the carbon tax. The 10 million-plus households of Australia will each receive $550-plus by the abolition of the carbon tax. 


The Leader of the Opposition has been complaining and grizzling about a $2.2 billion tax over four years. What about the $36 billion carbon tax that he loves so much that, despite having promised to terminate it again and again before the election, he votes in favour of again and again, and again and again, after the election? You cannot take this Leader of the Opposition seriously when it comes to cost-of-living pressures, because if he were fair dinkum he would not be smiling every time your power bill goes up. He would not be smiling every time your power bill goes up, but he is smiling because that is just the carbon tax doing its job.




Mr Shorten:
  I rise on a point of order. Madam Speaker, mindful of your earlier direction to me, I gave the Prime Minister a minute to at least say why he has broken his promises on the seniors supplement. 


Why don't you just answer a question, once in your life?



The SPEAKER:  There is no point of order. Resume your seat. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that he put his questions in parts and asked about the cost of living. 




Mr ABBOTT:
  I think he's got irritable Bill syndrome. I think that is the problem that the Leader of the Opposition has at the moment.

The SPEAKER:  There will be silence from both sides of the chamber. 




Ms Plibersek:
  You are still the suppository of all wisdom!



The SPEAKER:  The member for Sydney will withdraw that genteel comment, and the Prime Minister will also withdraw.




Ms Plibersek:
  I am happy to withdraw.



Honourable members interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  I am afraid I find that there is a little disconnect in the thinking of those members who think that the comment by the member for Sydney is amusing, yet object to other things. That sort of language is not really acceptable in this place.




Mr ABBOTT:
  Madam Speaker, I do apologise. We should not engage in levity in this chamber. I accept that. The point this government made—over and over again—before the election is that this country could not afford cash splashes with borrowed money. What this government has done is ensure that periodic payments, occasional payments, that this country can no longer afford—such as the schoolkids bonus, such as the low-income supplement and such as the seniors supplement—are no longer being paid. I believe that the decent people of this country do understand, even those who are doing it tough, that the government cannot go on loading up our children and grandchildren with unsustainable debts.


I notice that members opposite have stopped waving around the budget, because they did not like having in their hands the solution to the problem they created.



Opposition members interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  You will put them all down.



Opposition members interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  I am the one who has the authority to do that.




Mr ABBOTT:
  They do have, in their hands, the solution to the problem they created. We did not create the problem—Labor created the problem—but we will solve the problem. We will take responsibility for getting the budget back under control. And we have.

(2) notes:


(a) Financial Assistance Grants are used by every local government in Australia to maintain local roads and deliver critical community services;


(b) the Government's indexation freeze represents cuts of $925 million to local governments in every town and city over the next four years;


(c) regional and remote councils will be most affected by the cuts, with larger service areas and more kilometres of roads to maintain per ratepayer;


(d) the viability of some regional and remote councils may be compromised as a result of the cuts;


(e) the pressure now on councils to increase council rates or cut services due to the cuts; and


(f) within six years, the value of the cuts will be greater than the entire Roads to Recovery budget; and

(c) many small businesses are run at a very slim profit margin and are unable to pass these costs on to the consumers, forcing them to absorb the burden of the carbon tax themselves;


(d) with the cost of doing business increasing due to the carbon tax, small businesses lose confidence, invest less money in their business, and are forced to employ fewer staff; and


(e) under the former Government, too many small business jobs were lost; and

1 MS PARKE: To move:


That this House:


(1) notes that:


(a) the ethnic and sectarian unrest in parts of Myanmar, including Rakhine state and the Mandalay, Bago, and Yangon regions, but in Rakhine state in particular, has created significant humanitarian concerns given that the latest iteration of displacement has been going on for almost two years;


(b) Human Rights Watch released two reports on the unrest in Rakhine state and the situation of Rohingya Muslims there which clearly concluded that ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity were perpetrated against the Rohingyas;


(c) the national census in Myanmar in April 2014 has led to a deepening of the humanitarian crisis due to the census boycott by ethnic Arakanese groups and the alienation of minority communities as a result of questions relating to ethnicity and religion, including the refusal to allow Rohingya Muslims to self-identify as such;


(d) on 27 May 2014 Myanmar's state-run media published a draft law on religious conversions that would impose unlawful restrictions on citizens wishing to change their religion, which would encourage further repression and violence against Muslims and other religious minorities;


(e) the Australian Government continues to assist affected people in Rakhine state through direct humanitarian assistance, providing over $5.79 million in humanitarian assistance in 2012-13, making Australia one of the largest donors helping those affected by the crisis; and


(f) any acts of discrimination or violence against any persons will impact on Myanmar's international standing and consequently harm its bilateral relationships; and


(2) calls on the Australian Government to urge the Myanmar Government to:


(a) elevate its efforts to resolve ethnic and sectarian unrest in parts of Myanmar, including by accepting the deployment of personnel from the Australian Civilian Corps for security, humanitarian and peace building purposes in Rakhine state;


(b) allow the establishment of the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights in Myanmar with a full rights protection, promotion and technical assistance mandate, and permit unfettered access to all areas where sectarian violence has occurred;


(c) permit Médecins Sans Frontières to freely enter and operate in Rakhine state, and provide humanitarian assistance to all persons needing it;


(d) impartially investigate and bring to justice all those responsible for abuses, regardless of their status, position, or rank;


(e) ensure the security of all persons in Rakhine state while protecting human rights, including the right to freedom of movement, maintaining proper rule of law and good governance that includes an end to all discriminatory policies against Rohingyas;


(f) amend the 1982 Citizenship Law to bring it in line with international standards;


(g) ensure that minority communities are properly included in the national census;


(h) abandon the proposed law on religious conversions that would politicise religion and permit government intrusion on decisions of faith;


(i) ensure right to fair trial to all persons held in jails in Rakhine state;


(j) ensure all local laws are non-discriminatory and fair to all people of Myanmar, and respect the rights to movement, religion, work and access to health care and education;


(k) condemn violence and abuse inflicted on any persons, ensuring proper judicial procedures are applied;

Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Leader of the House and Minister for Education) (15:12):  Many members of the House would well remember Howard Moffat. Howard Moffat has been 18 years working in Parliament House—since 1996, when he first came here—but he was also a photographer for Auspic. On the old parliament house, when it was being transferred to the hill, he took the photographs of the engineering works and the building of the new parliament house.


Since 1988 and before, Howard Moffat has been associated with our work on this hill. Howard Moffat is retiring after his long service to the parliament, and sometimes, when a longstanding member of the department, whose job is to make us look good—which is no easy task, particularly in my case, Madam Speaker, not yours—retires, we do like to acknowledge them and say thank you. The staff of the parliament, from the drivers through to the clerks, the cleaners and the photographers at Auspic, do a fantastic job on our behalf and on behalf of the people of Australia. I would like to acknowledge today, for Howard and for his family, the great work that he has done for us as photographer at Auspic for all these years.

Those of us who sat on the government benches in the last term spent a lot of time with him at community cabinets, capturing not only the work of this parliament but the work that then goes out into the community around the country. He has performed a very fine level of professional service in capturing moments that form part of the history of this country. He will be missed and we wish him well.

",HoR,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Future of Financial Advice</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,12,1,speech
"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,2014-06-25,"



Mr RIPOLL
 (Oxley) (15:15):  Every day we see more and more evidence of just how unfair this government really is—unfair in terms of the budget and what it is doing to ordinary people, and unfair in terms of what it is doing to protect consumers, to protect pensioners and to protect families. We have no more evidence of that than having a look at the changes they want to make to the Future of Financial Advice laws, laws that are specifically designed to protect consumers—to protect pensioners, to protect families—and, most importantly, to protect their life savings and retirement savings. 


It is not as if we haven't seen enough horror stories in this space out in the community. There are the stories of the collapse of Storm Financial, Trio and Westpoint. It is a list too long to detail here. They are names that just slip off the tongue, but consider the very real people that those collapses impact on. In Storm's collapse alone 14,000 different people lost some of their life savings or all their life savings. Some were left in a position so destitute that they will owe for the rest of their lives money to banks and other lenders. These were people who were very financially sound before being involved.


What Labor did was put in place some good, sound, solid protections to protect those people. What this Liberal government is doing—very, very tragically—is ripping away at all of those protections. Let me make it absolutely clear: the Liberals have got it wrong, just plainly got it wrong. You cannot argue your way out of this one. You cannot demonstrate your way out of this one. Your own Senate report, your own Senate inquiry into FoFA changes, clearly states it. Your own senators tell you you are wrong, your own report says you are wrong. It says: 'Go back to the drawing board. Have another look.' There is evidence of that everywhere we look.


Let me go back and just explain to people why it is so important that we not only keep FoFA protections but we improve on them and we enhance them. If we do anything, we need to do that; not wreck them, not pull them apart. If only this Liberal government would understand that in opposition people might accept you swing the wrecking ball, but when you get to government, stop wrecking. You are in government now. It is not your job to wreck everything anymore. Don't wreck people's life savings. Don't be part of that. Help us clean it up, help the regulator clean it up. Listen to the voices out there—not just the voice of Labor but of National Seniors, of the Council of the Ageing, of Choice, of Industry Super Australia. There is a list of them—and I will come to that list, because I think there might be one or two of your friends on that list who are telling you you are wrong as well.


These were significant reforms. These were reforms that went to the heart of what needs to happen, because this is not easy to fix. You have got to change behaviour and you have got to change culture. If you are going to do that you have to somehow put in words in law and through regulation something significant enough that actually helps and enables the sector. The financial services sector, which is good, sound, very necessary—and from Labor's perspective needs to grow itself, needs to professionalise. That is what sector wants and that is what we want, because we understand it is essential for people to not only get more advice but get good quality advice.


It is just not good enough to come in here and rip away and destroy what is basically five years of really hard work. It is hard work not just by us, not just by Labor, but by the sector itself. It is the hard work of the community. We have just seen too many horror stories. The horror stories do not stop They are still coming out of Senate inquiries and other inquiries, out of the things that we see in current affairs programs about consumers who have lost all of their life savings. When you sit down with them and look them in the eye and see the tears and hear the catastrophes that have happened to them through no fault of their own but because they were defrauded, robbed or the victims of really poor advice, you have to question yourself and say, 'Why do we stand up so much for FoFA and protecting consumers?' But then I ask myself, 'Why is this Liberal government so determined to pull it apart, so determined to get rid of the best interest duty?' I will not take for a minute what this government and some of its cronies says about best interest being safe because they are going to write it in there. You can write it on every page at the top of the page and at the bottom of the page but your changes to the law still take it away and diminish it. You cannot argue that.


When it comes to opt in, it is one of the few mechanisms that is available to us if you believe in standards, if you believe in changing culture and best interests. It is one of the few ways that you can actually help the sector. The majority of them actually contact their clients on a regular basis, not once every two years, but on a regular basis: once a month, once every three months, once every six months. We think it is quite reasonable to say at least once every two years make contact. At least do something for the clients, because—you know what?—it is not for free; you are actually charging people fees. If you are going to do that we say do it and do it properly.


On annual disclosure it is not just about disclosure. Yes, there is some disclosure, but it is about meaningful disclosure—disclosure for everybody in the financial services sector not just for new clients from some day forward. It is about disclosure for everybody. That is not retrospective. It just says that it applies from this day forward but it applies to everyone equally and fairly, not just a few lucky people who for the first time get some advice now. What about the people about to retire? What about their life savings? What about the need for them to know? I do not think it is stretching it too far to say to everybody in this chamber: 'If you pay for something, would you like to know exactly what you are paying for and what you are getting in return?' Because that is our expectation and I am sure it is everybody's expectation.


When it comes to conflicted remuneration and banning commissions, let us just get it right. The minister now has had a sudden revelation. Something has just sort of descended upon him—the fog, the confusion. He says that they are going to re-ban commissions. I just say to him: 'Minister, you don't have to toy or play with words. We have already banned commissions. You cannot ban them twice. What we are saying is don't take the ban away.'


What is at stake here is significant. It is the national retirement pool of savings worth $1.84 trillion—that is right, 'trillion'. Let me tell you: never stand between a pot of gold that big and a whole heap of people who would love to just keep pulling more fees and charges out. But they want to do it quietly. They do not want you to know. They do not want the opt-in every two years, just in case you find out. They do not want you to tell them how much you can or cannot, or whether you even agree. And you do not have to take my word for it. I would just say to you: read the explanatory memorandum from the government and read the regulation, because it actually says it in there.


I love talking to people from right across the sector, because I think that they are doing a great job, on the whole. Individual financial advisers go out there with the best interests of their clients and their customers at heart, and the problem is that they do not always get to choose. Under these laws, they will be pushed and directed more to sales than to advice. It should always be the consumer that comes first. We wrote in for the first time that an adviser has to put their clients' interests ahead of their own. Does that sound outrageous—that, if you are paying someone to give you advice, they should put your interests ahead of their own? I do not think it is. I think it is one of the cornerstones—best interests, opt-in. 


For me, there is some real clarity around all of this. It is not just if you take each of these issues that the government is wrecking—absolutely destroying and taking out; it is if you take them combined. If you take each one of these combined, as a package, what impact do they have? Let me tell you what that impact is. It destroys the best interests, it destroys opt-in and it destroys proper disclosure. It destroys all those things. If you turn to the technical elements of what is in this bill, it is there in black and white for anyone to read. The minister does not have to ban commissions twice. They are already banned. Leave them the way they are. 


So who benefits? I just say: follow the money and have a look at who is involved and who benefits. The four major banks, and AMP, control 80 per cent of the finance advice business in Australia. Good luck to them. But they should not, at the same time, be in concert with the government trying to diminish the good protection measures for consumers. I reckon there is an easy choice. It is a choice that we can make every single day, and we do, when it comes to a whole range of issues. We get a choice in this place. Just in case you are confused or you are not sure, I will just put it to you very simply: if it is a choice for me and for Labor between siding with the banks, AMP, those who charge fees, those who would argue till they are blue in the face and say, 'It doesn't do that much anyway, so you can get rid of it,' and siding with consumers and their life savings and their potential to have a better retirement because of good, sound, decent protections, then I will always side with the consumer, and Labor will always side with the consumer. So to the Liberal Party, I would just say this: you choose; are you with the banks and big money or are you with consumers and ordinary people and people who are in retirement? Who are you with? We know who we are with.

Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (15:25): It was interesting to listen the contribution made by the member for Oxley, in particular as he railed against financial advisers. We will come to the point about whether he supports financial advisers. He said that what financial advisers were interested in, I think, was secret commissions and that they did not want their customers to find out, and that was the reason why financial advisers would be opposed to the two-year opt-in provisions. He went to great lengths to explain how those that invest their hard-earned savings were at great risk from shonky advice, conflicted advice, from financial advisers. But then, in true and typical Labor style, he turned around and said: 'But I support financial advisers. I think they're doing a great job.' He spoke at length about how people should effectively be fearful of the advice that they would receive from the financial planning industry in this country if it were not for Labor's big whopping red tape of FoFA and how consumers should recognise that if, in any way, shape or form, Labor's FoFA—



Mr Thistlethwaite interjecting—




Mr CIOBO:
  Now they are being called 'shonks' by Labor members. They are calling financial planners shonks. So we see and we understand the exact way that Labor looks at the financial planning industry in this country. 




Mr Thistlethwaite interjecting— 




Mr CIOBO:
  We understand that it might be well and good for the Labor Party and for their shadow minister in the area to stand up and to talk about how people are going to be exploited by financial advisers, and now we have the member for Kingsford Smith labelling financial advisers 'shonks'. We on this side of the House do not think that is appropriate. Granted, there is probably a very small percentage of people that do the wrong thing. We do not, for one moment, in the coalition think that everybody does the right thing all the time. But you know what: it is one thing to acknowledge that there is a very small percentage of people that have historically done the wrong thing and then a separate thing to label them 'shonks', as the member for Kingsford Smith has just done, or to say, as the member for Oxley said, that people that are investing money are going to be subject to investment advisers and financial planners that are giving them shonky advice, misleading them and are conflicted because all they actually want is a commission. That is not the coalition's approach and it has never been the coalition's approach. 


When FoFA was first announced in April 2011, the coalition could not have been more clear in our response to it. We were broadly supportive of reform in the sector. However, we were concerned that Labor's reforms, if implemented in full, were going to lead to a massively increased regulatory burden, and that increased regulatory burden would result in fewer people having access to quality financial advice. Even more concerning, those people least able to afford to have access to financial advice—in other words those who might have a smaller lump sum of money to invest, those that might be lower in terms of demographics, struggling income earners et cetera—would be priced out of the market, effectively, as a result of Labor's FoFA reforms. From day one, the coalition made it clear that we believed that there was scope for there to be reform but that we thought that that reform needed to strike the right balance. Guess what: Labor also knew that their approach did not strike the right balance. I would suggest to all coalition members that the proof in that respect was the fact that the then minister, the now Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, refused to subject the FoFA laws to a cost-benefit analysis and refused to subject the FoFA laws to a regulatory impact statement.


Why would the minister at the time have refused to subject the laws to a cost-benefit analysis or to a regulatory impact statement? I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that Labor did that because they knew full well that their laws implied a crushing, punishing, red-tape compliance burden on all of those in this sector. Labor had reached the point where they were unwilling to take any backward steps in the face of criticism from the industry and from a number of consumer groups that, as a consequence of Labor's proposal, we were going to see people effectively priced out of the market. As a consequence of Labor's reforms, we were going to see financial planners in a position where they had to incur significant charges and had to pass those charges on to consumers in order to comply with Labor's laws.


That is the exact reason why the coalition outlined our policy in very clear terms years ago. We made it clear that we would seek to address a number of aspects of Labor's FoFA legislation that imposed too much of a regulatory burden. At no stage have we watered down what is perhaps the single most important aspect—and often one of the most debated aspects—of FoFA, which is the duty to act in a client's best interests.


I heard just now the Labor shadow minister talking and railing once again about the best-interest duty. And do you know what, Mr Deputy Speaker? We have heard the shadow Treasurer scaremongering—I use that word advisedly, and I will explain why—about the best-interest duty. The shadow Treasurer does it. The shadow minister at the dispatch box just did it. They deliberately go out of their way to say to Australians, 'You should be fearful because the best-interest duty is being swept away by the coalition, and you're going to be left vulnerable.'


We have argued consistently that Labor is doing nothing more than scaremongering on this, but I think it is important that people do not just take the coalition's word for it. ABC News, in their ABC Fact Check service, made it crystal clear with the big word 'scaremongering' and a photo of the shadow Treasurer. The ABC Fact Check unit made it crystal clear that Labor was 'scaremongering'—the ABC's words, not my words. Those of us in the coalition know that from time to time perhaps the ABC and the coalition do not always get a perfect alignment, but in this particular case ABC Fact Check makes it very clear that the shadow Treasurer, just like the shadow minister at the dispatch box, is doing nothing more than scaremongering, because the very straightforward facts with respect to the best-interest duty are that the best-interest duty remains. The requirement for a financial adviser to act in the best interest of his or her client is enshrined in section 961B(1) of the Corporations Act. That stays in place. It remains unchanged. There is no amendment to that requirement at all.


As a consequence of the reforms that the coalition are making to FoFA, we want to bring about a series of modest reforms that reduce the amount of compliance that is required in order to meet the obligations of financial planners under FoFA. By doing so, the coalition will achieve an enshrinement of all the protections necessary for consumers but a reduction in the amount of red tape associated with FoFA—for example, the opt-in provisions, which the coalition outlined that we would abolish. The reason is—in fact, to some extent the shadow minister touched upon it—that financial planners are in regular touch with their clients regardless. The requirement to have financial planners writing every two years to all their clients, saying, 'Once again, can you please show that you intend to keep using us?' is a complete waste of time, a compliance exercise with no upside benefit whatsoever. Why would you impose that requirement on the industry when there is no upside for consumers?


Likewise, there have been allegations made by the Labor Party in relation to conflicted remuneration. Let us be clear: the government has supported the ban on conflicted remuneration and on commissions for financial advisers since it was first legislated, and that continues to be the case. At no point have we as a government sought to reintroduce commissions or conflicted remuneration for financial advisers. Once again, ABC Fact Check found that the Labor Party was scaremongering in relation to those claims as well.


I think it is important that in this debate we have proper, rational discussion about what has been taking place. Labor can whip up fear. Labor can whip up hysteria in the community. Labor can slander an entire financial-planning industry and say that it is only motivated by greed. But the simple facts are that the coalition recognises that the industry does an outstanding job, that the industry is motivated by the best interests of its clients, that the best-interest protections remain in place and that the ban on conflicted remuneration and commissions remains in place. The coalition's reforms simply seek to reduce the amount of red tape and compliance for the industry, which is good news for consumers and good news for financial planners.

"Neumann, Shayne, MP",ALP,2014-06-25,"



Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (15:35):  This is not about red tape, transparency or accountability; this is simply siding with the banks, the AMP and other big providers in relation to this. If the parliamentary secretary had listened to the people in rural communities in my electorate who came to see me having lost their savings in the Storm crisis, he would not be making speeches like that. This is a serious matter. There are thousands of Australians who lost their life savings and had to return to work, who lost their homes, who lost their investment properties and whose financial security in the future was trashed by Storm.


There was a parliamentary inquiry in relation to this. We responded. The parliamentary inquiry was actually chaired by the member for Oxley, the shadow minister in relation to this issue. The parliamentary inquiry was held by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, which inquired into Storm. It inquired into what happened—how people lost their savings, their investments and their property. As a result of that, the then federal Labor government came up with the Future of Financial Advice bills that went through this place. They were important pieces of reform that made a difference. They were supported by CPA Australia, by National Seniors, by the Council of the Ageing, by the insurance industry and by the superannuation industry, but those opposite have not listened. They did not listen to the parliamentary inquiry. They did not listen to the players and the consumers. They did not listen to CHOICE. They have sided not with the consumers but with the big players.


It is a $1.8 trillion industry. We on this side of the chamber had a part in the creation of that with superannuation not just for the powerful but for teachers, cleaners, farmers and small business operators. We created the superannuation system in this country. Those opposite never saw a superannuation bill that they would not vote against. They vote against them every single time. The superannuation guarantee has gone up under a Labor government every time. As a result of that, people had opportunities to secure their financial future and it was trashed.


This legislation, together with the regulations that those opposite want to bring in, is not even supported by Alan Jones. Even Alan Jones, who is no friend of the Labor Party, does not support what the coalition government is trying to do here. They are not siding with their constituents. Last night they did not side with their constituents in the votes they cast in favour of not just hurting the income they receive but affecting their cost of living in the future.


This legislation and the stuff that the coalition is trying to do are not in the best interests of this country. Let us have a look at what we did and contrast it with what the coalition is proposing. We brought in a best-interest test requiring advisers to act in their clients' best interests. How revolutionary is that? Why would those opposite be afraid of, and worry about, the requirement for advisers to act in their clients' best interests? We also had a provision that required advisers to get their clients to opt-in to receive ongoing service—not every week, not every month, but every two years. How hard is that? We also had a provision in relation to annual disclosure. Statements were to be sent to a client annually disclosing fees and details of services performed. That is not revolutionary or radical in any way, shape or form.


We had a ban on conflicted remuneration—commissions paid by financial product providers to financial advisers. On 20 December last year they announced 'reforms' to change it. It was paused because Senator Sinodinos had problems and opted out of that role. Now we have the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Cormann, involved in this role, but they have not really changed their position.


Let me tell those people who might be interested what they are doing. They are removing the catch-all provision in best interests. This adds a loophole for advisers that means that best-interest will become ineffective. That is what they are doing. They are scrapping opt in, allowing an adviser to continue to charge fees—sometimes without having actively worked on a client's file and definitely without receiving consent from the client. They are amending the annual disclosure provision so that advisers will have to provide annual disclosure only to clients who commenced with them after 1 July 2013. There is a partial lifting of the ban on conflicted remuneration. The ban on conflicted remuneration will apply only to commissions on general advice. This opens the door for a sales push culture of products over advice. That is what is happening here. They should be ashamed of themselves.

"Van Manen, Bert, MP",LP,2014-06-25,"



Mr VAN MANEN
 (Forde) (15:40):  It is interesting to listen to the opposition talk about the MPI on FoFA. I realise that, whilst this is indeed an important issue, the reality is that it is a discussion about rent seeking. That is the story of the FoFA reforms. Yes, people did lose money with Storm, Westpoint and Trio, but many of the changes in FoFA will do nothing to prevent those things happening again. If ASIC had actually done their job in relation to Storm we would not be having this discussion.


At the end of the day this is a battle between the super funds and the banks to gain control of a portion of the compulsory acquisition from Australian salaries of the superannuation guarantee charge. The union managed industry super funds have lobbied hard and sought to dirty up advisers at every opportunity—and I think they have done a very good job—and sought to achieve a crackdown on avenues of revenue for financial advice outside the superannuation system. I think it is a disgrace that those opposite aided and abetted that and in the process destroyed the reputation and the good name of many good, independent financial advisers in the marketplace.


The very thing that they complain about about the big banks is actually a direct result of their actions under this legislation, because they have created the incentive for the big banks to buy up the small financial planning businesses because they have not had the resources to cope with this tsunami of red tape and regulation that had everything to do with backing their union mates in the industry super funds. I am sad to say that with FoFA they got what they wanted. Now they are crying over spilt milk.


This is where this MPI falls short, as most other things those opposite do. The very same industry super funds are increasingly being caught out, failing the very people that they so adamantly claim to protect. I would like to quote a few recent media articles to highlight this issue. In The Australian on 25 June, Hedley Thomas wrote about the meat industry super fund:


Audits of a union super fund for meatworkers have uncovered alleged corporate governance failures, conflicts of interest and an alleged failure by a union stalwart … to disclose six-figure ""consultancy fees"" …


In the Cooper review there are 17 recommendations under the heading 'trustee governance'. This is the standard those opposite hold up for the industry, but how many recommendations did those opposite implement in their time in government? Zero. That is what goes to the heart of this issue. APRA, finally, has got around to doing some of its work and has been examining—again in relation to the meatworkers' super fund—the justification for the number of poor investments by the meatworkers' fund in companies that have in turn paid significant fees, for personal benefit, to people directly connected with the fund—one of the key issues in the trustee governance recommendations that the Cooper review talked about. If you want to talk about the effect on local employers, I have 800 employees in a local abattoir that are in the meat industry super fund. I wonder how they feel knowing that their hard-earned superannuation money is being trashed by the industry super fund.



How about we also look at the alleged union super fund leak of members' details to the CFMEU in New South Wales? The CFMEU used those to ring members to put pressure on them because they want to railroad the company they work for. That was another breach of governance principles. They can sit over there and talk about governance and protecting consumer interests all they like, but some of their biggest supporters are failing to do exactly that because they failed to include in their legislation, last time when they were in government, those trustee governance provisions which go to the very heart of some of the major issues that we are talking about here today. It is only this side that is going to generally protect the superannuation holders in this country. (Time expired)

"Mitchell, Rob, MP",ALP,2014-06-25,"



Mr MITCHELL
 (McEwen—Second Deputy Speaker) (15:45):  I like the member for Forde, but really if he is going to come into this chamber and sit there and use the protection of saying things are facts, when they are allegations, that is pretty poor form. He is better than that. I know some of the Star Wars scene around him is a little bit different, but he is actually better than that. He should not come in here with allegations and make them claims.


These reforms, which the government is bringing in, are nothing but an attack on everyday Australians who have little savings. The purpose of what we brought in was to ensure that financial advisers act in the best interests of their clients—put simply: to make sure that the client is getting the best possible advice for their needs and objectives without being caught up by the adviser. To those of us with strong convictions—which counts out the other side of the House—morals and ethics, to Labor, and to many people, this seems ethical. It seems ethical to make sure that when you go and see a financial planner they are working in your best interests and not their own hip pocket.


The Abbott government is seeking to change this by adding a loophole so that advisers do not have to look after the best interests of their client. I will just state that again to be clear: financial advisers do not have to look after their clients' best interests. And this is considered really good by those opposite. It is absolutely appalling. This means that the average person will visit a financial adviser to seek help on planning for their retirement. But, under Labor, the financial adviser would be required to genuinely determine what is affordable and what is suitable for the client's needs. Under this government, the financial adviser can basically sell the client whatever product he wants to sell and he can pick up the biggest commission he likes, without thinking twice about how that is going to impact on people and their savings.


Speaking of commissions, another reform Labor introduced was a conflicted remuneration  This reform banned commissions from being paid to financial advisers by the financial product providers. Again, put simply, it means that financial advisers could no longer be persuaded to spruik a particular financial product, because they knew that they would receive a very healthy commission from it. Removing this temptation to sell a product because of the juicy commission means that financial advisers would offer the most suitable product for their client. But, alas, the Abbott government is removing that. It opens the door to allow the financial advice sector to become a sales push, as opposed to being a life-long, important financial decision-making process affecting those who need assistance. 


For example, Joe wants to speak to an adviser about taking out a life insurance policy to look after his family in the event of something unfortunate happening to him. Instead of the financial adviser listing the options best suited to his needs, affordable in his budget, and flexible to his life changes, advisers can simply push for a product that will give them the most sales commission.


Another change Tony Abbott seeks to remove is the opt-in. This reform was introduced by Labor to ensure that clients have to physically opt-in to receive ongoing advice every two years. That means that any fees that the financial adviser is charging to work with the client will need to be mutually agreed to every two years. This prevents advisers from sticking a lifetime of fees onto a client's portfolio, without the person even knowing that it is happening. The Abbott government scrapping this means that most people will pay fees for services they do not get, and some will pay fees without knowing because there is no disclosure, no best interests and no opt-in.


These are examples of how the Abbott government is completely disregarding the needs of everyday Australians, but the Prime Minister is making sure he is looking after his own mates in the big banks. As one of our members mentioned just before, even that great doyen of the Labor Party, the great voice of the socialist left, Alan Jones, got out and said that what this government is doing is wrong. So, being the puppet master, maybe he should pull a couple of strings and get little Pinocchio-Tony to actually back off on this. 


In closing, I heard the parliamentary secretary talk about the ABC's Fact Checkand how important it is. So I had a quick look at the ABC's Fact Check. It says: 'Is the government paying a billion dollars a month on Labor's debt?' Fact Check says: 'Exaggerated'. 'Christopher Pyne has claimed that graduates earn more.' Fact Checksays: 'Overblown'. 'Will Australia have the biggest medical research fund?' All overblown, all lies, all puff and all bluff. (Time expired)

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2014-06-25,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) (15:51):  Labor's future of financial advice reforms equals more red tape, higher costs and less choice. As we said at the time, reforms in this area need to strike the correct balance, the right balance. We were concerned at the time that Labor's reforms would lessen the affordability and availability of advice. There has been debate, much of it ill-informed, such as the contribution just then by the member for McEwen.


The best-interests duty remains in place. We are not watering it down; we are making it work in practice. What we are introducing is a comprehensive set of steps that will provide greater certainty, better certainty, about what the duty requires of financial advisers. Surely the hallmark of well-designed regulation is that the regulated know what is expected of them and the community knows what they have a right to expect. That is so crucial. Our changes will provide that certain incentive payments can be made where they do not conflict with advice. This legislation is not and never was designed to bring back commissions. The legislation will explicitly prohibit payments made solely because of a financial product, in relation to which general advice was provided, has been sold.


The legislation will explicitly prohibit, stop—call it what you like—a recurring payment made because someone has been given general advice. As Minister for Finance and Acting Assistant Treasurer, Senator Cormann is doing an outstanding job, an absolutely wonderful job. Not many people would have the drive and the energy necessary to take on such a task, but he certainly has. The government's FoFA amendments are about ensuring more affordable, better and improved quality advice. It delivers on our election commitment to reduce the unnecessary regulatory burdens on business and consumers and to promote greater access to high-quality financial advice. But do not just take my word for it. 


Whilst I was out of the chamber for an hour I actually put in a call to Trevor Ion, who is a 28-year veteran of financial advice in Wagga Wagga. He runs a small adviser's firm, in conjunction with his wife, Sue. And he said his biggest problem is that he spends so much time on compliance. Labor love red tape. That is why they introduced all these reforms, because they love red tape. He said that it just adds to more cost which, as he admitted, gets passed on to the consumers. And he does not want to do that. 


He talked about FoFA reforms, FoFA legislation having common sense and efficiency. He said, 'That's what is needed here; not more red tape, bureaucracy and compliance.' He said that, under Labor, his practice was going to be less productive and less profitable. 'We're out there,' he said, 'trying to do our best for the people that we serve, trying to do our best for our customers.' He has customers and clients in Wagga Wagga. He also has a practice in Deniliquin and he services a lot of people in Griffith. He actually said that, when Labor brought in their reforms, companies spent millions of dollars getting product disclosure statements et cetera organised, training people and changing systems just to become compliant with what Labor requested, what Labor wanted.  As I say, Labor love red tape. 


He said the amount of compliance that has crept in over the years is just 'huge'—that was the word he used to describe it. He said it does not provide better outcomes for his clients; it just provides an 'onerous' burden—that was another word he used—on his small company. His is a small company. He is out there, doing his best, paying his taxes, trying to get a better outcome for the people he serves. 


All the important consumer protections in FoFA will remain. I note that the member for McEwen is leaving the chamber, but he should stay. Only the unnecessary and costly red tape will go. Advice will have to be given in the best interests of the client. We all want that. Advice must be appropriate. An adviser must prioritise their client's interests ahead of their own—and Trevor Ion certainly does that. Conflicted remuneration structures, including commissions that have the ability to influence advice, will continue to be banned.


The government propose to keep important consumer protections, such as the requirement for advisers to act in the best interests of their clients, and also the ban on conflicted remuneration, while putting downward pressure on the cost of advice. That is the important thing here. We promised at the last election that we would restore the balance between important and appropriate levels of consumer protection and ensure that access to high-quality financial advice remains available and affordable for all Australians, particularly those in regional areas and particularly for companies such as Trevor Ion Financial Services.

"Thistlethwaite, Matt, MP",ALP,2014-06-25,"



Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (15:56):  In 2012, along with the member for Oxley, I travelled to Wollongong as a member of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services. At that public hearing in Wollongong we listened to the stories of hundreds of mum and dad investors who had lost their life savings in the collapse of Trio Capital. They were harrowing stories of people pleading with the government to do something about what had occurred in their circumstance. There were certain characteristics of those individuals and their plight with respect to Trio. The characteristics are as follows. Most of these people were nearing retirement. They had worked all of their lives, predominantly in the mines or steelworks around Wollongong. They had been targeted by shonky people who were out to steal money. 


They had been advised by their local financial planner or their accountant to invest their superannuation savings in Trio Capital. They had been advised to do it. Many of them had also been advised to establish a self- managed super fund as the vehicle to make the investment in Trio Capital. Most of these people were telling us at the inquiry that they signed forms establishing self-managed super funds, but they did not even know that they had their own self-managed super fund. They did not know that the forms they were signing were actually establishing a self-managed super fund, that they had got out of their industry fund, out of the protection of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act—they swam outside the flags, if you like—and had lost the protection of that act when the collapse occurred.


Some of these people had to remortgage their houses. They were in their 60s, they had worked all their lives and they had remortgaged their house to invest more into Trio Capital. So not only did they lose their life savings but they lost their kids inheritance as well. These people were pleading, begging the committee to do something to ensure that this situation could not happen again.


What would a good government do in that circumstance? Would you just ignore the concerns of those people and what had happened to them at the whim of shonky financial advice? This was not an isolated incident. Unfortunately, it had occurred in the past in respect of Storm Financial, Opus Prime and Westpoint. These were not isolated incidents. Hundreds of Australians, thousands of Australians, had lost their life savings because the financial laws in this country were inadequate. So the previous Labor government did something about it.


We did not sit on our backsides, we did not ignore the pleas of these people; we did something about it. We instituted the Future of Financial Advice reforms. They are not groundbreaking reforms; they are simply reforms that avoid the situation that many of those people got themselves into where they did not know that they had established a self-managed superannuation fund. 


How can it possibly be under Australian law that you could establish a self-managed superannuation fund and not know about it? That is what occurred in the case of Trio Capital because the law did not protect them. The law did not say that their financial adviser had an obligation to act in their best interests. The law did not say that their financial adviser had an obligation to tell those people where the commissions that they were receiving on providing that advice were going. That is what Labor did with the Future of Financial Advice reforms. That is what a good government does: it protects the vulnerable in our community from the advice of shonks, the advice of people who are out to steal their money. That is what we did with the Future of Financial Advice.


What would a bad government do? A bad government would repeal those reforms. A bad government would repeal those protections that were put in place to protect the vulnerable, and that is exactly what has occurred with the Future of Financial Advice reforms in the repeal of some of those important annual disclosure provisions which simply require a financial adviser to disclose the fees and commissions that they are receiving on behalf of product sellers and their obligation to act in the best interests of the client. This is not groundbreaking stuff; these are basic protections for people.


What is the view of CHOICE? What is the view of the organisation that is established in Australia to protect consumers? This is their view. They say:


The proposed Bill—


that is, the bill to repeal the FoFA—


would substantially weaken consumer protections and undermine the original goals of the FoFA reforms: to improve the quality of financial advice and build trust in the financial planning industry.


This was in the wake of a series of high-profile scandals that saw consumers lose hundreds of millions of dollars. That is the view of the independent protector of consumers in this country. (Time expired)

Mr SUKKAR
 (Deakin) (16:01):  It gives me pleasure, I suppose, to speak in relation to the coalition's FoFA reforms, although it has not been a pleasurable experience listening to members opposite conflate issues and deliberately scare consumers. I have got no doubt that the intentions behind the original FoFA reforms were honourable. They were seeking to deal with situations that had arisen where consumers of financial advice had been poorly treated, whether it be Storm Financial, Westpoint and others, and other speakers have mentioned those in detail. But I think it is dangerous for members opposite, by conflating those issues, to create a false sense of security that FoFA means that no rogue financial advisers in future could do the same thing to consumers again. That is effectively what you were saying, and lots of people have argued—and I think argued very well—that the FoFA reforms that Labor introduced are not foolproof and in the circumstances where you do have financial advisers acting unlawfully, consumers will be at risk.


But the problem with Labor's FoFA rules is that they have imposed unnecessary red tape, regulation and additional burdens particularly on small financial advisers who cannot meet those requirements. In that sense, the Labor Party, unsurprisingly, was hijacked by the union-dominated industry super funds. We went from a situation where intentions started off pretty well but with poor advice and obviously the vested interests of the unions which control the Labor Party, the FoFA reforms were hijacked and now we see ourselves in a situation where members opposite are, in effect, trying to conflate issues and argue that this is a situation of the big four banks fighting against industry super funds. No, it is not. 


Our changes to the FoFA rules seek to enshrine the most basic and important protections for consumers of financial advice without creating circumstances that disenfranchise particularly low-income people or people with low asset bases from being able to access good-quality financial advice. In my electorate of Deakin I have got a number of small financial advisers. I do not have big institutions situated in my electorate. In each of the conversations I have had with the financial advisers in my electorate, there has been concern with Labor's FoFA rules and actually very enthusiastic applause for the coalition's changes to the FoFA.


There are two main reasons. The first is that when you run a small financial advising business, often you are advising people with low asset bases, so when you increase the fixed costs that that financial adviser has to meet in relation to each additional client for people with the small asset bases that is a big proportion of the cost that then has to be passed on to that particular customer. Here we have situations where financial advisers have said to me that they will be forced to reorientate their practice to take on more customers with larger asset bases, disenfranchising those people who have had low incomes and may not have the large asset bases that they are seeking financial advice about. Perversely, while members opposite are protesting that these reforms are there to protect these people, they are actually disenfranchising them, because the people that need the best financial advice are those with the lower asset bases. They are the people who need the best advice and, if there are customers out there that cannot any longer afford to obtain good-quality financial advice because the regulatory burdens placed on their financial adviser are so high that they have had to be passed on to them and they can no longer seek that advice, then they are the people that are hurt the most.


Unfortunately, the Labor Party has picked the wrong fight here. We are trying to maintain absolute protections to consumers while at the same time ensuring that financial advisers are able to continue doing the good work that they are doing and that particularly customers who do not have large asset bases are not disenfranchised from getting that financial advice in the first place, because those are the customers who need it the most. So I would suggest that the members opposite should get on board and support the coalition's FoFA changes.

Ms CLAYDON
 (Newcastle) (16:06):  I rise to join with my Labor colleagues, the member for Oxley, the member for Blair, the member for McEwen and the member for Kingsford Smith, on today's matter of public importance, namely, the government's failure to protect Australians seeking financial advice for their hard earned savings.


Across the globe and here in Australia, we have seen the massive damage that can be caused when financial service providers take advantage of their clients. I have listened carefully to arguments put by members opposite. No matter how they might like to dress this little package up, there is no mistake that the government's proposals are, indeed, those that were lobbied for by the big banks and the financial planners. The big banks and AMP together control some 70 per cent of the financial planning market in Australia. The government has lost sight of the very reason for Labor's future of financial advice, FoFA, reforms, which were introduced following a big series of financial collapses that occurred here and abroad and the subsequent parliamentary inquiry into financial advice products and services.


I think it is really worth reminding ourselves why those Labor reforms were introduced in the first place, because who could forget the devastation that emerged when Storm Financial collapsed? The lives of thousands of mostly elderly Australians were ruined. The reckless advice given by Storm cost more than 3,000 investors around $3 billion. I recall members opposite arguing: 'We're introducing these reforms, because it's just a small number of people that have been doing the wrong thing. That's why we can strip away consumer protections now, throw them to one side and give the financial planning market increased opportunities to do as it sees fit.' This would again expose a situation where you could have 3,000 investors like the mostly elderly Australians who were set to, and did, lose $3 billion.


As reported in the Monthly, Barry and Deanna Doyle from Townsville are one case in point. I note the member for Herbert sitting in the chamber. I am sure he will be very interested in this case. The Doyles double-geared into the stock market by borrowing against their home and using the cash to raise yet more money to invest. Barry worked as a part-time librarian, earning $17½ thousand per year. Deanna was retired and received about $7,000 per year from Centrelink. Yet, thanks to Storm, they ended up owning a share portfolio costing $2.26 million, with debts to match on which their annual interest payments eventually rose to $191,800. Two-and-a half years after first engaging Storm, the Doyle's super had gone, the share portfolio had been sold and they had racked up a debt of $456,000 on their home, with insufficient income to make the repayments. They had been wiped out, with Storm charging them more than $150,000 for the privilege.


The Labor reforms, which many of my colleagues have gone into in detail, were put in place to ensure the best possible protection for people like the Doyles and the many other mum-and-dad investors around Australia. Regrettably, under the process that the government has chosen to undertake, we are not even seeing these proposals from the government as legislation that can be debated in the House; they are sneaking it through the back door as regulations not legislation, and this means that we do not even get to have this discussion in parliament in the way that we should be. 


In closing, I would like to echo the words of Alan Kirkland, the Chief Executive Officer of CHOICE, who said:


Conflicted and poor financial advice has cost consumers billions and in too many cases led to people losing their homes and life savings. This is why consumer protections were originally needed and exactly why they should not be removed.

Mr HOGAN
 (Page) (16:11):  I think with most things that happen in this House there is good intention on both sides for a position that you may hold, and I certainly understand the opposition's concerns with this legislation when you look at it from a certain perspective. They are raising issues and concerns about Storm Financial and other examples. They happened, and no-one likes that. In almost every industry in whatever field you want to look at there is a shark or two, and that is never good, especially when we are talking about people's finances. It is very easy to pick out an example and say: this has cost this person this much money and we have to regulate to fix it.


I will say a couple of things. One is that the regulations that we are talking about today did not protect those investors anyway, and would not have. It is very difficult to regulate against criminals. They will do what they do and they will flout the regulations. The other side of this, which has been completely ignored by the other side, is the regulation and the red tape that they want to keep is a cost and a burden that is not worn by the financial adviser; it is worn by the investor. They can come up with examples which are very true where investors have been ripped off by a shark, which is not good. But the regulation would not have protected them anyway. But the bigger picture is—and the opposition have acknowledged this—that the vast majority of financial planners in this country are good people. They have the best interests of their clients at heart and they have the best interests to get good returns for their clients.


We acknowledge that a shark is a shark, and it is very hard to regulate to protect you from them. People, at the end of the day, have to take some personal responsibility as well in those situations and be clear about what they are doing. But what we are proposing is going to increase the return for mum-and-dad investors. It was very well raised by a previous member that a lot of balances for a lot of investors are quite small, and when you put on extra red-tape burdens and extra costs they are the ones that are hurt. It might not be as emotional as the $150,000 lost to Storm Financial, which is a very small section of the market and very unusual, but what we are talking about is hundreds of millions of dollars over time of money being taken out. That is what is happening. It is being taken out of people savings accounts because of overregulation.


We do not even need to be talking about financial services; it could be any aspect of our community, not just your money but agriculture, occupational health and safety or anything. It is almost like the other side thinks, 'If there is a thought on something, regulate it. If there's a perceived problem on something, let's regulate it. If there's a shark there, let's try and regulate the whole industry because of that one shark, which is going to add extra red tape and cost to it.'


This legislation is all about achieving the balance. Everything is about a balance. It is a balance that says, 'Yes, we have to provide adequate consumer protection.' No-one here is saying that the consumer does not need protection; they do. So it is adequate protection, again, without burdens. This country—and I know that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, know this—is in some ways the most expensive country to do business in lots of things. This is just another example of a section of the economy where we are making it exceptionally expensive for us to do business, and penalising our mum and dad investors and their superannuation. The protections that we are going to maintain here, and the regulations, ensure a commitment from the providers, from the financial planners, to lift their professional, ethical and educational standards. Again, the balance is in the red tape, not penalising.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The time allocated for this discussion has concluded.

Mr LAURIE FERGUSON
 (Werriwa) (16:17):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, I present the committee's eighth report of the 44th Parliament, entitled Examination of legislation in accordance with the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011, Bills introduced 2-19 June 2014, Legislative instruments received 31 May-6 June 2014, Eighth report of the 44th Parliament.


Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.




Mr LAURIE FERGUSON:
  by leave—I rise to speak to the tabling of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights eighth report of the 44th Parliament.


This report covers 18 bills introduced in the period 2 to 19 June, nine of which have been deferred for further consideration, and 51 legislative instruments received during the period 31 May to 6 June. The report also includes the committee's consideration of 11 responses to matters raised in previous committee reports.


Of the bills considered in this report, I note that the following bills are scheduled for debate in the parliament this week:


•   Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2014-2015


•   Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2014-2015


•   Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2014-2015


•   Appropriation Bill (No. 5) 2013-2014


•   Appropriation Bill (No. 6) 2013-2014.


The report outlines the committee's assessment of the compatibility of these bills with human rights, and I encourage my fellow members to look to the committee's report to inform your deliberations on the merits of this proposed legislation.


I would like to draw members' attention to two bills in this report which are of particular interest and relevance to the committee's task of assessing legislation for compatibility with human rights.


The Australian Citizenship (Intercountry Adoption) Bill 2014 seeks to amend the Australian Citizenship Act to facilitate intercountry adoptions in accordance with a bilateral agreement where the country of the child's birth is not a party to the Hague Convention. These 'fast-track' arrangements for citizenship are currently only available where the birth country is a party to the Hague Convention.


The report notes that children have special rights under human rights law taking into account their particular vulnerabilities. Of particular relevance to the bill, article 21 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child provides special protection in relation to intercountry adoption, seeking to ensure that it is performed in the best interest of the child. The Hague Convention implements these obligations.


The report notes that, by providing for the grant of Australian citizenship (and the issue of passports) to children adopted by Australian citizens, the bill provides for the exercise of Australian jurisdiction over any such children. Accordingly, in exercising that jurisdiction, decision makers must act in the best interest of the child.


In accordance with this analysis, the committee has sought more information from the minister on the standards or safeguards that will apply to intercountry adoptions under a bilateral agreement where the country is not a signatory to the Hague Convention. More information on this question will enable the committee to better assess whether the bill is compatible with Australia's human rights obligation to consider the best interests of the child.


I would also seek to draw members' attention to a feature of the committee's work that is often overlooked. While the committee's work is generally concerned with identifying potential limitations on human rights, the committee's analysis of legislation also identifies bills and instruments that promote human rights. In this regard, I note that the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Legislation Amendments (Removing re-approval and Re-registration) Bill seeks to reintroduce the right to not incriminate oneself to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Act 1994. The committee notes that this measure promotes the right to a fair trial consistent with international human rights law.


I encourage members to consult the full discussion of these bills in the report, which provides a more detailed account of the issues raised.


Finally, in relation to responses to matters previously raised by the committee, the report contains consideration of 11 such responses, and the committee's concluding remarks on these matters.


With these comments, I commend the committee's eighth report of the 44th Parliament to the House.

"Hendy, Peter, MP",LP,2014-06-25,"



Dr HENDY
 (Eden-Monaro) (16:21):  I rise to support the Customs Tariff Amendment (Fuel Indexation) Bill 2014 and associated bills, to oppose the amendment proposed by the opposition. These bills form part of a wider strategy to massively boost infrastructure spending in Australia. In particular, the focus of this package of bills is a massive increase in road infrastructure which will help boost the productivity of the Australian economy. That is vitally important because with a more productive economy it means we can, in a sustainable way, pay for all those other things that government provides like health services, education services and defence.


These bills amend the Excise Tariff Act and the Customs Tariff Act so that the rate of excise and excise equivalent customs duty applying to all fuels listed will be bi-annually indexed by reference to the consumer price index. The exception will be aviation fuel and the production of crude oil or condensate. The government has also provided that the increased revenue will be diverted to road expenditure. These measures will provide a stable and growing source of revenue to deliver the government's new road infrastructure projects.


Let us be clear: this is not so much the introduction of fuel indexation—that was done by the Hawke government in its 1983 budget. Instead, it is a reintroduction after a number of years of a hiatus. The rate of excise and excise equivalent customs duty on most fuels has not changed since the cessation of indexation in March 2001. As the Treasurer has detailed, petrol and diesel have both maintained an excise rate of 38.143c per litre since that time, with the real value of this rate having been eroded by inflation.


To give listeners a sense of this in relative terms, in the June quarter 2001, excise represented approximately 41.5 per cent of the price of unleaded petrol. Things are vastly different now. It is now worth around 25 per cent. The government has committed to the biggest increase in road expenditure in Australian history and reintroducing indexation is projected to moderately assist in funding these commitments by raising approximately $2.2 billion.


My electorate of it Eden-Monaro is receiving an early down payment on the increased roads expenditure. On 13 June the then Acting Prime Minister—that is, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure—visited Queanbeyan in my electorate. Together with the New South Wales Deputy Premier, Andrew Stoner, he announced a joint funding commitment of $50 million to build the Queanbeyan bypass. The Commonwealth and New South Wales governments have committed $25 million each to construct a 4.6 kilometre two-lane carriageway linking the end of Ellerton Drive to the new Edwin Land Parkway intersection at Old Cooma Road. A bridge will also be built over the Queanbeyan River.


The extension of Ellerton Drive will provide an alternative route for traffic wanting to bypass Queanbeyan's busy CBD and improve road safety. It is also a major economic development investment for the Queanbeyan district and has been the No. 1 infrastructure priority for the Queanbeyan City Council for a number of years. For those people worried that spending decreases in Canberra will adversely affect Queanbeyan and Eden-Monaro, this project will be a massive boost in investment and in jobs.




Mr Albanese:
  Under standing order 66A Interventions, I ask if the member for Eden-Monaro would take an intervention to which he could then respond.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Will the member take an intervention?




Dr HENDY:
  I am always interested to hear your questions.




Mr Albanese:
  I thank the member for Eden-Monaro. I ask, because this is related to the fuel tax increase, whether the project in Queanbeyan that he referred to in his contribution or even the Majura Parkway Parkway that is already under way are dependent upon the carriage of this new tax for funding or whether if this new tax does not go ahead those projects will still be concluded, which would suggest that the funding is not dependent upon this new tax at all.




Dr HENDY:
  The point I think is really relevant is that the ALP absolutely opposed this Queanbeyan bypass in the last election.



Mr Albanese interjecting—




Dr HENDY:
  You did not support it at all.



Opposition members interjecting—




Dr HENDY:
  I was asked a question about the Queanbeyan bypass.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Eden-Monaro has the call. The member for Grayndler will listen in silence to the answer. He was afforded the silence of the chamber for his intervention.




Dr HENDY:
  Indeed, Mr Deputy Speaker. I was asked a question about the Queanbeyan bypass, which was opposed by the Labor Party. The member for Grayndler may have been the relevant minister at the time. He opposed a project that was the No. 1 priority of the Queanbeyan City Council. Instead, those opposite proposed a Dunns Creek Road extension road that was not actually on the list of priorities for the Queanbeyan City Council and was never asked for. It was actually promised for in the 2010 election and was never delivered through the course of the 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 parliamentary term.




Mr Ewen Jones:
  Who was that member?




Dr HENDY:
  The member then was a fellow named Mike Kelly.




Mr Ewen Jones:
  What party was he in?




Dr HENDY:
  He was with the ALP. It is a road—that is, the Queanbeyan bypass—that will not only ease congestion in the CBD but will provide better access to the new housing estates in the area like the Googong development and maintain connection between east and west Queanbeyan during a one-in-100-years flood. This project has been promised for decades at the state level but was never delivered by Labor governments. Coalition governments at both the Commonwealth and state levels are now delivering it.


The government does not resile from the fact that these initiatives come at a cost. The estimated price impact of fuel indexation by the end of 2014-15 is an increase of about 0.8c per litre with an additional 0.1c per litre due to the GST, as the GST is applied to the excise inclusive price. The Treasury has calculated that 50 litres of fuel would cost around 45c extra or around $24 extra per annum if this usage was weekly, assuming the change is passed on in full and ignoring any other price changes. By the end of the forward estimates period in 2013, the increase is about 3.7c per litre with an additional 0.4c per litre due to the GST. Fifty litres of fuel would cost around $2.05 extra or around $107 extra per annum extract if this usage was weekly. For those businesses using fuel in off-road operations or operating a vehicle with a gross vehicle mass in excess of 4.5 tonnes, this measure will not increase their business cost. This is because these businesses are able to receive fuel tax credits to offset the fuel excise paid.


Since I have been interrupted by the member for Grayndler, I will cut to this really important point: I would like to remind people in my electorate that, on coming to office, the new coalition government faced a $47 billion budget deficit for the 2013-14 financial year and $123 billion of projected deficits to 2016-17. Today every man, woman and child in Australia, and therefore in my electorate, is footing a $1 billion interest bill every month on Labor debt. This budget begins the task of restoring budget integrity for the long term, making savings in current expenditure so we can invest in the infrastructure necessary to rebuild our national economy. The 2014 budget outlined a $50 billion investment across Australia to deliver vital transport infrastructure for the 21st century. The budget includes many large-scale commitments which will trigger more than $125 billion in infrastructure investment but, importantly, there is also a significant boost to road funding at the local level.


As part of this agenda we have committed $2.5 million for the continuation of the Roads to Recovery program to support the maintenance and upgrade of local roads. This includes an additional payment of $350 million to local councils during the 2015-16 financial year. To fix dangerous and accident-prone sections of local roads and streets, $565 million will be provided through the ongoing Black Spot program. This includes an extra $100 million in both the 2015-16 and 2016-17 financial years. Recently, on 4 June this year, the Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development and I announced funding of $622,450 to fix dangerous black spots in Eden-Monaro. The Eurobodalla Shire Council will receive a total of $530,000, the Queanbeyan City Council will receive a total of $52,450 and the Bega Valley Shire Council will receive $40,000. The projects were recommended by a panel of independent road safety experts and will be delivered in the course of the coming financial year, 2014-15. A recent evaluation of the Black Spot program found that fatal and casualty crashes are reduced at treated sites by 30 per cent. That is a great result for the Black Spot program. This investment in black spot projects will deliver safer roads for Eden-Monaro through targeted upgrades proven to deliver results.


I also note the government's Bridges Renewal program, which was promised in the election campaign, will commence in 2014-15. Partnering with local councils and state governments, this program will invest $300 million in Commonwealth funding into the repair and replacement of local bridges. I have already raised this program with the mayors in my electorate and they are considering putting in bids.


To improve productivity and safety in the heavy vehicle industry, the government has also committed to continue the heavy vehicle safety and productivity program, with $200 million available over the next five years for projects such as road enhancement, rest areas and technology trials. In addition there has been a Community Development Grants program since the election which has confirmed $314 million in investments in over 300 projects, which are designed to deliver the coalition's election commitments, and some residue projects from the previous government. Among those 300 projects was the $10 million for the port of Eden redevelopment in my electorate, which is one of the most important local investments in infrastructure we have seen in years. It was promised by the previous government over the course of a whole six years but, amazingly, it was not delivered. We are now proceeding with it. The money is in the budget. We are getting on with the job, in consultation and partnership with the New South Wales coalition government.


Talking about infrastructure, I am also happy to confirm the coalition government will continue with its $160 million commitment to the Bega community to build the new South East Regional Hospital. This is a major project, in collaboration with the New South Wales government, which we hope will be completed in 2016. Only in February this year—that is, 2014—was it announced that the tender for the main works were awarded to Brookfield Multiplex. Do not let people think this is a Labor government project just because they announced it before the election: it is taking form and substance under a coalition government. We are actually getting the work done on this vital need for the Bega Valley district.


Further, the government's new $1 billion National Stronger Regions Fund aims to promote economic development through investment in infrastructure projects at the local level. The program will help communities with lower than average socioeconomic circumstances and higher than average unemployment by improving local facilities, creating jobs and building needed infrastructure. Grants from the program will commence next year. Again, I have been talking to the mayors in my district to ensure we work together, collaboratively, to get bids in for this very useful regional and rural program.


By partnering with state governments and leveraging private sector investment through innovative financing models, Australia is set to receive $126 billion in investment in productivity-enhancing infrastructure. Major projects are occurring across the country. I have already talked about major projects in my electorate like the port of Eden redevelopment, the Bega Valley hospital project, the Queanbeyan bypass and other road spending in the Eurobodalla and Bega Valley shires. In conclusion, these bills are a vital part of the government's infrastructure strategy and I commend them to the House.

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari) (16:36):  The shame of this debate is that it has been truncated and effectively gagged, which means that members opposite who should be speaking will not be. I am not talking about members who come from Eden-Monaro or even the mighty Herbert. I am talking about the members for O'Connor, Forrest, Pearce, Capricornia, Grey and Leichhardt—those people who come from large regional electorates. 




Mr Hutchinson:
  Lyons.




Mr SNOWDON:
  Lyons is not a large regional electorate. Let me just tell you what the impact of this GST is on those communities—I'll speak up on behalf of their constituents, even if they won't. Let me be very clear: the fuel excise will have a dramatic impact on people who live in those communities. We heard the Deputy Prime Minister say today in question time that the major impact of the tax is on the trucking industry. Well, I've got news for him. The major impact of the tax is on residents and constituents of mine who live in remote parts of northern Australia.


If you index fuel in the way that is being proposed and it also cops the GST it becomes a cascading tax. So if you pay fuel at $1.53 a litre then the current excise plus GST is 53.2c. If, however, you are paying $2.50 a litre you are paying 63c tax, a difference of 10c. But, of course, the people opposite do not acknowledge this cascading impact of this tax on the cost of fuel for people who live in regional Australia. They need to understand the impact of this tax on those people and on their lives, because families will be adversely affected by this silly tax. The Deputy Prime Minister has already said, and others have spoken of this: 'Fuel tax is a tax on distance. If ever there was a country that should not aggressively tax fuel it is a vast country like Australia. It is a tax on doing business outside of the capital cities. It is a tax on farming and the distant parts of our nation. It is a tax on living and setting up a business in a country town.'


Let me tell you that at Numbulwar in the Northern Territory people are currently paying $2.57 a litre for fuel. At Ngukurr, close by, the price is somewhat similar. Ngukurr is 300 kilometres from Katherine in the Northern Territory. People play football in Katherine of the weekend. The round trip is 600 kilometres and they are paying about $2.50 a litre for fuel. Who can say that this is sustainable? Who can argue that this impost that is going to have a cascading impact and increase over time will not have a major impact on those communities? 


It is not the trucking industry, it is the people who live in those places who are most adversely affected by the changes which are being made. They already suffer huge costs. For example, the Central Land Council did a remote communities store price mark-up survey of the price in the CLC region compared to in the nearest regional centres of Tennant Creek, Alice Springs or Katherine. It found: fruit and vegetables, 35 per cent mark-up; essential health items, 55 per cent; variety products, 150 per cent; takeaway foods, 100 per cent; clothing, 80 per cent. It is the people there who are going to suffer, yet people in this chamber from the National Party and those people who purport to represent regional seats are not prepared to get up on their scrapers and represent the interests of those people. 


We have an obligation in this place to tell this government that the people who will be most adversely affected, in this case in the Northern Territory, are the poorest people in Australia. They will be most gravely impacted by the whole suite of measures in this budget and this fuel indexation proposal will most adversely impact upon them. It is an absolute shame that we cannot get the members of the National Party to come in here and explain why it is they are going to support this measure when they know it is contrary to the interests of their constituents. I make it very clear that there is no way on God's earth I would support such an impost on the people in my community. Why would they?

Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (16:41):  I thank those members who have contributed to this debate. These bills modify the Excise Tariff Act 1921, the Customs Tariff Act 1995, the Excise Act 1901, the Fuel Tax Act 2006 and the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 to reintroduce the biennial indexation of excise and excise equivalent customs duty on all non-aviation fuels. Indexation to the consumer price index will begin on 1 August 2014 and will occur in February and August every year thereafter. The re-indexation of fuel excise and excise equivalent customs duty will raise $2.2 billion over the forward estimates. This will provide a predictable and growing source of revenue for the government's road infrastructure projects. Indeed, this revenue source allowed the government to commit to the biggest increase in road expenditure in Australian history in the recent budget.


This legislation also establishes the fuel indexation road funding special account. This account will ensure that net revenue raised through the re-indexation is spent on road infrastructure. The balance of this account will be reported in Budget Paper No. 4. The cost of petrol and diesel is expected to increase by approximately 0.9c per litre for consumers by July 2015 as a result of re-indexation. Businesses using fuel in off-road operations or operating and on-road vehicle with a gross vehicle mass in excess of 4.5 tonnes will not face an increase in their business costs from indexation. These businesses are able to receive fuel tax credits to offset the fuel excise paid. Consequential amendments will also be made to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and the Customs Tariff Act 1995.


While indexation will continue at three decimal places for each indexation period, the applicable duty rate will be rounded from three decimal places in the cent to one decimal place. This rounding will simplify the duty rate to reduce the burden on businesses. On the current rate for petrol this would have the effect of reducing the rate from 38.143c per litre to 38.1c per litre. 


We have reached the point in this debate where the Labor Party have put forward their opposition to it and have even put forward an amendment that in some rather poor way attempts to maintain that this policy is not consistent with what the coalition took to the last election. We have the Greens, in an amazing about-turn, an almost gymnastic effort of a backflip, now saying they will not support re-indexation of excise on fossil fuels—surely something that I think most people would reasonably have thought. But what is extraordinary from the contributions of Labor members opposite is the Labor Party's contention that because we in the coalition government are seriously attempting to deal with the state of the nation's finances, attempting to stop stealing from the next generation of young Australians to pay for today's spending and undertaking to make responsible decisions that deal with the fiscal challenges this nation faces, that is in some way inconsistent with the mandate received from the Australian people at the last election.


Let's be clear about what exactly it is that is inconsistent. It is inconsistent for the Australian Labor Party to come in on debates like this and rail about equity. It is inconsistent for the Australian Labor Party to come into debates like this one and rail about the impact on families. The reason it is inconsistent is that Labor's efforts, not only in relation to this budget initiative but in respect of the nearly $40 billion of additional spending that Labor want to reintroduce into the budget, combined with the fact that Labor stand opposed to revenue increases like this one, underscore that Labor are not serious when it comes to inequity. Labor are not serious when it comes to Australian families because, if they were—if Labor were genuine about the impact on families and genuinely motivated and concerned about what it meant for Australian children—they would not condemn them to tens of billions of dollars of additional debt in order to try to win a few votes.


The Australian Labor Party have form; Australians know that. They will say anything on any given day if they think that there is a vote in it. They will not make the serious decisions that are in the national interest to address the challenges that we have. The Labor Party will not undertake the heavy lifting that is required to meet the challenges this nation faces. When the coalition are genuinely concerned about making sure that Australian children do not have to spend the next 20 or 30 years paying off Labor's debt, we respond by making unpopular decisions like this one—not because we think there are votes in it but because it is in the national interest. The Labor Party used to know that. The Labor Party was once a party of principle.




Mr Hutchinson:
  They stood for something.




Mr CIOBO:
  The Labor Party did indeed once stand for something—but no more. The only thing you can be assured of in this day and age is that the Australian Labor Party will adopt whatever position they need to adopt in order to try to secure themselves one extra vote. So we get members like the member for Lingiari, who professes to be concerned about the people of the Northern Territory and who in his contribution to the debate made claims that this measure is not in their interests but conveniently ignores the fact that, as a result of the six biggest budget deficits in Australia's history, the actions of the government that he was a member of mean that the Australian people of the Northern Territory are forecast to be in debt to the tune of $25,000 for every man, woman and child.




Mr Snowdon:
  What did you do to the deficit when you came to government?




Mr CIOBO:
  So do not expect us to take you very seriously, Member for Lingiari, because we do not take you very seriously.




Mr Snowdon:
  What did you do to the deficit?




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Vasta
):  Order, Member for Lingiari!




Mr CIOBO:
  The member for Lingiari cannot come into the chamber professing to be concerned about Australian families and professing to be concerned about the people of the Northern Territory after the track record of the government of which he was a member left those people in so much debt and deficit that they will take 20 or 30 years to repay the debt.


When we take initiatives like this to stop Australia from staying on a trajectory where we have to borrow $1 billion every single month simply to pay back the interest on the debt that Labor accumulated, we do not expect the Australian Labor Party to stand in the way; we expect them to do the right thing. We know that the right thing is not always popular, but that does not in any way, shape or form erode the fact that it is the right thing to do for our nation. The coalition will continue to do the right thing for our nation. The coalition will continue to make sure that we put the interests of the next generation of Australians first. The next generation of Australians know that we will attempt to bequeath to them a country that is in a stronger financial position than what we inherited. That is not Labor's approach; it is not the approach of the Greens. On that basis, this is the right thing to do. I commend the bill to the House.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (17:07):  In this debate we have seen a notable lack of speakers from the Nationals. This is the Liberal tail wagging the Nationals dog. Members of the National Party are happy to come in here and cast a vote that will raise fuel taxes on their electors. And they know full well—as the Leader of the Nationals and the Deputy Prime Minister has outlined—that this is a tax on distance. 


This is a tax that will fall disproportionately on those in the largest electorates in Australia. But have we heard from the member for Pearce in this debate? I'm afraid not. The member for Durack? No—she was guillotined as well. Have we heard from the member for O'Connor? No, we have not heard from him. We have so many members across that side of the House, representing large rural electorates, who have not stood up in their party room, who have not stood up in this House and who have not stood up against the measure that will raise taxes every time Australians get into the car. 


As I outlined in my second-reading speech, this is a broken promise, and there could be no clearer broken promise than the increase of fuel indexation. No less than a dozen times prior to the election, Tony Abbott said he would not raise taxes on the Australian people, and now we are seeing this 'big new tax'. In another part of this building, very shortly, we will have Al Gore standing next to Clive Palmer. It is apposite to remind the House—as Al Gore might have said and, indeed, as Tony Abbott said to Barack Obama—this is a measure which acts like a carbon tax. Having run around the country, berating a price on carbon, now we have Tony Abbott introducing a measure that has the effect of being a price on carbon. 


This is a measure that was decried by coalition member after coalition member when they were on this side of the House. As soon as they moved to that side of the House they discovered a new-found love for carbon taxes. As long as it is their carbon tax, they are very happy to have it. So we have Greens members—in a Bizarro World—more committed to standing up for rural Australians than the National Party is. The National Party will not stand up to the Liberal Party. That is why, at election after election, over the past generation, we have seen the National Party slowly being reduced to a rump in this place. It is unwilling to stand up for the interests of rural Australia.


We on this side of the House take a different view. We on this side of the House are standing to see the Prime Minister keep his word when he said—no less than a dozen times before the last election—that he would not put a new tax on the Australian people. He is not only putting a new tax on the Australian people but also he is taking away this House's right to debate it. Those on that side of the House should have all been given the opportunity. We would have been delighted to give them the freedom, because we believe in freedom of speech. We particularly believe in the freedom of National Party members to explain to their constituents why they support paying higher fuel taxes. 


It would have been a great joy for us to hear 15-minute speech after 15-minute speech from members representing some of the largest electorates in Australia. They are electorates where a typical elector might jump in the car for a couple of hours to go off to a meeting, or find themselves taking an hour each way to drop the kids to sport on Saturday. It would have been a pleasure for those of us on this side of the House to sit and watch them explain to their electors why they thought higher fuel taxes was the right promise to break. 


This is not the only promise the government has broken. There are broken promises on: no cuts to the ABC, no cuts to SBS and on bringing the deficit down. Of course, they have raised the deficit. It is a little smaller than it was after Joe Hockey doubled it, but it is still a whole lot bigger than it was when the government came to office. But this broken promise is one which will resonate in the rural and regional electorates of Australia. They will be asking themselves: 'Where was my member when the great debate happened in the House of Representatives?' The answer: missing in action. Rural and regional members were missing in action—except for those on this side of the House.

Mr HUTCHINSON
 (Lyons) (17:12):  I cannot claim to have the largest electorate in the country but I can claim to have the largest electorate in the state of Tasmania. I am more than happy to stand in front of my constituents and explain the benefits of good public policy. That is something the Labor Party once believed in. The Labor Party once had principles and once stood for something.


It was interesting to pick up today The Financial Review. That well-known supporter of the Liberal Party Laura Tingle today started off by saying:


If there was one budget measure which Labor and the Greens really should have supported, it was the move to reinstate indexation on fuel excise.


I found this more and more interesting, as the article went on. She said: 


After all, it would have been the Coalition—not Labor—that bore the opprobrium, and both sides of politics and the budget bottom line would have benefited from the move. 


We do believe that it is important to fix the budget. It was one of the fundamental commitments that we went to the election in September 2013 with, that we would restore faith in government and that we would restore faith and respect for the finances that are the product of the taxpayers of this country. 


I hesitate here, but she goes on to say:


In what was a too-clever-by-half punt, Labor thought it could get the best of both worlds by counting on the Greens to support the Coalition on the indexation move, thus avoiding any political fallout but gaining the revenue whenever it eventually gets back to government—


And goodness knows when that might be—


despite never having had the courage to make the move on fuel excise itself when it was—


For six long years—


in government.


The keyword there is courage—and lack of courage, of principle, on the part of those on the other side. This is a budget that our country needs. We know that some of these measures may not be popular, but the fact that the excise is going to roads will make it a valuable contribution to regional Australia. Certainly in my electorate of Lyons there are many roads that will benefit from an excise of a very modest nature on fuel that will be legislated to be put back into roads, some of which will be in regional Australia. We were elected to a do a job, and that was to fix the mess that was left by the previous government—and fix it we will. 


The rate of excise and excise-equivalent customs duty on most fuels was last changed in March 2001—13 years ago. The rate at that time was 38.143c, and that has effectively been eroded over time. The fundamental principle of this excise—to allow us to reinvest in roads and reinvest in infrastructure—has been eroded through a lack of courage. In 2001, it represented roughly 41.5 per cent of the price of petrol. Today, nationally, it is around 25 per cent, and I would say it is a little less than that in my state of Tasmania. We are prepared, when good policy is put in front of us, to look at those things. It is also important to note, for regional Australia, that the level of fuel excise will not affect businesses operating vehicles greater than 4.5 tonnes gross vehicle mass. Importantly, vehicles used in my electorate by the many farmers—people that work, employ people and generate wealth within my communities—will not be affected for off-road activities. The fuel tax credits that they rightly receive offset entirely the increase in the fuel excise.


This is sensible policy. This is good policy. We understand, on this side, that some of the measures in the budget that we have brought down are not popular, but we are a government that needs to fix the mess that Australia was left with after six years of Labor. We are up for the job, we are committed to the task and this is one small measure of good public policy that should be supported by the Greens, but it should also be supported by the Labor Party if they believe in something and stand for something.

Ms CHESTERS
 (Bendigo) (17:17):  This is actually terrible public policy, despite what has just been put forward. This is terrible public policy and it has been condemned and canned throughout the regional media. That is probably exactly why the government has moved to gag debate today. I am a regional MP, and it is not just my local paper that has really gone out there and canned this policy. A number of papers in regional areas have come out and canned this policy, saying that it is going to be tough for the bush and tough for farmers.


Let us look at TheDaily Mercury, which is a paper in Mackay. It says that this will have a crippling effect on our cane growers in the region—a crippling effect—yet we are hearing from people opposite that farmers want this. This does not include the farmers who are cane growers in Mackay. We have also heard that it is something that people are proud to defend. Really? Your local papers are not saying that. Is that why we have got so many MPs in hiding, not willing to stand up and nail their colours to the mast on that? We have had MPs on the other side—on the government's side—publicly say that they disagree with this policy. We have got senators coming out and maintaining the rage against this, saying that this will be bad for the bush. We have got other members of the government coming out publicly and saying that this particular fuel excise increase is another tax and it is a broken promise. So no wonder the government is moving to gag debate on this, when its own MPs out in public are saying that it is another broken promise and an increase in a tax.


It is a broken promise and it is an increase in a tax. In my electorate of Bendigo, we pay high fuel prices, which means we will be paying even more in excise to the government. On one Saturday in Bendigo city itself, the price was okay—it was about the national average; it was $1.50—but, the moment you went further out, it got more expensive. On the same day, the price was $1.65 in Woodend. That is an extra 15c. On top of that, they then have to pay more excise. The fact is that, in regional Australia, the further out you go, the more you pay in fuel. So this is a tax that hurts the bush. The increasing of the excise will hurt the bush and hurt regional electorates like mine, because the further you go, the more tax you have to pay to this government.


I am also not surprised that the government wants to gag debate to stop those MPs from big rural seats standing up and talking about this issue, because who would want to go home and stand up in front of the farmers and the small businesses and say, 'Yes, I've just increased the cost of your business.' This is a government that claims to be the best friend of small business, yet it has just increased one of the biggest things that you can increase for a small business—the cost of fuel and the cost of petrol. 


Let us, for a moment, remember why it is the fuel excise was frozen. Let us just remind people why. John Howard, the former Prime Minister, introduced the GST, and part of the trade-off when he introduced the GST was to freeze the fuel excise, because having the fuel excise and the GST is double-taxing. It is double-taxing on fuel, which is vital for people to be able to live. The motorists who live in country areas, the people who rely on transport, rely on fuel. We have limited or no public transport in the regions, so, for those electorates where people need to use a car, we need to ensure that we have fairer taxes. 


Right now, this is not a fair tax, and it is not a fair tax because it is a tax on a tax. I am quite surprised that the government, who were the architects of the GST, forget this. They forget that this is a tax on a tax. The question that I have for the government now is: are they going to consider reducing or removing the GST on fuel? That is the only way that you can ensure that the people in the country and in the regions are not hit with a double tax. 


It is very disappointing that the government has gagged debate on this. There are a number of MPs on this side of the House that wanted to stand up for their families, stand up for their communities, stand up for their electorate and highlight exactly why this is an unfair tax and another broken promise.

"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2014-06-25,"



Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (17:22):  Once again it has been instructive to listen to the contribution from Labor members who continue to apparently rail against the inequities of an initiative like this while conveniently ignoring the fact that this type of measure would not be necessary if the Labor Party had not spent so recklessly over the past six years. This type of measure would not have been necessary if Labor had not run the six biggest budget deficits in Australia's history. Indeed, this type of measure would not be necessary if Labor had left Australia in a better financial position than they inherited it.


But the Australian people understand what Labor did. The Australian people, when they reflect on Labor's track record, know the truth, which is that, when Labor was elected to office, they inherited a $50 billion asset base, they inherited a budget in strong surplus and the Australian economy was performing strongly. In six short years the Labor Party ran the six biggest deficits in Australia history and put us on a debt trajectory that the Treasury forecast was going to reach $667 billion unless policy changes were made—policy changes such as the policy debate that we are having in the chamber right now.


So it is a little disingenuous, frankly, for Labor members to pop up on the opposition side and claim that they are so concerned about the impact of this bill. One of the reasons it is particularly disingenuous is because this is coming from the same Australian Labor Party who in this debate rail against the impact of 40 or maybe 50c for the average Australian family per week for the cost of fuel yet are perfectly happy to see the continuation of the world's biggest carbon tax, which has an impost on Australian families of $550. Bear in mind that the carbon tax is set to increase, so the impact on Australian households will be even more pronounced. The government does not need hypocrisy or lectures from the Australian Labor party about how this is not an appropriate initiative to undertake. What we need from the Australian Labor Party is a little bit of common sense, a little bit of recognition that as a government we were elected to fix up the mess that the Australian Labor Party left behind.


Labor cannot have it both ways. Labor cannot claim that they are a party concerned about Australian families. Labor cannot claim that they are a party that is concerned about the impact on Australian people of a policy initiative like this. Labor cannot claim that they are a party of economic responsibility yet enable a situation or attempt to impose a situation where the Australian budget continues to face significant economic headwinds, where the Australian budget continues to be subjected to tens of billions of dollars of budget deficit. Until such time as Labor is willing to be upfront with the Australian people, Labor is not in a strong position to be critical of measures that this government undertakes not because we think they are popular but because we know that they are the right thing to do, as I have said in this debate previously. Initiatives like this are done because this is what is required to help restore Australia's economic standing. These types of policy decisions are undertaken not because we think they are going to win vast numbers of votes in the community; we do it because as a government we are committed to making sure that this nation stands more strongly in the future than it is able to as a consequence of Labor's economic stewardship and the reckless spending they engaged in.


Labor cannot have a situation where they oppose every tax increase and hey oppose every savings initiative but then say that they are concerned about equity, fairness and the impact that that will have on Australian families when as a direct consequence of Labor's policy positions we now see Labor trying to reimpose nearly $40 billion of additional spending back on the budget. That is the reason the Australian people voted in such overwhelming numbers against the Australian Labor Party. They know that Labor's recipe is a recipe for more debt and more deficit and will do nothing to make sure the next generation of Australians inherit a country that is stronger and more resilient in the future than the nation that Labor left behind.

"Watts, Tim, MP",ALP,2014-06-25,"



Mr WATTS
 (Gellibrand) (17:27):  I feel bad for detaining the member for Moncrieff, who I know will be wanting to rush to the Great Hall and hear the member for Fairfax, Clive Palmer, blowing up another one of the Abbott government's agendas; but, because of the gag on this bill, I was prevented from speaking on it earlier, and I really could not miss the chance to have my say on this bill. This is one of those bills that goes to the heart of the absolute substancelessness of this government.


I have a very simple question for the member for Moncrieff: if this bill is such good policy, as those opposite are insisting, why didn't you tell the Australian people about it before the last election? Before the last election it was a very different message coming from those opposite. I can remember hearing the then Leader of the Opposition, now Prime Minister, telling Australians: 'What you'll get under us are tax cuts without new taxes. There should be no new tax collection without an election.' The government's Real solutions policy pamphlet, which was mailed to every constituent in my electorate during the last election campaign, read: 'We pledge to the families of Australia that we will never make your lives harder by imposing unnecessary new taxes.' In one interview, when asked if lower taxes was a promise, the then Leader of the Opposition responded, 'This is my whole reason for being in politics—in this parliament.' Indeed, the then Leader of the Opposition gave more than 80 speeches about tax in this place in the last parliament but never once said that he would be increasing them.


Yet in the government's first budget we see a swath of tax hikes: increases to income tax, a new tax on visits to your GP and the increases to the petrol tax that we see in the bills before this House. Those provisions must have been in the sealed section of the Real solutions policy pamphlet—the lift-out section of the pamphlet with the obscene bits in it that aren't fit for public consumption! I must have missed that section. It would have to have been a bulky one to contain all the nasties that were included in this recent budget—all the nasties that had to be hidden away from the Australian people before the last election. The sealed section would have had to include the new $7 tax on visits to the GP, the $80 billion in cuts to health and education and the plans to Americanise our higher education system through massively increased student fees and student debt costs.


But there is a little bit of familiarity. It was before my time but seeing all of the opposition leader's promises about honesty and about no new taxes it did remind me of another previous opposition leader. We have pretty well established that Tony Abbott is no John Howard. Those opposite are quickly realising that Tony Abbott is more extreme, more out of touch than John Howard ever was, much to their detriment. But he is doing a pretty good Malcolm Fraser impression at the moment. Before the 1975 election Malcolm Fraser said:


I can promise you honesty and integrity in Government—


You can hear the echoes from the then opposition leader—


I'd like to have a Government which people can trust.


…   …   …   


We will reduce the tax burden. We will put an end to Labor's tax rip-off.


…   …   …   


The Government will bring taxes down further—not increase them.


We all know what happened next. In 1978 Malcolm Fraser introduced the petrol taxation that Tony Abbott, his progeny some 30 years later, is now increasing.


People ask, 'Why is the Labor Party opposing this bill?' Those opposite ask why aren't we supporting this excellent policy. I can tell you that this excellent policy is far from it for my constituents. This is a regressive tax that slugs the hardest those with no choice but to use their cars. It is a regressive tax introduced without any broader tax reform to curb these regressive impacts. I ask the minister in this respect: has the government undertaken modelling of the cumulative impact of this tax hike on working families wend combined with the GP tax, the cuts to family payments and the cuts to child care support? Why has the government not sought to engage in a substantive holistic tax reform process before slugging working families with this procession of new taxes? The cumulative effect of these taxes on my constituents in a working class electorate not like my own is a cost of living catastrophe for working families. This is a particularly shameful outcome, given that before the last election the opposition leader told Australians that he would:


… offer real solutions that will help the forgotten families of Australia with cost of living pressures.


I ask the minister: why have you forgotten the cost of living pressures of the families of Australia less than 12 months into your government? I further ask the minister why funding raised from this tax isn't being spent on infrastructure projects that would actually ease congestion on our roads—projects to take commuters off our roads and allow them to catch public transport; projects like the Melbourne metro rail tunnel that would increase the peak hour capacity of the rail network in my electorate by tens of thousands of commuters and yet has had $3 billion in Commonwealth funding slashed from it in the recent federal budget. I ask the minister: why is the government trying to gull Australians by setting up a road funding account that incidentally does not even guarantee increased road spending, at the same time that it is ripping billions out of commuter rail infrastructure? Why are road commuters more equal than rail commuters?

Dr HENDY
 (Eden-Monaro) (16:21):  I rise to support the Customs Tariff Amendment (Fuel Indexation) Bill 2014 and associated bills, to oppose the amendment proposed by the opposition. These bills form part of a wider strategy to massively boost infrastructure spending in Australia. In particular, the focus of this package of bills is a massive increase in road infrastructure which will help boost the productivity of the Australian economy. That is vitally important because with a more productive economy it means we can, in a sustainable way, pay for all those other things that government provides like health services, education services and defence.


These bills amend the Excise Tariff Act and the Customs Tariff Act so that the rate of excise and excise equivalent customs duty applying to all fuels listed will be bi-annually indexed by reference to the consumer price index. The exception will be aviation fuel and the production of crude oil or condensate. The government has also provided that the increased revenue will be diverted to road expenditure. These measures will provide a stable and growing source of revenue to deliver the government's new road infrastructure projects.


Let us be clear: this is not so much the introduction of fuel indexation—that was done by the Hawke government in its 1983 budget. Instead, it is a reintroduction after a number of years of a hiatus. The rate of excise and excise equivalent customs duty on most fuels has not changed since the cessation of indexation in March 2001. As the Treasurer has detailed, petrol and diesel have both maintained an excise rate of 38.143c per litre since that time, with the real value of this rate having been eroded by inflation.


To give listeners a sense of this in relative terms, in the June quarter 2001, excise represented approximately 41.5 per cent of the price of unleaded petrol. Things are vastly different now. It is now worth around 25 per cent. The government has committed to the biggest increase in road expenditure in Australian history and reintroducing indexation is projected to moderately assist in funding these commitments by raising approximately $2.2 billion.


My electorate of it Eden-Monaro is receiving an early down payment on the increased roads expenditure. On 13 June the then Acting Prime Minister—that is, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure—visited Queanbeyan in my electorate. Together with the New South Wales Deputy Premier, Andrew Stoner, he announced a joint funding commitment of $50 million to build the Queanbeyan bypass. The Commonwealth and New South Wales governments have committed $25 million each to construct a 4.6 kilometre two-lane carriageway linking the end of Ellerton Drive to the new Edwin Land Parkway intersection at Old Cooma Road. A bridge will also be built over the Queanbeyan River.


The extension of Ellerton Drive will provide an alternative route for traffic wanting to bypass Queanbeyan's busy CBD and improve road safety. It is also a major economic development investment for the Queanbeyan district and has been the No. 1 infrastructure priority for the Queanbeyan City Council for a number of years. For those people worried that spending decreases in Canberra will adversely affect Queanbeyan and Eden-Monaro, this project will be a massive boost in investment and in jobs.




Mr Albanese:
  Under standing order 66A Interventions, I ask if the member for Eden-Monaro would take an intervention to which he could then respond.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Will the member take an intervention?




Dr HENDY:
  I am always interested to hear your questions.




Mr Albanese:
  I thank the member for Eden-Monaro. I ask, because this is related to the fuel tax increase, whether the project in Queanbeyan that he referred to in his contribution or even the Majura Parkway Parkway that is already under way are dependent upon the carriage of this new tax for funding or whether if this new tax does not go ahead those projects will still be concluded, which would suggest that the funding is not dependent upon this new tax at all.




Dr HENDY:
  The point I think is really relevant is that the ALP absolutely opposed this Queanbeyan bypass in the last election.



Mr Albanese interjecting—




Dr HENDY:
  You did not support it at all.



Opposition members interjecting—




Dr HENDY:
  I was asked a question about the Queanbeyan bypass.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Eden-Monaro has the call. The member for Grayndler will listen in silence to the answer. He was afforded the silence of the chamber for his intervention.




Dr HENDY:
  Indeed, Mr Deputy Speaker. I was asked a question about the Queanbeyan bypass, which was opposed by the Labor Party. The member for Grayndler may have been the relevant minister at the time. He opposed a project that was the No. 1 priority of the Queanbeyan City Council. Instead, those opposite proposed a Dunns Creek Road extension road that was not actually on the list of priorities for the Queanbeyan City Council and was never asked for. It was actually promised for in the 2010 election and was never delivered through the course of the 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 parliamentary term.




Mr Ewen Jones:
  Who was that member?




Dr HENDY:
  The member then was a fellow named Mike Kelly.




Mr Ewen Jones:
  What party was he in?




Dr HENDY:
  He was with the ALP. It is a road—that is, the Queanbeyan bypass—that will not only ease congestion in the CBD but will provide better access to the new housing estates in the area like the Googong development and maintain connection between east and west Queanbeyan during a one-in-100-years flood. This project has been promised for decades at the state level but was never delivered by Labor governments. Coalition governments at both the Commonwealth and state levels are now delivering it.


The government does not resile from the fact that these initiatives come at a cost. The estimated price impact of fuel indexation by the end of 2014-15 is an increase of about 0.8c per litre with an additional 0.1c per litre due to the GST, as the GST is applied to the excise inclusive price. The Treasury has calculated that 50 litres of fuel would cost around 45c extra or around $24 extra per annum if this usage was weekly, assuming the change is passed on in full and ignoring any other price changes. By the end of the forward estimates period in 2013, the increase is about 3.7c per litre with an additional 0.4c per litre due to the GST. Fifty litres of fuel would cost around $2.05 extra or around $107 extra per annum extract if this usage was weekly. For those businesses using fuel in off-road operations or operating a vehicle with a gross vehicle mass in excess of 4.5 tonnes, this measure will not increase their business cost. This is because these businesses are able to receive fuel tax credits to offset the fuel excise paid.


Since I have been interrupted by the member for Grayndler, I will cut to this really important point: I would like to remind people in my electorate that, on coming to office, the new coalition government faced a $47 billion budget deficit for the 2013-14 financial year and $123 billion of projected deficits to 2016-17. Today every man, woman and child in Australia, and therefore in my electorate, is footing a $1 billion interest bill every month on Labor debt. This budget begins the task of restoring budget integrity for the long term, making savings in current expenditure so we can invest in the infrastructure necessary to rebuild our national economy. The 2014 budget outlined a $50 billion investment across Australia to deliver vital transport infrastructure for the 21st century. The budget includes many large-scale commitments which will trigger more than $125 billion in infrastructure investment but, importantly, there is also a significant boost to road funding at the local level.


As part of this agenda we have committed $2.5 million for the continuation of the Roads to Recovery program to support the maintenance and upgrade of local roads. This includes an additional payment of $350 million to local councils during the 2015-16 financial year. To fix dangerous and accident-prone sections of local roads and streets, $565 million will be provided through the ongoing Black Spot program. This includes an extra $100 million in both the 2015-16 and 2016-17 financial years. Recently, on 4 June this year, the Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development and I announced funding of $622,450 to fix dangerous black spots in Eden-Monaro. The Eurobodalla Shire Council will receive a total of $530,000, the Queanbeyan City Council will receive a total of $52,450 and the Bega Valley Shire Council will receive $40,000. The projects were recommended by a panel of independent road safety experts and will be delivered in the course of the coming financial year, 2014-15. A recent evaluation of the Black Spot program found that fatal and casualty crashes are reduced at treated sites by 30 per cent. That is a great result for the Black Spot program. This investment in black spot projects will deliver safer roads for Eden-Monaro through targeted upgrades proven to deliver results.


I also note the government's Bridges Renewal program, which was promised in the election campaign, will commence in 2014-15. Partnering with local councils and state governments, this program will invest $300 million in Commonwealth funding into the repair and replacement of local bridges. I have already raised this program with the mayors in my electorate and they are considering putting in bids.


To improve productivity and safety in the heavy vehicle industry, the government has also committed to continue the heavy vehicle safety and productivity program, with $200 million available over the next five years for projects such as road enhancement, rest areas and technology trials. In addition there has been a Community Development Grants program since the election which has confirmed $314 million in investments in over 300 projects, which are designed to deliver the coalition's election commitments, and some residue projects from the previous government. Among those 300 projects was the $10 million for the port of Eden redevelopment in my electorate, which is one of the most important local investments in infrastructure we have seen in years. It was promised by the previous government over the course of a whole six years but, amazingly, it was not delivered. We are now proceeding with it. The money is in the budget. We are getting on with the job, in consultation and partnership with the New South Wales coalition government.


Talking about infrastructure, I am also happy to confirm the coalition government will continue with its $160 million commitment to the Bega community to build the new South East Regional Hospital. This is a major project, in collaboration with the New South Wales government, which we hope will be completed in 2016. Only in February this year—that is, 2014—was it announced that the tender for the main works were awarded to Brookfield Multiplex. Do not let people think this is a Labor government project just because they announced it before the election: it is taking form and substance under a coalition government. We are actually getting the work done on this vital need for the Bega Valley district.


Further, the government's new $1 billion National Stronger Regions Fund aims to promote economic development through investment in infrastructure projects at the local level. The program will help communities with lower than average socioeconomic circumstances and higher than average unemployment by improving local facilities, creating jobs and building needed infrastructure. Grants from the program will commence next year. Again, I have been talking to the mayors in my district to ensure we work together, collaboratively, to get bids in for this very useful regional and rural program.


By partnering with state governments and leveraging private sector investment through innovative financing models, Australia is set to receive $126 billion in investment in productivity-enhancing infrastructure. Major projects are occurring across the country. I have already talked about major projects in my electorate like the port of Eden redevelopment, the Bega Valley hospital project, the Queanbeyan bypass and other road spending in the Eurobodalla and Bega Valley shires. In conclusion, these bills are a vital part of the government's infrastructure strategy and I commend them to the House.

"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2014-06-25,"



Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari) (16:36):  The shame of this debate is that it has been truncated and effectively gagged, which means that members opposite who should be speaking will not be. I am not talking about members who come from Eden-Monaro or even the mighty Herbert. I am talking about the members for O'Connor, Forrest, Pearce, Capricornia, Grey and Leichhardt—those people who come from large regional electorates. 




Mr Hutchinson:
  Lyons.




Mr SNOWDON:
  Lyons is not a large regional electorate. Let me just tell you what the impact of this GST is on those communities—I'll speak up on behalf of their constituents, even if they won't. Let me be very clear: the fuel excise will have a dramatic impact on people who live in those communities. We heard the Deputy Prime Minister say today in question time that the major impact of the tax is on the trucking industry. Well, I've got news for him. The major impact of the tax is on residents and constituents of mine who live in remote parts of northern Australia.


If you index fuel in the way that is being proposed and it also cops the GST it becomes a cascading tax. So if you pay fuel at $1.53 a litre then the current excise plus GST is 53.2c. If, however, you are paying $2.50 a litre you are paying 63c tax, a difference of 10c. But, of course, the people opposite do not acknowledge this cascading impact of this tax on the cost of fuel for people who live in regional Australia. They need to understand the impact of this tax on those people and on their lives, because families will be adversely affected by this silly tax. The Deputy Prime Minister has already said, and others have spoken of this: 'Fuel tax is a tax on distance. If ever there was a country that should not aggressively tax fuel it is a vast country like Australia. It is a tax on doing business outside of the capital cities. It is a tax on farming and the distant parts of our nation. It is a tax on living and setting up a business in a country town.'


Let me tell you that at Numbulwar in the Northern Territory people are currently paying $2.57 a litre for fuel. At Ngukurr, close by, the price is somewhat similar. Ngukurr is 300 kilometres from Katherine in the Northern Territory. People play football in Katherine of the weekend. The round trip is 600 kilometres and they are paying about $2.50 a litre for fuel. Who can say that this is sustainable? Who can argue that this impost that is going to have a cascading impact and increase over time will not have a major impact on those communities? 


It is not the trucking industry, it is the people who live in those places who are most adversely affected by the changes which are being made. They already suffer huge costs. For example, the Central Land Council did a remote communities store price mark-up survey of the price in the CLC region compared to in the nearest regional centres of Tennant Creek, Alice Springs or Katherine. It found: fruit and vegetables, 35 per cent mark-up; essential health items, 55 per cent; variety products, 150 per cent; takeaway foods, 100 per cent; clothing, 80 per cent. It is the people there who are going to suffer, yet people in this chamber from the National Party and those people who purport to represent regional seats are not prepared to get up on their scrapers and represent the interests of those people. 


We have an obligation in this place to tell this government that the people who will be most adversely affected, in this case in the Northern Territory, are the poorest people in Australia. They will be most gravely impacted by the whole suite of measures in this budget and this fuel indexation proposal will most adversely impact upon them. It is an absolute shame that we cannot get the members of the National Party to come in here and explain why it is they are going to support this measure when they know it is contrary to the interests of their constituents. I make it very clear that there is no way on God's earth I would support such an impost on the people in my community. Why would they?

"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2014-06-25,"



Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (16:41):  I thank those members who have contributed to this debate. These bills modify the Excise Tariff Act 1921, the Customs Tariff Act 1995, the Excise Act 1901, the Fuel Tax Act 2006 and the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 to reintroduce the biennial indexation of excise and excise equivalent customs duty on all non-aviation fuels. Indexation to the consumer price index will begin on 1 August 2014 and will occur in February and August every year thereafter. The re-indexation of fuel excise and excise equivalent customs duty will raise $2.2 billion over the forward estimates. This will provide a predictable and growing source of revenue for the government's road infrastructure projects. Indeed, this revenue source allowed the government to commit to the biggest increase in road expenditure in Australian history in the recent budget.


This legislation also establishes the fuel indexation road funding special account. This account will ensure that net revenue raised through the re-indexation is spent on road infrastructure. The balance of this account will be reported in Budget Paper No. 4. The cost of petrol and diesel is expected to increase by approximately 0.9c per litre for consumers by July 2015 as a result of re-indexation. Businesses using fuel in off-road operations or operating and on-road vehicle with a gross vehicle mass in excess of 4.5 tonnes will not face an increase in their business costs from indexation. These businesses are able to receive fuel tax credits to offset the fuel excise paid. Consequential amendments will also be made to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and the Customs Tariff Act 1995.


While indexation will continue at three decimal places for each indexation period, the applicable duty rate will be rounded from three decimal places in the cent to one decimal place. This rounding will simplify the duty rate to reduce the burden on businesses. On the current rate for petrol this would have the effect of reducing the rate from 38.143c per litre to 38.1c per litre. 


We have reached the point in this debate where the Labor Party have put forward their opposition to it and have even put forward an amendment that in some rather poor way attempts to maintain that this policy is not consistent with what the coalition took to the last election. We have the Greens, in an amazing about-turn, an almost gymnastic effort of a backflip, now saying they will not support re-indexation of excise on fossil fuels—surely something that I think most people would reasonably have thought. But what is extraordinary from the contributions of Labor members opposite is the Labor Party's contention that because we in the coalition government are seriously attempting to deal with the state of the nation's finances, attempting to stop stealing from the next generation of young Australians to pay for today's spending and undertaking to make responsible decisions that deal with the fiscal challenges this nation faces, that is in some way inconsistent with the mandate received from the Australian people at the last election.


Let's be clear about what exactly it is that is inconsistent. It is inconsistent for the Australian Labor Party to come in on debates like this and rail about equity. It is inconsistent for the Australian Labor Party to come into debates like this one and rail about the impact on families. The reason it is inconsistent is that Labor's efforts, not only in relation to this budget initiative but in respect of the nearly $40 billion of additional spending that Labor want to reintroduce into the budget, combined with the fact that Labor stand opposed to revenue increases like this one, underscore that Labor are not serious when it comes to inequity. Labor are not serious when it comes to Australian families because, if they were—if Labor were genuine about the impact on families and genuinely motivated and concerned about what it meant for Australian children—they would not condemn them to tens of billions of dollars of additional debt in order to try to win a few votes.


The Australian Labor Party have form; Australians know that. They will say anything on any given day if they think that there is a vote in it. They will not make the serious decisions that are in the national interest to address the challenges that we have. The Labor Party will not undertake the heavy lifting that is required to meet the challenges this nation faces. When the coalition are genuinely concerned about making sure that Australian children do not have to spend the next 20 or 30 years paying off Labor's debt, we respond by making unpopular decisions like this one—not because we think there are votes in it but because it is in the national interest. The Labor Party used to know that. The Labor Party was once a party of principle.




Mr Hutchinson:
  They stood for something.




Mr CIOBO:
  The Labor Party did indeed once stand for something—but no more. The only thing you can be assured of in this day and age is that the Australian Labor Party will adopt whatever position they need to adopt in order to try to secure themselves one extra vote. So we get members like the member for Lingiari, who professes to be concerned about the people of the Northern Territory and who in his contribution to the debate made claims that this measure is not in their interests but conveniently ignores the fact that, as a result of the six biggest budget deficits in Australia's history, the actions of the government that he was a member of mean that the Australian people of the Northern Territory are forecast to be in debt to the tune of $25,000 for every man, woman and child.




Mr Snowdon:
  What did you do to the deficit when you came to government?




Mr CIOBO:
  So do not expect us to take you very seriously, Member for Lingiari, because we do not take you very seriously.




Mr Snowdon:
  What did you do to the deficit?




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Vasta
):  Order, Member for Lingiari!




Mr CIOBO:
  The member for Lingiari cannot come into the chamber professing to be concerned about Australian families and professing to be concerned about the people of the Northern Territory after the track record of the government of which he was a member left those people in so much debt and deficit that they will take 20 or 30 years to repay the debt.


When we take initiatives like this to stop Australia from staying on a trajectory where we have to borrow $1 billion every single month simply to pay back the interest on the debt that Labor accumulated, we do not expect the Australian Labor Party to stand in the way; we expect them to do the right thing. We know that the right thing is not always popular, but that does not in any way, shape or form erode the fact that it is the right thing to do for our nation. The coalition will continue to do the right thing for our nation. The coalition will continue to make sure that we put the interests of the next generation of Australians first. The next generation of Australians know that we will attempt to bequeath to them a country that is in a stronger financial position than what we inherited. That is not Labor's approach; it is not the approach of the Greens. On that basis, this is the right thing to do. I commend the bill to the House.

Ms KATE ELLIS
 (Adelaide) (19:30):  This is the week of Senate valedictory speeches, when we farewell many of those who have served in the other place. I would like to use this opportunity tonight to recognise all the departing senators, from both sides of the house, and thank them for their contributions to the parliament. I particularly note the departing Labor senators Mark Furner, Mark Bishop, Mehmet Tillem, Ursula Stephens, Louise Pratt, Lin Thorp, John Hogg and Don Farrell, and send them my particular gratitude and my every best wish for the future.


It may not shock you that I want to focus my remarks tonight on the senator who has served the great state of South Australia, Don Farrell. I wanted to do this for a number of reasons, but one is because—with the possible exception of Julia Gillard—I have never met anyone in public life whose public persona is so very different to the individual they actually are. Now is the time: we owe it to ourselves to set the record straight.


Some choose to refer to Don as a 'faceless man'. It is a particularly absurd way to refer to someone whose face is very public through both election and appointment to the federal ministry, and it is also just plain wrong. It is wrong to leave unchallenged any perception of a factional operative interested only in power or, as some others choose to put forward, a staunch conservative intent on pushing his own moral viewpoint on others, incapable of accepting different views. This is not the man Don Farrell is. This is not the Don Farrell I have the pleasure of knowing and the privilege of working with.


It is just that this parliament has a permanent and lasting account of the real and remarkable contributions of this great South Australian to public life, so I want to tell you a bit about the real Don Farrell. Don Farrell is a powerful figure in politics in South Australia. He is a thoroughly decent human being, a man of absolute integrity, a giant of the labour movement and a champion of working people. He is also an absolutely besotted husband, father and soon-to-be grandfather. If you want to know the real Don Farrell, then you are best served to set aside the cliches about faceless men.


Don has dedicated his life absolutely to the working people of this nation. He is driven, daily, by fighting for fairness and ensuring that people are valued and treated appropriately in the workplace. I know this is true of the retail workers in Australia Don dedicated so many years to representing. My first introduction to Don was as a young checkout operator who was a member of the South Australian SDA and a recipient of the benefits and conditions Don fought for and secured. He has been tireless in pursuing fairness and justice for working Australians.


Don also has an enthusiasm for and commitment to his work that I think many of us could learn much from. Whether as a senator, parliamentary secretary, minister or shadow minister, Don has never once taken for granted the amazing opportunity we are given of serving in this place. He has always worked to make the most of every opportunity and repay the faith that has been placed in him. I know that in recent months, as the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, he has shown the same dedication to the pursuit of justice and commitment to fairness that has been evident throughout his working life.


He has achieved much in parliament and in his portfolios, but he has also played an important role within our party. People in this place talk about the under-representation of women. Don generally does not, but few have done more to walk the walk than he has in supporting and promoting. When I was a 26-year-old girly candidate with progressive views on social policy and untested qualities as a local candidate in a tough battle it was Don who stood up and supported me for the seat of Adelaide. I am incredibly grateful for that.


Don has, at every stage, put our party before his own individual interest, often at great personal expense. He has contributed more than most ever will but has never sought to take in return. He has been dealt an injustice he simply does not deserve. It is not just my words; I have heard from many people from different sides of politics. Today I spoke to Roger Drake, an employer who worked with Don, who said: 'I've worked with Don for 30 years. He is the fairest man that I've ever dealt with.' Someone from across the factional divide, Pat Conlon, said he is: 'an outstanding human being who in politics always gave far more to others than he ever took for himself. I am proud to call him a friend.' And Annette Hurley said he has worked in 'an honest, compassionate and clean way. He was and is a model of leadership.'


Our parliament is better because of Don Farrell, our party is better because of Don Farrell, and our country is better because of Don Farrell. I thank him wholeheartedly for his contribution.

"Giles, Andrew, MP",ALP,2014-06-25,"



Mr GILES
 (Scullin) (09:36):  I have spoken often in this place, indeed, at every opportunity on the impacts of this government's budget on our economy and on our community. I have also been speaking with and listening to Scullin constituents about their thoughts and concerns in relation to this budget. So I take this opportunity to give voice of one constituent, one of many.


Yesterday the effects of this government's cruel cuts and budget broken promises were brought into stark relief as a constituent on an age pension, Silvana, told me her story. It deeply affected me. When government members talk about their priorities reflecting tough choices, I say this: how tough was it to make this choice? Silvana is 67 years old and lives in Lalor. Her husband is in a nursing home with dementia and has Alzheimer's. His entire pension goes to his nursing home for his care. Silvana gets $700 a fortnight; she has to use $140 a month for her husband's medication as well as other expenses like clothes and occasional haircuts. The rest she has to live on.


Silvana has been volunteering at Peter Lalor Secondary College for 28 years. She has worked all of her life, most of it in factories. In fact, Silvana started working at a factory in Richmond when she was less than 12 years old. She has done more than her fair share of lifting. Both of Silvana's children are struggling with debt, trying to save money to buy their own houses and are in no position to offer their parents money. Silvana says she finds it difficult to pay her water and energy bills. She has no money in the bank, no money saved for her or her husband's funeral. She only occasionally goes to the cinema. She makes tough choices. As the opposition leader, the now Prime Minister promised there would be no changes to pensions but now wants to cut the pension and increase the retirement age. Australia's 2.3 million pensioners have every right to feel betrayed by the Prime Minister.


The current indexation system introduced by Labor helps the pension keep pace with the cost of living to maintain decent standards of living and keeps faith with our societal obligation to pensioners, supporting in their old age people who have worked hard all their lives. CPI is not an accurate reflection of pensioners' cost of living and will mean pensioners like Silvana have to get by on less. Had this new indexation system been in place for the last four years, a single pensioner on the maximum rate would be around $1,500 a year worse off than they are today.


Silvana wanted me to ask a question of the Prime Minister on behalf not just of her but on behalf of all pensioners in Victoria—and I suspect Australia. What are pensioners like her supposed to do when the pension is cut? This is the ultimate test: to walk mile in someone else's shoes. I doubt our self-described 'best friend of pensioners' would get very far in this regard. So, Silvana, let me be clear: I and the Labor Party will fight for a fair go for you and other pensioners. For us, this is not a tough choice.

Mr Andrews:
  The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: 


(1) The total number of humanitarian/refugee and family stream migrants in English Proficiency group 3 and 4 countries who have settled in each of the requested areas since 1 January 2009 are presented in the tables at Attachment A. 


(2) The Government has commissioned the Building a New Life in Australia longitudinal study of humanitarian migrants. The objective of the study is to better understand the factors that aid (or hinder) the successful settlement of humanitarian migrants in Australia. The study commenced in 2013 and is being conducted over five years. The study includes asking respondents why they chose their current home and respondents will be followed if they move.

Definitions and Caveats



All data is sourced from the Department's Settlement Database (SDB).


 




Data Capture





SDB collects data concerning settlers who have been granted a permanent (or provisional) visa. 





SDB data is compiled from a number of sources including Department of Immigration and Border Protection (DIBP), other Commonwealth agencies and service providers.



 




English Proficiency 





English Proficiency Group 3 contains countries, from which Australia has received settlers in the last 5 years, where 57.5% to 84.5% of these settlers reported that they spoke English only or Good English at the last Census.





English Proficiency Group 4 contains countries, from which Australia has received settlers in the last 5 years, where less than 57.5% of these settlers reported that they spoke English only or Good English at the last Census.



 




Local Government Areas (LGAs)





Abbreviations as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics are: (A) Area; (AC) Aboriginal council; (DC) District Council; (R) Regional Council; (RC) Rural City; (S) Shire; (T) Town.



 




Data Limitations





SDB includes settlers who were:



granted a permanent (or provisional) visa after 1/1/1991 and arrived in Australia within 25 months of visa grant, (or are yet to arrive and it has been less than 25 months since their visa was granted), or 


who arrived in Australia after 1/1/1991 having been granted a permanent (or provisional) visa prior to 1/1/1991. 




SDB has not been adjusted to reflect settlers who are deceased, have permanently departed Australia or who have had their grants cancelled.





SDB includes some duplicate settler records.





SDB includes only the settler's latest known residential (or intended residential) address. Address information is only updated if the department is notified. Some settlers have no address details recorded.





SDB location data is based on the 2011 Australian Standard Geographic Classification (ASGC).





SDB includes only the latest permanent (or provisional) visa for a settler.



 




Reporting Limitations





Reports including numbers of settlers in specified locations may be inaccurate due to limitations in address data. This is particularly problematic for regional/rural locations.





Settlers with an existing permanent (or provisional) visa may appear in different reporting categories over time if they are granted a subsequent permanent (or provisional) visa. 





Reports including numbers of settlers of 5 or fewer have been suppressed (indicated by an asterisk*) for client confidentiality.
