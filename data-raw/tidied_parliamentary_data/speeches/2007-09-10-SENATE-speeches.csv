"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2007-09-10,—I table a supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government amendments to be moved to this bill. The memorandum was circulated in the chamber on 8 August 2007.,SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT (CITIZENSHIP TESTING) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-09-10,"—by leave—I move Democrats amendments (1) and (2) on sheet 5326 revised together:
(1)    Schedule 1, page 3 (after line 18), after item 1, insert:
1A  Section 3
Insert:

citizenship education program is a program which gives people from non-English speaking backgrounds an understanding of the English language and Australian society and shall be in such form as is prescribed.
(2)    Schedule 1, item 3, page 3 (line 28), after “successfully completed a citizenship test” insert “or, if from a non-English speaking background, a citizenship education program”.
We have already had the second reading stage of this legislation, a few weeks back. I will restate the Democrats core position: we have the view that this legislation is not necessary. There has not been any evidence provided either to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee inquiry or, indeed, to the wider public as to why it is needed. Let us not forget this is quite an expensive process. Well over $100 million of taxpayers’ funds is going into instituting, setting up and running the citizenship test. To me—and this is reinforced by the draft booklet Becoming an Australian citizen that has been put together and released by the government since we had the second reading stage of this debate—the whole thrust behind the citizenship test proposal from the government reflects a very insecure nation, a real example of cultural cringe and a very narrow, timid, inward-looking approach to Australia and what it means to be Australia let alone what the future potential of Australia is.
That is at that the core of why I think this is bad policy and bad legislation. You do not implement a major proposal like this, dealing with the very important issues of citizenship and the qualification for citizenship, without a thorough process—not the flimsy, farcical, token consultation process and the quite poor issues paper that was put together to initiate that process—and you should certainly put together some evidence as to why it is needed. You do not make these sorts of changes unless there is evidence that there is a problem, and at no stage has there been an indication of a problem with regard to qualification for citizenship and the sorts of things that are addressed in the citizenship test. Let us not forget that nobody is eligible to apply for citizenship, let alone then undergo the test, unless they have already been resident in this country for four years, with at least one of those years as a permanent resident. We are dealing with people who are already permanent residents of Australia and who have been part of our community for four years. To suggest that testing them in the way that is proposed through this legislation is somehow going to fix any problem that exists with regard to people who are part of the Australian community is just ludicrous.
On top of that, I do not accept the premise that we have a problem with people who are part of the Australian community and with people who are taking up citizenship. Hundreds of thousands of people become residents of Australia every year. Over 150,000 new people become permanent residents of Australia every year. More than double that number become long-term temporary residents each year. When we are having such large numbers of new residents coming into the country every year, to suggest, without any evidence to demonstrate it, that there is a problem is poor public policy and generates unnecessary concern in the community when no problem has been identified. To then suggest that some of that goes to the qualification for citizenship creates a completely unhelpful and, I would argue, destructive perception about migrant communities and about the many, many migrants who become Australian citizens.
Let us not forget that by far the largest group of people who are long-term residents of the Australian community who do not take up citizenship are people from the UK and from New Zealand. On my understanding of information provided by the Parliamentary Library, more than half of the very large numbers—hundreds of thousands—of people who live in Australia who are eligible to become citizens but do not bother taking up citizenship are New Zealanders and people from the UK. That is fine; that is their right. If they do not wish to become citizens and just wish to remain as permanent residents they can do that, but to suggest that we have some problem with eligibility for citizenship, with all of the issues that surround it, without actually looking at the evidence is, firstly, poor public policy, secondly, signals a government that is not confident about the vibrant, very strong, diverse and dynamic multicultural Australia that we have and have had for decades and, thirdly, is potentially quite destructive in the long term.
Those points need to be made once again at the start of this debate. This citizenship test is not necessary. At best, I think it will just be a large waste of money and it will be a bit of light entertainment every now and then for the media to run some of the test questions that will inevitably become public, even though the government wants to keep them secret, and test them against the so-called average Australian in the shopping malls and find out how many of us actually get them wrong all the time. I suspect it is quite likely that that is all it will end up being—another pointless piece of bureaucracy paid for by the taxpayer that we can all make fun of from time to time as a bit of a Trivial Pursuit thing on the side. If that is all it is then it is still degrading Australian citizenship, which is more important than that.
But more dangerous is the potential for it to be used consciously, or even subconsciously, as an exclusionary device, and that is where my concerns become greater. I am not saying that is the government’s intent currently, but it can be used for that purpose, particularly given that the desire to keep secret even the questions that are used reinforces the risk of it being used for exclusionary purposes. It is telling in some ways that, in justifying bringing in this test, the government have pointed to other countries that have done the same. I am thinking of the Netherlands, the UK and the US. The government have not provided any evidence that it has produced positive results—improved social cohesion, integration or citizen participation—in the countries that have done it. There is no evidence to back up any of that at all, and none was provided to the Senate committee inquiry. Particularly in the Netherlands, it has been used as a mechanism to target some in the migrant community. It has been used, and proposals have been floated specifically for it to be used, to target and try to exclude Muslims. I am not saying that is the government’s intent, but that is how similar tests have been used in another country, one that this government has pointed to, and the fear that it could be used in this way does exist amongst some within the migrant community in Australia.
If we are putting forward a public policy proposal, particularly one that is going to be creating a whole new web of bureaucracy at great public cost, then we have got to look at what the reason for it is and what the consequences of it are. There has been no evidence put forward as to why it is needed but there is evidence that a consequence of it is greater apprehension amongst some in the community, so we actually have a perverse consequence of it potentially leading to less social cohesion and less effective integration by people perceiving it as having been put forward as an exclusionary device. Such perceptions are real and should be acknowledged. It is not enough just to say, ‘That is not our intent.’ I am not saying it is the government’s intent but I am saying that is a potential future use for it and I am saying there is a real, current perception by some of it being a possible future use and there possibly being such an intent.
I hope we do not need to debate the reality that there is a strong fear amongst many in the Muslim communities around Australia—there is certainly that in my own state of Queensland—that they are being targeted at the moment in all sorts of ways, through all sorts of laws and through public rhetoric. It is a simple fact that members of the Muslim communities have been targeted time after time through public rhetoric by members of this government who have not been disciplined, brought into line or corrected by the leaders of this government. In that circumstance it is simple common sense and human nature for the people who are repeatedly being targeted, those who are repeatedly being misrepresented and who are repeatedly the target of ignorant public statements, to feel that these mechanisms are potentially going to be used to target them, particularly—and there has been no evidence put forward to suggest why these things are necessary—when we have a determination amongst those in the government to ensure that these sorts of things are maintained under a veil of secrecy. Those important points need to be made.
Having said all that, I state that we, as the Democrats often do, will seek to improve the legislation in the committee stage of the debate. That is what our amendments go to. I have already formally moved jointly my first two amendments, which relate to a citizenship education program which gives people from non-English-speaking backgrounds an understanding of the English language and Australian society and would be in a form as prescribed by the minister.
The other amendment provides an alternative mechanism. The intent is to provide an alternative citizenship mechanism for non-English-speaking entrants, so it is being put forward under the assumption that the citizenship test and the legislation will go ahead in some form, even though the Democrats do not believe the test is necessary. The amendment is based upon a significant number of concerns that were put forward by a range of people during the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs inquiry into this legislation. They included the need to ensure that the test did not operate, either deliberately or by default, as an exclusionary mechanism for people from non-English-speaking backgrounds, particularly those from refugee backgrounds.
People from refugee backgrounds are of course, by definition, different from other types of migrants in that they have been forced to flee their homeland rather than having made a choice to simply seek a different country, a different future and a different life. Obviously, refugees have done that as well but they have done that by virtue of having been forced out of a situation that is unsafe, where they are at risk of serious persecution, by definition, and having had Australia offer them the opportunity to rebuild their lives.
It is a simple fact that in those circumstances from time to time such people are going to find difficulty in meeting some of the formal criteria that can be put forward in tests like this. So that amendment is based upon the recommendation that was put forward in my dissenting committee report, or minority report, that we ensure that refugee and humanitarian entrants from non-English-speaking backgrounds with a low level of English proficiency may be exempt from the test if they fulfil an alternative requirement such as attending a citizenship course. So it still provides that mechanism whereby they need to attend a course that specifically looks at issues relating to citizenship.
Let me say that, whilst I have not seen a single piece of evidence that suggests a citizenship test as is proposed is necessary or even helpful, I do think that it is desirable and appropriate for all prospective citizens to learn about what is involved in citizenship. I would actually like to see all Australian-born citizens required to learn that because, quite frankly, most of us do not know—and I would say, on the basis of a number of statements made by members of this parliament on this issue, a number of members of this parliament do not know—some of the basics around Australian citizenship: what is involved, what its history is, what the rights attached to it are, what the responsibilities attached to it are and just how intangible a concept it has been under law in many respects throughout Australia’s history. So I think we could all benefit from that, quite frankly. But, if you are going to create a requirement for new citizens to have done that, even though we are not requiring Australian-born citizens to have done that, then we should at least ensure that there are some options that enable sufficient flexibility for people who are not going to be able, because of their background, to meet the single structure that is being put forward.
I know that there are opportunities for exemptions within the legislation. As is often the case these days, they are pretty much totally at ministerial discretion, so we are just giving to the government, through the minister of the day, more power over people’s lives. I believe that having a specifically detailed alternative pathway for people from non-English-speaking backgrounds who are refugee and humanitarian entrants provides some extra surety that that option will be provided to people.
Let me emphasise, in moving these amendments and in commenting on those who are refugee and humanitarian entrants—it should be continually stressed—that the one group in the community of new arrivals to Australia who are most prompt in wanting to take up citizenship and to engage fully with the Australian community through citizenship and membership of the Australian society, are people from refugee and humanitarian backgrounds. It is well established that they are most likely to want to quickly take up citizenship. So there should be no suggestion that people from refugee and humanitarian entrance backgrounds are some sort of problem. They are the keenest to fully integrate into the Australian community and to get on with fully rebuilding their lives to contribute to the country that has given them another chance. We should not have some poorly thought through bureaucratic and politically motivated citizenship test get in the way of their doing that. Our country would be the loser as well as those people. So let us not forget that part of it: it is in the interests of the entire community to ensure that we can get full participation by people who history has shown contribute enormously to the development, prosperity and richness of Australia.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT (CITIZENSHIP TESTING) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2007-09-10,"—I want to not only speak to the amendments that have been moved by Senator Bartlett but also comment more broadly on the direction that Senator Bartlett is taking. I will use the more general language of the Democrats for the purpose of the chair. It seems to me that the Democrats are answering a proposal put some time ago and which the Prime Minister originally announced, and I think it is instructive to understand what he said at that time. In December 2006 the Howard government announced that it would introduce a new citizenship test and that migrants wanting to become citizens would be required to sit a formal examination, in English, in which they would answer 30 questions, drawn from a pool of 200, about Australian values, traditions, institutions and history.
A significant amount of water has flowed under the bridge since then and we now have a much changed situation from the government’s perspective. Labor, though, has been consistent throughout. Labor has said it supports the principle of formalising the current citizenship test. The issue, then, centres round the reasonableness of it all.
The amendments proposed by the Democrats today, and the language surrounding them, tend to answer the original proposal put forward by the government and they also focus, in part, on the test itself. I want to draw back a bit from that and have a look at the broader perspective, because Labor has always said that it is about the reasonableness of the test and not about the test individually. Labor recognises that the strength and success of the citizenship test lie in its ability—in other words, a facilitative provision—to promote community inclusion and provide opportunity for people to fully engage in the Australian way of life. That is a journey that people need to undertake, and the way they can undertake it is through this process. What Labor has added to the debate, which is going a bit further from what the government has done, is to say that it will ensure that the citizenship test is not a daunting prospect and that it will not discourage people from becoming citizens. Labor says that it is about recognising the importance of teaching English, that English language skills are important not only in the labour market but also for social inclusion at home and at work in offices around the country.
A Rudd Labor government would also provide for the teaching of English and citizenship. To that end the shadow minister for immigration moved a second reading amendment in the other place in which lies the crux of the whole debate. The shadow minister noted that the issue is whether the citizenship test to be determined under the legislation is reasonable. He also noted the importance of teaching English, the development of English language skills and the acquisition of knowledge of Australian history, culture and values. And I am sure the Democrats and others in this chamber would agree on those values. It is about ensuring that we do support and provide improvements to the Adult Migrant English Program and other settlement services to assist migrants to participate fully in the Australian community and to ultimately pass the citizenship test.
If we look at the bill now before the committee, we can see that it does provide a flexible approach, and that should not be overlooked. We do say that we continue to have concerns about a great deal of emphasis being placed on the citizenship test rather than on the support services and community initiatives that are critical to building an integrated and inclusive society. That is where the debate should be, quite frankly, but that is where this government has left the field.
By way of background, Democrats amendment (1) explains that a ‘citizenship education program is a program which gives people from non-English-speaking backgrounds an understanding of the English language and Australian society and shall be in such form as is prescribed’. Democrats amendment (2) inserts:
Schedule 1, item 3, page 3 (line 28), after “successfully completed a citizenship test” insert “or, if from a non-English speaking background, a citizenship education program”.
The question arising, then, is whether there may be a way in which the test could be combined with coursework. It is not unusual for that to occur, although traditionally there are tests and there is coursework, and the two generally do not meet. But the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship does have the discretion to make such an alternative test available if necessary.
However, Labor will not be supporting these amendments which propose a citizenship education program, on the basis that the concept of a separate stream of testing for anyone from a non-English-speaking background ultimately ignores the fact that many people from a non-English-speaking background may already be fluent in English. They may have English as their second language and may be fluent in either written or spoken English, or both. Moreover, such a program overlooks the possibility of a person passively sitting in a classroom ignoring the citizenship coursework—in fact, not being particularly receptive to it. The proposed amendments do not go on to indicate how that election of coursework with test would be made, whether it would be elected by the person sitting the test or by determination of a government official. So, on that basis, Labor does not support the amendments and will not be voting for them.
I wanted to raise those couple of issues and to add at the outset the more general comments about this bill in order to ensure that Labor’s position is clear. Of course, if the Democrats want to add anything they certainly may, but I do not think it will convince us to support the proposed amendments.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT (CITIZENSHIP TESTING) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2007-09-10,"—The government oppose these amendments proposed by the Democrats for a number of reasons, some of which we hold in common with what Senator Ludwig outlined. I think this has the propensity to result in two streams of applicants for citizenship: those who require an education program and those who do not. More importantly, it presupposes that there is a cohort of applicants for citizenship who do require some education. We have a resources book, and that is where the questions would be drawn from. We say to people: ‘Look, there is the resources book. The test is there for you all.’ As to how that is developed over time and how it is implemented, we have dealt with concerns by saying that we will have a review of this. We not only will closely monitor how this is implemented but also have agreed to a review in three years time.
The Democrats also seek to make this a legislative instrument which would be subject to review by the parliament according to the Legislative Instruments Act. We do not believe it appropriate that this be subject to that act. It would lead to uncertainty because you would have a test in place and a system in place which people had come to accept and then subsequently it could be changed because it is disallowed under the provisions of the Legislative Instruments Act. Of course, that would need a majority of parliamentarians to support it, but this is something which could be done with less requirement than, say, an act of parliament. To that extent, we believe it could lead to some uncertainty. So I say to the Democrats, Mr Temporary Chairman, that we certainly will be watching the implementation of this closely. I think we have approached it carefully—for instance, taking into account youth, age and mental incapacity. People under 18, those over 60 and those with a mental incapacity will not be subject to the test. I think that to go any further, however, would create a division within the community of applicants for citizenship. For those reasons, we oppose the Democrats amendments.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT (CITIZENSHIP TESTING) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2007-09-10,"—The Australian Greens support these particular amendments. We are opposed to the citizenship test because we do not think it is going to meet the objectives that the government set out for the test about improving the English language skills of migrants and creating a more cohesive society in Australia. In fact, we think it will do precisely the opposite to those two things. What these amendments go to is ensuring that people have the opportunity to learn about citizenship and what that means. We think that is fundamentally important and something that should be made available to all people who are seeking to gain citizenship in Australia. Indeed, we think there is benefit in people who are citizens of Australia by birth also having the opportunity to access that information. So we are very supportive of having an education program such as that proposed in this set of amendments that Senator Bartlett has put forward.
I want to ask the minister a couple of more general questions about some of the criticism of the citizenship test and, in particular, whether the government has a view about what impact the introduction of the citizenship test will have on the existing English language classes for migrants. We heard during the Senate inquiry from people who teach English as a second language in Australia. They were concerned that the existing English language classes for migrants may end up teaching people how to pass the test rather than the communication skills that they need to survive here in Australia.
That is a very significant concern for me because I do not want to see the existing English language programs undermined. I think these programs, by the way, are good and need to be expanded. That is why I moved a second reading amendment on behalf of the Greens calling for that to occur. I acknowledge that there was some additional funding provided in the budget. I think the programs that exist are beneficial and I would not want to see them undermined by the introduction of a citizenship test that sees those language programs change to end up teaching people only how to pass the test. I do not think that is anywhere near as helpful as teaching people the communication skills that they need. Has the government formed a view about that or done any kind of assessment of the impact that this citizenship test will have on the existing English language programs for migrants?",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT (CITIZENSHIP TESTING) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2007-09-10,—I can answer that question quite clearly. There will be no impact. The program will continue as it is. It is there to teach adult migrants the English language and it will continue to do that. It is funded separately. It is dealt with in a separate area of government and there will be no impact on that program. They will not be classes to pass the citizenship test.,SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT (CITIZENSHIP TESTING) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2007-09-10,"—There are two things that come out of that. I am not sure whether I have made myself clear in asking my questions. I accept that there is a separate budget, that that is where the funding comes from and that the funding for the English language programs will continue. I totally accept that. I note the comments that the then parliamentary secretary Andrew Robb made some time ago, at the time at which the citizenship test was being proposed, in which he said that if we needed to increase the funding for English language programs as a result of the introduction of the citizenship test then that was open. I recall those comments that he made at a citizenship ceremony—I think it might have been in Melbourne—some time ago. So I do understand. I am not suggesting that there is a budgetary link. If there is going to be an announcement about an increase, that is great—that is welcome; I would love to hear about that.
The minister said they are not going to be teaching people how to pass the test. I accept that that is not the government’s intention of the English language classes that are provided to migrants. I accept at face value what the government says about the benefits of the programs for migrants. I support them; I think they are good. I want to see them expanded. So my concern is not that the government is saying that these programs should be about people passing the test. I am not making the claim that that is the government’s intention. Educators who appeared before the committee said that, when you have a test coming up at school, the classes before the test end up being oriented towards helping people to pass the test. I am not saying that that is the government’s intention, and I accept the minister’s answer that that is not the government’s plan, but does the government have a concern that that may occur? If that which educators have expressed to us is a concern to the government, what kinds of mechanisms might the government be able to put in place to ensure that those classes did not become just about teaching people how to pass the tests? I think we all agree that would not be the best use of that budgetary allocation. I am not questioning the government’s intention. It is more a question of whether the government is concerned that this may occur and what can be done to ensure that it does not occur.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT (CITIZENSHIP TESTING) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2007-09-10,"—We have announced that we will be doing a review in three years time and that we will be monitoring closely its implementation. If, contrary to the government’s intention and will, the courses do become courses for the test, we will take action, but I do not think you can plan or say what action you will take until that problem arises. We have no indication that it will arise, for a number of reasons: (1) we do not intend that it will—it would be contrary to government policy—and (2) the teaching of adult migrant English is entirely a different program. It is to teach people English. We do not see how it could happen, but if someone wanted to change that, and did so contrary to government policy, we would of course act. But we are monitoring its implementation across the board. We will keep an eye on that.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT (CITIZENSHIP TESTING) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2007-09-10,"—I have two other general questions that I want to ask the Minister for Human Services. A number of migrant groups in the community are fearful that the introduction of a citizenship test will deter some people from making an application to become a citizen. We can only speculate why somebody may be deterred. Perhaps they do not have the same educational background as people in here and the thought of having to do a test is intimidating. When they see the level of detail in the draft booklet, that may turn them off, but without wanting to speculate on what all those reasons may be, without being able to state categorically the things that would deter each particular individual from applying to become a citizen, I did want to ask the government whether it shared that concern a number of migrant groups have raised. I also raised this concern upon hearing it from migrant communities. None of us wants anyone to be deterred from making an application to become an Australian citizen. So I just ask the government whether it shares any of those concerns that the migrant groups have raised about this citizenship test.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT (CITIZENSHIP TESTING) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2007-09-10,"—I say again that we will be monitoring the program closely and there will be a review in three years time. We do not have any results of any reviews overseas. I understand there is one being conducted in United States which has not yet concluded. We will watch that carefully. However, I think it is fair to say that the government does not share the concerns of people who think that this might deter people from applying for citizenship. As I understand it, there is a four-year requirement for residency before you can take the test and I think that someone who has been in Australia for four years would have sufficient confidence to make an application for citizenship and go through the test. The longer you stay in a place, the more comfortable you become in that environment, and one would assume that you would have the confidence to do it. I do not think Australia is a country where people are overawed or intimidated by the programs we have. I do not see any reason for there to be a reduction in the number of applications because people do not want to take the citizenship test. We have nothing on which to base any concern. We will be continuously monitoring this, as I say, and in three years time there will be a review. We will also be looking at the overseas experience. We have not yet seen the results of reviews overseas. As I say, we will have a look at the review being conducted in the United States when it is handed down.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT (CITIZENSHIP TESTING) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2007-09-10,"—The other question I want to ask, which again came up in the Senate inquiry, is about the best way for people to learn about Australian values, as the government defines them. There was a suggestion made by people who appeared in front of the Senate committee that if you teach someone values in their own language they may have a better capacity to understand the intricacies around what values or content you are trying to get across than if you teach them in a language which is not their first language. I note that, in the United States citizenship test, people can learn the values part of the citizenship test in their own language, and I presume that is because they have made an analysis or an assessment that the best way to convey what can be quite complex, complicated or detailed information is in the language that the person best understands. I acknowledge it is not the government’s intention to do that here.  I ask the minister whether the government has looked at and considered that example in the United States—where you learn about the values in your own language, in your first language—and rejected it.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT (CITIZENSHIP TESTING) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2007-09-10,"—The Australian values section of the resources book is fairly general. It sets out:
Values which are important in modern Australia include:
respect for the equal worth, dignity and freedom of the individual
freedom of speech
freedom of religion and secular government
freedom of association
support for parliamentary democracy and the rule of law
equality under the law
equality of men and women
equality of opportunity
peacefulness
tolerance, mutual respect and compassion for those in need.
It goes on to say:
These values and principles are central to Australia remaining a stable, prosperous and peaceful community.
Those are fairly general values which can incorporate within them a great deal of difference, which we enjoy in our Australian community. Nonetheless, they are of general application and we do not see a need to have specific tuition in a person’s own language to appreciate those values. They are of such a general nature that you do not really need to drill down into great detail which might require communicating with someone in their own language.
The second part of this is the requirement that a person understands and has a degree of proficiency in English. Part of the application for becoming a citizen of Australia is that you have a basic understanding of English. We think it would defeat the purpose for us to get into the weeds of the detail and do that in a person’s original language because that would be confusing things even more. We believe that the values as set out in the resources manual, which is freely available for people who want to apply to become citizens, are self-explanatory. Even with a very basic understanding of English you can still appreciate what is being conveyed under the Australian values section. We do not think it is so complicated that you need to communicate with a person in their original language. Our view is that what other countries are doing in that regard might suit their regime or the way they have structured their citizenship tests but we think that the way that we have put it is of such simplicity that there will not need to be any tuition or training in a person’s own language.
Question negatived.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT (CITIZENSHIP TESTING) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2007-09-10,"—by leave—I move government amendments (1) and (2) together:
(1)    Schedule 1, item 5, page 4 (after line 33), at the end of subsection 23A(1), add:
Note:   The test must be related to the eligibility criteria referred to in paragraphs 21(2)(d), (e) and (f).
(2)    Schedule 1, item 5, page 5 (after line 6), at the end of subsection 23A(3), add:
Note:   The eligibility criteria for sitting the test cannot be inconsistent with this Act and in particular subsection 21(2) (about the general eligibility criteria for becoming an Australian citizen).
The first amendment clarifies the operation of proposed subsection 23A(1) and the second amendment clarifies the operation of proposed subsection 23A(3). The first amendment comes as the result of a recommendation of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. That committee recommended an amendment to clarify what it believed was some ambiguity existing in the proposed subsection. Although our legal advice indicates that there is no ambiguity, this proposed amendment inserts a notice at the end of the new proposed subsection to make clear that the test approved by the minister under the proposed subsection must relate to the eligibility criteria referred to in paragraphs 21(2)(d), (e) and (f). We appreciate that the Senate committee was of that view and we respectfully disagree but, to make it absolutely beyond doubt, we will insert a note to deal with the concern raised by the Senate committee. Our legal advice is that the note is not needed, but we do appreciate the work the Senate committee did on this. This particular committee does a very good job, so we have taken that on board and we will put in that note.
The second amendment inserts a note into proposed subsection 23A(3) in item 5 of schedule 1 to the bill to make clear that the eligibility criteria for sitting a test cannot be inconsistent with the act and, in particular, with the general eligibility criteria for citizenship contained in the new proposed subsection 21(2) of the bill. Again, this note will alleviate concerns that have been raised regarding the power to determine eligibility criteria for sitting a test. Concerns had been expressed about this during proceedings before the Senate committee. I do not think there was a Senate committee recommendation on this, but the government did take note of those concerns and, in an effort to allay them, has determined to insert this note.
We believe that these two amendments will make absolutely clear the operation of the respective proposed subsections. Again, whilst on legal advice this is not necessary, we are doing it in an effort of good faith and to demonstrate very clearly our position in relation to the operation of these proposed subsections. I commend both amendments to the committee.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT (CITIZENSHIP TESTING) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2007-09-10,"—The opposition can say that we support the amendments proposed by the government. It is helpful to understand that the government have indicated that they are willing to take up the committee recommendation, if only on the basis of a belt-and-braces approach, although they could always table the advice if they were so minded. I am certainly not asking for it, but they could always table it if they were so minded.
The third recommendation of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs is:
... that proposed subsection 23A(1) of the Bill be amended to specifically require that the test relate to the eligibility criteria in paragraphs—
and it becomes a little technical—
21 (2)(d),(e) and (f).
The government’s amendments in relation to eligibility criteria do reflect the committee’s recommendations and obviously attract Labor’s support. Labor welcomes the government amendments to the bill. The amendment to clause 23A(1)—that the test must relate to the eligibility criteria referred to in clause 21(2), paragraphs (d), (e) and (f)—and the amendment to clause 23A(3), which adds that the eligibility criteria for sitting the test cannot be inconsistent with the Australian Citizenship Act and, in particular, clause 21(2), which provides the general eligibility criteria for becoming an Australian citizen, actually address one of the key issues that Labor raised as soon as the debate commenced in the other house.
Resolving the matters relating to clause 23A is essential to the credibility of the legislation. Labor supports the shift by the government in this amendment, supports the outcomes of the committee and supports the amendments proposed by the government. Labor does appreciate the work that the Senate committee has done in respect of this bill. Unfortunately, I did not participate in the committee deliberations on this matter. I do recognise the work of the secretariat as well—if that has not already been said before—and the committee members who undertook this work.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT (CITIZENSHIP TESTING) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-09-10,"—I move Democrats amendment (3) on sheet 5326, as revised:
(3)    Schedule 1, item 5, page 4, (after line 33), insert:
      (1A)    Prior to ministerial approval, the proposed test questions are to be trialled by the Australian Electoral Commission on a demographically representative sample group of Australian-born citizens to determine the suitability of the test questions.
This amendment is important in order to ensure that we do not get a two-tiered standard attached to Australian citizenship. There is a real potential that migrants who have to undertake this test to become a citizen will in effect have to know more about Australian values, history and geography and the Australian system of government et cetera than Australian-born citizens, who get citizenship as of right under law without having to undergo a test.
That point should be emphasised, because we had the repeated mantra coming from some within the government that citizenship is a privilege, not a right. It certainly is a privilege, but it is also a right. I am an Australian citizen by right. It was my right under law, being born in Australia of Australian citizen parents. There are millions of Australians who are citizens as of right. It is a privilege as well, but it is certainly not something that we should present as not being a right.
There is also a risk here, attached to these tests—particularly given the government’s continuing insistence that the questions not be tabled in the parliament and not be made public—that those who have to do this test to become citizens, to then under law obtain the right to citizenship with all of the privileges and responsibilities that attach to it, may be required to have a greater understanding of Australia than another group of citizens. I think that is an inequality that we should seek to avoid as much as is possible.
The simple aim of this amendment is to ensure that, in effect, we test the test to make sure that the vast majority of Australian-born Australian citizens will be able to pass it. This is of course a matter of continuing commentary, some of it fairly light-hearted, as to how well or otherwise many so-called average Australians would go in passing some of the questions on the test. Frankly, I think that is one of the reasons why the government wants to insist on the questions remaining secret. There is a suggestion that the questions have to remain secret because otherwise people would be able to cram for the test.
If you are going to get a random sampling of 20 questions out of a total pool of 200 questions and you manage to learn them all by rote sufficiently that you can pass the test, then, frankly, isn’t that the point—that we want people to understand all these things? If the way that some people understand it is by rote learning hundreds of questions then good luck to them. As has already been indicated, the questions will be derived from a booklet—similar, I presume, to the draft booklet Becoming an Australian citizen, which has already been released. Frankly, I think the difference between people cramming, if you like, for their test by reading a booklet as opposed to reading hundreds of questions is an artificial distinction. It really does not help to allay some of the apprehensions amongst some of the migrant communities around Australia that there is some other agenda here when there is a continuing insistence on the questions not being made public and not being tabled.
I again make the point that the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs itself did recommend that the proposed citizenship test questions be tabled in parliament. That was recommendation 2 of the entire Senate committee. To ignore that is not a helpful move by the government and suggests to me that, firstly, it is poorly thought-through policy and, secondly, it is basically a political stunt. It might be a harmless political stunt, but I for one and the Democrats believe that Australian citizenship is too important to be reduced to a matter for political stunts.
It is also important to not just test the test on Australians but enable Australians to test the adequacy of the questions. We all know in this place just how contentious the simple question is about who Australia’s head of state is or who the head of the Australian government is. That is a sample question that the government has put forward as a possible question in the draft booklet. That simple question—’Who is the head of the Australian government?’—is open to interpretation. Others, like whether or not Australian citizens are required to enrol on the electoral register, have qualifications and exemptions—such as whether it applies to Australian citizens residing overseas—that are not specifically detailed in the question. Those sorts of things do not indicate a problem with our laws; they simply indicate the fact that the obligations, responsibilities, opportunities and all of the other things that are attached to citizenship are not as simplistic and narrow as they are portrayed by the government in putting forward this debate.
Even some of the ideas and ideals that are put forward in the government’s draft booklet, including those about Australian values, beg the question of how serious we are about putting forward these things and seek to prescribe what Australian values are in an officially government ordained book, which is then used as the basis for government ordained questions at the whim of the minister of the day, including in any future government. Quite frankly, this government and this parliament have, from time to time, passed laws that have seriously breached some of the things that are detailed here as important values in modern Australia.
It is always up to the parliament to pass whatever laws it likes, particularly in a country like ours where we do not have basic rights and freedoms entrenched in the Constitution. So the sorts of things detailed in the booklet are things that, in many cases, can be breached at any stage by virtue of this parliament passing a law to make it happen. To some extent that is a wider debate, but to some extent it is not because we are talking about something as fundamental as Australian citizenship. We are putting forward to prospective new citizens the suggestion that these values, these freedoms and these particular characteristics of Australia are so fundamental and so intrinsic that you need to get the right answer in a test to become a citizen. They send a message that these values are locked in stone—that they are intrinsic values that we do not waver from as a nation and that if you become an Australian citizen you have a right to expect them to be attached to that citizenship.
The simple fact is that in many cases that is not so. In many cases those freedoms, values and rights are able to be removed simply by this parliament passing a law making it happen, and we do that all the time. That is a wider debate and I will not go into a bill of rights except to say that it reinforces just how misleading so many of the messages underlying this debate are. We are passing on those misleading messages to the entire Australian community and to new Australians. To me, it shows how muddle-headed and puerilely politicised this process is.
One way of reducing the potential for puerile politicisation is to ensure that the test is able to be tested, as this amendment seeks to do. I believe it would be very much in this parliament’s interest and would maintain some degree of integrity in the central importance of citizenship to accept this amendment so as to reduce the potential for any future government to more seriously pervert the test down the track and enable it to be used more explicitly as an exclusionary device, because that potential is undoubtedly there. We know, and many migrants know—but many Australian-born Australians do not know—about Australia’s history of using our migration laws in discriminatory ways to specifically exclude people. I am not accusing this government, at this stage, of specifically putting forward this citizenship test to that end, but I am saying that the potential is there for it to be used to that end in the future, particularly given how grievous and unjust the discriminatory abuses have been in the past and, I would argue, how damaging they have been to Australia’s reputation internationally as well as to our own awareness about social cohesion and integration. We need to make absolutely crystal clear that any such tests are not able to be used in that way in the future. This would be one way. It is not a pure, total safeguard but it would be one safeguard that would minimise the chances of that happening.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT (CITIZENSHIP TESTING) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2007-09-10,—That was a long contribution for a short issue. It did not have to go on for so long—but I say that in a good-natured way. Labor supports the amendment. It is important to ensure that any test is fair and appropriate for people taking full membership of Australian society and that it is understood by all Australians. This is one way of ensuring that. It seems practical and sensible that you would trial something and then ensure that it works effectively. You would expect the government to ensure that the test is appropriate and designed well. It would be sensible for the government to pick it up and express a view that of course they will be doing this type of work to ensure that any test is appropriately adapted to the circumstances.,SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT (CITIZENSHIP TESTING) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2007-09-10,"—The government opposes this amendment. It does so on the basis that we will have testing experts engaged to develop the questions and they will ensure that those questions go through a proper validation and development process. I believe it is not appropriate to have wider testing or sampling of focus groups where you have the Australian Electoral Commission involved. In any event, testing Australian-born people might not be appropriate because the cohort that you are looking at testing, by very necessity, was not born in Australia. They are just some of the aspects of it. Again, we will be monitoring this on an ongoing basis and, in a very formal way, having a review in three years time. All of that will be under public purview, and I believe that this amendment is not necessary for those reasons.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT (CITIZENSHIP TESTING) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-09-10,"—At the risk of being chided by Senator Ludwig again for talking too long, I shall make a brief contribution. As I tried to make clear in my comments, I am not accusing this government of, from the outset, proposing to misuse the test in that way, but assurances from the minister now about what the government are going to do and how they are going to operate with regard to developing this test are not sufficient. We are passing a law; it will stay as part of the law well into the future. I would not be surprised if, at various stages in the past when amendments were made to migration laws and other laws relating to the entry of people into Australia and when various tests were put forward, commitments were given that they would not operate in particular ways. It is very common in this place, and it was very common in the past, for concerns to be raised that something might be misused, or used in a negative way, and for the commitment to be given that it would not be. Of course, we cannot tie any future government or any future minister to those commitments. They are governed simply by what is in the actual law. And we have seen abuses of the law in the past. Some of the provisions in the Migration Act have been used in ways that were not expressed as an intent when they were originally put forward. Certainly the disgracefully unfair abuse of dictation tests and the like in the past to exclude migrants from particular ethnic and religious backgrounds was not expressly detailed in legislation as being the intent of those tests, but the test has given that power to be misused.
The Democrats amendment being considered here would not provide 100 per cent perfect protection against that sort of abuse in the future but it would at least reduce the prospect of that sort of abuse. We should recognise that putting in place the requirement for a test like this without putting protections in the legislation has the clear potential for such a test to be used for discriminatory and politically motivated purposes in the future. I cannot believe that we could be so ignorant of our history—particularly when we are talking about citizenship tests that are supposed to reaffirm our understanding and knowledge of our history, including quite recent history—in which there are many examples of Australian governments applying laws regarding migrants in unjust and very discriminatory ways. We should be putting protections in this legislation to minimise the chance of any future government using this law in short-term, divisive ways. The legislation is meant to be about inclusion, about encouraging integration and about promoting social unity—I do not think it will particularly achieve that, but that is clearly the intent—but we leave open the potential for it to be used for very divisive purposes down the track, as our current laws relating to migrants have been used in the past and, indeed, the very recent past.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT (CITIZENSHIP TESTING) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2007-09-10,"—I want to indicate that the Australian Greens will be supporting these amendments. It is very difficult for senators who are being asked to vote on this citizenship test to determine whether or not we think the system for creating the questions is appropriate because, as Senator Bartlett has pointed out, we do not know what the questions are going to be. Even though there are sample questions at the back of the government’s document, it is hard to know how hard or easy they will be because we do not know what the multiple-choice options will be. The multiple-choice options can make the question easy or, indeed, can make the question hard.
A range of educators have appeared before the Senate committee and they have commented on the make-up of the citizenship test. In particular, those who teach English to people for whom English is a second, third, fourth, fifth or sixth language have indicated that they do not see a multiple-choice mechanism as the best way to determine whether or not people’s English language skills are at the level we may want them to be at. I think this amendment tries to bring to the legislation some system of assessing whether or not the right path has been followed in the determination of the questions.
The Greens have raised concerns about lack of transparency in relation to the questions, in the past and in my additional comments, and we have an amendment which deals with that further down the track. I acknowledge that the reason the government do not want to make the questions public is that they do not want people to rote learn them, but it is very difficult for senators and members of parliament to assess whether or not the process is a fair one when they are not able to get an understanding of the types of questions. I acknowledge that there are 20 questions at the back of the booklet, but you cannot really tell how hard or easy they are going to be without seeing them proposed as answers in a multiple-choice question.
There has been a lot of speculation in the community about the questions for the citizenship test and how difficult they will be. I noticed that in one of the Greek newspapers a number of different ethnic community groups were consulted and came up with 50 ethnic Australian citizenship test questions, which I have to say I found pretty informative. They were questions like: ‘How many Greeks were convicted of piracy and sent to Australia in 1829 on the Norfolk, arriving in Sydney?’ The answer is seven. ‘Which Chinese Australian former kangaroo shooter won fame at Gallipoli as a sniper?’
—Billy Sing.
—That is right: Billy Sing. Here is another one: ‘What was the family name of the Chinese Australian realtor LJ Hooker before he changed his name by deed poll in 1925?’ Anyone? No?
—No.
—Tingyou is the answer to that one. And there is some interesting information there about the Italian Australians on Captain Cook’s ship the Endeavour. This article was in a Greek newspaper but it was done in consultation with editors of Greek, Chinese, Italian, Maltese and Indian newspapers.
Following the publication of the draft document, they made some criticism about the draft booklet. They said, ‘The sample citizenship test questions released by the government this week are retrospective and selective, written largely by John Howard to perpetuate and to sustain a golden era of white Anglo-Saxon pre-eminence in Australia.’ They went on to say that, with one in four Australians born overseas and an even higher ratio from non-English-speaking backgrounds born here, they are critical of the government asking new aspiring migrants to answer questions about the narrow band of life experience of white Anglo-Saxon immigrants when so many in the past have come from Europe, Asia and Africa.
The amendments being put forward are about getting a sense within the community of what an appropriate level is for setting these kinds of questions. As I said, I am not able to say whether they are too hard or too easy, because I have not seen the multiple-choice questions. There is certainly an incredible amount of detail in the draft booklet. Perhaps the minister knows the answer to this, but I did not know how many kilometres of water pipe were laid from Perth to the goldfields. That is in the booklet, but is that level of detail going to be asked about? We do not know because we do not know what the questions are. And we do not know whether, in a multiple-choice question, you would be able to guess between it being one metre versus several thousands of metres. You cannot tell unless you have the multiple-choice answers.
I want to ask the minister about the process for the booklet. It is a draft booklet, and I noticed on the minister’s website that there is the opportunity for giving input. I would appreciate it if the minister could let us know what the process and the time frame are in relation to the finalising of the booklet. During the Senate inquiry, the department indicated to the Senate committee that there was an intended start date of—I think, off the top of my head—17 September for the government to start introducing the test if the legislation passed through the parliament. Could the minister outline if that is still the intended start date, how the process for input into the draft booklet is intended to occur and whether that shifts back the time frame in which the government would like to see the citizenship test start if it is passed through the parliament?",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT (CITIZENSHIP TESTING) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech

"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2007-09-10,"—Thank you, Minister. I am trying to remember the date off the top of my head, but during the Senate inquiry the department put a date forward for when they intended the citizenship test to start. My recollection—and it is just a recollection—was that it was 17 September. I could be wrong about that. As the minister is talking about launching the booklet in the second half of September, does that mean that the intended start date for the introduction of the citizenship test has been pushed back? Will it be in late September or in October? I would also like the minister to explain about the process for input on the draft booklet. On the minister’s website, you can provide input in relation to the draft booklet. What is the process for determining that? Will it be that the input comes in, the minister or the department looks at it and then, when the minister makes his announcement in a very short period of time, there will be a government response to the input? Is there a more formalised mechanism for input or do you just send in your information and see how you go when the announcement is made? That and the start date are the two things I would like the minister to explain.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT (CITIZENSHIP TESTING) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2007-09-10,"—As I said, the announcement will be predicated on the passage of this legislation, so the sooner this is done, the better. I do not want to pre-empt what the Senate may or may not do but Senator Nettle is asking me to give some idea. That is not unreasonable, and on that basis I will presume that this legislation will go through expeditiously. If this legislation is passed expeditiously, I would envisage an announcement on the final book within the next 10 days. The tests would then commence on 1 October, so that would give some time. And, of course, people do not have to make an application on 1 October. If they want to have more time to look at the book they can delay their application. That is how I see it, but I stress—lest I be misrepresented, and I am sure I would not be—that this is based on an expeditious passing of this bill. The answer to the other question is that everything that has come in on the website has been considered by the minister in relation to the formulation of the final draft of the booklet.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT (CITIZENSHIP TESTING) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2007-09-10,"—Minister, I do not want to be hoist with my own petard by adding to the debate, but in answer to Senator Nettle’s question you indicated, and the process seems to be, that should the bill pass—and I have every confidence that it will—then people can provide feedback online. For collating that and providing an outcome, what are the time lines that will allow that to occur before 1 October? In other words, what is in place to ensure that it is taken into account and then answered in a way that allows a dialogue? It seems to be that the date for start-up was originally going to be 17 September. Could the minister indicate whether that has now been vacated for 1 October?",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT (CITIZENSHIP TESTING) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2007-09-10,"—As I indicated previously, the feedback is being received on an ongoing basis. We want that to continue, by the way, so what I am about to say should not in any way deter anybody from offering feedback. In that regard, the government seeks the cooperation of all concerned that this continues. But for the purposes of efficiently putting in place a new booklet and giving people time for testing on 1 October and thereafter, everything up until this point today that has been received will be put into the mix and considered. As I have indicated, I envisage the minister making a decision within the next 10 days or so as to the final booklet, and the testing will start on 1 October. However, we still ask that feedback continue to come via the minister’s website. Certainly, the government would not want these remarks to deter anybody or to make them say, ‘Oh well, there was a cut-off point and you cannot put anything in after that date.’ That is certainly not the case. We are monitoring this in an ongoing way, and continuing feedback is not only warmly welcomed but, we believe, essential. For the purposes of drawing a line from where we can start working on a final booklet, anything received up until today will be put into the mix for that final draft. The minister will launch that within the next 10 days or so and the testing can commence on 1 October.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT (CITIZENSHIP TESTING) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech

If the line is going to be drawn in the sand today, is the department or the minister going to provide a response to those issues that have been raised? And how are those matters going to be taken into account? The normal process for these sorts of things is that people provide feedback that the department might then summarise and then reject or accept or in principle support—there are a range of possible responses—so that people can understand what the process has been. You can encourage continued feedback by indicating that, for the purposes of the launch, this is a final position, but you might then indicate whether you intend to refine it if further feedback is received. Otherwise, there does not seem to be any point in encouraging feedback after today.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT (CITIZENSHIP TESTING) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-09-10,"—I will not proceed with Democrat amendment (4), because it really links back to my amendments (1) and (2). We have basically had that debate and I do not see much point in revisiting it. So I will not proceed with that amendment. I move Democrat amendment (5) on sheet 5326 revised:
(5)    Schedule 1, item 5, page 5 (lines 15 to 17), omit subsection 23A(7), substitute:
Determination is a legislative instrument
         (7)    A determination made under subsection (1) is a legislative instrument and where the determination relates to a test, a question or questions within the test, or a component of the test, are subject to disallowance in accordance with the Legislative Instruments Act 2003.
This is the final Democrat amendment and it is fairly similar to one circulated by the Greens, although it is slightly different. It seeks to ensure that any determination made under subsection (1) of the act that relates to a test, a question or questions within the test, or a component of the test, is subject to disallowance.
The minister pre-empted this amendment earlier by giving some reasons why it was not desirable and why the government would not be supporting it. It was nice of him to do so without hearing my coherent arguments in favour of it. You never know; you might be persuaded! The suggestion that it would create uncertainty is not, frankly, a good enough reason. At the heart of the citizenship test, obviously, is the issue of whether it is going to have credibility. That is the question. If it turns out to be a bunch of ridiculous, jingoistic, offensive, misleading or ideologically biased questions then you will distort the credibility of the citizenship test and therefore distort the credibility of citizenship. Again, I am not accusing the government of planning to do that. I would be very surprised if they did, quite frankly, but this is another mechanism to provide that protection, that safeguard, that I believe is needed, particularly given Australia’s history of misusing our laws in discriminatory and unjust ways to target and exclude people from particular ethnic or religious backgrounds.
I emphasise to the Senate that I am not making a political point in saying this; I am very much making a plea about the social consequences of the laws we pass. This debate is not, at its core, about some pre-election positioning or some potential political opportunities or political points to be scored, from all sides. This debate is about whether we pass a law and, if so, what is in that law. We should always remind ourselves that the laws we pass have impacts on human beings, in the Australian community and more widely. Therefore, it is totally appropriate for us to consider the potential, and in some cases the current, impacts of proposed laws.
A current impact of this proposed law is that there is a group within the community—a minority, I fully recognise, but nonetheless a group—who are apprehensive about the intent behind this test and the potential it could be misused for political purposes. One of the reasons they are apprehensive is the history that they all know, and we should certainly know, of laws with regard to migrants being misused in a discriminatory and unjust way, targeting people because of their ethnic, religious or racial backgrounds. We all know—and if we do not we certainly should—that one of the groups in the community at the moment who do feel targeted by some of the rhetoric and policies and by the application of some of the existing laws—not just migration laws—is the Muslim community.
I was at a forum just yesterday, as was Senator Ludwig, who gave a very cogent contribution and earned himself a few Mars bars along the way by giving good answers to some questions—the Mars bars were a reward from the audience for giving full and complete answers, to clarify. There is very clearly concern out there. It does not all go just to the citizenship test. It is much wider than that. The Dr Haneef issue is at the heart of it. But that is a symptom; it is not the cause—the Haneef issue is not the cause. The fear and the apprehension in the community is a symptom of a much wider perception that there is a deliberate targeting of Muslim Australians for partisan political purposes and we must ensure that we do not pass a new law that feeds apprehension and creates that division.

Didn’t he also go on to say that ‘an aspirational target is not a real target at all’?

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2007-09-10,"—I think all Australians would be very pleased with the outcome of the APEC forum that we were very honoured and pleased to host in this country over the past week. One of the great strengths that has been able to be displayed as a result of the APEC forum has been the high regard in which Australia is held, right around the world. One of the great achievements of APEC has been to get countries such as the United States and Russia together—and China, might I add—to talk about the important challenge that we face as a world in relation to climate change.
To be able to get developing countries such as Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia and China as well as the US and Russia agreeing on the need for a long-term aspirational global emissions reduction goal is a truly great, ground-breaking consensus. The important thing in relation to these aspirational goals is that we do not of our own volition set up an aspirational goal which is not in the context of the international situation. That is in fact something that the Prime Minister’s task force addressed in relation to the approach that we should take to the issue of climate change.
The Howard government has been very responsible and sensible in its approach to climate change. As the vast majority of workers in this country know, if Australia were to go it alone, all that would happen would be the wholesale export of wealth and jobs to other countries in our region, to the detriment of our own wealth and to the detriment of the working men and women of Australia. That is why, in the context of APEC, the government sought to get together as many of the differing approaches as you can get: the United States—well and truly developed; China—going gang busters; and other countries as well, such as Russia, that have come from a difficult background. So we believe that APEC has served a very useful purpose in getting the world communities together so that we can face this challenge together, because trying to do it alone will not achieve any purpose and, more importantly, it would be to Australia’s great detriment.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Climate Change</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,answer
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2007-09-10,"—If the key charge is that which the Leader of the Opposition has put, I say it is a struggling opposition. We, as a government, have been dealing with the issue of climate change since we first got into government. I have reminded those opposite time and time again that we established the Australian Greenhouse Office in 1998, within two years of coming into office. What is more, it was the first of its kind within the world. So do not say that we have come to this issue lately. We have been addressing this issue in a good, sensible approach which has the recognition of, indeed, the IPCC itself. The IPCC itself has commended the Howard government’s approach. In relation to symbolic matters, I simply say the Labor Party would still sign on to Kyoto, knowing full well it would make no difference to the real challenges that we face. (Time expired)

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2007-09-10,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today.
I particularly want to focus on the non-answers provided by Senator Abetz in relation to two issues, which demonstrate yet again how the Howard government’s extreme workplace laws have been bad for working Australians and their families. The first issue which this government is extraordinarily embarrassed about is the enormous backlog in the processing of agreements under their so-called fairness test. From the government’s own figures, we see that over 100,000 Australian workplace agreements are waiting to be approved under the government’s new system. This is a complete bureaucratic bungle. This is a red-tape nightmare for working Australian families and also for employers who are party to those agreements.
There is a backlog of over 100,000 Australian workplace agreements awaiting approval. Guess how many, under the new system, the Howard government have managed to actually process since their much trumpeted and much advertised new industrial relations laws—the result of what Mr Textor told Mr Howard to do. They have managed to process just over 6,000. There is a backlog of over 100,000 and just over 6,000 have actually passed, and 42,000 agreements require more information to be provided. This demonstrates many things. The first thing it demonstrates is that when the government pushed through its extreme industrial relations laws, it did not have a plan other than to get through to the next election. We all know, everyone in this chamber knows—and if those on the other side were honest they would get up and acknowledge this—that the government’s so-called fairness test was nothing more than a fig leaf to get them through to the next election. Australian working families know that these Howard government laws are bad for working people. They are bad for their wages and conditions and for their job security. They know that. The government passed a set of laws that were nothing more than a fig leaf to get them through to the next election because their polling information was telling them that Australians knew what was happening. They knew that these laws were about stripping away hard-won entitlements such as penalty rates, overtime, shift allowances and so forth. The government have got a complete bureaucratic bungle here, with over 100,000 agreements just sitting there waiting to be processed, with 30,000 a month coming in. Even if this government were re-elected, how many months would it be before this backlog was processed?
I ask the Senate to consider one thing—and the minister refused to engage with this issue when asked the question: how many of those 100,000 agreements are in fact so unfair that they fail the fairness test? As a result of your bureaucratic bungle, how many Australian workers are working under agreements which would not pass your so-called fairness test and will continue to have to work under inferior wages and conditions and under agreements which strip away penalty rates, overtime and shift allowances? How many Australians are covered by those 100,000 agreements? How many Australians will be working under agreements which are actually unlawful? The fact is you do not know. You cannot give an answer. All you can say is, ‘We’ve managed to process just over 6,000, but we do have 100,000 outstanding.’ There may be 100,000 working Australians involved here, some of whom will be covered by an agreement which is so unfair it would fail the fairness test, but they will have no recourse for months under this government. They will continue to have to take home lower wages and experience inferior conditions because of your unfair laws and because the one change you put in place prior to the election has not been able to be implemented.
Finally, in relation to the revelations in the papers today about the way in which the government’s laws make it easier to sack people, yet again what we see from Senator Abetz is not a denial that these laws make it easier to sack people—he did not even deny it; we see him shooting the messenger, shooting the academic. We see the same thing over and over again from Senator Abetz in this place. He is not prepared to engage with the argument. All we get is a personal, smear attack. That is all he does. He attacks the individual. Come in here, Senator Abetz, during question time and answer the question, and explain to the Australian people why your laws make it easier for large employers to sack people. If you do not believe that that is the case, explain why it is not. What we saw again today is ducking and weaving, and another political attack on various individuals, but not dealing with the key issue. (Time expired)

"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2007-09-10,"—We can see that Senator Wong is engaging in the politics of scaremongering. She has admitted that we do not know whether the number of agreements that she is talking about is fair or not. That is scaremongering. To make a statement and then admit that you do not know what the answer is is absolute scaremongering. The fact is that our workplace relations laws have been in place for less than two years. Yet more than 100,000 agreements are being reviewed and more than 1,000 new agreements are being lodged every day with the Workplace Authority, which is the independent umpire ensuring that the conditions of working Australians are being protected. It is this independent umpire that the Labor Party would scrap if it ever gets into government.
We do not apologise for a small delay in processing agreements, because we want to make sure that people are paid properly. That is our top priority. To speed up the process, we want to encourage employers to pay the right money to begin with. The Workplace Authority has a pre-lodgement system for agreements to fast-track the process. Of the 12,749 agreements which have been fully assessed, only 1,070 did not initially pass. Under the proper procedure, the Workplace Authority has written to the employer and employee, requesting changes be made to the agreement—within 14 days—so that it passes the fairness test. This is our system and it works well. If the employer does not make the changes, the agreement ceases to operate and the employer will need to back pay. If they fail to do that, they will be referred to the Workplace Ombudsman.
This system works very well. A great deal of thought went into putting it into place initially, and our reforms of the workplace shift right away from the Labor Party system where the rights of employers and employees were controlled and could only be changed by industrial tribunals and unions. Our system, workplace relations, fits very well with the idea that individual employers and individual employees can come to an agreement about the working arrangements that suit their own personal circumstances, rather than being forced to work under the old, one-size-fits-all system.
I always used to think of the system before I came into parliament as having the needle pointing totally in favour of unions. All I ever wanted to see was the needle shift to neutral on a gauge, you might say, so that employees and employers had equal rights and, under a fair and balanced system, they could be worked out. The difference between Labor’s approach to industrial relations and the approach taken by the coalition is that the coalition recognise that all of the regulation in the world cannot create jobs. We recognise that providing an economic framework that creates more jobs and better-paid jobs is the system that we want to have.
What we have done has determined whether the jobs growth and the increase in wages over the last decade will continue. We have seen the unemployment rate in Australia fall to an over-30-year low of 4.3 per cent and we have seen growth by 417,900 jobs since March 2006. I need hardly remind the Senate that, under the old industrial relations system presided over by Labor, the unemployment rate peaked in 1992 at 10.9 per cent and almost one million Australians were without a job. We have moved to a single national workplace relations system.
Julia Gillard is on record in the Adelaide Advertiser of 17 February this year as saying that the current workplace system hinders industrial action with all sorts of legal red tape. The fact is that the previous industrial relations system worked under 4,000 separate awards—4,000. And, given the chance, Labor will fall into line with the demands of their union mates—(Time expired)

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2007-09-10,"—The sad part about the industrial relations debate is the untruths being spread by the government side. I can say that in all honesty, Mr Deputy President, because, like you, I did represent workers before coming into this place. And, like you, Mr Deputy President, I have seen myriad unfair, unbalanced Australian workplace agreements. History will judge the Howard legacy, and no doubt the Howard legacy will have a large contingent of bitterness about industrial relations. This government won the last election; there is no doubt about that. Mr Howard had absolutely no mandate to tip the Australian industrial relations system on its head. But that is what Mr Howard did, with help from honourable senators opposite, back in, I think, November 2005, when the government guillotined debate on the Work Choices legislation and rammed it through this place.
I have the privilege of travelling around the great state of Western Australia, speaking to a lot of people from all walks of life—people who are employed under Australian workplace agreements and people who have children employed under Australian workplace agreements. There are two levels of Australian workplace agreements. Prime Minister Howard, Mr Hockey and the rest of the government love to flag workplace agreements in the highly paid mining and resources industry. They do not like to talk about those disgraceful Australian workplace agreements found in the retail, hospitality, transport and construction industries. The government never wheel those out, because they are so disgraceful that they are embarrassed. But that is what Mr Howard’s legacy will be. Honourable senators opposite, you are all guilty—you all supported the legislation. You could not wait to ram it through. You will live with this legislation, and you will live with the effects that this legislation will have on the next generation of workers.
Yes, we are in a mining boom. In my state of WA, more than in any other state, we really are witnessing the mining boom. I have the privilege of going through all of those north-western communities, none more so than Karratha. You can make two visits in Karratha and on the Dampier Peninsula. You can go out to Woodside or you can go out to the Burrup and look around. I know the Burrup very well because I was driving trucks and helping to create that LNG gas plant back in the eighties. I also know of the ballooning of the population in Karratha.

Senator McGauran interjecting—

—I would like to take the interjection from Senator McGauran, who would not know a worker if they walked up and headbutted him. He would not know a worker. When you are in Collins Street in Melbourne, stuck up on whatever floor you are on, Senator McGauran—through you, Mr Deputy President—do yourself a favour and get out there. Start talking to people who are employed under Australian workplace agreements who are not in the mining industry. Have a chat. Talk to those young kids in the retail industry.
—Senator Sterle, address your comments to the chair.
—I will go through the chair, Mr Deputy President. As I said, through you, Mr Deputy President, Senator McGauran should get out and talk to young people who are employed in the hospitality industry, the retail industry and in some of the transport and construction industries. Do you know what will come and bite this government in the backside, Mr Deputy President? It is the question: how dare you go out there and look the next generation of Australians in the eye and tell them that this is the best thing for them? Mr Howard and this government have chucked decency and fairness out the back door; let us not make any mistake about that.
Labor has a plan. It is not for the next six or seven weeks of the election period, like that of Mr Howard. Labor has a plan for the next 10 years. Labor will install decency and fairness back into the Australian industrial relations system—decency that will create well-paying jobs for the next generation of Australians, not the drive for the bottom and the lowest common denominator. Mr Deputy President, I am sure that in your great state of Queensland it is fantastic to have this mining boom. But what will happen when this boom subsides? What will happen when it slows down? We can go back to the days when employment was running a little bit higher than what it is. The government have overseen the greatest skills gap in history. They have sat on their hands for the last 11 years. They have done nothing about the skills dilemma that we face in this country. The voters of Australia will have the opportunity to decide. Do they want decency and fairness? Do they want balance in the workplace? Do they want the best for their children and their grandchildren? We will know very soon, as the voters of Australia will have the opportunity to say which way they want to take Australia’s industrial landscape into the future. Decency and fairness is something that has built this country over the past 106 years of Federation—(Time expired)

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2007-09-10,"—We have seen yet again today another desperate attempt by Senator Wong, Senator Sterle and others to reignite the scare campaign that Labor have been waging over a number of years now—the scare campaign that they hope will propel them into government, but the scare campaign that Australians should not be fooled by. Towards the end of his remarks in this debate, Senator Sterle spoke of balance. This government has been working hard to get the question of balance right. It is a question of getting the balance right between protecting people in employment and providing jobs, and the economic environment necessary to provide those jobs. No amount of regulation—no amount in the world—creates jobs. The right economic environment is what creates jobs. That is what this government has been focusing on, in tandem with ensuring that we have enough protection for workers.
The results clearly speak for themselves, with more than two million jobs created under this government and employment at a record 10½ million Australians enjoying jobs today. They are the figures that matter. They are the results that have been delivered—more than 400,000 jobs since Work Choices was introduced. Despite all the scaremongering we hear from the other side of this chamber, some 84 per cent, 350,000, of the new jobs that have been created since Work Choices was introduced have been full-time jobs. So we are not seeing the plethora of new part-time opportunities or the casualisation of the workforce that those on the other side of the chamber claimed would occur. Instead, we have seen sustained, strong growth in full-time employment opportunities, which is certainly the most important thing we can do to provide a sound foundation and a sound footing for Australians, going into the future.
My colleague Senator Troeth outlined that the spurious claims being made by the opposition about the new fairness test are unfounded. We have introduced the fairness test in our quest to get the balance right—the balance that I spoke of earlier, between protecting workers rights and having the right economic framework. We have a system which is ensuring that all the AWAs are checked by the new authority and that they are detailed. The overwhelming majority of those that have been checked have been accepted.
The system we have introduced has created jobs and certainty. Contrast it with the system that Labor seeks to take us back to. That is a system that would reintroduce unfair dismissal laws and abolish the flexibility that this government delivered into the workplace. We risk those changes. There would be a reintroduction of unfair dismissal laws at the cost of some billions of dollars to the Australian economy.
Senator Sterle spoke of mandates. The other side of the chamber, time and again, voted against the abolition of unfair dismissal laws, no matter how many times this government—
—Forty-two times!
—Forty-two times, I am told, they voted against changing the unfair dismissal laws, no matter how many times this side took that issue to the people. We know that the Labor Party will strip those laws back. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, whom they keep in hiding—Julia Gillard—has described the laws as fundamentally bad policy, short-sighted and ridiculous. These laws cost an estimated $1.3 billion a year for Australian small business and kept a cap on job creation. Since they have been lifted we have seen growth go through the roof, with some 400,000 jobs being created in that period of time. Instead, Labor and their union mates want to abolish that and take us back to the past.
Senator Sterle spoke about a plan for the future. In fact, Labor’s plan is one for the past. It is a plan to take us back to laws that gave us high unemployment, higher industrial disputation and lower growth in real wages. That is the world they want to take us back to—all to keep their union mates, who have tipped more than $50 million into the ALP’s war chest over the last decades, happy and to deliver for them the power that they so need.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2007-09-10,"—I think it is interesting that we are here today discussing the government’s workplace relations policy, Work Choices, because I understand that at this very moment there is a discussion going on within the government ranks about whether the Prime Minister is going to keep his job or whether he will be removed for ‘operational reasons’. Will he be fairly or unfairly dismissed? I do not think it matters. I think that on the other side of the chamber they are trying to figure out how they can get rid of the Prime Minister, because he has become a substantial liability to them. He has become a liability because it is his ideological obsession with deregulating Australia’s system of fairness and wage justice that has brought the government to the situation they find themselves in today. It is a situation where the Australian public are making it very clear they have had enough of Work Choices and enough of AWAs, and they want to see a return to fairness and justice in the Australian industrial relations system.
We should remember that it was Mr Howard who, back in 1996, said that he wanted Australians to feel ‘relaxed and comfortable’. I have never forgotten that. I can tell you that a lot of Australians today do not feel relaxed and comfortable. Senator Ursula Stephens, during question time today, pointed out that every week record numbers of people in New South Wales are losing their homes because they cannot meet their mortgage payments. The government waxes on about the low interest rates. The fact of the matter is that today a much greater percentage of household income is spent on mortgages than ever before. That is why people have been losing their homes—as interest rates have gone up on five consecutive occasions.
Mr Howard also told us that no Australians would be worse off under his government. Well, after 10 years many, many Australian families are worse off. A lot of Australians are worse off, particularly those that have been forced onto Australian workplace agreements as a result of this government’s policies. But Mr Howard tells us that Australians have never been better off. What an absolute load of rot that is.
I recall over the past 10 or 11 years of this government the various debates that went on in this parliament as the government sought to whittle away and to undermine our system of industrial relations fairness and wage justice. They presided over an ever-increasing gulf between, on the one hand, a reduction in the protections for ordinary workers who relied upon industrial awards and the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and, on the other hand, executive salaries, which have skyrocketed. You now pick up a copy of the Financial Review any day and see the levels of bonus payments, levels of directors’ fees and salaries that are paid to senior executives, and there is absolutely no cap or control on them. The government have used the corporations power to extend their reach into industrial relations, but they have only used it for the weakest—the people who have the least bargaining power when it comes to their employment. They have not once considered the use of the corporations power to try and rein in the growth of executive salaries in this country.
When the government gained absolute control of the Senate after the last election, it proceeded apace to basically rip up the entire system of industrial protection in this country to give effect to the Prime Minister’s long-held ideological obsession. Suddenly the definition of a small business went from 20 or 25 employees, as we all understood it was, to 100, so that any person employed in a business of fewer than 100 employees lost their rights to pursue an unfair dismissal claim. We just heard from Senator Birmingham about how many times we voted against the government’s changes. I am proud of the 42 times I voted against them, because what you were voting for, what you were putting through as legislation, was taking away the fundamental right of a worker to sue—to take action legally—if they believe they have been unfairly dismissed.
—Not true!
—That is exactly true. Of course, we now have the situation where many, many standard conditions of employment are no longer included in awards. (Time expired)

That:
the following bill be introduced: A Bill for an Act to amend the Northern Territory National Emergency Response Act 2007, and for related purposes [Northern Territory National Emergency Response Amendment (Alcohol) Bill 2007]; and
the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (8) of standing order 111 not apply to the bill allowing it to be considered during this period of sittings.
I table a statement of reasons justifying the need for this bill to be considered during this period of sittings and seek leave to have the statement incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—

Purpose of the Bill

The bill makes amendments to consolidate the alcohol measures in the Northern Territory National Emergency Response Act 2007.  For example, the 1,350 ml trigger for seeking and recording identification details in relation to takeaway alcohol sales will be clarified, certain exceptions made to the alcohol offences in relation to visitors to parks, and provision made for the alcohol measures to be determined not to apply in a particular area if warranted, for example, by strong local alcohol management measures.

Reasons for Urgency

The existing alcohol measures take effect on Saturday, 15 September 2007.  If these amendments do not pass and take effect before that date, stakeholders potentially face dealing with two differing regimes in a short period of time.  This would create confusion, particularly at the point of sale, and potentially undermine public support for the new measures.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-09-10,"—I move:
That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:
The need for the Australian Government to support the adoption of the proposed United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples when it is put to the vote in the current session of the United Nations General Assembly.
The Democrats have brought on this matter of urgency today because we believe it is an urgent matter. The United Nations General Assembly is sitting at present and it will be considering the issue of the adoption of a declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples within the next week. It is doubly appropriate because of course we have the Prime Minister of Canada in Australia at the moment. He will be addressing an unofficial session of the Australian parliament tomorrow. Canada and Australia are two governments that have been less than supportive—in fact, they have been amongst the least supportive publicly—of adopting the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.
It needs to be stated up-front that this declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples would not be binding. It is nonetheless an internationally agreed mechanism for recognising the rights of indigenous peoples and it sets benchmarks which all countries should seek to meet in ensuring that their indigenous peoples’ rights are acknowledged, respected, enforced and implemented.
The Howard government has of course on a number of occasions been quite hostile to the United Nations and to various international treaties and conventions. It has sought to belittle them a number of times. But it is particularly relevant, I think, to note that in recent times there have been fervent references to international conventions and laws by the Howard government to justify and reinforce their actions—including, the intervention in the Northern Territory with regard to Aboriginal people. The Convention on the Rights of the Child in particular was referred to regularly by government speakers and by the minister as part of the reason why the government had to act—to ensure that the rights under the Convention on the Rights of the Child were properly respected and implemented. Certainly that is a convention that the Democrats support, and indeed we would like to see it actually reflected properly in Australian law.
We have even seen the government make fervent pleas referring to the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to justify and reinforce its legislation and action to enable plebiscites on the amalgamations of local government in Queensland. So we are seeing in recent times what I think is a welcome number of statements by coalition government ministers referring to international conventions and international law which Australia has adopted as valuable benchmarks to justify actions here in Australia.
It is, I believe, a key moment for Australia and, indeed, for the global community to be adopting internationally agreed declarations setting out basic fundamental rights for indigenous peoples around the world and particularly ours in Australia. It is not engaging in self-flagellation or hairshirt politics or black armband politics, or any other pejorative phrases, to make the simple clear statement that Australia as a nation has failed its Indigenous peoples terribly over centuries. This has been done often unintentionally, often inadvertently, often unknowingly, but it is still a fact that we have done it. That is our legacy, that is our record, across the political spectrum, across all levels of government, across the decades. This covenant provides an opportunity for the Australian government to say, in conjunction with the global community, ‘We recognise these as fundamental rights for indigenous peoples and we will seek to commit to them.’
One of the areas that is often pointed to, and has in the past been pointed to by people speaking on behalf of the Australian government, as a problem in the declaration is the right of self-determination. So it is worth emphasising that, according to the very latest version that I understand is to be put to the United Nations General Assembly, article 46, part 1, specifically says:
Nothing in this Declaration may be interpreted as implying for any State, people, group or person any right to engage in any activity or to perform any act contrary to the Charter of the United Nations or construed as authorizing or encouraging any action which would dismember or impair, totally or in part, the territorial integrity or political unity of sovereign and independent States ...
So any suggestion that self-determination and the right to self-determination somehow threaten the territorial integrity of Australia or the political unity of Australia is a furphy. This declaration also has a recognition in article 3:
Indigenous peoples have the right of self-determination. By virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development.
That is simply a repeat of part 1 of article 1 of the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which Australia has long ratified, stating that all peoples, including of course indigenous peoples, have the right of self-determination.
It is important in the current debate—not debating the specifics of the policies whether in the Northern Territory or anywhere else—to take note of some of the overarching attitudes that have been expressed and the directions and comments that have been made by government leaders. These are attitudes that have been interpreted by many indigenous communities as supporting assimilation as the only way forward, as supporting paternalism as an adequate attitude. There have been government members in this Senate who have said that. I believe that it is clearly counter to the human rights of anybody to have governments adopting paternalism and assimilation, but this applies particularly to the rights of indigenous peoples. A crucial part of these declarations is recognising that indigenous peoples have the right to maintain and strengthen their distinct political, legal, economic, social and cultural institutions, whilst retaining their rights to participate fully in the political, economic, social and cultural life of the state, of the nation, they are a part of. It is possible to do that. It is not only possible but desirable, not just for indigenous peoples but for the future of our state. The Democrats believe that adopting this declaration is a matter of urgency. We urge the Australian government to vote in support of it in the UN General Assembly within the next week, and we also urge the Canadian Prime Minister, who is a guest in our country at the moment, to consider doing the same on behalf of his nation.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2007-09-10,"—I rise to participate in this debate this afternoon on the United Nations Draft Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. I start where Senator Bartlett ended, with the observation that, in the view of the Australian Democrats at least, this is a matter of some urgency. I do not think there is substantial demur about the importance of the declaration itself. In fact, its lengthy and considered development would indicate that, but I really do not think that the importance of considering it in a rushed manner when there are still matters to be resolved, certainly as far as our government and a number of other governments are concerned, is outweighed by the urgency that Senator Bartlett has in his view identified. It was interesting that in his early remarks he indicated that Australia—Canada can speak for itself—is one of the least supportive governments publicly. I find that somewhat ironic given that, in the development of the declaration itself, which has been in play now for over a decade, Australia has been intimately and constructively involved in that process. In many ways, the amount of time that has been spent and the engagement of senior officials which has been undertaken are an acknowledgement and an indication of the fact that we do regard this as an important piece of work by the United Nations.
Senator Bartlett made a number of specific references, including one to the right of self-determination, which I will come to in a moment. We support a meaningful declaration which will hopefully be achieved by a consensus of the states setting what would be regarded as a new standard of achievement with the potential to make some real difference in the circumstances of indigenous peoples across the world. We believe that indigenous peoples deserve and need a declaration which can be implemented meaningfully, not one which is rushed for the sake of signing on a particular dotted line.
As I said before, we have been involved in this process for over 10 years. We approached the consultations that were held in New York recently in a constructive, engaged and flexible manner. We put on record in New York the fact that our concerns could be met through very limited changes to the Chair’s text. We made a concerted effort to reduce our key concerns to the minimum number of possible changes so that we were not seeking a complete rewrite of the entire declaration, which would obviously be an extraordinary process. We are not trying to have the entire text renegotiated.
As I understand it, when a moderator, His Excellency Hilario Davide of the Philippines, was appointed to convene the recent consultations on the Declaration in New York, he recommended to the President of the UN General Assembly that a limited portion of the text that was adopted by the vote in the Human Rights Council in June last year be reopened. We thought that was a sound recommendation. We thought it would have honoured the spirit of the GA resolution of November 2006 which in fact deferred consideration of the declaration pending further consultations. We welcomed the GA decision to defer adoption of the declaration text to allow for further consultations.
I note Senator Bartlett’s observations about Australia’s attitude and approach to the UN, but we have always said that it is our strong preference that human rights instruments in particular be adopted by consensus to ensure the broadest possible support. This text was lacking in consensus. It was hastily put to the Human Rights Council for adoption and it was done without full and final consultations. In fact, as I understand it from the statement issued by Australia, New Zealand and the United States during the Human Rights Council in June 2006 by Her Excellency Caroline Millar, our ambassador and permanent representative to the UN in Geneva, the text was issued over the internet with no opportunity for states to discuss it collectively, which does not seem to me like the most constructive process in the world.
We have a number of procedural concerns. We are concerned, as I said, that we have not been given the opportunity as states to discuss the text collectively because it was prepared and submitted by the chair of the working group after negotiations had concluded. There was plenary discussion about the declaration in June this year. There has still been no actual collective read-through of the final text and, as Senator Bartlett indicated, it is due to be considered on 13 September in the 61st Session of the GA. We will base the final decision on our voting position on the exact terms of any text which is put to the vote. I note that Senator Bartlett raises some issues about the current drafting of article 46. We really cannot support a text that does not address our key concerns, which have been put on the record, both singly and in company with other nations, on a number of occasions in the General Assembly, the Human Rights Council and the predecessor of the Human Rights Council, the Commission on Human Rights. There has been advanced, in recent times, a so-called African-Mexican compromise text, but we are still concerned about that because we do not think it adequately addresses our key concerns, which include the need for safeguards that will protect the territorial integrity of states and also the rights of third parties.
I will identify the six key concerns we have with the text as it currently stands. Notwithstanding Senator Bartlett’s observations about the drafting of the language in article 46, we still have concerns about the references to self-determination and the potential for misconstruing those. I do not see any particularly significant problem with trying to get clarity around that so that as many people as possible support the declaration. There are other states which have the same concerns.
On the question of land and resources, we are concerned that the provisions on those areas in the text ignore the contemporary realities of many countries which have indigenous populations. They seem, to many readers, to require the recognition of indigenous rights to lands which are now lawfully owned by other citizens, both indigenous and non-indigenous, and therefore to have some quite significant potential to impact on the rights of third parties.
Intellectual property is the third point we would raise. We believe that, as our laws here currently stand, we protect our Indigenous cultural heritage, traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expression to an extent that is consistent with both Australian and international intellectual property law, and we are not prepared to go as far as the provisions in the text of the draft declaration currently do on that matter.
We also have concerns about the inclusion in the text of an unqualified right of free, prior and informed consent for indigenous peoples on matters affecting them, which implies to some readers that they may then be able to exercise a right of veto over all matters of state, which would include national laws and other administrative measures. That would obviously be of concern to any sovereign government.
Further on the question of third-party rights, in seeking to give indigenous people exclusive rights over intellectual, real and cultural property, the draft text does not acknowledge the rights of third parties—in particular, their rights to access indigenous land and heritage and cultural objects where appropriate under national law. That should not be a big stumbling block, but it is a matter which we wish to see addressed. The text in its current form fails to consider the different types of ownership and use that can be accorded to indigenous people and the rights of third parties to property in that regard.
I also want to make a note about matters of customary law. There are concerns about the way the text is currently drafted on the question of customary law and whether that may place indigenous customary law in a superior position to national law. We understand in talking about customary law that it is a law based on culture and tradition and is not one which is expected to override national laws and is certainly not one which should be used selectively by certain indigenous communities where it is possibly convenient to permit the exercise of practices which would not be acceptable across the broad.
They are the six points where we have concerns. We have tried very constructively—and I really do commend the statement by Her Excellency Caroline Millar on behalf of Australia, New Zealand and the United States in the Human Rights Council in June last year. She is intimately acquainted with this process. She has set out very, very clearly, for the council and for those who are interested, where the concerns actually are. It is a very constructive statement and one which I think others would do well to read. In that statement and on behalf of those nations she also made a number of suggestions about alternative procedures which could be taken which seem to have been ignored. (Time expired)

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2007-09-10,"—I too rise to contribute to this debate on the urgency motion this afternoon. I start at the point that we are really looking at a draft declaration which is not binding—which has, as we have heard, aspirational goals. We have heard a lot about aspirational goals in the last few days, particularly in relation to climate change: aspirational goals are now something that is very worthy and that we should all be adopting.
But, on the issue of the draft declaration and what it represents, Labor is concerned that we have come to the position where this draft declaration is going to be voted on, definitely by 17 September but probably as early as Thursday, and that after 24 years of negotiation, clear discussions, a lot of work and goodwill and a lot of extended negotiations and deliberations by a range of people, we now have the situation where Senator Payne would suggest there is no urgency around this issue, but in fact the situation for indigenous peoples around the world is getting more and more dramatically desperate by the day.
We only have to look at the situation of indigenous peoples in places like Chad and the Sudan—in Darfur—to understand how important this declaration is for the rights of indigenous peoples. It will affect those people. It is not just about the indigenous peoples of developed countries. In fact, it is much more important to the indigenous peoples of undeveloped countries and the circumstances with which they are presented.
The Australian government’s argument, presented by Her Excellency the Ambassador Rosemary Banks, the New Zealand representative speaking also on behalf of Australia and the United States, said that those countries could not accept the adoption of a text that she described as ‘confusing, unworkable, contradictory and deeply flawed’. She suggested that the declaration’s reference to self-determination:
... could be misrepresented as conferring a unilateral right of self-determination and possible secession ... thus threatening the political unity, territorial integrity and the stability of existing ... Member States.
Senator Bartlett, in his contribution to this debate, has reflected on the most current drafting of the draft declaration. The draft declaration goes to some pains to address that issue in article 45, saying:
Nothing in this Declaration may be interpreted as implying for any State, group or person any right to engage in any activity or to perform any act contrary to the Charter of the United Nations.
Labor’s position on this issue is that this is another very shameful moment for Australia. It certainly confirms to the international community what they already think about our human rights record, especially coming so closely after the adverse international media reports about the Northern Territory intervention legislation. Let me tell you: we did not get very much positive reporting about that legislation.
The Prime Minister himself actually worked quite hard to destabilise the negotiations and the important work of consensus building on the rights of indigenous peoples around the world when he persuaded the new Prime Minister of Canada to completely reverse the position of the Canadian people and the Canadian government, when he visited Canada last year. That is a very significant thing. The Prime Minister’s department admitted last year that the Prime Minister lobbied the new Prime Minister of Canada to change that country’s position on the draft declaration. There was Canada, which had played a significant role in the negotiations for more than a decade and had collaborated with indigenous peoples around the world to draft a number of the provisions that were critical in building support among other states, and then, at the 11th hour, there was an about-face, with arm-twisting by Australia’s Prime Minister, to now denounce the position that the country had previously supported.
The declaration has major global implications. It is urgently needed as a major step towards addressing the widespread human rights violations affecting indigenous peoples across the world, and it is certainly a long-overdue step towards limiting the abuse and murder of indigenous peoples around the world. As I said, it has important implications for places like the Sudan.
We know that the declaration, like other UN declarations, is not legally enforceable. It is a non-binding document that certainly has no capacity to override Australian law. As I say, it is an aspirational document. After being adopted by an overwhelming majority of the Human Rights Council last year, we know that despite the opposition by Australia, New Zealand, Russia, Canada and America it will be adopted by the United Nations this week. We will just be the people, the developed countries, that have not supported the rights of indigenous people in developing countries in the world.
The declaration itself sets international standards for how aboriginal peoples, indigenous peoples, are to be treated in countries around the world. It says aboriginal peoples or indigenous peoples should have the right to determine their political status and have the right to all freedoms granted under the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and international human rights laws.
Senator Payne raised concerns about self-determination and that reminded me of what I was reading about the development of this draft declaration and the sudden interest by Australia in the issue of self-determination, which has been part of the Australian government’s Indigenous policy since 1972. Even until 1977, Australia was silent in the whole debate about self-determination. But it was in 1998 when the Howard government decided that Australia would seek to persuade Canada, New Zealand and the United States to demand the removal of the term ‘self-determination’ from the draft Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. At the time, the Foreign Minister is reported as saying:
In the case of Australia, we don’t want to see a separate country created for indigenous Australians. We will be arguing that it might be better to use the term self-management rather than leaving an impression that we are prepared to have a separate indigenous state.
Of course, that is alarmist rhetoric. There is no sense that this draft declaration will lead to the establishment of a separate Indigenous state.
Labor is calling on the Howard government to show some moral courage and leadership and support the adoption of the UN Draft Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. It is going before the UN this week and, despite the government’s opposition, the UN will adopt it. Labor is very proud of the constructive role that it played in the negotiations during the Hawke-Keating government and is pretty disappointed that the Howard government not only have taken an adversarial attitude to the negotiations but also have successfully lobbied other nation states, like Canada, to reverse their position. It is very clear that their opposition to the declaration is ideological because they continue, as we have heard today, to point out worst-case scenarios rather than interpreting the provisions of the draft declaration in good faith.
There are many people who are concerned about Australia’s opposition. Amnesty International and the National Council of Churches are among dozens of groups seeking a change of heart. We have had demonstrations outside Australia’s UN mission in New York calling on the Howard government to end its opposition to the declaration. More than 25 organisations were there, most representing indigenous peoples from various parts of the world. Right now in Australia, Indigenous Australians have no constitutional acknowledgement, no settlement, no bill of rights, no representative body and no national leadership on reconciliation. Adopting this declaration would give this country a set of aspirations that we can all hold on to.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</title>,Matters of Urgency,8,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-09-10,"—The Greens also support this motion and note in today’s paper Amnesty International’s ad, which is addressed to the Prime Minister of Australia, John Howard, and to the Prime Minister of Canada, Stephen Harper. They ask the respective governments to support this declaration. The ad says:
This week the United Nations is set to take a long overdue step when it votes on the adoption of a new Declaration recognising the fundamental rights of Indigenous peoples. Amnesty International members throughout Australia and Canada call on you to make it clear that your governments are prepared to join the world in supporting its adoption.
In Australia, in Canada and around the world, Indigenous peoples are universally among the most marginalised and persecuted people on the planet. There is no question that concerted international attention is needed if these grave abuses are to be addressed. The Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples will be central to these efforts.
It has taken more than two decades to get this far. In June 2006, the first major hurdle was cleared when the UN Human Rights Council adopted the Declaration. However, Australia and Canada joined forces with other governments and were instrumental in blocking its adoption at the UN General Assembly earlier this year.
Today an overwhelming majority of the world’s nations have indicated they support the Declaration and are prepared to vote for its adoption. At long last there may be an international human rights instrument which delivers minimum human rights standards for Indigenous peoples. Canada and Australia should be among the global champions of this Declaration.
At this significant point in history, it is our hope and expectation that your governments will no longer stand in opposition to the Declaration. Indigenous peoples need your support, and certainly deserve no less.
We hear today that the government cannot possibly support the declaration because it is so rushed. It has been over two decades. Two decades! How long do you need to support this declaration? How long do you need to study it? It is longer than my son’s lifetime—and he is 18. He has not been in this world as long as you have been talking about this declaration.
There are seven states, I understand, who have major objections to this declaration, and I find that deeply objectionable. But when you scratch beneath the surface you probably do not have to scratch too far to realise why the Australian government does not want to support this declaration—because it does not want to expose itself perhaps to accusations of violations under this declaration. When you look at the racially discriminatory legislation which has just been adopted by this government and which takes away people’s land, their rights to control their income and their decision making, it is no wonder that the government does not want to support this declaration. It is no wonder that this government does not want to support this declaration when it is still presiding over a 17-year gap in the life expectancy of our Indigenous peoples, when it is still underfunding medical and health requirements for our Indigenous peoples in a major way and when it is still underfunding their housing requirements in a major way. Last year we saw the report from the UN Special Rapporteur on Adequate Housing, which showed the parlous state of housing in our Aboriginal communities.
Of course, the declaration calls on states to work closely with indigenous peoples, ensuring the protection of their rights pertaining to such things as self-determination, education, cultural identity and the use of lands, territories and resources essential to indigenous people’s livelihoods and ways of living. Did we see that with the legislation that just passed through this chamber? No, we certainly did not. There was no consultation with indigenous peoples around that legislation, which had to be exempted from the Racial Discrimination Act because it quite clearly contravenes it. It is no wonder that this government needs a little bit more time—maybe a quarter of a century. We have now had 24 years—maybe we need another year or two! Let us take it over the quarter-century mark to see if we can protect it.
This government has also gone about systematically undermining and removing representative organisations for Indigenous peoples, undermining their ability to make decisions, and has not addressed the issues that are so pertinently covered by this declaration. This is an important declaration, and I would have thought this government would have been proud to be one of the first to sign up. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</title>,Matters of Urgency,8,1,speech
"Trood, Sen Russell",LP,2007-09-10,"—It is a great privilege to be able to participate in this debate this afternoon. I want to express, as my colleague Senator Payne has done, some of the concerns that the government has about the declaration. In listening to the opposition and the minor parties on this matter, I have been rather curious. There has been much reference to moral courage, to good faith and to supporting the alleged body of opinion that exists within the international community in favour of this declaration. There was a reference to the fact that we would be forever condemned if we were not to support the declaration which is to come before the United Nations in perhaps a few days time.
This is quite an extraordinary argument because it seems to suggest that Australia is not permitted to have its own view on these matters, that it is not permitted to assess an instrument that is proposed to become a declaration of the United Nations and that it is not permitted to assess whether or not that particular declaration is in Australia’s interests and in the interests of Indigenous Australians. I would have thought that every member of this chamber would assert and accept the proposition that, in relation to every matter that comes before any international body, any international organisation or any non-governmental organisation, Australia has the right to reflect on whether or not the particular proposal which is before the organisation is in its interests. The Australian government has taken the view that this declaration, as it now stands, is not in the interests of Australia and not in the interests, more widely and more generally, of indigenous peoples around the world. That is the important proposition. This document will not advance the cause of indigenous people anywhere on the planet.
In many ways, the Australian government would like to support this document. It has some merit, as Senator Payne pointed out. It is a document of some 46 articles and contains some articles which I think most of us could quite strongly support, such as ‘the right to a nationality’ and ‘the rights to life, physical and mental integrity, liberty and security of person’. Article 8 contains ‘the right not to be subjected to forced assimilation or destruction of their culture’, and so it goes. The Australian government’s position is to strongly support numerous elements of this document, but the view it takes of the document overall is that it is flawed.
The Australian government has worked constructively with other countries, over a long period of time, trying to secure a document which would have consensus within the international community. It has done that because it believes that that is the only kind of document that will be of value to indigenous people around the world. There is no point in the General Assembly approving a declaration from which a large number of significant countries are likely to dissent. We would be far better off if we could secure a document which had widespread international approval, and this document, as it currently stands, does not command that widespread international approval.
It ought to be a document which we can all look to with some pride and say, ‘This document sets a standard by which we wish governments to show concern for their indigenous people.’ This document, as it presently stands, does not reach that standard. It is an aspirational document. It is not intended to be law and, curiously, I think it was Senator Stephens who said that the fact that it was not going to be law was a reason why the concerns that we have should be set to one side. It is almost as though we should support rhetorical expressions of concern and, if they are not binding in law, add our name to a long list of countries which are apparently entirely happy with this document. The Australian government has worked constructively over a long period of time and, as Senator Payne pointed out in her contribution to the debate, we had hoped that there would be further time to assess the progress of the document.
It is flawed in various kinds of ways, and Senator Payne alluded to those shortcomings. One that she did not mention but I think deserves some recognition in the context of this debate is the fact that the document as it stands does not contain a definition of ‘indigenous peoples’. This seems to be an extraordinary omission. Here is a document proposed to be an international declaration about indigenous peoples and there is no attempt, within the document, to make any kind of effort to define what an indigenous person might actually be. The absence of a definition leaves the document open to abuse. It provides the opportunity for separatist groups and minority groups—anybody who might wish to claim indigenous status—to abuse the forthright intent of the document. I would have thought that that was something which, on further discussion, might easily be eliminated. That opportunity for exploitation could easily be removed, and we could move to something which would have, at least in that respect, a wider degree of consensus.
Senator Payne alluded to some of the other shortcomings of the document. She alluded to the problem of self-determination. She alluded to the problem in relation to intellectual property. She did not allude to the concern expressed by Australia and several other countries in relation to the repatriation of human remains. It seems that, rather than being seen as an opportunity for indigenous people to repatriate remains taken from their country of origin, the document is being interpreted and construed by some states as allowing them to maintain their holdings of indigenous remains and artefacts. There may be some countries in which that would be an acceptable course of action, but it is hardly a state of mind or position that Indigenous Australians would encourage the Australian government to take on their behalf in relation to this declaration before the United Nations.
The general position of the government on this matter is that this is a document which we would very much like to support. It is a document which we have constructively contributed to over a long time. It is a document which we believe ought to be a sign of the international community’s position. (Time expired)

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2007-09-10,"—I too wish to partake in what I find to be a frustrating and disappointing debate. In terms of where we are at, I think it is clear that rarely does a perfect document come out of any organisation—in particular, the UN. The document in front of us, which is now in front of the world community, has been evolving over a long time. Some people say there has been 20 years of discussion since the original International Decade of the World’s Indigenous Peoples was declared. Most particularly, since the mid-nineties there has been a structured approach to the UN principles to look at how there can be an international commitment to the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. This declaration is a huge commitment and offers real hope to so many people. It is long and complex and uses many verbs—in fact, the preambles of all the UN documents that I have been acquainted with are often longer than the actual articles that people are agreeing to—but, in terms of what it offers to the world, it is invaluable. In fact, when we were talking with indigenous people this year on the International Day of the World’s Indigenous People, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights talked about the hope this document could have for indigenous people across the world. She invited states and the international community as a whole to give particular attention to targeting indigenous people in programs to reduce poverty and also to make sure that people have their voice.
This is not an easy document to consume, but what we forget is that it is an aspirational document—a declaration; it does not actually bind any country of the world to take particular action. What it does is bind countries to look within their own programs of law to respect and acknowledge the rights of indigenous people. When Senator Bartlett and Senator Evans talked to Tom Calma from HREOC in October last year, Mr Calma was asked, in his capacity as a commissioner, what the signing of this document would mean. In his evidence, Mr Calma said:
… it is a declaration. As such, it is a non-binding document … It will then be up to each of the states—
that is, the governments of countries—to take up what they can do in this process. He went on to say:
But, from an indigenous person’s perspective, it will be the benchmark that we will be looking to encourage governments to try and follow. What needs to be recognised is that the declaration is really a compilation of all the various references to indigenous peoples in other conventions and covenants, so there is not really anything new—
in this document. As an integral part of two decades of consideration of issues around indigenous people, it is a declaration about which the United Nations, as a compilation of member nations, can stand together and say, ‘We accept this declaration.’ It does not mean that every state that signs up to the declaration will have to implement all the articles. This declaration will not mean that there will be a binding rule on self-determination and the issues that we have heard Senator Payne and Senator Trood identify—and quite rightly so, because these things belong under individual country laws—but what it will do is put on the international stage an awareness of, and focus on, the role of indigenous people within those frameworks. Australia should be leading in this area—in fact, we have led in the past. That is why I say again that there is a degree of disappointment in our discussion at this time.
There has been a recommendation from the Human Rights Committee that this declaration be taken up, so already a hope has been established amongst a number of indigenous people who have attended and contributed to meetings of the Human Rights Forum. Many Indigenous Australians have gone to the UN, at various places, to talk about why such a declaration is important to them in their daily lives and about the issues of disadvantage they face on an almost daily basis. We have heard many times in this place about the horrific statistics on the suffering of Australian Indigenous people in health, in education and in life. Those same issues are being suffered—and the statistics are similar—by the various indigenous people across the world. The UN itself has put out statistics—and this is an estimate—that more than 370 million individuals, living in more than 70 countries, could be identified as indigenous people in 2007. Those numbers are confronting, but one of the most confronting things about them is that, when you go around and look at the living conditions, life expectancy and day-to-day issues faced by indigenous people in their own countries, they suffer disadvantage in so many cases. The declaration that is going before the UN assembly acknowledges indigenous disadvantage and will establish the right of people to have expectations of education, health, land ownership and a genuine life within their own community.
They are the kinds of hopes and expectations that all of us have. Now we are hoping that as a part of the second International Decade of the World’s Indigenous Peoples the UN assembly will acknowledge, through the various articles of this particular declaration, that all peoples who are indigenous to their lands will be able to work together to achieve these within their own processes.
We are celebrating in so many ways in our country this year the 40th year of the rights of Indigenous people to vote and to be citizens in our country. Earlier this year, a friend of mine, Jackie Huggins, in speaking at one of the very many celebrations around those issues, talked about the processes that were established in her family when they were fighting for reconciliation 40 years ago. She said:
To me, like my mother ... reconciliation has always encompassed three things: recognition, justice and healing.
They are the three components that are encompassed in the international Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. We can look together and see that across the world people are saying that Indigenous peoples have the right to recognition, the right to justice and the right to healing. That is what this declaration is about. We can achieve it and we can work within our own laws to give hope to our own people and people across the world.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</title>,Matters of Urgency,8,1,speech
"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2007-09-10,"—Mr Acting Deputy President, I also rise to contribute to this debate today. Let me say at the outset that I support the view that the Australian government should only support the adoption of the proposed United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples if it is in our national interest to do so and if it is in the interests of indigenous people. For that to be the case we require some of our outstanding concerns to be addressed. In fact, when it comes to human rights instruments like this one it is the norm, and quite appropriately our preference, that they be adopted by consensus to ensure broad support. At this point it is very clear that consensus has not been reached. Indeed, it is our view that the current text has been put forward much too hastily for adoption by the Human Rights Council. That is obviously disappointing, and hopefully some more work can be done to reach that consensus between now and when the ultimate vote is taken—although at this stage it would appear that that is rather unlikely.
By way of general comment let me say that we need a declaration that is focused on making a real, positive difference in the circumstances of indigenous people. I share the view that we need a declaration that is clear, transparent and capable of implementation. Our concern is that the current text is confusing and would risk endless and conflicting interpretations and debate in its application. There are a series of very specific concerns, and some of them have been mentioned in the debate so far.
Firstly, there is a concern in relation to the provisions about self-determination. Let me read to you current article 3 of the text as it stands:
All peoples have the right to self-determination. By virtue of that right they may freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development.
Self-determination has significant meaning in public international law, and we are quite appropriately concerned that references to it in the current text could be misconstrued as conferring the right of secession upon indigenous peoples. Let me read out to you a definition of the principle of self-determination:
The principle of self-determination, often seen as a moral and legal right, is that every nation is entitled to a sovereign territorial state, and that every specifically identifiable population should choose which state it belongs to, often by plebiscite. It is commonly used to justify the aspirations of an ethnic group that self-identifies as a nation toward forming an independent sovereign state, but it equally grants the right to reject sovereignty and join a larger multi-ethnic state.
Senator Moore mentioned that self-determination in this context does not mean that indigenous peoples would seek to exercise their right to self-determination by way of a separate entity. Well, if it does not mean that, why does it say so in the current text of the declaration? If it does not mean that, why wouldn’t we clarify the text and amend it such that a broader consensus can be reached? Those are questions that will need to be answered.
We also have very serious concerns about the provisions in relation to land and resources. The current provisions on land and resources appear to ignore today’s realities and we believe them to be unworkable and unacceptable. As they currently stand they would appear to require the recognition of indigenous land rights to lands now lawfully owned by other citizens, both indigenous and non-indigenous. In fact, it is our view that the text as it currently stands does not sufficiently recognise third-party rights—in particular, the rights of third parties to access indigenous land, heritage and cultural objects where appropriate under our laws. Another example of that relates to the inclusion of intellectual property rights. We do not support the inclusion of intellectual property rights for indigenous peoples in the text of the declaration. While we protect our Indigenous cultural heritage, traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expression to the extent that they are consistent with Australian and international property law, we will not provide sui generis intellectual property rights for Indigenous communities as envisaged in the declaration.
We are concerned also about the inclusion in the text of the declaration at present of what appears to be an unqualified right of free, prior and informed consent for indigenous peoples on matters affecting them. Senator Payne has talked about that. That provision would seem to imply that they may exercise the right of veto over all matters of state, including national laws and administrative matters. We do support the full and active engagement of indigenous peoples in democratic decision-making processes, but no government can or should accept the notion of creating different classes of citizenship.
Finally, we do not support the text as it currently stands which would appear to place indigenous customary law in a superior position to national law. Customary law is not law in the sense that modern democracies use the term; it is based on culture and tradition and should not override national laws. Very specifically, I strongly support the view that customary law should not be used selectively as an excuse to permit the exercise of practices by certain indigenous communities which would be unacceptable in the rest of the community.
A suggestion was made that the text is aspirational and not legally binding. While that is true, the position put forward by Australia, New Zealand and the United States is that we need a text that is capable of implementation and that represents a standard of achievement that various countries can be measured against. In summing up, previous speakers on the government side have made the point that this is a declaration that we would like to be able to support. It is very clear that at this stage a consensus has not been reached. We very strongly encourage all of the relevant states that are participating in the consultations and negotiations to do everything that they can to reach that consensus between now and 13 September—or even after that if that is necessary. But at this point in time, I support the proposition that it is not in our national interest or in the interests of Indigenous people for Australia to support the adoption of the proposed declaration in its current form.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</title>,Matters of Urgency,8,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2007-09-10,"—I rise this afternoon to provide some support for the call put forward this afternoon for the need for the Australian government to support the adoption of the proposed United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People. After 20 years of long, hard and considered work and debate internationally through the United Nations, there is an intention to put this declaration before the current session of the United Nations General Assembly sometime this week. I have to say that the government’s response is disappointing but not unexpected. Essentially, what they are saying is that they will not be supporting this declaration because it does not line up with their policy on Indigenous affairs. We have seen that unfold quite dramatically in the last three months in relation to the Northern Territory.
This declaration has evolved through a long process which has stretched from 1982, when it was first suggested that a human rights standard be developed by a working group. In 1985, that working group began preparing the draft declaration. In 1993, the working group agreed on the final text. There have been further amendments to that text recently. There was also a world summit in 2005. In 2006, the fifth session of the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues called for the adoption of the declaration. In June 2006, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, which is now called the Human Rights Council, endorsed and adopted this declaration. It is pretty much coming down the final straight and heading to the finish line.
It is disappointing that Australia will not be there leading the world when it comes to forging a path on indigenous issues. Unfortunately, we have never been able to step up to the mark when it comes to those issues. Canada and New Zealand have some concerns with this. If we have a look at what is happening over in Norway and other places, we see that some countries have proven to be world leaders when it comes to dealing with indigenous people. But Australia never seems to have gotten it quite right. Australia remains among a group of only seven states to delay the final adoption of this important and long-overdue declaration. We stand with Canada, Columbia, Guyana, New Zealand, the Russian Federation and Surinam, who have all publicly called for further negotiations to redraft the central provisions of the declaration. It is sad to think that this could lead to unacceptable delays in the adoption of the declaration. We run the risk of the declaration never being adopted at all or its provisions being so weakened and undermined as to be meaningless, denying indigenous peoples the protection to which they are entitled. Amnesty International believes that the adoption of the declaration is a critical step towards ending the pervasive human rights violations that are faced by indigenous people right around this globe.
The declaration calls on states to work closely with indigenous people in ensuring that their rights are protected. This is where the government’s intent is fundamentally different to the intent of the declaration. The declaration points to self-determination. This government has publicly said that it has a policy of assimilation. The declaration talks about intellectual property rights. There has long been a call by Indigenous people in this country for their intellectual property rights to be recognised through research and through legislation, particularly when it comes to Indigenous art. The declaration calls for the recognition of customary law. There is some bizarre notion that Indigenous people here would seek to have their customary law override any other sort of judicial law. In fact, what Indigenous people here are calling for is recognition and respect for that customary law. I have not met one Indigenous person who believes that their customary law should override criminal law. (Time expired)

Government responses to parliamentary committee reports

Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services––Report––Timeshare: The price of leisure (received 30 August 2007)
The Government response read as follows—

COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE PARLIAMENTARY JOINT COMMITTEE ON CORPORATIONS AND FINANCIAL SERVICES REPORT ON TIMESHARE:
 
 THE PRICE OF LEISURE


Government response to the report of the parliamentary joint committee on corporations and financial services—Timeshare: the price of leisure background

On 8 December 2004, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services (PJC) agreed to conduct an inquiry and report on the regulation of the timeshare industry.  The report, entitled Timeshare: The Price of Leisure, was tabled in the Parliament on 5 September 2005.
The report contains 19 recommendations, the main one being that timeshare schemes should no longer be regulated as managed investment schemes under Chapter 5C of the Corporations Act 2001 (the Corporations Act), but should be given their own chapter.  The report also recommends that the new chapter should contain a number of consumer protection provisions.
Other substantial recommendations of the report are that contracts for the purchase of timeshare interests be required to include a minimum buy back amount and that an Australian Government agency (and possibly agencies in the States and Territories as well) be established to acquire compulsorily the interests of delinquent members in older ‘title-based’ timeshare schemes.
The Government’s response to each of the report’s recommendations is outlined below. 

THE GOVERNMENT’S RESPONSE TO THE COMMITTEE’S RECOMMENDATIONS


RECOMMENDATION 1


The Committee recommends that timeshare should continue to be regulated under the Corporations Act 2001.

The Government supports this recommendation.
Regulation of timeshares under the Corporations Act is appropriate and works effectively to control the operations of the industry and its conduct. 

RECOMMENDATION 2


The Committee recommends that:

Timeshare should be removed as a definitional element of the managed investment funds under s.9 of the Corporations Act 2001; and
A separate chapter be inserted into the Corporations Act 2001 to deal specifically with timeshare.
The Government does not support this recommendation.
Timeshare schemes share all the basic elements of managed investment schemes and therefore warrant regulation as such.  Where timeshare has unique characteristics compared with other managed investment schemes, the Corporations Act contains sufficient flexibility such that the requirements can be modified.  Indeed, ASIC has used its power in this area to grant concessions and ‘relief’ to various timeshare schemes.
Inclusion of a new chapter of various consumer protection measures would replicate existing provisions in the ASIC Act and Corporations Act which already apply to financial products such as timeshare interests (as managed investment schemes, timeshare schemes are also financial products.) 

RECOMMENDATION 3


The Committee recommends that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) establish and maintain a watching brief on the level of concentration of the Australian timeshare market.

The Government does not support this recommendation.
The ACCC is the independent statutory authority responsible for enforcing and administering the Trade Practices Act 1974 (TPA).  In undertaking this role, the ACCC considers and investigates information regarding potential breaches of the TPA.  Relevantly, subsection 29(1A) of the TPA prohibits the Minister from giving directions to the ACCC about the performance of its functions or exercise of its powers under Part IV of the Act (prohibition of anti-competitive conduct).
The ACCC carries out these functions in accordance with its statutory obligations and is resourced sufficiently to do so.  The ACCC will continue to make appropriate decisions regarding monitoring, in the light of complaints it receives and other information it gathers. 

RECOMMENDATION 4


The Committee recommends that the proposed chapter in the Corporations Act 2001 include specific provisions proscribing pressure selling tactics in the sale of timeshare.
 
 These provisions should include the remedy of a full refund to any customer who can reasonably show that their decision to enter a timeshare contract was procured by physical, psychological, social or economic threat or intimidation.

The Government does not support this recommendation.
Existing financial services regulation in the Corporations Act and ASIC Act already deals with this issue.  Specifically, sections 12DB and 12DC of the ASIC Act which deal with false representations and other misleading or offensive conduct have a wide application.  Additionally, sections 12DJ and 12CB prohibit certain activities, including harassment and coercion and unconscionable conduct, and section 992AA of the Corporations Act addresses anti-hawking practices.
As a condition of their licence, cooling-off provisions apply to Australian financial services licensees who sell timeshare - the length of that cooling off period depended on the nature of the scheme and whether the parties were members of ATHOC.  ASIC’s revised policy statement extends this cooling off period across the board to 14 days, effective on 30 September 2007.  This will provide added protection for consumers against pressure selling. 
Implementing this recommendation would involve the introduction of additional regulation, which would duplicate existing provisions, with little demonstrated benefit.

RECOMMENDATION 5


The Committee recommends that the Australian Timeshare and Holiday Ownership Council (ATHOC) produce a detailed statement of practice outlining the types of behaviour which should be regarded as pressure selling in timeshare.

The Government supports this recommendation but notes that this is a recommendation for which it is not responsible as it is directed to a specific industry body.
The Government recognises the significance and importance of industry bodies in assisting with the co-regulatory process, including providing their industry members with relevant standards and codes of practice to regulate industry behaviour.  Codes offer an efficient and flexible method for encouraging good practices. 
ATHOC has indicated its strong support for a co-regulatory role with ASIC.

RECOMMENDATION 6


The Committee recommends that future training courses provided to timeshare sales personnel should include specific training on the avoidance of pressure selling.

The Government supports this recommendation.
The selling of financial products such as timeshares is regulated under the Corporations and ASIC Acts and includes obligations to ensure staff are trained appropriately.  Legislation already regulates pressure selling issues (as set out in the response to recommendation 4 above) and provides a full suite of provisions to regulate how timeshare advice is provided.  The legislation also includes appropriate penalties for breaches. 
The Government would support further emphasis on training on this issue but notes that in relation to managed investment schemes, such as timeshare, training already exists on misleading or deceptive conduct and unconscionable conduct practices, which would encompass the issue of pressure selling.  Again, the industry codes of conduct will help address this issue.
The Government supports training packages that ensure that those selling timeshare schemes are made aware of their obligations under the law and how to comply.
In the context of the Government’s Corporate and Financial Services Regulation Review Proposals Paper, ASIC has committed to undertake a review of its training requirements under Policy Statement 146.  Changes suggested and strongly endorsed include providing specific training for specific services, such as timeshare. 

RECOMMENDATION 7


The Committee recommends that the proposed timeshare chapter in the Corporations Act 2001 state any approach to a potential timeshare customer, whether by a timeshare company, a marketing company, or any other agency, must make it clear that:

The purpose of the approach is, or includes, selling an interest in timeshare; and
Any inducement offered is premised on attendance at such sales seminars.
The Government does not support this recommendation.
Existing financial services regulation in the Corporations Act and ASIC Act already deals with this issue (misleading and deceptive, and unconscionable conduct).  Again, industry codes of practice and conduct would also satisfactorily police this issue without the need for further regulation.  We note that ATHOC sets out in its codes for members that all its members who market to consumers must state to their clients that they are being sold a financial product, such as a timeshare or holiday ownership.

RECOMMENDATION 8


The Committee recommends that the proposed timeshare chapter in the Corporations Act 2001 mandate that:

Any term of any offer made in the course of selling timeshare should be available for one week after the term is offered; and
Such terms should not be offered on the basis that the customer can only obtain the term by signing the contract immediately. 

The Government does not support this recommendation.
Cooling off provisions already apply to sales of timeshares by Australian financial services licensees and allow the consumer the option to notify the seller that they want to rescind the contract and obtain a full refund.  This will be further enhanced by ASIC’s extension of the cooling off periods to 14 days (refer recommendation 4 above).
The provisions in the ASIC Act relating to unconscionable conduct and harassment also offer consumer protection against such practices.  Further, ATHOC’s industry codes of practice and ethics reflect the need to ensure that operators do not intimidate or threaten consumers to sign contracts.
Any further regulation would mean duplication and be unnecessarily burdensome.

RECOMMENDATION 9


The Committee recommends that timeshare sellers be required to disclose to consumers that an interest in timeshare does not involve any form of ownership of real property.
 
 This disclosure should be:

made prior to contract information;
made in clear language; and
included in the relevant Schumer boxes.
The Government does not support this recommendation.
The Corporations Act sets out the information which must be provided in a product disclosure statement which needs to be issued for the sale of a financial product such as timeshare.  This includes information about any significant characteristics or features of the product or of the rights, terms, conditions and obligations attaching to the product.  Further, there is an existing requirement that this information be presented in a clear, concise and effective manner. 
The corporations legislation also contains provisions to prohibit false or misleading conduct. 

RECOMMENDATION 10


The Committee recommends that the proposed timeshare chapter in the Corporations Act 2001 should contain anti-hawking provisions similar to those contained in s.992A of the Corporations Act, and should make it clear that those provisions apply to unsolicited contact intended to procure attendance at sales seminars. 
 

The Government does not support this recommendation.
The Corporations Act already prohibits hawking in relation to the offer of financial products  (section 992A and 992AA).  Section 992AA generally prohibits the offer of interests in managed investment schemes for issue or sale in the course of, or because of, an unsolicited meeting or telephone call.

RECOMMENDATION 11


The Committee recommends that the current requirement for Tier 1 level training for timeshare sales personnel should remain, but that training courses should be developed specifically for timeshare.

The Government supports this recommendation.
Legislation already allows the setting of minimum training standards for financial product advisers.  
As noted in recommendation 6 above, training requirements are being reviewed in the context of the Government’s current Corporate and Financial Services Regulation Review.  The issue of appropriate training requirements was raised in the context of avoiding a “one size fits all” approach and allowing for training requirements to provide greater recognition of different skills and competencies relevant to the different streams of business. 

RECOMMENDATION 12


The Committee recommends that the proposed timeshare chapter in the Corporations Act 2001 should include mandatory cooling-off periods of 10 business days for all timeshare sales, regardless of whether the timeshare company is a member of the Australian Timeshare and Holiday Ownership Council (ATHOC) or not.

The Government does not support the recommendation that there be a new chapter of the Corporations Act devoted to timeshare. 
Cooling off periods do not apply under the Corporations Act (as timeshares are not considered to be liquid assets Reg 7.9.64(1)(e)), but do apply under ASIC licensing conditions for timeshare licensees. 

RECOMMENDATION 13


The Committee recommends that the proposed timeshare chapter in the Corporations Act 2001 should require that timeshare customers be advised of their entitlement to a cooling-off period by:

a document of one page approved by ASIC for this purpose; and
advice of the entitlement and the length of the cooling-off period in the contract’s Schumer box.
The Government does not support the recommendation that there be a new chapter of the Corporations Act devoted to timeshare.  However, any industry initiatives to provide focussed information to customers about the cooling-off period would be welcomed by the Government.
The Corporations Act already sets out the information which must be provided in a product disclosure statement, which includes that clients be advised of their entitlement to a cooling-off period (para 1013D(1)(i)).  The product disclosure statement must present this advice in a clear, concise and effective manner.
ASIC revised Policy Statement 160, which was recently released, enhances these requirements.

RECOMMENDATION 14


The Committee recommends that the cooling-off period for a timeshare sales contract be suspended during the interval between the customer asking for further information, and that further information being provided.

The Government does not support this recommendation. 
The cooling-off period generally begins on the day when all required documents (including the cooling-off statement) are given to the consumer and they have acknowledged in writing that they have received them.
It would be inappropriate to suspend the period when the customer asked for information beyond that which was required to be provided.

RECOMMENDATION 15


The Committee recommends that the proposed timeshare chapter in the Corporations Act 2001 should require timeshare contracts to have, on their front cover, a prominent disclosure box with the heading ‘Important Disclosure Information’ and the information detailed in paragraph 5.83 of this report.

The Government does not support this recommendation.
The Government considers that the existing disclosure requirements under the Corporations Act, particularly in relation to product disclosure statements, are appropriate and effective. 

RECOMMENDATION 16


The Committee recommends that the proposed timeshare chapter in the Corporations Act 2001 should require timeshare contracts to include a minimum guaranteed buy back amount.

The Government does not support this recommendation.
The terms by which an interest in a timeshare is bought back is a commercial decision between the parties.  Individuals are best placed to determine what they require. 

RECOMMENDATION 17


The Committee recommends that fully sold schemes should be able to sell interests in their own timeshare scheme without holding an Australian Financial Services Licence.

The Government supports this recommendation, provided that relief is restricted to the older style fully sold schemes only. 
Fully sold schemes are those schemes which are exempt under state law, exempt title based time-sharing schemes or member controlled schemes.  ASIC has previously provided relief from the need to hold a licence to a number of participants after individual applications have been received.  As part of its revised policy statement on time-sharing schemes, ASIC has formally recognised that this relief is available on a case-by-case basis subject to certain conditions, including less than 5% of the interests are resold in any year and that the 14 day cooling off period applies.

RECOMMENDATION 18


The Committee recommends that the Treasurer consult with appropriate state and territory ministers with a view to outlining a scheme outlined in paragraph 6.17 of this report.

The Government does not support this recommendation.
This recommendation relates to the re-acquisition of the interests of ‘delinquent’ members of a few older schemes.  These members have failed to keep up payments in relation to their time-sharing interests - the numbers of delinquent members are relatively low.  The Government considers that compulsory acquisition would be a disproportionate solution to the problem and the cost of this solution does not justify the benefits.
The operators of such schemes may wish to consider other means, including the possibility of amending the constitution of these schemes, to address this problem.

RECOMMENDATION 19


The Committee recommends that any new regulatory scheme should make clear that the board of a fully-sold scheme can dismiss the resort manager if the board is unsatisfied with the performance of the manager.

The Government does not support this recommendation.
Fully sold schemes may be eligible for relief or modification orders (s601QA) from certain managed investment provisions of the Corporations Act as they often have unusual structures (the older schemes tend to be title based rather than points based systems) because they were set up under old legislation. 
When providing relief under the managed investment provisions, ASIC imposes conditions requiring that the schemes provide certain protections which allow for dismissal of management.  This relief provides that the decision on dismissing the manager is one for the members, not the board.
It is appropriate that the members make this decision and that the mechanism remain flexible.
Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security—Report—Review of administration and expenditure: Australian intelligence organisations—Number 4: Recruitment and training (received 30 August 2007)
The Government response read as follows—

Government Response to the Fourth Report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security


Review of administration and expenditure: Australian Intelligence Organisations


Recruitment and Training


The Government has considered the Committee’s report on its review of Australian Intelligence Organisations’ administration and expenditure.
 
 The Government has decided to implement two of the Committee’s three recommendations.
 
 This response sets out the action taken to deal with each of the recommendations.
  


Recommendation 1


That the Government provide the Committee with separate financial statements for DSD, DIGO and DIO to enable the Committee to fulfil its statutory obligations regarding oversight of the administration and expenditure of the intelligence and security agencies.


Response:


Accepted
. The Department of Defence is engaging with ANAO representatives and the Committee Secretariat to discuss how the Defence Intelligence Agencies can best address the Committee’s desire for greater detail in the financial statements, given that the Defence Intelligence Agencies are not statutory reporting entities.


Recommendation 2


The Committee recommends:

that the Government identify methods to address the security clearance
backlog of the agencies; and
that the agencies be required to report every year on the backlog and the
methods being used to address it in their Annual Reports.

Response:


Accepted
. The Government supports this recommendation and notes that the backlog issue is being addressed by the Department of Defence and the Inter-Agency Security Forum.


Recommendation 3


The Committee recommends that the Government enquire into the feasibility of establishing a combined facility for basic training in intelligence either in an existing academic institution or as a separate college.


Response:


Not Accepted
. At this stage AIC agencies believe that most training needs are effectively addressed by each agency being able to shape its own training for its specific needs. This takes place in a context in which AIC-wide training programmes have also been established. An AIC training secretariat has been established, funded by all AIC agencies, in response to a recommendation in the Flood Review. As a need is identified for an AIC-wide approach to training in a discrete area the AIC responds to that need - the most recent example being a proposal to provide an AIC-wide course on counter-proliferation.


For the most part, agencies’ training benefits are maximised by each agency being able to tailor its training programme to fit its specific professional needs along with the timing and participation numbers that best suit it. While there are some skills that are common across the community each agency tends to have a core of skill requirements that is unique to that agency. It is not a matter of unnecessary duplication taking place across the AIC.


Exposure to other parts of the AIC is part of agencies’ existing training programmes. Secondments already take place across the AIC, to which a combined training facility would not necessarily add value.


The Report does not elaborate on its reference to ‘current training difficulties’, so we are not clear as to what the Committee believes needs to be remedied by a combined training facility.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-09-10,"—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the response by the Premier of Western Australia that has just been tabled.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
As you have outlined, Mr Acting Deputy President, this is a response from the Premier of Western Australia to a resolution of the Senate on 21 June this year which related to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs entitled Unfinished business: Indigenous stolen wages. I moved that resolution of the Senate and it was, as far as I am aware, adopted by the Senate without dissent. The report was tabled by the committee in December of last year by the then chair, Senator Payne. The report of that committee was also unanimous from all senators across all parties in this place. It contained just six recommendations. The resolution of June this year that the Western Australian Premier has responded to basically requested that the relevant state governments and the federal government respond to the recommendations of the Senate committee report regarding Indigenous stolen wages as promptly as possible and ideally by 7 August.
I thank the Western Australian Premier for providing a response to the resolution of the Senate, albeit not as quickly as I would have liked. I note that the federal government is still yet to respond to this resolution of the Senate, and that is something I find very unfortunate and, frankly, totally unacceptable. The recommendations of the Senate committee were tabled, as I said, in December last year. There are only six recommendations and some of them do not even relate to the federal government; they relate specifically to state governments.
I remind the Senate, as I repeatedly do, that it is an existing standing order that governments should respond to Senate committee reports and their recommendations within three months. If it is a very detailed report with a bevy of recommendations numbering in the hundreds then perhaps a longer response time might be justified. But when there are only six recommendations—some of which do not even apply to the federal government—and nine months later we still have no response, that indicates to me not just a contempt for the Senate and the Senate committee but also a contempt for the Indigenous Australians who are directly affected by the injustice identified in the report and who are extremely anxious, upset, distressed and hurt by the continuing failure of governments, particularly at a state level, to respond. And when the federal government joins in failing to respond it compounds that injustice and that hurt. It is very disappointing and I frankly do not understand it. It is not that hard.
The recommendations are not that complex. They are not asking for billions of dollars from the federal government. The committee recommended that the Commonwealth government facilitate unhindered access to their archives for Indigenous people and their representatives for the purpose of finding out about the extent of Indigenous stolen wages and that the Commonwealth government provide funding to the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies to conduct a national oral history and archival project with regard to Indigenous stolen wages. The committee also recommended that the Commonwealth government, in regard to the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory, urgently consult with Indigenous people and conduct some preliminary research of their archival material. It is not that complex.
I do not know why it should take nine months to respond, even if the response is ‘No’. No response at all is contemptuous, particularly given that the committee itself emphasised that this is an urgent matter—not that the federal government or state government need to be told this because they already know it. Many of the people who were victims of this injustice are very old and they and, of course, their descendants want justice and recognition in relation to this issue. It is totally unacceptable for the federal government to have failed to respond. They have failed to respond to that Senate resolution—which was as polite as it could be. The resolution was in June, six months after the report was tabled. The federal government should already have responded.
The Senate specifically passed a resolution requesting that the government table a response by 7 August. I know the government have a lot of things on their minds with regard to the Northern Territory, but how this could not have been done at the same time is beyond me. It is not that complex, and it really signals to me a show of bad faith. It is a show of bad faith in an area where, frankly, the vast majority of blame in this area is on the state governments. In the current context where we are seeing the federal government grasping any opportunity to point out failures of the state governments you would think that the government would be onto it. But it seems that any issues regarding Indigenous people where it is matter of recognising clear-cut, undisputed injustices of the past which clearly have a link to the poverty and dysfunction of the present—I am not saying it is the sole reason, but there is a clearly a link there—do not fit the mantra, so there is no response. It is hard for me to come to any other conclusion. I am extremely disappointed that the federal government is yet to respond on such an important issue. It was a unanimous Senate committee report. They are not complex recommendations. There is a clearly identified injustice and a clearly identified expression of the fact that it is an urgent issue.
I welcome the Western Australian government’s response. It notes that the Western Australian government has made a commitment to examine the stolen wages issue and to determine its position by 30 June next year. It is a bit unfortunate that it will not be sooner, but at least it has made that commitment, and I accept that it does require an examination of the archives. That is time consuming and it is painstaking to look at the full extent of the evidence that is there. From the evidence that was provided to the Senate committee inquiry regarding government and commercial entities and other institutions in Western Australia, there seemed to be prima facie evidence that it was very likely that similar practices regarding stolen wages had been acknowledged as having occurred in Queensland and Western Australia. It is good that the Western Australia government has made a commitment to examine the issue. I think it is testimony to the Senate committee’s process and to the report that they helped provide that catalyst—and I am pleased about that.
I note the response to the recommendation about the ministerial council on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs to agree on joint funding arrangements for preliminary legal research. I think they have written to the Senate committee, but I will not comment on that ministerial council as I do not think it has been made public yet. The Western Australia Premier has reflected the view that each jurisdiction should undertake their own education and awareness campaign. That is fair enough as far as it goes, but I do believe there was a role for the ministerial council to take that leadership position and recognise this as a national issue, rather than have people having to fight the battle over and over again under each state jurisdiction. I think it is unfortunate that that recommendation has not been fully implemented. At least we are getting some response from the Western Australian government, even if not from the government at the federal level, on whether the recommendation was considered. It has been put on the agenda and has been flagged with the relevant state ministers. It is a welcome response from Western Australia and it is now a matter of continuing to monitor that process to see what happens. The one thing I would emphasise and urge the Western Australia government to do when they are examining the issue is to make sure that, whatever evidence they find, there is a comprehensive response so that we do not have the abysmal, insulting response that we had from the Queensland government.
I draw the Senate’s attention to the Hard labour, stolen wages report that was released by Dr Ros Kidd last week with the assistance of ANTaR, Australians for Native Title and Reconciliation, which details the situation and collates some of the evidence, including evidence that was provided to the Senate committee inquiry, which outlines the facts. It is very stark and very clear that there is more detail in some states than in others, and that is why more work needs to be done in going into the archives, but there is a clear case in most states of the gross injustice done.
To return to Queensland: for the state government to still pretend that offering four thousand bucks—maybe a bit more depending on what they decide to do with the leftover—offering just $50 million as a ‘gesture of reconciliation’, to use their words, as compensation for a lifetime of withheld earnings is an insult; it is not satisfactory. We all know that today Premier Peter Beattie announced that he is retiring. This is a key opportunity for the new premier, who I assume will be Anna Bligh, to make a difference and go that extra step to remedy the failure of the state government in Queensland to address this clear injustice, to make a proper redress and proper reparation. As part of that, I repeat my urging to all other state governments to respond to the Senate resolution and particularly urge the federal government to show some basic respect if nothing else.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2007-09-10,"—I listened very carefully to what Senator Bartlett has just said. I do not have ministerial responsibility for the response to this report but I will undertake, Senator Bartlett, through you Mr Acting Deputy President, to pursue this urgently with the relevant minister.
As Senator Bartlett knows, I sat as a participating member of that inquiry at its Brisbane hearing, and Senator Bartlett rightly points out that the recommendations were unanimous. Senator Payne, whom I see in the chamber, chaired that committee with great efficiency and penetration, if I may say so. It is not an exaggeration to say that all senators from all parties who participated in those hearings were absolutely appalled at the injustice that had been perpetrated, over generations, on Aboriginal people. As you rightly say, Senator Bartlett, this was largely, though not exclusively, at the instance of state governments on both sides. I remember, Senator Bartlett, as you will also recall, being absolutely appalled at the behaviour of the Queensland state government in dealing with proposals to settle these claims for what you rightly say—I agree with you—was an insultingly small amount of money. I also remember being appalled at the behaviour of Mr Beattie, who, mercifully, is not going to be among us as a practising politician for very much longer, in the way he treated these people with contempt. It seemed to me, Senator Bartlett, that Mr Beattie, who was briefly a solicitor many years ago, should have known that some of the conduct in which he engaged, or for which he was responsible in trying to force a settlement on these people, came pretty close to, if not beyond, the legal definition of duress and undue influence.
So, Senator Bartlett, I share your concern about the urgency and the significance of this report. This is not just about the rights of a group of disadvantaged people; it is also about property rights. If the people or their ancestors—their parents, grandparents or great-grandparents—were entitled to the wages and, through well-meaning but nevertheless wrongful conduct of state governments at the time the wages to which they were entitled were not paid to them, then they have a property right just as good as anybody else in the country to have those wages restored to them, to have the governments concerned make restitution. Senator Bartlett, I undertake to you to pursue the matter urgently. I think you know how strongly I feel about it as well.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Responses to Senate Resolutions</title>,Documents,11,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-09-10,"—I welcome Senator Brandis’s commitment that he will follow up the recommendations. I too was a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and heard the stories about stolen wages that people throughout Australia told.
I would like to acknowledge that my home state of Western Australia is now picking up this issue. I very strongly continue to push this issue in Western Australia. I know that members of the Aboriginal community in Western Australia who had their wages stolen—those who are still with us, that is, because many people are passing on before this issue is resolved—will be looking to government for reparation. It is not good enough for the Western Australian government to just say, ‘We are looking into this.’ In June next year the people of Western Australia will be looking for a commitment from the state government to address this issue. The government needs to provide the compensation due to the Aboriginal people of Western Australia who helped build that state. Other states need to follow the Western Australian government’s leadership and investigate these issues.
I also think the Commonwealth needs to look to itself and to its records, because the Commonwealth knew something of this. Some of the evidence indicates that the Commonwealth was advising states—in particular my home state of Western Australia—about how to avoid giving all the child endowment and other payments that were due to Aboriginal people. The Commonwealth also needs to look at its own records to see if it has a case to answer. As yet I have not heard the Commonwealth acknowledge that that is an issue and that it also needs to take some action. So I ask Senator Brandis to, if possible, also raise that issue with the minister.
As Senator Bartlett indicated, last week in Melbourne Dr Ros Kidd launched the report Hard labour, stolen wages in Melbourne. I would like to remind people of what we are talking about here by quoting the speech she gave at the launch:
We are a wealthy nation today in large part because for decades we did not pay those workers whose labour was said, again and again, to be essential to the pastoral industry on which our national development prospered. We are a wealthy nation today in large part because governments around Australia used the savings and entitlements of Aboriginal families for their own profit. We are a wealthy nation today. We have a budget surplus of $17.3 billion. Please read this National Report. Please urge others to read it. Please join the fight to force the men in charge to settle this long overdue debt.
I think that sums it up: Australia was built on the back of the work of these people.
White people—non-Indigenous people—whom they worked alongside have prospered. They have built houses. They have managed to create wealth for their families. Continuing generations of people have prospered and live much better lives than the Aboriginal people whose wages were stolen. If the wages that they earned had been paid to them in the first place imagine how that money could have been invested and what it could have done for the circumstances of those people and their families now.
This is an issue that needs urgent attention because these people are passing on. During the inquiry, one of the senior elders of the Kimberley who is affected by this actually passed on. This is so relevant to people’s lives right now and can make such a difference. As I said, I welcome Senator Brandis’s commitment to follow this up, but I add this plea: could the government also look at the Commonwealth’s role, what it knew and whether perhaps the Commonwealth, even to a small degree, has a role to play in helping to recompense peoples whose entitlements were stolen.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Responses to Senate Resolutions</title>,Documents,11,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-09-10,"—On the same topic, I wish to support and endorse the remarks of the three senators who preceded me—Senator Bartlett, Senator Brandis and Senator Siewert. Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, I would like to direct a request to Senator Brandis—in view of the commitment he has just given—that anyone who has had their wages stolen, particularly when they were below the age of maturity, should be the subject of government attention in the manner and with the feeling that Senator Brandis has described. In these remarks, I refer to the over 500,000 children who were institutionalised in the last century. There were three cohorts: firstly, the Indigenous Australian children; secondly, the foreign children, who were the smallest group, of British, Irish and Maltese migrants; and, thirdly, and the largest group, Australian non-Indigenous non-foreign children. There were over 500,000 children. Vast numbers of children were used as employees. Their wages were supposed to be paid into trust funds and many of them did not receive their due recompense.
This matter was first referred to during the Senate Community Affairs References Committee inquiry into child migrants, the report of which is entitled Lost innocents: righting the record. It contained unanimous recommendations, and the issue of stolen wages was raised therein. I make these remarks so that Senator Brandis can note that the issue does not just apply to Indigenous children and adults, as important as that is. Whoever had this happen to them should, I think, have restitution and inquiry made on their behalf. I urge the government to take that up if they are of a mind to look at this issue in the depth and with the seriousness that Senator Brandis indicated.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2007-09-10,"—I present the third progress report of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on reforms to Australia’s military justice system.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
The Senate will be familiar with the engagement of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade in reviewing the implementation of reforms to Australia’s military justice system. This stems from our initial report on this issue, containing some 40 recommendations, which was presented to the Senate in June 2005. The government tabled its response to that report in October 2005. In all, it accepted, in whole or in part—or in principle, in some cases—30 of the committee’s 40 recommendations. It indicated at the same time that, where those recommendations could not be accepted, alternative solutions would be found to achieve the intent—I believe that was the turn of phrase—of the committee’s recommendations.
The government at the time gave Defence approximately two years to implement those recommendations and enhancements. Defence was to report to the Senate committee twice a year through that implementation period. In April 2006 the committee received from the Chief of the Defence Force the first progress report on the implementation progress. We responded to that both by taking evidence at a committee hearing and by a close consideration of the report. It was clear to us at the time, and gratifyingly so, that the ADF was demonstrating a very clear commitment to improving Australia’s military justice system. We were able to note positive observations of the Defence Force Ombudsman and his role in the area. We were also able to note that we were particularly impressed with the work of the Inspector-General of the ADF and the role that he was carrying out.
We noted in that inaugural progress report that we had remaining concerns about the culture which prevailed in the ADF and its capacity to potentially undermine the success of the reform process. We were very careful to note that we thought a real shift was necessary in attitudes of ADF personnel so that lasting change—not just changes to process and procedure—could be achieved. We are pleased to say that, since that time, we have considered a second progress report, tabled at the end of last year, and that Defence has published a number of major reports which have had a particular impact on and relevance to Australia’s military justice system. They are referred to briefly in this report.
This is our third progress report. In view of the questions taken on notice and the consideration of earlier reports, the committee has decided to table a relatively brief report on this occasion. We did not hold a public hearing in this case. We have noted that it is our view that it is still a little too early to examine and report on progress towards implementing changes as a result of a range of new recommendations, some of which stem from a number of the reports I just referred to. But we have had recent advice from Defence about a number of reviews which will be undertaken in relation to these reforms, and we have noted those for the record in the committee’s report. We have requested from Defence copies of those reviews when they are finalised, and we look forward to receiving them in due course. Of course, the committee is simultaneously engaged in reviewing some of the legislation that pertains to this reform process, and there have been public hearings in recent weeks—last week in relation to the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 2007.
I want to note a couple of the responses the committee received to written questions on notice which pertained to the 2006 inquiry into the learning culture in ADF schools and training establishments. We were seeking some clarity from Defence around observations made by the inquiry team in relation to the status, if you like, of the learning culture within the ADF. The clarifications provided by Defence helped us in some cases, but in others, I must say, we reiterate our earlier concerns in relation to cultural matters. If issues of culture are not addressed at the learning end of the ADF, then they have an enormous potential to be inculcated throughout the life of those who are starting at that learning point. So we have been very concerned to review these and to examine critically the work of the inquiry team. We found the report of the learning culture inquiry to be very valuable to our considerations. We have said—and it will come as no surprise to Defence—that as a committee, where it is appropriate, we will continue to monitor Defence’s endeavours to change those aspects of its culture that still have the capacity to undermine the major success of the reforms to the military justice system.
We also place on notice in this report that we wish to pursue at a later date the inquiry processes into the very tragic death of Trooper Angus Lawrence. This matter was raised briefly at the public hearing on 26 February and we took evidence about it. Again, the issue concerning the committee was the problem of perceptions of bias which have the capacity to undermine the integrity of the administrative inquiry process. We think it is possible to do more to eliminate those perceptions, and we have made some observations in that regard. I know that there are matters of ongoing concern within ADF as part of this process. We will be interested to see how those matters are progressed.
In conclusion, I want to note a recent report by the Defence Force Ombudsman which relates to the management of complaints about unacceptable behaviour within the ADF. This report was published in June this year. Overall it found:
The information gathered in this investigation supports the view that Defence currently provides an effective complaint-management mechanism that ADF members can readily access. We observed that ADF members consider there have been improvements in the complaint-handling process in recent years and that members have a reasonable level of confidence in the complaints system.
We do welcome these particular findings, and they do strengthen earlier observations of the Defence Force Ombudsman. The ombudsman also made 15 further recommendations, which are intended to enhance the current management system. Given that they are based on suggestions made by members of the ADF—and they relate to areas like record keeping, training, reporting and data collection, the role of inquiry officers and equity advisers and quality assurance—we hope that, given Defence’s agreement to all of those recommendations, progress can be made in those areas. We will further consider the ombudsman’s report in our next review.
At this stage we have identified a couple of other matters contained in that report which we think need to be underlined. They are questions about fear of reprisal; that is, how ADF members feel they will be treated if they lodge a complaint of unacceptable behaviour. I do not hold for a minute that this is confined to the Australian Defence Force but, in an environment of that nature, it is obviously very important to address these concerns. We note that concern, and we note that the ombudsman suggests that Defence may want to conduct additional research in that area. We will be interested to see that progress.
There were also references to deficiencies in record keeping in relation to the management and investigation of complaints about unacceptable behaviour. Record keeping generally, and in relation to this area specifically, has been raised on previous occasions, and we will take these matters up with Defence in due course. There are a number of other issues under consideration by the committee currently. We have not really had the opportunity to canvass those properly at the committee level or specifically with Defence, so it was not considered appropriate in this report to pursue them. We will take those issues up in due course.
I particularly want to thank the Chief of the Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, for his support in this process and for the particular engagement he has taken on this reform process. I also want to thank Rear Admiral Mark Bonser and his officers for their assistance in the committee’s efforts in this area. And, of course, I thank my secretariat.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-09-10,"—It certainly does not worry me. I think they deal with the same issues and seek to do the same thing. We can put the question separately at the end and I imagine the outcome will be exactly the same. But, just to remind the chamber and those following this debate, the amendment currently before the chamber is Democrat amendment (5), which seeks to make issues relating to the citizenship test and the questions within it and processes surrounding it disallowable instruments. I want to reinforce the point that this citizenship test and its contents are important in terms of the long-term credibility of the test and therefore the long-term credibility of citizenship.
As I was saying before we were interrupted by question time, there is a very understandable apprehension amongst a minority within the community that there is potential down the track for the test to be misused by future governments and for it to be shaped in a way where it can be exclusionary and targeted at individual groups. That is a very real fear. I believe it is one that is totally understandable, particularly given Australia’s history, going back many years; many people, particularly migrants, know that Australia has done that in the past. So we need to put in place some mechanisms to protect against misuse of the test in the future.
I do not believe that enabling the test to be a disallowable instrument is a major impediment. The minister in his earlier contribution today suggested it would create uncertainty. For those who are not aware, the process of disallowance is that an instrument is gazetted, it is tabled in parliament, it can become operational from when it is gazetted or tabled, and the parliament and the Senate have the opportunity over the next 15 sitting days to move a disallowance motion to negate that legislative instrument—in this case, the citizenship test. There are two aspects. Firstly, it would require the test to be made public, which I think is an eminently sensible and desirable thing for the credibility of the test. Indeed, that was reflected and agreed on by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, including by government members of the committee, in one of their recommendations. Secondly, it would also provide a mechanism for the parliament, if it perceived there was a serious problem with aspects of the test or the processes surrounding it, to disallow it. I do not see why that would be a major impediment or how it would create massive uncertainty.
As senators would know, every day a list of legislative instruments is tabled in this place. After a few non-sitting weeks we get a very long list. The list of documents, which was tabled in this place today, is 23 pages long. There are 23 pages containing the titles of legislative instruments which have been tabled in the last couple of weeks. As a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances I see literally thousands of legislative instruments—I must confess I do not read them all—tabled each year. Most of them have the potential to be disallowed. Each one has the potential to be introduced and become operational and, if the Senate should then decide to disallow it, to become no longer operational. That is the nature of disallowance and disallowable instruments. To say that that then creates uncertainty is to say that having legislative instruments creates potential uncertainty. Every single one of them has that uncertainty.
You have uncertainty if you introduce legislation and it then gets amended. If there is sufficient concern about starting to put that law or that test into operation and then having to stop putting it into operation once it is disallowed, then there is a very easy mechanism around that: you just do not make it operational until the time for disallowance has expired. It is a simple thing to do and it is done from time to time. It is simply a furphy to say, ‘If you make them disallowable instruments, it creates too much uncertainty and you may have a test coming in, then going out and all those sorts of things,’ and it is not a good enough reason to not have that protection in place.
As the minister would know, I would expect—and I am sure most senators would know—out of those literally thousands of legislative instruments, the number that have actually been disallowed has been minimal, even when the government did not have control of the Senate. It is obviously extremely minimal now they have control of the Senate. They do not disallow anything; they do not support any disallowance motions. But, even including the time when the government did not have control of the Senate and disallowance motions were moved from time to time—even attempts to disallow are extremely rare—I would say, off the top of my head, that the number which have successfully been disallowed every year for the last decade or more would be in single figures. It is extremely rare. Less than 0.1 per cent of all legislative instruments get disallowed. It is that last-resort safety net, it is that final bit of protection, it is that accountability mechanism, it is that oversight. As with many accountability mechanisms and many processes that enable oversight, the fact that the oversight is there is as important as how often it is used.
It is like any other piece of accountability: if you know that if you do something outrageous there is a chance you will be stopped then you are far less likely to do something outrageous in the first place. If you know you have open slather to do whatever you want then there is a much greater temptation down the track—whether for political reasons, administrative convenience, covering up a mistake or whatever it might be—to undertake that extra action that you should not, which will have a negative impact. It is simply human nature. It is not a politically partisan statement. If you know you have total power, without any sort of effective mechanism, then there is more scope for it to be used inappropriately, wrongfully or in an unhelpful or damaging way.
Making any instrument a legislative instrument is a valuable safety net, and making it disallowable is not a major drama. For all intents and purposes, 99.9 per cent of the time it will just mean one more title in the long list of legislative instruments tabled by the Clerk that is put on our desks every day. It would mean little more than that, and few of us would even read them. But someone will read and check it; if there is a problem they will let someone else know; and the accountability mechanism is there. To not have that mechanism increases the chances of tests being misused down the track by a future government. It also tends to reinforce the apprehension and suspicion of some within the community that there is some other agenda here or that there is a potential for a citizenship test to be used in an exclusionary fashion.
It is much easier to reassure people that these citizenship tests are benign if people can see what is in them and if they also know there is an accountability mechanism in place. If you are putting in place a mechanism that just gives open powers to any future minister then it becomes that much harder to reassure people. I urge this amendment on the committee because I think it is a valuable one that I do not think would detract in any way from the effective operation of the responsible citizenship test well into the future, even if personally I am not convinced that such a test is needed.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT (CITIZENSHIP TESTING) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2007-09-10,"—It is worth reiterating where we are now at: we are debating in committee the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Testing) Bill 2007 and specifically Democrats amendment (5). At the heart of this matter is what the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs recommended, which is that the proposed citizenship test questions be tabled in parliament. It seems that the Democrats have proposed a sensible solution to the problem—that you use a legislative instrument to effect that recommendation.
The government should not be afraid of using legislative instruments; it should not be concerned about it. The Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances will oversee regulations that engage such legislative instruments. The government should not be afraid of scrutiny. The government should not be concerned that the process allows people to have a look at matters such as this to ensure that it meets the commitment and that it continues on an ongoing basis to meet the requirements under the legislation. On balance it seems to me that the government is trying to walk away from oversight. It is not major oversight; it is sensible oversight that the Democrats are proposing. That is why Labor supports this amendment. It reflects not only the Senate committee’s recommendations but also Labor’s view that the questions should be publicly available.
In the current scheme of things the government does have the majority in the House. If the government does not like the matters and is concerned then it can oppose any disallowance motion and win that debate. But a disallowance motion is really the end point. If you look at the way the Senate works, not a lot of disallowance motions are raised in the first instance. But, if you are concerned about that, you are really concerned about the end product, the end of the road. You should be more worried about ensuring that you get it right. In that way you should not be concerned about oversight, because if you get it right then the matter will not get to that end point. You will not end up having to be concerned about whether a disallowance motion is passed.
The Temporary Chairman, Senator Watson, runs the Regulations and Ordinances Committee admirably, as I understand it. There he occasionally puts disallowance motions on matters but then comes back in after consultation with the minister and has those motions removed because the consultative process has fixed any problems. What concerns me is that, in terms of oversight, scrutiny and public availability of documents, this is an admission by this government that it wants to walk away from it all or that it is afraid of it—I am not sure which. The government set up the process with good legislation, which was supported by Labor, to allow legislative instruments to be utilised in this place and now wants to walk away from those commitments. It does not want to use the Regulations and Ordinances Committee, which has been in place since 1932, to oversight its legislation and ensure it meets necessary commitments. I guess we will hear the answer from the minister. But let us not hear, ‘We simply don’t like the process,’ or ‘It’s not going to meet our commitments’; let us hear an appropriate response that says more than simply that.
I am happy to have the cognate debate with Senator Nettle’s foreshadowed amendment and then split the question. Senator Nettle’s amendment that I suspect she will move reads:
A determination made under subsection (1) is a legislative instrument and a question within a test, or a component of a test is deemed to be provisions within the meaning of section 42 of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 and is subject to disallowance.
On that basis it seems to be very similar to the Democrats’ amendment currently before the chair, and the comments I have just made are germane to Senator Nettle’s foreshadowed amendment in any event. I do not want to prolong the debate, but the government needs to not only justify why not but also demonstrate why their system will provide a better oversight.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT (CITIZENSHIP TESTING) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2007-09-10,"—I agree with Senator Ludwig that the issues which relate to this are very similar to proposed Greens amendment (1). The remarks I make on behalf of the government about the Democrat amendment are similar to those about Senator Nettle’s proposed amendment.
In relation to this amendment, the government does not believe that the determination which is made by the minister, which will approve the content of the new citizenship test and include the test questions, should be subject to the disallowance provisions of the Legislative Instruments Act. I said earlier that this could breed some degree of uncertainty. You could have people sitting a certain test in a certain form one month and it could be disallowed the next month and they would have to go back and sit a different test, or people applying the next month could have a different test under which to apply.
As well as that, I will add to my previous argument and say that the determination does not fall within the meaning of a legislative instrument as defined by section 5 of the Legislative Instruments Act. It is not of a legislative character, and that is because it will not determine the law or alter the content of the law. Even if you do think it should be a determination as such, it does not fall within the definition contained in section 5. So there is both a policy reason and a more legalistic reason, if you like, that the government relies on for this—and quite properly so. I think that what you have to look at is the determination and how it will function. You will have attachment A and attachment B. Attachment A will have the form of the test and the way it will be conducted. Attachment B will have the questions. Attachment A will be released publicly, and that will be open to public purview. So that is the form of the test, the rules, how it will be conducted and things of that nature. The part that will not be released, as we have said publicly before, on the record, is the part which deals with the questions that will be in the test, and that is attachment B. We have said that for a policy reason. We do not believe that releasing the questions would achieve the purpose we are setting out to achieve here. What you would have is a set of questions released publicly, and doing that would alert people to the questions. You would have rote learning, not a more genuine understanding of the issues and those aspects of citizenship that we want people to understand when they apply to become an Australian citizen.
Certainly the format and how it is run will all be in attachment A, which will be made public. But to make it a determination which is a legislative instrument, we believe, would not be appropriate, because it would have that uncertainty. More importantly, it simply does not fit the meaning of a legislative instrument as defined by section 5 of the Legislative Instruments Act. I think that that reinforces the government’s position. As I say, this is very similar to the Greens amendment. The government opposes Democrat amendment (5) on the basis of what I have outlined and, for similar reasons, would oppose Greens amendment (1).",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT (CITIZENSHIP TESTING) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2007-09-10,"—I want to indicate that I will not proceed with the Australian Greens amendment, because the Democrats have said that effectively they will be doing the same thing, which is to seek to make the questions within the citizenship test a disallowable instrument—that is, to allow the parliament to see what the proposed questions for the citizenship test are. The Greens think this is an important oversight role that parliament needs to, and can, play. It is about ensuring that the questions are appropriate—whilst recognising, as I have said previously, that the Greens do not support the citizenship test, because we do not think it will achieve the government’s objectives in relation to this.
In particular, we do not support what is proposed in relation to how it should work, which is that the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship has complete say over what the questions are. There are a number of examples you could point to. You could ask the question: ‘What do people in Australia think of the colour pink?’ You could put it in any absurd way and say, ‘I don’t know that that is really an appropriate question.’ People might think that the minister will not do that, but I would look at the sample questions we have already been given in the draft document in relation to the citizenship test—I do not think they are outrageous questions in the way that it might be to say, ‘What do we think of the colour pink?’ but I cannot see that knowing the floral emblem of Australia indicates you are going to obey the laws in Australia, respect Australian values and understand what it is like to be in the culture here. It might mean that you know something about Australia—and, yes, that is good; we do not have a problem with that—but I do not see how, in terms of the government’s objective around this legislation, the citizenship test will ensure that people who come to Australia will respect Australia and the way of life here. You could be a mass murderer; you could be a person with really evil intentions and still happen to know what the floral emblem is. I do not see how knowing the first line of the national anthem or what day Australia Day is indicates that you are going to be a valuable citizen. There are many people who have made really fantastic contributions as citizens in Australia over the years who may not know the answers to these questions. I do not think that that somehow diminishes the value of the contributions they have made here in Australia.
It is not outrageous to say that we should see these questions to see whether they are appropriate. It is not as though I am proposing that the minister is going to do something outrageous; I just do not see what the questions add. I am not claiming they are outrageous; I am just saying that I cannot see how learning the answers to these questions indicates that you are not going to be a valued, contributing citizen.
I imagine that probably everybody in this chamber could point to people they know who are valued contributing citizens, be they celebrities that we know of who do not speak English all that well or the people around the corner who run the local grocery store who have really contributed to our community. They may not know the answers to these questions, but that does not diminish the contribution that they have to make. That really sits at the heart of the Greens’ concerns in relation to the citizenship test.
I am quite happy to support the objectives the government says are behind this. I absolutely support improving the English language skills of migrants. That is why I moved a second reading amendment about expanding the English language program for migrants. I think we should do that. I think it is great that the government increased funding for that in the last budget. I totally support that. I totally support people understanding what life in Australia is like. But I do not think that the two objectives that the government put forward are going to be achieved through this test. That is essentially why the Greens are not supporting this test.
This particular amendment—which is similar to the amendment proposed by the Australian Greens—is about the parliament having some oversight of this. Deciding who can and who cannot be a citizen of this country is a very significant decision. What this legislation is proposing is that the test that determines who can or cannot be a citizen should not come before the parliament. I think if we are going to set a standard measure on something as significant as who should or should not become a citizen—which is what this test is proposing—the parliament should have some oversight and some say in that standard framework, and there should be some transparency.
Where it is an individual decision, the minister is in a good position to be able to do that, but that is not what is being proposed here. It is a standard, across-the-board mechanism for determining who should or should not become a citizen. I think it is a really fundamental thing in our society to decide who should or should not become a citizen. I think it is core business of the parliament to have some oversight of that, which is why I am so concerned about this particular amendment which says that the minister is the only person to determine that. Okay, if it is a one-off decision, I can see an argument for that. But this is not a one-off decision; this is an across-the-board mechanism for deciding who should or should not be able to become citizens. It is a fundamental component.
Other countries around the world put things like that into their constitutions to determine who should or should not be able to become a citizen of their country. I am not advocating that, but I am using that as an example of how important other countries think that it is to decide who can or cannot become a citizen of their country. That is why I think this amendment is so important. This amendment is saying that the parliament, as the elected representatives of people in this country, should have some say in the standard test the government is proposing to apply to all people to determine who should or should not be a citizen.
I do not think it is a very big ask at all that we in the parliament should have some oversight of that, and that is why the Greens support this amendment. That is why we proposed a similar one ourselves that I indicate I will not move, because we are having the debate here about the way in which this should be determined. When I look at that series of questions, I just cannot see how being able to answer those questions means that you are going to be a contributing citizen. You may be able to answer those questions and be a contributing citizen, but I do not think that being able to answer those questions proves that you are going to be a contributing citizen.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2007-09-10,"—I move opposition amendment (1) on sheet 5346:
(1)    Schedule 1, item 5, page 5 (after line 17), at the end of section 23A, add:
         (8)    The Minister must cause an independent and comprehensive review of the operation of the citizen testing regime to be completed by August 2010 to:
              (a)    gauge its impact on citizenship application and conferral rates in all applicant categories; and
              (b)    specifically examine the citizenship test regime’s impact on citizenship application and conferral rates on persons seeking to enter Australia and become Australian citizens through refugee and humanitarian provisions.
         (9)    The person or organisation undertaking the review must give the Minister a written report of the review.
       (10)    The Minister must cause a copy of the report to be presented in both Houses of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of receiving the report.
I note the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs made several key recommendations following its inquiry into the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Testing) Bill 2007. The committee recommended that the operation of the citizenship testing regime be reviewed three years after the bill’s commencement, particularly in order to gauge the regime’s impact on citizenship application and conferral rates, and how it is impacting upon groups within our society, particularly the refugee and humanitarian entrants.
As the government would know and the Senate may know, there is a high correlation between humanitarian entrants and their ability to pick up citizenship at the expiration of the humanitarian visa. Of course, that has now been extended to four years, but there is a high uptake of citizenship amongst that group for a range of very good reasons that are reflected in that group. From what I have been led to believe, they are appreciative of the ability to be able to start a new life in Australia and recognise the value embodied in Australian citizenship.
A concern that a review could also look at would be where there may not be a high uptake in citizenship in some groups. All that can be looked at. The government has indicated there will be a review, but Labor thinks that the ability to have a review should be embodied in the legislation itself. It is not unusual, because the government has acceded to those requests in the past, for a review to be contained in the legislation itself. Labor’s amendment also sets out the areas that should be looked at. What can sometimes happen down the track—say, three years hence—is that we lose sight of what the review should encompass. But if you set out the parameters now and leave sufficient scope to add to them if necessary then you have a basis not only to look at now but to continue to look at and then finally review in three years time.
The Labor amendment says, ‘The Minister must cause an independent and comprehensive review of the operation of the citizenship testing regime to be completed by August 2010.’ I think it is necessary to have that element of independence about the citizenship testing regime. It is also necessary to gauge its impact on citizenship applications and to specifically examine the citizenship testing regime’s impact on citizenship application and conferral rates on persons. Those rates could be provided and the review could then be tabled. It would be helpful if this parliament would set out that course of action rather than simply conduct the more generic three-year review promised by the government.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-09-10,"—I briefly indicate the Democrats’ willingness to support this. I think that it would at least provide some mechanism for review. As I have said in some of my previous contributions, obviously the test itself and how it operates is at the heart of the credibility of this whole process. I repeat my apprehension that there is potential for the credibility of Australian citizenship in general to be degraded if the test does not operate effectively and is seen to be problematic in some way or other. I am not convinced, and I still have not heard any evidence in this debate or elsewhere, as to why the test is even needed, but if we are going to have it then we should at least have more reliable mechanisms for ensuring that there is oversight and review. Assertions or pledges now from the minister—sincere though I am sure they are—are not sufficient to bind any future minister.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT (CITIZENSHIP TESTING) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2007-09-10,"—Just for the record, the government oppose this amendment, and the reason for that is that the minister has given an undertaking that there will be a formal review in three years time.

We think that it is better to develop the terms of reference when you have the review, when it would be more relevant to the times, rather than formulating them at this stage when we still do not know how it will pan out. The government oppose this amendment on that basis.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2007-09-10,"—I rise to speak on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Protecting Services for Rural and Regional Australia into the Future) Bill 2007. The bill seeks to protect the $2 billion Communications Fund, the pork-barrelling slush fund that was established by the government in September 2005 under pressure from the National Party in response to the privatisation of Telstra. The Communications Fund was intended to earn an income stream to finance spending on telecommunications projects in Australia. The projects are supposed to come from the government’s response to any recommendations proposed by the Regional Telecommunications Independent Review Committee. Despite the fact that the fund was established in 2005, the first report was not due until 2008—that is, until the government went into full panic mode and brought forward the review committee report, announcing on 13 August that it would start immediately.
Senator Barnaby Joyce was the man who christened the Communications Fund a slush fund—and proudly so, as this was his prize for selling out the people of Queensland after he promised them that he would oppose the sale of Telstra. This was his slush fund. Senator Barnaby Joyce, along with many other members of the National Party—who have realised that political expediency is yet again failing to deliver broadband to millions of regional and rural Australians—have demanded that the review committee start immediately so that they can get a few photo opportunities between now and the federal election. No-one should be under any illusions: the recommendations that will come forward over the next few weeks will be nothing more than pork-barrelling and photo opportunities for a panicked National Party, which has been involved in a tawdry process from day one when it comes to the sale of Telstra.
This new legislation quarantines the $2 billion capital of the Communications Fund. If passed, only the interest earned on the $2 billion fund may be used to improve the state of telecommunication services in rural, regional and remote Australia. This will result in up to $400 million every three years to ensure that telecommunication services in rural, regional and remote Australia keep pace with the rest of the nation. Just in case the National Party cannot add up, subtract or divide, let me be clear about this: the price of the National Party’s votes was $133 million per annum. I am looking forward to the contribution of Senator Fiona Nash, who is here in the chamber today, as she tries to explain why the National Party went so cheap that it sold out for $133 million per annum. That was the National Party’s price for selling out millions of regional and rural Australians and their ability to get decent telecommunications and broadband. This amount is not enough to ensure telecommunication services in rural, regional and remote areas of Australia keep pace with the rest of the nation.
Does the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts believe that this amount is enough to ensure that the intent of the Communications Fund is met? Is $133 million a year enough to provide adequate broadband to millions of regional and rural Australians? Is it enough to ensure that Australians living in rural, regional and remote areas have access to affordable, reliable and up-to-date telecommunication services into the future? Labor—and, indeed, some of the government’s own senators—do not believe so. That is right: this may come as a surprise but some of the government’s own senators do not believe that this legislation is worth while. The truth is that the legislation will not improve telecommunication services in rural, regional and remote Australia. If it would do so, the government’s own backbenchers would have recommended a vote for it in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. Let me be clear: the government’s own senators—your own senators, Senator Nash—did not recommend a vote for this legislation in the Senate committee report. The truth is that this legislation will not improve telecommunication services in rural, regional and remote Australia.
This legislation is another sign of the Howard government’s desperate politics. It is a political stunt with the intended aim of highlighting the fact that Labor will use the Communications Fund to provide investment capital to build a national broadband network. This is a national broadband network that will benefit all Australians. This is a national broadband network that will ensure Australia’s future prosperity. Rather than governing in the national interest, the government prefers to attack Labor for showing leadership and solving the broadband problems that continue to plague our country.
—How can you say that with a straight face!
—Over the past 11 years the Howard government has proposed 18—that is right: 18—bandaid broadband solutions. How proud you must be, Senator Nash, of your 17th and 18th plans which you have just announced in the shadows of an election—11 years and we have our 17th and 18th broadband plans! Not one of these piecemeal attempts will ensure Australians living in rural, regional and remote Australia have access to high-speed internet. The introduction of this legislation clearly shows that the Howard government is once again, with the connivance of the National Party, abandoning rural, regional and remote Australians.

Senator Nash interjecting—

—If only you had had the courage, Senator Nash, to stand up for your principles, to stand up for your fibre proposal the Page Foundation recommended, you might not be getting the reaction out there in regional and rural Australia that you are getting.
 (Senator Forshaw)—And, Senator Conroy, if only you would direct those remarks through the chair you could continue!
—I accept your admonishment. I have been unduly provoked by Senator Nash’s interjections! Labor believes that this is not good enough and strongly opposes this bill—and so should other senators who believe that all Australians, no matter where they live, should have access to the best available telecommunication infrastructure. Australia does not need another set of patchwork broadband solutions. Australia needs to invest in a national broadband network that will ensure everyone, no matter where they live, has high-speed internet connections. That is why Labor will use the capital of the Communications Fund to help build a state-of-the-art national broadband network that promises to turn around Australia’s poor broadband performance.
Let me remind you that, after 11 years of the Howard government, the state of telecommunication infrastructure and services has suffered. Our ageing infrastructure continues to lag further and further behind countries we consider our international peers. Currently, Australia is ranked just 16th out of 30 countries regularly surveyed by the OECD. The Howard government may think this is good enough but, let me tell you, Australians do not. Over the past 11 years the Howard government has taken a haphazard, pork-barrelling approach to changing the state of broadband services. To date 18 different broadband plans have been proposed, at a cost in excess of $4 billion—rising to nearly $5 billion with the signing of the OPEL contract. How proud the senators on the other side of the chamber must be! Nearly $5 billion, and what will you have to show for it? A clapped-out, obsolete wireless network. Congratulations; you must be proud! Not one of these plans has managed to address the poor quality of telecommunication infrastructure to ensure our broadband performance is turned around—not one of these plans! Australians deserve better. Australians need a government who puts the national interest first rather than one whose sole aim is to get through an election year.
Contrary to the Howard government, Labor recognises that it is imperative that we invest in telecommunication services to enable the full potential of the information superhighway to be reached. Labor understands the benefits of high-speed broadband infrastructure and the impact it will have on Australia’s future. The increased connectivity from vastly improved telco services will ensure future prosperity for all Australians. True broadband services will allow small and medium businesses to compete in both national and international arenas, increasing productivity gains and opportunities. New markets will be created, resulting in more jobs for Australians. A study by the New South Wales government has shown that true broadband would boost the state economy by up to $1.4 billion. A similar study in Queensland has shown productivity returns of up to $4 billion. The Victorian state government anticipates that broadband will boost the state economy by $15 billion over the next decade. But none of these calculations was based on a clapped-out, obsolete old fixed wireless network.
The potential for broadband is enormous. New services will change the way we lead our lives. E-health will revolutionise the health care sector, enhance patient services and ultimately save lives. E-education promises to enhance learning opportunities for primary, secondary and tertiary students and beyond. These services will benefit all Australians, particularly those in rural, regional and remote Australia. Broadband promises to overcome the tyranny of distance, which up until now has inhibited the potential of many Australians, socially and economically. However, Labor recognises that the full potential of the enhanced services offered by broadband will only be achieved by investing in state-of-the-art communications infrastructure. And let me make it very clear: the best technology, which under Labor’s broadband plan will be available to at least 98 per cent of Australians, is a fibre-to-the-node network.

Senator Nash interjecting—

—And let us be clear—because I accept that last interjection from Senator Nash, being provocative again—that this is the sort of proposal that Senator Nash herself signed up to, that she herself put her name to with the Page Foundation. How galling it must be to have not been able to convince her own colleagues to adopt her own idea and then to watch as Labor receives applause and plaudits from around the country for having the courage and initiative to go for a national high-speed fibre network. Her own colleagues rejected it. She was dismissed with a simple ‘The government will look at it’—not that they ever did. For nearly 12 months I asked the department at Senate estimates whether they had looked at the Page Foundation report. Not once did the department ever even bother to consider Senator Nash’s idea. How disappointing, how galling, how bitter it must be for Senator Nash!
We have only to look to the countries who continue to lead the way in telecommunications, including Japan and Korea, to see the countries that have invested in fibre technologies. No fixed wireless for them! Fibre-to-the-node networks offer minimum connection speeds over 40 times faster than today’s average—and I stress the word ‘minimum’. I know it is something that the minister has a lot of difficulty with. She cannot get the words ‘up to’ out. She will keep misleading the Australian public about the speeds and the coverage. If you are listening, Senator Coonan, just make sure that you put the words ‘up to’ in. I know you are not engaged in trade in commerce; otherwise Graeme Samuel would have fined you by now.
Fibre-to-the-node networks are future proof. They scale in ways that alternative technologies just cannot. Over time, they can be easily upgraded to cope with the ever-increasing demand for bandwidth. Fibre-to-the-node infrastructure is an investment. It is not a quick-fix solution. It is more costly to deploy than cheaper, less scalable alternatives. Nevertheless, the government should stand up and meet the challenge of deploying a fibre-to-the-node network across Australia.
To achieve this Australia needs a government that is prepared to invest in telco infrastructure, and oversee the deployment of a national broadband network. Australia needs a Rudd Labor government. A Rudd Labor government will use the Communications Fund to enable all Australians to have access to vastly improved telecommunication services. Labor will deliver a fibre-to-the-node service that will deliver guaranteed minimum—again I stress ‘minimum’—connection speeds that are 40 times faster than today’s average to 98 per cent of Australians. The remaining two per cent of Australians will receive a standard of service which—depending on the available technology, including fixed line, wireless or satellite—will be as close as possible to that provided by the new network. Labor’s new network will have open access. This will promote competition and drive consumer prices downward.
Labor’s carefully costed fibre-to-the-node network is based on a detailed calculation of the number of nodes required to reach 98 per cent of Australians. This includes the number of upgrades of exchanges and pillars into nodes that are required. To deliver the national broadband network Labor will use a $4.7 billion public equity injection, which includes the $2 billion asset in the Communications Fund. Under Labor’s network the Communications Fund will be used to achieve the aim for which it was intended. ‘To future proof’ were the famous words—bandaids worth $133 million. Labor will build a network that is actually future proofed, when it puts the fibre in the ground, just as Senator Nash and the Page Foundation recommended all those years ago.
Labor’s broadband network will ensure that Australians living in rural, regional and remote areas have access to affordable, reliable and up-to-date telecommunication services into the future. The national broadband network will ensure Australians living in rural and regional areas will have not just metro-comparable pricing—the bauble that the National Party and the National Farmers Federation rolled over to endorse—but also parity of service. This is in stark contrast to the Howard government, who prefer to insist on a two-tier system. Some Australians living in metropolitan areas—and we do not know who, judging by the incredibly vague and highly criticised guidelines—will have access to a fibre-to-the-node network. The remainder of the population, including those in rural, regional and remote Australia, will have to put up with a second-rate system. The second-rate system is based on the government’s favourite technology, fixed wireless WiMAX. This technology is widely regarded by industry experts as obsolete.
Under ideal conditions fixed wireless WiMAX will allow broadband speeds up to—there are those words again; ‘up to’—20 times faster than today’s average, but in reality the technology is plagued with a number of issues. Firstly, the connections speeds are shared. These things work according to the laws of physics—for Senator Nash’s and the Senate’s interest—and no amount of spin by Senator Nash when she speaks next, or jawboning by Senator Coonan, when she eventually turns up in the chamber for her own bill, will get away from the laws of physics. The laws of physics say that with wireless the further you stand away from the tower the slower the speeds and the more people using the connection at the same time the slower the speeds. Senator Nash might sit there making notes and trying to rewrite the laws of physics but it is just not going to wash. The laws of physics are the laws of physics and there is nowhere to go.
The connection speeds, as I said, are shared, meaning that the average speeds for Australians living in the outer suburbs of the major cities, as well as for those living in rural and regional areas, will only be double today’s average. So, when you hear the words ‘I’ll deliver you 12 meg in the bush,’ just remember that the average speed that they will be able to deliver over this network, if they are lucky, is double what you get today. Congratulations to Senator Nash and the National Party! As I said, the connection speeds depend on the distance from the tower. In fact, the Optus-Elders consortium, OPEL, who were awarded the grant to build the new network, have acknowledged this in their press release. You will not hear this from the other side of the chamber. The consortium say:
Actual speeds will vary due to various factors such as distance from the base station, selected service, customer equipment and general internet traffic.
There it is in black and white. OPEL have to tell the truth. I know that Senator Nash is not going to, but OPEL have to. (Time expired)

Leave granted.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PROTECTING SERVICES FOR RURAL AND REGIONAL AUSTRALIA INTO THE FUTURE) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2007-09-10,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

The Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Protecting Services for Rural and Regional Australia into the Future) Bill 2007 ensures that the $2 billion principal of the Communications Fund—part of the proceeds of the final tranche of Telstra’s sell-off—is maintained as a perpetual fund.
The $2 billion is under management and invested in short term, low risk assets. The earnings on investments are made available at around $130 million a year to fund infrastructure for broadband, additional mobile telephone towers and backhaul fibre capabilities to rural communities.
According to the government, it enables the Commonwealth to implement responses to recommendations made by the Regional Telecommunications Independent Review Committee relating to the adequacy of telecommunication services in regional, rural or remote areas.
This is a very common approach of this government. It steers clear of guarantees of universal entitlements and instead drip feeds funds, mostly through grants to organisations in a patchwork of projects.
However, there is no overall plan and despite spending over $11 billion on telecommunications in rural Australia between 1997 and 2005 broadband services are still inadequate.
We said then and we say again now that there needs to be an audit of current fibre networks, a national plan and an adequate fund to roll broadband out.
We suggested that rather than use the $2 billion for infrastructure that it be used to maintain and upgrade services into the future.
Of course the commitment by the government at the last election was to not sell Telstra until rural service obligations and levels of service in rural areas were met. They were not acceptable when that last tranche was sold and they are still not acceptable.
But of course, as Minister McGauran admits, this bill is all about playing politics and a total waste of our time. It will obviously pass into law but as everyone knows, takes only a bill to repeal it which presumably the ALP will introduce as soon as it wins office.
The Government is quite open about it. This is to ensure that the Labor Party in office cannot, by ‘sleight of hand, or under cover of night’, abolish the Communications Fund.
Minister McGauran says if Labor wants to undo the legislation it will have to ‘do so in the full glare of public accountability’.
Well I suppose it will but would people in rural and regional areas prefer to wait for services while the interest of about $130 million a year is dribbled out for broadband or would they like the benefits of the full rollout as soon as possible.
In the full glare of the public gaze, as people despair at ever getting fast, affordable Internet services, I think they are likely to go for the latter.
The interest on this $2 billion was always going to be inadequate which may be why the government has only provided the woolliest idea of what these services are that the government is protecting or who will be entitled to them.
Like most politicians I receive a lot of correspondence from constituents on broadband. A tourist business in the Grampians (Royce Raleigh) said:
“We are disgusted that after all the publicity and advertising re Broadband in rural areas by both the Government and providers, that even while paying $49.50 per month, the best we can get in practice, is a Broadband service slower than Dial-up. When is the Government going to get fair dinkum and make Broadband /SP providers deliver the speeds that they advertise? When are we going to get the same Communication Technology that people in the city take for granted?
We have put up with bushfires and drought in the last 12 months. We are trying to run a business in a very busy Tourist area, with no mobile phone coverage and no Broadband service. We are getting more and more international guests, who comment and ask: ‘Why is the Internet so slow in Australia? Why is mobile phone coverage so poor?’ We can only respond that the government does not see it as priority for country people. When are we going to get some real communication?”
In another instance an Albury-based businessman located in a regional hub with close to 100,000 people complains about the service level of broadband upload and download speeds and the impact to his business.
There are many cities in regional Australia with over 40,000 people, and a number with over 80,000.
This bill should be about delivering minimum services to regional cities and towns that match the standards in our capital cities.
And at the heart of this—the broadband debate—is the future competitiveness of regional Australia. What is needed is public Fibre to the Node infrastructure that gives fair access to all players, and a level playing field.
One solution might be to replace existing networks entirely and put in fibre or a wireless solution to every home and business as South Korea and Japan have done. They would cost far more than the $4.7 billion the ALP is offering but we need an honest debate about whether this is the way to go or not.
If this level of investment is not an option then we need as a minimum to sort out the regulatory mess. On the one side we have Telstra claiming that it will not make investments on account of the risk to shareholder returns and the share price because of current competition regulation.
The G9 group has the opposite problem - it needs regulation to get access to premises and that means connecting its fibre to Telstra’s copper pair.
I hear that Telstra will not even switch on the equipment it has, arguing that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission will force it to accept unreasonably low rates. Of course if the equipment remains switched off and effectively mothballed then it can’t generate return on share holders’ investment in any case—so the question has to be asked: what is Telstra’s game?
Should the G9 lay their own fibre network there is the risk that has been Optus’ experience that Telstra will duplicate the infrastructure. This would deliver another Mexican stand off.
So while the G9 proposal is a way forward, the options are to do this with public money as Labor is proposing or to place restrictions on Telstra.
In either case these problems would not exist if Telstra was properly structurally separated and all retailers, including Telstra Retail, bought network services on the same terms. Critically the issue of access to Telstra’s copper pair needs to be dealt with and through competition policy.
It is regrettable that we are today dealing with a bill that achieves nothing constructive. Instead, we should be removing the structural impediments to competition through the restructuring of Telstra and by giving the regulator effective divestiture powers, as recommended by ACCC and OECD.
We should be introducing a well funded national strategy with targets and timeframes that has as its basis the supply of affordable broadband to all Australians.
We should have an industry/government coordinating body to implement this national strategy.
The Democrats say funding should be available for new technology only, not to upgrade existing copper networks. Fibre-to-the-House and/or true wireless broadband at a minimum of 10Mb, should be implemented as a high priority. Federal Government should support local councils to facilitate broadband access in their communities. All new housing estates should be fibre.
The Government should specify in legislation and regulations minimum service requirements for broadband access and minimum broadband speeds to provide Australians reasonable access to data services.
Subsidisation of satellite technologies should be reviewed to find the most appropriate means of supplying the technology to isolated areas and where possible provide all Australians with equal access.
The Democrats call on both the government and the opposition to act in the long-term national interest rather than the short term politicking reflected in this bill.
 (Senator Forshaw)—Just before we proceed further, Senator Conroy, are you circulating a second reading amendment?",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PROTECTING SERVICES FOR RURAL AND REGIONAL AUSTRALIA INTO THE FUTURE) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2007-09-10,"—I move the amendment circulated in my name:
At the end of the motion, add “but the Senate condemns the Government for failing to invest the $2 billion Communications Fund in a national fibre to the node broadband network to ensure:
parity of service and metro comparable pricing for all Australians serviced by the fibre to the node network;
the state of broadband services in Australia is turned around, after the past 11 years of neglect under the Howard Government;
that Australians have access to the best available telecommunication technologies;
that Australians in rural and regional areas have improved telecommunication services, including access to e-health and e-eduction, which are only possible over a fibre to the node network—the interest earned on the Communications Fund (up to $400 million every 3 years) is not enough to ensure this;
that 98 per cent of Australians, including those in rural and regional areas, have access to future proof telecommunications technology; and
that the 2 per cent of people that the new fibre to node network will not reach have a standard of service, depending on the available technology, that is as close as possible to that provided by the new network”.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PROTECTING SERVICES FOR RURAL AND REGIONAL AUSTRALIA INTO THE FUTURE) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Nash, Sen Fiona",NATS,2007-09-10,"—I rise tonight to make some comments about the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Protecting Services for Rural and Regional Australia into the Future) Bill 2007. I do so because, quite simply, if the government had not moved to introduce this legislation, rural and regional Australia would have been completely disadvantaged and would have lost out as a result of the Australian Labor Party—there is no way around that; there is no other way of saying it, but that is it.
The National Party and the coalition government introduced a $2 billion Communications Fund to ensure that rural and regional Australia would have telecommunications to a level that they needed into the future. It was fairly simple and obvious to those people looking at it. Senator Conroy on the other side of the chamber would have you believe that the Labor Party’s plan is going to deliver for rural and regional communities, so I rise tonight to let the people, particularly of rural and regional communities, know that this is not the case. The government has put in place a $2 billion principal Communications Fund to ensure telecommunications for regional communities. Interestingly, Senator Conroy fails to tell the Senate that they have no plan for rural and regional Australian telecommunications whatsoever—absolutely none. As I have referred to before, I do not think Senator Conroy has actually been out of Melbourne and into regional Australia, because I live out in a regional community, Mr Acting Deputy President, and I can tell Senator Conroy that there are no nodes where I live and no nodes anywhere nearby, and I live in a reasonably populated part of rural Australia.
Their plan will not work. What is fascinating about this is that all we have had from the Labor Party so far on their grand plan for broadband rollout in rural and regional Australia—actually all of Australia—is one media release. There are no costings, there is no detail and there is no substance. There is absolutely nothing except this superficial commentary about the great things they are going to deliver. It is absolute rubbish and there is no substance whatsoever, which is like a whole lot of other Labor policies at the moment—there is absolutely no substance to them whatsoever. We have from Labor a plan for broadband for the nation which, if it were not so sad for rural and regional communities, would be absolutely laughable. Interestingly, their fibre to the node—and I think that side of the chamber got so caught up with the actual word that they cannot get past the phrase ‘fibre to the node’ because it is all really exciting—does not get to more than about 75 per cent of Australians.
I represent rural and regional communities and they are the most important thing to me as a National Party senator. The very simple message for our rural and regional communities is that, under Labor’s plan for fibre to the node, 25 per cent of Australia is going to miss out and that includes every single little bit of rural and regional communities, because fibre to the node is exactly that; fibre to the node. Senator Conroy—‘No Nodes Noddy’, on the other side—again: there are no nodes out there. I do not know if Senator Conroy does not ‘get’ the technology of what fibre to the node is—maybe that is true; I am not quite sure. It does not go to rural and regional communities. I can stand here and talk for 20 minutes and say 27 million times how this is not going to get to rural and regional Australia. But it is simple—Labor’s policy will not deliver to rural and regional communities. There is nothing; there will be no broadband and no fast speeds, because it is all about ‘big city’ Labor and making sure that everything is okay in the cities. Well, that is not okay, because rural and regional communities are the ones that are going to miss out and that is not fair and it is not right.
Labor are going to steal the very money from rural and regional communities that was put there to ensure that they had telecommunications services. It was put there by the National Party and the Liberal Party to ensure that it was guaranteed into the future that we would have those services for regional communities, because we recognise how important it is that we have them. Those on the other side in the Labor Party have absolutely no idea. I might be wrong, but I would imagine that every single person living in a rural and regional community at this moment, tonight, is aware that, if they have a Labor government after the election, they will have no capacity for faster broadband speeds because Labor want to steal the money from the very fund that is going to help deliver to those rural and regional communities. I do not think it is right for them to take that money and put it into the cities when, by the way, private commercial companies are delivering broadband services to the city anyway. The Australian Labor Party want to steal that $2 billion and put it into the cities. I defy anybody around this country to tell me why that is right, because it is not—it is absolutely wrong. As I said earlier, Senator Conroy should be ‘No Nodes Noddy’ because there are no nodes; they cannot deliver. Most people probably do not realise that the speeds of broadband delivered from the nodes go 1.5 kilometres. That is fine if you are living in the middle of Sydney, Melbourne or Brisbane, but it is not fine if you are living in Young, or Albury, or Mendooran, or in Tamworth or on the north coast.
It is not fine and it is not right. We are talking about a distance of 1.5 kilometres. The Australian Labor Party are dealing in ‘fraudband’. They are not being fair and they are not being truthful with the people living in our rural and regional communities. The Labor Party would have people in our regional and rural communities believe that they are going to deliver this great broadband speed that the government cannot possibly deliver. That is rubbish. It is absolute rubbish. They are leading the people of rural Australia down the garden path, because they cannot deliver what they say they are going to purely by the dint of technology. I know that, and many of my colleagues on this side know that. Certainly my National Party colleagues know that. My National Party colleagues in the House who have spoken on this bill—Mrs Hull, Mr Scott and Mr Neville—all made the point that the Australian Labor Party were going to steal from rural and regional communities. That is exactly what it is.
What we have under this government is a very solid plan for the delivery of broadband around this nation. It is not just about regional communities getting the level of service that they need. It is not just about our regional communities being able to communicate with the cities around this nation. It is about our regional communities being able to play on the global stage—we are part of the world; the barriers have broken down—and we need that ability. This government actually has a plan to make sure that those people in regional communities have the telecommunications services that they need. We are putting $958 million into the rollout of a broadband network that will reach 99 per cent of the country. The last one per cent of the country, as everybody knows, out in those very remote areas, needs satellite capacity to get this broadband network there. We are going to ensure that 100 per cent of the country is covered. That 99 per cent figure is not some pie-in-the-sky, Senator Conroy style grand plan of absolute rubbish; it is a substantive, costed, sensible, measured rollout of broadband capability for this nation. We are doing the right thing in ensuring that this nation gets the broadband capability that it needs.
It really concerns me that we see a scare campaign coming from the Australian Labor Party, denigrating what the government is doing. If the Australian Labor Party were really concerned about telecommunications in this nation, if they were really concerned about telecommunications in rural and regional communities, they would actually say how they are going to deliver their fibre-to-the-node plan—because, quite frankly, one media release does not cut it. The people of this country deserve more. They deserve to know how it is being costed. They deserve to know where it is going to be rolled out. They deserve to know where all these nodes are going to be, given that it is only 1.5 kilometres from the node that this technology is going to deliver to. I can almost hear people around regional communities laughing about the 1.5 kilometres, because they are tens of hundreds of kilometres from nodes and they know that that is not going to deliver.
What is also really interesting is that the $958 million, which this government is putting in to roll out broadband around this nation, is there because this government has the economic credentials to be able to afford it. It is a bit like running a household; you cannot spend money on things if you have not saved it up. This is the money the government has very carefully saved because it has managed the economy of this country well. While that phrase sometimes gets lost on people, what that actually means is that this government has money to spend on things that are important to the people of this nation—and one of those things is telecommunications. When I came into this place, and for a long time before, I was very aware of the fact that we had budgets in deficit. There was no money. We came into this place with a $96 billion debt from Labor. And it was not just $96 billion of debt; along with that came an $8 billion a year interest bill. That meant that there was no money to spend on things like telecommunications broadband plans for the nation. Now, because we have finally paid off that debt—and it took a lot of hard work and a lot of good management—we have that money in our household budget, in this country’s household budget, to spend on telecommunications. It is all very well for Senator Conroy to stand on the other side and talk about his grand plan about fibre-to-the-node blah, blah, blah but under Labor there would not be the money to pay for it. That is not just a throwaway line; there is a track record.
You only have to look at all the state Labor governments right around this nation to know that Labor cannot manage money, and there is absolutely no reason to believe that federal Labor would be any different because the philosophy is entirely the same. For state Labor, federal Labor, Labor people and the unions it is exactly the same. To suddenly expect that, because Mr Rudd says, ‘I’m an economic conservative,’ all will be okay in the economy is wrong. It will not be okay, and people in rural and regional Australia in particular need to know that Labor cannot manage money. It is because they cannot manage money that they have never been able to do things like roll out a $958 million broadband plan, which is what we are doing.
The fibre-to-the-node proposal from the Australian Labor Party means that they have to steal $2 billion from rural and regional communities. I find that absolutely abhorrent because, at this moment, an enormous percentage of the nation—including 75 per cent of New South Wales—is going through one of the worst droughts on record. People in those areas are doing it very tough. I take my hat off to them because they battle and battle to provide food for this nation and to provide an economic powerhouse for us as a trading nation. On top of that drought, we see Labor wanting to rip out the $2 billion Communications Fund that was set up purely to help rural and regional communities. We do not know where technology is going to go in the future, but The Nationals and the Liberal Party know that we have to make sure that we look after those rural and regional communities and we look ahead, we think and we prepare. We know there may well be changes in technology and technology delivery down the track, and we have prepared by setting up a $2 billion fund from which $400 million every three years is going to go to rural and regional communities. It was set up to be substantive and ongoing.
We need to protect that $2 billion fund, which is why this legislation has been introduced. If we protect that $2 billion fund, then rural and regional communities will have $400 million every three years in perpetuity to go towards their security of telecommunications. It is a sensible, practical measure that will ensure telecommunications in rural and regional communities. But, oh no, Labor want to get rid of it. Very simply, the Australian Labor Party want to take $2 billion from rural and regional communities and put it in the cities. That is not fair. It is not right. Private enterprise is going to deliver broadband to the cities anyway. How the Australian Labor Party can sit on the other side of the chamber and say, ‘This is fine; we will steal this money from the bush and give it to the cities,’ I do not know. I do not know how they can possibly think that is right, proper or fair, because it is not.
The government has had to bring in this legislation because, if we had not, rural and regional communities around Australia would have missed out. We have had to do this as a safety net because we know that the Australian Labor Party would steal the fund. We will not stand for it. We will not wear it. We are going to secure the future of rural and regional communities. We are going to secure the telecommunications needs of rural and regional communities into the future.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PROTECTING SERVICES FOR RURAL AND REGIONAL AUSTRALIA INTO THE FUTURE) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Wortley, Sen Dana",ALP,2007-09-10,"—I rise to speak on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Protecting Services for Rural and Regional Australia into the Future) Bill 2007. This bill seeks to introduce legislation to prevent the $2 billion principal of the Communications Fund from being drawn upon to deliver telecommunications services to rural, regional and remote Australia. It is a bill that Labor opposes. The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Coonan, in her press release on 21 June 2007, made it clear that this legislation is to prevent Labor from using the Communications Fund to provide a national broadband network should a Rudd Labor government be elected. Surely such motivation is further evidence that the government does not hold the national interest as paramount. The government is more interested in trying to cover up its own incompetence than in getting on with the task of connecting the nation to world-class broadband access.
There is one little, simple, single-syllable word that characterises the Howard government’s action on the issues that matter to the Australian people. The word is ‘slow’. We know only too well that the government has been slow to even admit climate change is a crucial, compelling challenge. It has been slow to address the nation’s growing skills shortage. Infrastructure is yet another area that has suffered due to the federal government being slow to act. And now in this chamber, focusing on the issue of broadband, again the government has been slow. The only thing slower than the government’s moves in this area are the snail-paced internet speeds that many Australians have to deal with on a daily basis in family homes, in small businesses and in rural and regional Australia.
It is not in dispute that fast, reliable broadband is essential for our society—for families, for education, for medicine and health, for small businesses and for the economy. As it stands, our nation’s lack of high-speed broadband is hurting and holding back Australian families and small businesses. Australia’s broadband performance is poor. We are ranked only 16th out of the 30 countries surveyed by the OECD. We lag a long way behind the countries we consider our international peers. Yet the coalition has sat on its hands for years, only cobbling together a plan in the shadow of a looming federal election. And even now the result is unsatisfactory on so many levels—a poorly devised plan that will inhibit Australia’s potential both socially and economically.
The government’s plan is a two-tiered system which discriminates against rural and regional Australians. They will be treated as second-class citizens by the legislation the government wants to enact. Those living outside of metropolitan areas will be left with an inferior wireless service. Those living outside of the inner suburbs of any of the nation’s five major cities will have shared connection speeds. There should not be a debate over how important this issue is for a progressive and competitive Australia. There really is no argument. As we look at the detail of the government’s plan, it is hardly worthy of the tag ‘next generation’. Despite its posturing, the government just does not seem to get it.
Some months ago, Senator Coonan told The 7.30 Report that Australian broadband is ‘okay’ and that ‘no-one is complaining about the speeds of broadband in metropolitan areas’. How complacent and out of touch with Australian families this government is. Its procrastination in this matter has been costly for many people in metropolitan areas and in rural and regional areas. Mr Howard has had years to deal with broadband—as he has with other aforementioned issues—and is only acting now because there is an election on the way. Indeed, the federal government’s performance on broadband has been a broadscale hoax on all Australians, particularly those who live in rural and regional Australia.
Despite its name, the purpose of this legislation is not to protect people in rural, regional and remote areas. Senator Coonan’s claims that the government would deliver high-quality, high-speed broadband to 99 per cent of Australians, using the income generated by the Communications Fund, have been little more than an act. By the government’s own figures, the slush fund will generate a maximum of $400 million dollars in interest and other income every three years. Labor believes this is not nearly enough revenue to raise the standard of telecommunications services outside of city areas. Instead, Labor will make the Communications Fund true to its name. Under a Rudd Labor government, the fund’s capital would be used to build a national broadband network that would guarantee that those in rural and regional Australia would no longer be left behind when it comes to crucial, even lifesaving, communication. There is no risk to the government in being part of a joint venture for such a network; broadband is an essential utility and therefore an important investment.
The Communications Fund would form part of the $4.7 billion which will see 98 per cent of Australians serviced by a fibre-to-the-node network, with minimum connection speeds of 12 megabits per second. The remaining two per cent of Australians will receive a standard of service as close as possible to that provided to other users. Labor believes it is crucial that people living in regional and rural areas have, where possible, access to metro-comparable broadband. Labor rejects the claim that the coalition’s proposed new network would deliver broadband services 20 to 40 times faster than today’s average. The OPEL consortium—which was awarded the grant to build the government’s planned new network—admits: ‘Actual speeds will vary due to various factors such as distance from the base station, selected service, customer equipment and general internet traffic.’ So speeds under the government’s plan are seriously in question, with even the successful tenderer unable to confirm Senator Coonan’s claims. When I asked Senator Coonan in this chamber on 20 June why the government was spending up to $1 billion to duplicate an existing service, she replied that there was no duplication, but she then went on to say, ‘You cannot push out to 99 per cent of the population without having some minimal duplication of coverage.’
A failure to rule out investment in a duplicate network is not the only problem Labor sees in the guidelines for the government’s 18th broadband plan. They also failed to specify whom the network would reach. They omitted to state a minimum connection speed and did not rule out a government contribution for network losses—a very different story from that which the minister has been telling. Also providing a challenge to the minister’s claims is OPEL, the consortium which is providing the WiMAX network, which has stated delivery speeds up to six megabits per second, being scaled up to 12 megabits per second in 2009—a long way short of the claim made by the Howard government. After years of inaction, during which Australia slipped further and further behind other nations, and 17 previous attempts at a broadband plan, the government have come up with a substandard proposal—a second-class system. Labor believes this is simply not good enough. It is of fundamental importance that we get it right when it comes to broadband. Labor’s broadband plan uses superior technology to that of the government’s scheme; and crucially, it provides for the migration to the ultimate technology: fibre to the home.
Bringing Australian broadband into the 21st century is no easy or quick task, because our infrastructure is in such a deficient state. The Howard government’s indifference and neglect have come home to roost. They have been indecisive and painfully slow. Labor understands the importance of high-speed, accessible, affordable broadband internet for all Australians and is ready to roll up its metaphorical sleeves and get to work on this and other issues. A brighter, more competitive future when it comes to the benefits of broadband is reliant on the building of better fibre networks. Labor’s plan for a national broadband network would deliver the future to all Australians.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PROTECTING SERVICES FOR RURAL AND REGIONAL AUSTRALIA INTO THE FUTURE) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2007-09-10,"—I listened to Senator Nash tonight and I thought her contribution to the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Protecting Services for Rural and Regional Australia into the Future) Bill 2007 was worth while. She does put a lot of effort into telecommunications in Australia. This bill seeks to lock up the $2 billion that the National Party won in exchange for the sale of Telstra. In the party room, or forums, we said that if Telstra is sold then we want to ensure that rural and regional Australia never gets left behind, as it was at the end of the Labor Party administration. I remember that, when Labor came to office, rural and regional Australia did not even get untimed local calls. There was no such thing as broadband or the internet—just one lonely telephone, and you were even charged if you rang your next-door neighbour. In fact, you were charged for a long-distance call if you rang the cottage from the main house. Even a call to your employer was called a long-distance call.
The previous speaker, Senator Wortley, said the government has been indifferent and has not moved. There is $4 billion worth of indifference: there are mobile telephones right across Australia, there are mobile telephones in the smallest village and there are mobile telephones up into the Torres Strait and out to the islands. Towers have been put up and subsidised by the government to ensure that everyone gets a mobile phone. You can now ring from Birdsville to Bedourie, from Birdsville to Boulia and it is classed as a local call. These are things which the coalition has done. This bill seeks to lock in that $2 billion under legislation, and it can never be removed unless Labor has a majority in the Senate. That $2 billion is there to keep rural and regional Australia up to speed when new technology comes through. I am sad to say that Labor will raid that $2 billion. It has said it wants that $2 billion to put forward its plan for the use of fibre-to-the-node technology.
Senator Nash said that fibre to the node will be implemented within 1.5 kilometres. I have a note here to the effect it will go four kilometres. But, whether it is 1.5 kilometres or four kilometres, it does not make a great deal of difference when your telephone is five kilometres from the front gate, let alone five kilometres from the nearest town. There is no fibre to the node in rural and regional Australia, and 25 per cent of the people will be left out. There will be no plan under Labor to support them. It is bad enough to exclude 25 per cent of regional Australia, but they then want to rob the fund and say: ‘We’re going to use that $2 billion to push forward our fibre to the node. We’ll take that away from you and, if you fall behind in telecommunications, that is just too bad.’ Unfortunately, that is what the Labor Party have said they will do. They will take the $2 billion that the coalition has put in a trust fund which will produce $400 million every three years. Labor are going to use that money and then they will turn their backs on rural and regional Australia. I find that pretty hard to accept.
Only a couple of weeks ago we in the coalition put forward a program of, I think, $958 million to try to give people the latest technology, through a company called OPEL, which is a combination of Elders—a real Australian company—and another company. We actually reached 99 per cent of the people. We were not able to reach the other one per cent of the people, who are on radio digital concentrators and kilometres away from any town. But we have not ignored or forgotten them. We have not said, ‘Sorry, you’re just within the one per cent and that’s tough luck; you live out in the bush and you have to accept that.’ We have $400 million to fix that problem. We have appointed a very prominent eye doctor in Brisbane, Dr Glasson, who has taken on the duty of running around rural Queensland with the Mayor of Barcoo, ‘Barcoo Bruce Scott’. They will go out to those remote areas and ascertain what people are looking for.
We have provided $400 million to pick up that one per cent of the people, in contrast to Labor, which will raid our fund of $2 billion that will lock in the advanced telecommunications technology. Rural Australia will be left high and dry. Senator Conroy, you ought to be honest and say: ‘Fibre to the node just will not work in rural and regional Australia. If you are four kilometres from the node, you will be completely left out.’
This bill is needed. We need to lock it in. We want to ensure that that $2 billion can never be removed and that it picks up interest. There may be a time when $400 million is not sufficient to keep the telecommunications technology up to speed. That does not mean we will just say, ‘Well, here’s the $400 million and we’re just going to use that,’ as Senator Conroy has suggested. Senator Conroy will know that in the 12 years we have been in government we have spent $4 billion on telecommunications. What a disgrace it was when we came in: all people had was one lousy telephone and, even then, they could not use it to ring their neighbour up or even the house on their property. We have gone so far in telecommunications. No-one can deny that the National Party and the Liberal Party have stood up for the bush. We have had so many programs, including $50 million for regional mobile phones, regional highway satellite phones, internet assisted programs, national communication funds, Indigenous communication scoping funds, Torres Strait community funds, the telecommunications action plan, local government funds and building rural networks—time after time we have come up and met the needs of rural Australians.
All we have in return is the Labor Party saying: ‘Let’s go to fibre-to-the-node technology. We’ll put it in the cities and the bush can’—I do not know what happens to the bush, they will just carry on the way they are and gradually fall behind the rest of Australia. I say to Senator Conroy: the market is prepared to put in this broadband in Australia. You do not have to go and spend $15 billion of taxpayers’ money to put in what the market will put in. Where the market fails is where there are not enough people to make the market work, and that is in rural and regional Australia. That is where the government has to act. But you in the Labor Party just cannot help yourselves. You have $15 billion earmarked for a communications project to put in broadband that many companies in Australia are quite prepared to fund. However, those companies are not prepared to go out and fund telecommunications projects in the bush where there are not enough people to make the market work, so that is where we have come in with $400 million. We are looking after the people that have supported the National and Liberal parties. But Labor has walked away from them, Senator Conroy: you have not explained to us how you are going to get broadband out there. We have even supported mobile phones that are satellite phones when people get so far away from the CDMA that they cannot connect with it. Unfortunately, we need to pass this legislation otherwise the $2 billion will go up in smoke. Rural and regional Australia would then be left seeing telecommunications as they were before we came into government.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PROTECTING SERVICES FOR RURAL AND REGIONAL AUSTRALIA INTO THE FUTURE) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2007-09-10,"—I rise to speak on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Protecting Services for Rural and Regional Australia into the Future) Bill 2007, which seeks to amend the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999. From reading the title of the amendment bill one would be forgiven for assuming that the government is aiming, through this bill, to do something positive for the future of telecommunications services in rural and remote Australia. Indeed, one would be forgiven for assuming that this bill is aimed at doing the right thing by protecting the standard of telecommunication services in rural and regional Australia for the future.
If Senator Nash and Senator Boswell were serious about delivering broadband to the bush then they—the Nationals—would be supporting Labor’s national broadband plan. However, unfortunately for the people of rural, regional and remote Australia, the government’s intention through this bill is far from aimed at investing in and protecting the standard of telecommunications services; this bill is about preventing the ALP from using the Communications Fund to provide a national broadband network announced by Labor—should a Rudd Labor government be elected. The Howard government is not motivated by the long-term national interest; it is motivated by short-term political interests. The Labor Party are not the only ones to see that this government is all about stunts and does not stand for anything. I quote from yesterday’s Sunday Age:

After 11 years of being run by a policy contortionist, it’s difficult to see why the Liberals want to be in government.
They don’t stand for paying less tax, not for less regulation, not for smaller government, not for protecting civil liberties, not for investing in universities, not for the arts or sciences, not for a fair go in the workplace, not for states rights, not for an open economy, not for less welfare, not for caring for the planet and not for respecting international law.
The government recently released the draft guidelines for its 18th broadband plan. The guidelines are appalling and vague and leave the majority of Australians, particularly those in rural and regional Australia, in the dark, with it containing no firm guarantee that they will receive reliable, high-speed broadband access. The guidelines fail to specify who the network will reach and the minimum connection speed and to rule out government contribution to network losses.
So what is the point? The guidelines smell of another ad hoc political stunt by an out-of-touch, arrogant government, designed to convince the voters that they are committed to delivering a broadband solution for all Australians. However, it is obvious from the vague nature of the government’s guidelines that their broadband plan is a bandaid, a poorly thought-out policy that has been slapped together on the run in the lead-up to the election. Their vague, poorly drafted policy, which is set to invest in obsolete technology and see the majority of Australians still without a fast, reliable broadband service, proves once and for all that this government just does not get it when it comes to investing in the future of this nation. Just as it does not get it when it comes to climate change, it does not get it when it comes to providing a genuine broadband solution for this country.
This is a government that is stuck in the past and is not willing to invest in the future. The measures contained in this bill prove it. Through this bill the government intends to lock up $2 billion of government money set aside to improve telecommunications services in rural and regional Australia and effectively deny people and businesses in such areas the chance to access metro-comparable telecommunications services.
It seems that this government is so hell-bent on political stunts that, rather than turning around the poor quality of telecommunications for all Australians, including those living in rural, regional and remote areas, it is willing to underinvest in essential infrastructure such as telecommunications. While the government plays games in the lead-up to this year’s elections, people and businesses in rural, regional and remote Australia are set to suffer. It is measures like those contained in this bill that leave no doubt that this government is old and out of touch with the people of Australia and that investment is needed now to ensure the health of the Australian economy in the future. It proves that this government is more concerned with holding on to government money in the lead-up to an election than investing in essential infrastructure for the future. It proves that this government, at this point in time, is so obsessed with serving its own political interests in terms of preserving its own power that it no longer has the best interests of the Australian people at heart.
This bill seeks to effectively lock up $2 billion in the Communications Fund, which was initially established in 2005 to improve telecommunications services in rural and regional Australia by implementing the recommendations given by the Regional Telecommunications Independent Review Committee. As a result of this measure only the interest earned by the fund will be available to implement the recommendations of the committee. This will equate to about $400 million over three years, about $133 million a year being available to be spent on telecommunications services in rural and regional Australia.
Labor is 100 per cent committed to improving the appalling standards of telecommunications services in rural, regional and remote Australia and does not believe that $400 million every three years is anywhere near enough to ensure this occurs. At present Australia is ranked only sixteenth out of 30 countries surveyed by the OECD when it comes to our broadband performance. Over the past 11 years the Howard government has failed to do anything to improve this situation, with 18 failed broadband plans under its belt to prove it. Labor believes that what is needed is a national broadband network that ensures 98 per cent of Australians, regardless of whether they live in metropolitan areas or rural and regional Australia, have access to quick, reliable broadband services that deliver a minimum speed of 40 megabytes per second and the remaining two per cent at the very least have access to standard service comparable to that provided by the new network.
Labor plans to deliver such services by rolling out superior state-of-the-art, more reliable fibre-to-the-node technology to 98 per cent of Australians. Labor believes that investment in telecommunications services now and in the future is of comparable importance to investment in rail infrastructure at the turn of the century. Labor’s plan will ensure that all Australians, regardless of where they choose to live, will be granted access to a global market and a catalogue of information which will be pivotal in guaranteeing economic prosperity in the future. It will ensure that no Australian is left behind or left needlessly to struggle with inferior telecommunications infrastructure.
For this to occur there needs to be an obvious investment in telecommunications infrastructure over the next couple of years. As an indication of just how important investment in such infrastructure will be, Labor is willing to invest $4.7 billion to improve the standard of telecommunications services in Australia, particularly in rural and regional areas. This initial investment is sure to pay off in the not-too-distant future, with the network set to open up businesses, particularly in rural and regional areas, to the global market ensuring flow-on investment in such areas. This is why the government’s plan to lock up $2 billion of the Communications Fund, some of which could be used to improve the standard of telecommunications services in Australia, is simply not warranted. It just does not make good economic sense. Four hundred million dollars over three years will do nothing to improve services, let alone maintain them in rural and regional Australia. For this obvious reason, Labor opposes the bill.
The government’s broader approach to telecommunications services in this country just does not add up. It announced earlier this year that it intended to provide a ‘complete and comprehensive broadband solution for Australia’, yet it plans to invest only in the fibre-to-the-node technology in major metropolitan areas, leaving people and businesses in rural and regional Australia out in the cold. How can neglecting the needs of people in rural and regional Australia and leaving them with an inferior, second-rate wireless service be considered as ‘providing a complete and comprehensive broadband solution for Australia’? It is not.
The government has proved with this bill and its broader botched broadband plan that it just does not get it when it comes to investing in essential services for the future. It has proved that it does not get how investing in essential telecommunications infrastructure and lifting the standard of service delivered to rural and regional areas will pay considerable economic dividends in the future. Why doesn’t the government get these things? Because its attention is fixed on retaining power at the next election, rather than coming up with a plan that genuinely invests in telecommunications infrastructure and the future of Australia. It is too busy playing politics. And that is what this bill is about: politics.
Labor has openly expressed its intention, if elected, to put to use the money from the Communications Fund to assist in the rollout of fibre-to-the-node services to 98 per cent of Australian households under its national broadband plan. Now, ironically, here we are debating a bill proposed by the government to lock up that money before the next election. Once again we bear witness to a government that are willing to use and abuse parliamentary processes to play politics and suit their own political agenda, rather than promoting the interests of the Australian people. We have seen it time and time again. Now, with the election looming, they have turned to childish tit for tat politics to ensure that, even if things do fall in their favour at the next election, they will still be left a lasting legacy. This is the work of a government that are scared of losing power, rather than using it in the interests of the people they serve.
Why shouldn’t the money in the Communications Fund be available to invest wisely in the services it was formed to improve? Why should people in rural, regional and remote Australia be left behind? Access to quick and reliable telecommunications services will have a significant bearing on the long-term prosperity of my home state of Tasmania in particular. Tasmania has in recent times enjoyed a period of growth, thanks to the state government’s commitment to investing in the long-term future of the state. Indeed, in recent years there has been an increasing number of people moving to the state as well as an increasing number of young people choosing to stay and invest their futures in Tasmania. This has resulted in a significant amount of development in many parts of the state. In the north-west, places such as Stanley, Ulverstone and Burnie have witnessed a significant amount of development and investment.
Likewise, so has the Kingborough region in the south, where I recently toured with some of my colleagues. This region, combined with the accompanying Channel-Huon region, is one of the fastest growing regions in Tasmania. However, at present many of the people and the small and medium businesses in the region are unable to access the government’s current wireless broadband service. Further, those few who can are constantly hampered by interference, delays and slow upload and download times. The geographic nature of Tasmania, in particular, is not conducive to the Howard government’s proposed second-rate wireless service because of its hilly geography—the very thing that makes the region so appealing.
Under the government’s proposed broadband plan, the people and businesses located in Tasmania will be left either without service or to struggle with the second-rate and highly unreliable wireless network. How can this be in the best interests of the small to medium businesses emerging in Tasmania? This gross underinvestment in essential telecommunications infrastructure by the government will mean more to the people of Tasmania than simply not being able to check the footy scores or to log on to YouTube. The standard of access to telecommunications services in such areas will have direct bearing on the health of the local economy, the success of local businesses and the degree of prosperity they can generate for the national economy.
Indeed, the Australian Local Government Association’s State of the regions report of last year found that inferior broadband services—that is, wireless—in 2006 resulted in the loss of $32.1 million in forgone gross domestic product and around 415 regional jobs in southern Tasmania alone. This is a tragedy. And the figures are similar for other regional areas across Australia. How can the government ignore such figures and continue to underinvest in essential telecommunications infrastructure in Australia? How can we expect people to continue to invest in regional and rural areas when the government is not willing to provide them with basic, reliable telecommunications services to facilitate the growth of their businesses? Why can’t the government see that an investment in essential telecommunications infrastructure in such regions will no doubt result in the generation of more wealth to be invested in the local economy, which will in turn boost the health of the national economy now and in the future?
Such an investment will open local businesses to national and global markets, attracting international interest and investment. This is the way of the future. If Australia is to prosper beyond the current mining boom, investment in this infrastructure is essential. It will not only open up the global market to local businesses; it will also open up a catalogue of ideas to bright young minds, hopefully stimulating creativity and innovation. This will also no doubt benefit the Australian economy in the future.
Gone are the days when people were forced to move away from their local communities, families and friends and give up their lifestyle in order to make ends meet. The information superhighway and ever-increasing mobile means of communication ensure that people now have the option of staying with their families and in their local communities while pursuing a meaningful and productive career. Such advances are welcome in Tasmania, in particular, with the attractiveness of our way of life luring interstate and overseas investors to the state. It may also represent the first small step towards facilitating a means of fusing work and childcare duties for young parents struggling to juggle both.
For this opportunity to eventuate, there first needs to be an investment in the infrastructure to make it all possible, yet the government’s proposed broadband plan will deny nearly all Tasmanians access to a fast, reliable broadband service. They will be left to struggle with the second-rate and unreliable wireless technology. This is simply not good enough. It is not good politics, it is not in the best interests of the Tasmanian people and it is certainly not going to contribute to the future prosperity of the state.
Why throw $54 million into marginal electorates like Braddon in the form of ad hoc, quick-fix, vote-grabbing policies like the one aimed at the Mersey hospital—which one of the government’s own senators thinks will be a disaster? Why open a technical college campus in the same area when enrolment rates well below target are doing nothing to aid the skills crisis in the area or help people retrain to fill the ever-increasing number of job vacancies opening up in this developing area? Why not invest in the long-term future of the state and ensure that every Tasmanian has access to a fast, reliable broadband service?
Labor is aware of the possibilities and the need for investment in essential telecommunications infrastructure. That is why it has allocated $4.7 billion to invest in a high-speed, fibre-to-the-node national broadband network which will be rolled out to 98 per cent of Australians and deliver a service which will be a minimum of 40 times faster than that which is currently provided. Meanwhile, unfortunately the government is more interested in using rural and regional Australians as infantry for its pre-election campaign rather than coming up with a genuine plan that will see an investment in essential telecommunications infrastructure in such areas.
As with an increasing number of bills that have passed through this chamber in recent times, this bill is an attempt by the government to enforce its own political agenda in the lead-up to the election. It is unfortunate that the government has chosen to pursue its own political agenda rather than to consider the needs of people in rural and regional Australia. This bill by no means, as the title suggests, promotes or secures the future of telecommunications services in rural and regional Australia. In fact, it does the opposite.
For this reason and because Labor is 100 per cent committed to improving the standard of telecommunications services in rural and regional Australia, we oppose this bill. Locking up $2 billion and allocating only $400 million over three years is simply not enough, and the government knows it. The Howard government’s WiMAX solution will be badly affected by interruptions to line-of-sight vision. True broadband will bring enormous prosperity. We need to be prepared to take on the challenges so that we can compete in a competitive economy. More needs to be done than this government is prepared to do, and it appears that Labor is the only party with the vision, the plan and the will to do it.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PROTECTING SERVICES FOR RURAL AND REGIONAL AUSTRALIA INTO THE FUTURE) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2007-09-10,"—I am delighted to join this debate because I think I actually bring a reality check to the debate that we have had tonight. Unlike the Labor Party speakers who, with respect, have simply read speeches written by some Canberra based backroom clerk like the one who cleverly wrote Senator Conroy’s speech, I actually live in rural and regional Australia. I live a small country town. In July every year I drive throughout north-western and western Queensland. I am often in Far North Queensland, down in Rockhampton and out in Gladstone and Longreach, and, rather than reading these prepared speeches by some Canberra based adviser, I actually get out there and understand the work that Senator Coonan and other members of the government before her have done to assist telecommunications in rural and regional Australia.
I cannot forget the days when without any warning the Labor government shut off the analog telephone, which used to provide a service to rural and regional Australia, without any alternative strategy or system in mind. As is always the case with the Labor Party—and particularly with Senator Conroy—you do not listen to what they say or what they promise; you look at what they do when they are in government. They are criticising us now for interest rates hikes up to seven or eight per cent and say that it is terrible. They do not remember—they do remember but they choose not to remember—when I personally was paying on my own home loan mortgage interest rates of 17½ per cent. When you hear Mr Rudd saying that he is a fiscal conservative and that he will not let interest rates get up to that, do not listen to what he says; just look at what Labor do when they are in government.
The previous speaker had the temerity to mention the Australian Local Government Association. The Labor Party pretend that they are a party interested in rural and regional Australia. I would ask anyone sitting opposite me today to indicate if they happen to live in rural and regional Australia, and not one of them puts up their hand. Do any of them understand what the terminology ‘rural and regional Australia’ means? For Senator Conroy I think that means driving a truck. You were in the truckies union, weren’t you, Senator Conroy, and very involved in driving those big trucks? You were doing something in the Transport Workers Union. I am not quite sure whether you were actually driving trucks but it was probably driving trucks from the CBD of Melbourne to Mordialloc—and Senator Conroy probably thought that was regional Australia. Regional Australia is where I come from and where I drive every year. Senator Conroy, hopeless at policy but quite a nice fellow, should come out with me as I drive—
 (Senator Barnett)—Order! Senator Macdonald, I request you to address your remarks through the chair.
—I would make the invitation for him to come with me out to north-western and western and far northern Queensland to see what rural and regional Australia is about. He would be surprised to know that just in July this year I drove around with my new Palm Treo, that device that gets emails, messages and the internet. It is not a bad device—it does not always do what I want it to do. Would you believe that as I drove through western Queensland the device, using the Next G—or whatever Telstra do and I do not particularly want to promote Telstra—was working when other people travelling with me in the car found their phones were not working? It is not a perfect system, I have to say, but it has been doing pretty well in rural and regional Australia—unlike when the Labor Party shut off the analog system and left rural and regional Australians without any form of mobile telecommunications.
Over the years in my travels in what is genuinely rural and regional Queensland and rural and regional Australia I have been able to see the improvements that this government—Senator Coonan and her predecessors—have made to telecommunications in rural and regional Australia. Several years ago I was in Birdsville, almost in the centre of Australia. People there were actually using the internet to sell organic cattle from Birdsville into Japan. It was a satellite service but it was a service sponsored by the Howard government, a government that understands the needs and interests of rural and regional Australia.
So it is not what Labor promises in their great taxpayer funded robbed telecommunications fund plan for broadband in rural Australia. Do not listen to their promises. Have a look at their record. Up in Rockhampton, where I am spending a bit of time these days, there is a bit of a debate going on about dental health for rural and regional Australians—in fact for all Australians. The Howard government has put in the Medicare funded scheme to spend up to $400 million, I think it is, on people’s dental health. The Labor Party had a proposal that would give everybody dental health at the Commonwealth’s expense. It is a state responsibility. The Howard federal government has come into it because the state Labor governments are absolutely hopeless when it comes to dental health. The Labor Party spokesman promised that every Australian could have this at a cost—and I just want to mention this figure, Mr Acting Deputy President, because it is relevant—of $5 billion per annum.
For those who might be listening to this, that was the surplus in the last budget. The Labor Party would have blown $5 billion on one initiative. I mention that figure because here today the Labor Party are saying that they will blow another $5 billion on their broadband scheme. They do not have to, because, as Senator Coonan has proved, the commercial operators will take that up and the market forces will drive it. But there we have the Labor Party in one year spending twice the surplus. You do not have to be Einstein to work out where this is leading. In just two initiatives the Labor Party have spent twice the surplus. When they promise things for ports, roads, universities or whatever, you can easily see why they ran up a debt of $96 billion before 1996.
It is simply the case that you cannot trust Labor with the chequebook because they just keep signing the cheques and have no idea where the money is coming from. They borrow it, which pushes up interest rates and pushes up inflation. That is what Labor are all about. Their plans for broadband are just more of the same. They are simply signing the cheques with no idea of where the money is coming from. They work through the focus groups that Mr Rudd seems to be so driven by and find out what is popular and then promise some money for it.
I mentioned the ALGA. Ask any local government council anywhere in Australia—but particularly in Queensland—what they think about the Labor Party. The Labor Party are destroying local governments—and mainly the ones in rural and regional Queensland. By opposing this bill, they are destroying the people they are pretending to support. I cannot believe what the Australian media has picked up on. The Labor Party made it an offence to have a plebiscite on what form a local government should take. I cannot understand the Australian media. If Mr Howard blows his nose with the wrong handkerchief it is a front-page headline. But here a Labor Premier—sorry, ex-Premier, thank goodness; he has done the best thing by Queensland by resigning today—and a Labor government, supported by Kevin Rudd and all the other Queensland Labor Party people, although they are trying to distance themselves, brought in legislation that prevents free speech in the state of Queensland.
—That bill is listed for debate later this week. You might like to return to the topic.
—It was listed in the Queensland parliament, but—surprise, surprise—it is not coming on in the Queensland parliament. Would you believe that? Here we have a party that in the debate on this legislation is claiming to be the saviour of rural and regional Queensland and what do they do in Queensland? They destroy the government at the local level that gives local people a say. Councils might have said: ‘We don’t like Labor’s broadband policy,’ or ‘We didn’t like the way they shut off the analog network in our place,’ but the Labor Party know that they will not have to face those sorts of objections and criticism anymore, because they have taken the easy way out and abolished the councils in rural and regional Australia. For the Labor Party to quote the ALGA in support of their propositions regarding this bill is unbelievable. For the Queensland Labor government to stop people having a vote on their own local situation is beyond belief. Perhaps Senator Conroy in the committee stages could tell us why a Labor government destroyed the analog network back when it was important and why it has destroyed local government and free speech in Queensland.
I drive around Queensland a lot. I was amused to hear the previous speaker’s reference to climate change. Just last week, I was up in Nebo and Murrumba and Middlemount in the Bowen Basin coalfields. There it is well known that the ALP, with the support of their mates in the Greens, would shut down those coal mines because they want people to sign a bit of paper called the Kyoto agreement. What they are intending to do is to destroy the jobs of hardworking Australian families—people who labour in those mines but are well rewarded. The Labor Party, with their mates in the Greens, would shut them down. The reference to climate change and Labor’s approach to that is humorous. If you shut down every power station in Australia and turned off the engine in every motor vehicle, it would make less than 1½ per cent difference to the world’s greenhouse gas emissions.
What Mr Howard so cleverly and professionally did during the APEC meeting was to get the big emitters, China and the United States, to the table to talk about these things in a sensible way. That is not the way that the ALP would do it. They would shut down the mines and destroy the livelihoods of many hardworking families in rural and regional Australia—and particularly in the electorate of Capricornia, where the Liberal Party has a great candidate in Scott Kilpatrick, and in the electorate of Flynn, where the Liberal Party has a great candidate in Jason Rose. Those two gentlemen will be fighting to ensure that the jobs of the miners in the Bowen coalfields are saved from the ravages of the Labor Party and the Greens.
This is a very important bill because the interest from the Communications Fund, up to $400 million every three years, will be able to be used to provide telecommunications. On top of everything else that Senator Coonan and her predecessor Senator Alston have done for country Australia, there will be a permanent commitment of funds to providing real telecommunications support in rural and regional Australia.
I get to my conclusion on the same basis that I started. I do not read my speech from something that has been prepared by an adviser to Senator Conroy who lives in Canberra. Unlike Senator Conroy, I do not live in Melbourne and pontificate about telecommunications in the bush. I actually live in the bush and I travel widely in the bush. I know how telecommunications have improved under the Howard government. Anything and everything the Labor Party might say has to be judged against reality. The reality is—and I entered this debate to bring the reality check to it—that, when the Labor Party were in charge, they did nothing for the bush. You can understand that, because they hold no seats in rural and regional Australia. Even if we were to be defeated at this next election, which I think would be a sad and unlikely event, Labor would still not hold seats in rural and regional Australia.
—What’s Kirsten Livermore the member for if it is not a seat in rural and regional Australia?
—I am glad you mentioned that, Senator. You have mentioned Kirsten Livermore. Most of her constituents have not heard from her for the last 2½ years. I have to say they have heard from her in the last six months. Most of them come up to me when I am in Rockhampton supporting Scott Kilpatrick, the Liberal Party candidate, and say, ‘There must be an election on, because we’ve heard Kirsten is actually getting out and doing a few things these days.’ In the one media release that I have seen in recent times from Kirsten she criticised the Liberal candidate, Scott Kilpatrick, for being a wealthy person. Would you believe that, Senator? She criticised a Liberal candidate for being a wealthy person. The Liberal candidate happens to be a self-made builder who builds 200 affordable homes for the people of central Queensland every year. He is self-made. I do not know how wealthy he is but, whatever he has, good luck to him. For Kirsten Livermore to attack the Liberal candidate because he is ‘wealthy’ is beyond the pale to me. Think about your leader, Mr Rudd, and his wife, who are multimillionaires. We wonder how they got their money—they are multimillionaires—but, if they have earned it, good luck to them. In the Liberal Party we support people who get out and work. For a Labor candidate to criticise a Liberal candidate because he happens to be wealthy, when you have the most wealthy man in this parliament as your leader—

Senator Webber interjecting—

—And don’t talk to me about Malcolm Turnbull. Mr Rudd could buy and sell Malcolm Turnbull twice over. And let me tell you something else. The Labor candidate in the electorate of Herbert, in Townsville, where I come from, is another multimillionaire on the back of the McDonalds franchise, of which he holds the monopoly in Townsville. Labor Party candidates who criticise Liberal candidates for being wealthy should have a look at their candidate in Herbert, who is a multimillionaire on the back of the McDonalds franchise, or their own leader and his wife, who are multimillionaires. That sort of thing we should not look at. My time unfortunately has drawn to a conclusion. I do urge the Senate to support the bill. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PROTECTING SERVICES FOR RURAL AND REGIONAL AUSTRALIA INTO THE FUTURE) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2007-09-10,"—I will sum up on behalf of the government in respect of the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Protecting Services for Rural and Regional Australia into the Future) Bill 2007. I have brought forward the bill to ensure that the Australian government’s $2 billion investment in the Communications Fund is preserved in perpetuity to provide an ongoing income stream for future telecommunications improvements in regional, rural and remote Australia.
The Communications Fund was established by the government in 2005 and provides a guaranteed income stream to fund services and infrastructure for regional communities such as additional mobile towers, broadband provision and even backhaul fibre capabilities. Interest earned from the Communications Fund is used to implement the government’s responses to recommendations made by triennial independent regional telecommunications reviews. The current review, chaired by Dr Glasson, is underway.
The bill protects in legislation the $2 billion principal of the Communications Fund so that only the interest earned from the fund’s investments, up to $400 million every three years, will be available for future upgrades and can be drawn upon. Importantly, the bill will ensure that the $2 billion Communications Fund cannot be pillaged by a future government for wasteful purposes. It will also ensure that it continues to support areas that need ongoing, targeted government assistance—that is, rural and regional areas where commercial solutions are not always viable.
Labor has committed to draining the entire $2 billion from the Communications Fund, to rob the bush of its ongoing funding and to squander it on a network that is otherwise commercially viable in built-up metropolitan areas where industry has said, in the clearest of terms and publicly, it is prepared to invest. Somewhat ironically, it is rural and regional Australians—whom the Communications Fund was established to protect—whom the Labor Party will, true to form, abandon. Taxpayer funds should be used to deliver equity in under-served areas, and to ensure that regional and rural Australians are not left behind in the ongoing telecommunications technology revolution. We know that the solutions of today will not be sufficient for tomorrow. That is why there needs to be an ongoing dedicated fund for people who otherwise will not be able to get the upgrades and services they deserve and want.
The government has the only plan that will deliver fast internet to 100 per cent of Australians by 2009. When you contrast it with Labor’s so-called plan, which leaves out thousands of the most needy Australians, it is clear that Labor’s plan is a substantially flawed proposal that will not even provide a service until 2013. It is a fair time to 2013. We do not know what technology will be the best solution by 2013, but we know that the Labor Party has very little understanding or grasp of the need to roll out a fast internet solution. In fact, Labor’s proposal is so underdeveloped and incomplete that it has been incapable of providing a map, costing or developed plan—not even an indicative map—to show where this mythical fibre-to-the-node plan will roll out. I think the cat has been well and truly belled in relation to Labor’s plan. It seems quite clear that the Labor Party not only has not thought through this plan but also has absolutely no way to develop a plan of a roll-out to 98 per cent of the population.
Anyone who knows anything about telecommunications knows that Labor’s plan is farcical. In fact, it is a fraud on the Australian people. The Australian people need an internet service that will be available to all Australians—and that is what they are going to get from the Howard government. The bill that I have put forward will ensure that the Communications Fund cannot be pillaged for a plan that industry has said that it will develop. The bill protects the long-term interests of regional, rural and remote Australia, and it will protect regional Australia from the ineptitude and the gross economic irresponsibility of the Labor Party. It is important that these funds be locked away so that they will be available for the purpose for which they were established—that is, to look after the neediest Australians. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2007-09-10,"—I do not often speak on the adjournment, but I am moved to speak on the adjournment tonight. I had the opportunity to go to the Ballarat electorate in conjunction with Samantha McIntosh, who wanted to point out to me some issues that were occurring in that electorate. One of the main reasons for going was to look at disability services, but I went to look at aged care in Bacchus Marsh.
Before I talk about that, I want to talk about an absolutely outrageous campaign that has been waged against Samantha McIntosh in the electorate of Ballarat. There have been advertisements on the television which are totally inappropriate, appalling and misleading. They misrepresent a young woman who, with her family, has built up a business which has brought jobs and other benefits to Ballarat. This young family has bought houses, renovated them and moved; bought houses, renovated them and moved—and, as anyone who knows anything about renovating houses will know, it is not easy. They have finally bought an amazing old building in Ballarat that was owned by, I think, the hospital. They have renovated it, with the kids helping with painting, to its splendid Victorian original state, and they now use it for bed and breakfast accommodation to raise money for charities, and they have tourist events where people have high teas and are told about the history of the building and the history of Ballarat.
What do Labor do? They deride her by suggesting that she is living in some mansion. This is a home in which the children live while the business goes on around them. It is not an easy thing to do when there is a function in the kitchen and the kids are trying to study and do things. This family lives on the premises. They have worked their hearts out to build a successful business. What do Labor do? They portray them on the television as wealthy people. These are businesspeople who have worked their fingers to the bone to build up a small business.
What do Labor do? They put a shot of a building on the TV, on the pretext that it is this building, with a Mercedes-Benz outside so as to imply that the family drive a Mercedes-Benz. Nothing is further from the truth. I am advised the shot was not even of their building. And, anyway, people do go there in Jaguars and Mercedes-Benz to visit Ballarat and stay at their wonderful B&B. Labor pulled the ads but after the damage was done. I hope it backfires on them. Samantha McIntosh is a tremendous young woman who has gone through some challenging health issues with her young family. She and her husband have built a business up out of nothing. It is the old motto of former Senator Richardson: whatever it takes—denigrate, mislead, misrepresent, it does not matter, and never say ‘sorry,’ never apologise.
We went to Bacchus Marsh with Samantha. One of the things that was highlighted to me was that Bacchus Marsh needed more aged care, particularly more low-care and high-care places. We visited Grant Lodge, a facility administered by the Djerriwarrh Health Services. It passed what I call ‘my mum’ test: if my mother were still alive, would I like to have her live there? The care by the staff was outstanding—the facility is old and needs a lot of work done, if not rebuilding—and the love given to the residents there was exemplary. But I do not want to talk about the staff of Djerriwarrh services or Grant Lodge; I want to talk about the Victorian Labor government.
The facility passed 44 out of the 44 care standards set by the Commonwealth, which indicates that the staff there are providing appropriate and very good care. But I thought to myself: why is the building so old and why have they not applied for more aged-care places in previous rounds? Then I discovered that Grant Lodge is one of the aged-care facilities which are run by the public sector, the Victorian government. There are about 195 or so public sector residential aged-care facilities run by about 85 agencies across Victoria. About 80 per cent of them are located in rural and regional areas. Something which has interested me, from when I first became interested in aged care in Victoria, is that aged care in Victoria is quite different from aged care in almost every other state, other than most probably South Australia, where a significant proportion of aged-care places are provided by the state government. The Australian government provides recurrent residential aged-care funding, based on residents’ care needs, from time to time providing funds for specific capital purposes. However, capital works funding for Victorian public sector aged-care facilities is primarily the responsibility of the state government, administered through the Department of Human Services. Victoria, as I have said, has the largest involvement in residential aged care of any of the Australian jurisdictions. About 6,500 older Victorians are accommodated in Victorian public sector facilities. In the majority of cases, the agencies which provide public sector residential aged care are health services. They are required to comply with the same certification and accreditation requirements which apply to other providers of residential aged care.
An edifying document on the Bracks and Brumby record on the provision of aged care in public sector facilities can be found in the Victorian Auditor-General’s August 2006 report: Condition of public sector residential aged care facilities. It highlights the failures of the Bracks and Brumby administration in this area—a lack of overall planning and a lack of oversight of the Commonwealth’s 2005 grant of $3,500 per resident place to improve building standards. In fact, the report suggests that 65 per cent, or $13 million, of the total grants may have been unspent, and they need to be spent in this area.
There was evidence that communities which raised funds to support their public sector aged-care facilities may be penalised by a reduction in funds available to them for capital improvement. The report also pointed out that facilities with a higher number of low-care beds and higher SES areas were benefiting disproportionately from the benefits of accommodation bonds and extra charges. In addition, it was found that there was a wide variation in the per cent of residents paying bonds at the maximum level, which was limited to ineffective local practices and policies. I recommend that people have a look at that report. It is a damning indictment of Labor’s appalling record. The Auditor-General’s report concluded that the Victorian Department of Human Services:
… does not adequately plan for managing the condition of public sector residential aged care facilities.
The report was about the condition of public sector residential aged-care facilities. They were not looking at planning for the future. I have no doubt that, if a review had been undertaken of the Victorian government’s plans to redevelop and increase the provision of aged care in Victoria, the same conclusion would have been drawn.
The people of Victoria deserve better; the people of Bacchus Marsh deserve better. The burgeoning population of Bacchus Marsh and the surrounding areas need to know that the Victorian government is planning for their future. Just keeping the status quo in Grant Lodge is insufficient. There are no low-care beds. People cannot age in place; there are only high-care beds. The people of Bacchus Marsh should be demanding that the Victorian government rebuild and extend the facility so the people of Bacchus Marsh can take advantage of the $1.6 billion federal government funding which has gone to the recently announced aged-care reform package Securing the Future of Aged Care for Australians. If the Victorian government got its act together, older people in Bacchus Marsh could benefit from some of the 32,000 new places planned for the next three years.
I hope I do not go back there when I am no longer in the Senate and find that they still have not applied for places, because they have not planned for them. I am glad that Samantha McIntosh took me to Bacchus Marsh. She is a candidate who is already showing how she will stand up for the people of the Ballarat electorate. That is what they need—someone who will stand up, who will fight for the issues affecting people from Bacchus Marsh in the east of the electorate right across to the west. I call on the Victorian government to lift its game and give the older residents of Bacchus Marsh, and the rest of Victoria where aged-care facilities are run, access to care they need and deserve.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Ms Samantha McIntosh</title>,Adjournment,18,1,speech
