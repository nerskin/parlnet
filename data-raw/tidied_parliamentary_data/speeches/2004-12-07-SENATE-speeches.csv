"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-12-07,"—The Australian Democrats know that the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2004 is required for the funding of Indigenous schools and communities by January next year, so we do not want to stand in the way of funds reaching those schools and other institutions. That money is desperately needed by Indigenous students. However, we do want to put on the record our strong opposition to the way in which this government has gutted the Indigenous Education Direct Assistance Program. I also want to emphasise how severely lacking this supplementary funding is. The bill provides funding for the next four years for education and training of Indigenous students through two programs: the Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives Program and the Indigenous Education Direct Assistance Program. It continues the away from home base element of Abstudy at 2004 levels and it introduces accountability arrangements involving extensive and detailed reporting on Indigenous education programs.
Our main concern with these changes is the very clear and real lack of improvement in funding for Indigenous education. This bill contains a mere five per cent increase in real terms on funding between 2002 and 2003. There are also concerns about the redistribution of funds to remote communities. Secondly, the extensive reporting requirements, which we effectively dealt with yesterday in the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill, make it clear that the government is approaching Indigenous education funding with the same mainstreaming approach. The problem with Indigenous communities, particularly those in the more remote areas of Australia, is that they will not have the resources to fulfil the requirements of reporting. Thirdly, we think the election commitment to fund boarding places for students from remote communities and the additional city based apprenticeships and other tertiary training places represents yet another example of the government's policy-on-the-run approach to Indigenous affairs. These programs do not address a whole range of very complex issues regarding remote Indigenous communities and we are yet to see the details of either program.
I think we need to remember that the education we are talking about here is for Indigenous Australians, who have the lowest literacy and numeracy rates in the country by a long way, and I might say lower than so many other countries as well. The Indigenous population is growing at close to twice the rate of non-Indigenous Australians. Contributions to Indigenous education should be increasing, in our view. We have the chance to exponentially improve the education statistics and, more importantly, the life opportunities of Indigenous Australians through education, given the burgeoning young population. I think we are yet to embrace this opportunity in a productive way.
Unfortunately, this legislation does not move in that direction at all. Although the hard work and commitment of many Indigenous and non-Indigenous educators must be acknowledged, the statistics remain shocking. Only half of young Indigenous people aged between 15 and 19 attend secondary school. Only 10 per cent complete their year 12 qualifications—less than a third of non-Indigenous completion rates. Although the number of Indigenous people at universities has increased, the percentage of Indigenous university students has actually decreased over the Howard government's years. Considering that the percentage of Indigenous young people is increasing at a faster rate than that of non-Indigenous people, we would expect the university trend to be going in the opposite direction. Universities are making up for the drastic inequalities in education standards of Indigenous people through special entry programs—70 per cent of Indigenous university students gained entry through special entry programs, compared with just 20 per cent of non-Indigenous students. We should clearly be addressing the inequalities at preschool, primary school and secondary school so that these programs become less necessary. I would also make the point that the specific funding provided through this legislation, although supplementary, is often the most relevant and targeted funding for Indigenous students. Until mainstream educational institutions and curricula reflect and include the experiences of Indigenous Australia, mainstream funding will not deliver equal benefits to Indigenous students. 
It is the most disadvantaged Australians that the government is again short-changing with these amendments to the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act. This government has a history of saving money on Indigenous education. In January 2000, changes to Indigenous education funding for Abstudy were estimated to produce savings to the government of approximately $75.2 million for the year 2000 alone. In the last funding quadrennium, from 2001 to 2004, these changes have clearly saved the government a substantial sum. The Indigenous Education Direct Assistance Program review of this year revealed that funding for the program in its previous form had not received any major increases in funding since its establishment in 1991-92. According to the Australian Education Union, even the indexation of the Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives Program, or IESIP, is applied at a much lower rate than all other schools funding.
Given this history, I think we need to be clear about the money the government claims to be spending generously on Indigenous education. This eight per cent increase over the next four years is the only significant increase in the program's 16 years. Given the distinct lack of growth in previous years, this is hardly substantial. The increase in supplementary recurrent assistance, or SRA, is due to increased enrolments, as the funding is on a per capita basis. Indigenous enrolments in the schooling sector alone increased by 5.4 per cent from 2001 to 2002. This so-called new money—$86.3 million—does not constitute extra expenditure on a per capita basis. SRA funding for education providers who are being reclassified from remote to non-remote areas and funding for students in cities will be frozen at 2004 levels. This is despite the fact that enrolments are increasing in regional and urban areas too. That means there will be a real loss to non-remote Indigenous students.
Given the government's response to the idea of cutting funding to elite private schools, one might expect them to apply their `no losers' policy to Indigenous students as well but, sadly, this is not the case. Since we are constantly being reminded of the fact that we are living in a time of record national prosperity, these cost-cutting exercises in one of Australia's areas of greatest need are truly offensive. Essentially, the government are trying to spread existing funding further. What this means is that, where some improvements have been made so that those particular Indigenous students do not appear to be the most disadvantaged Indigenous students, the government are directing the funding to Indigenous students that are even more disadvantaged—a new measurement of disadvantage that does not consider the rest of the population. 
The risk of this approach is that any progress already made will be ruined, but the government seems prepared to take that risk. Instead of investing more money overall, the funding will just be rejigged and stretched further. I think it is necessary to outline a few of the ways in which the government's changes risk sacrificing gains to stretch further and further. Firstly, the government is purporting to address disadvantage in remote communities by redirecting supplementary recurrent assistance funds from regional and urban Indigenous students to newly classified remote students. There is no doubt that remote communities require increased funding. However, the assumption on which this redistribution is based is that urban Indigenous people benefit significantly from mainstream education—a premise which is not supported by the statistics or the anecdotal evidence. There will be losers in this plan. Indigenous students in urban areas will receive less per student than in previous years.
Secondly, the Aboriginal Students Support and Parent Awareness—ASSPA—scheme will no longer be funded on a per capita basis but on the basis of applications. The per capita formula left decision making in the hands of parents and resulted in some very positive parent-school partnerships. The government's media releases state that the DEST review of the Indigenous Education Direct Assistance Program found that formula based funding was `no longer an appropriate approach'. I will not be the first person to point out that a reading of this document reveals no such finding. However, it does include a statement that the `ASSPA program in itself is no longer an appropriate intervention' to achieve the involvement of Indigenous parents in educational decision making. This is a dubious statement for the government to use, given that it comes with no supporting evidence.
Since the numbers of Indigenous students are growing, per capita formula based funding would also mean an increase in the total funding. So, instead, the government will now distribute funds on the basis of applications. This will mean that some ASSPAs will find it difficult to get any funding: some will not have applications approved and some will find it too difficult to apply at all—for example, those parents who do not write English. A competitive system such as this is likely to result in the most powerful ASSPAs receiving significantly more funding than others and will disempower the least educated of the communities. That was borne out by the inquiry into Indigenous education. When we went to some of the more remote communities, it was quite clear that there were some that just did not get their act together to write grant applications—and these will be the schools that miss out.
Thirdly, the funding for the Vocational and Educational Guidance for Aboriginals Scheme, or VEGAS—a scheme which supports projects in relation to future study or careers for school students, parents and Indigenous people in custody—is being rolled into the whole of school intervention strategy, along with other ASSPA schemes. The submission based funding, with a narrower set of guidelines, means many of the projects will simply no longer be funded. Fourthly, the funding for the successful Indigenous Tutorial Assistance Scheme will also be spread further. Instead of tutoring for all Indigenous students to prevent them falling behind on benchmark testing, the new structure will only offer tutoring to students in years 4, 6 and 8 when they fail to meet certain standards. Perhaps the government has not done its research, but the Productivity Commission's 2003 statistics indicate that children who are behind in year 3 are less likely to remain at school beyond the compulsory age. Only 72 per cent of Indigenous students nationally, compared with a 90 per cent student average, achieve the year 3 reading benchmarks. This is clearly saying that we must catch Indigenous children before they fail the year 3 tests. It is also at odds with the tutorial scheme we dealt with yesterday which applies to mainstream schools and goes to every student who has failed that year 3 benchmark test. 
The second main area of concern for the Democrats is the accountability provisions. We are obviously not opposed to accountability. Indeed, we understand that the states would be made to account for their expenditure on Indigenous education, and we welcome that. We agree that funding should make it to the people for whom it is intended. A finding of our Indigenous education inquiry was that some states and, in particular, territories were squirreling away this money and not using it on Indigenous people, so this is a welcome amendment. However, the government knows no bounds when it comes to accountability requirements on money for Indigenous people.
Given that the amendments of which I am speaking are purportedly about making Indigenous education providers more accountable, I want to emphasise the double standards in this government's approach to accountability. On the one hand, much of what the government is doing to Indigenous education is by guidelines, not legislation for the parliament to consider, and yet we are being asked to pass legislation which demands an excessive amount of reporting by schools, Indigenous organisations and community groups under the veil of accountability, with no extra resources allocated for that purpose.
Through these amendments, the government is effectively reserving the right to require an education provider to collect data on performance indicators and targets—again with no additional resources. It also provides that funding recipients are required to report not only on the planned expenditure and the actual expenditure of Commonwealth funds but also on the way in which the recipient has advanced and intends to advance the objectives of the act from other non-Commonwealth funds—again with no additional resources. The Democrats recognise the need for better data collection in Indigenous education, but it seems that the time, energy and resources required to fulfil these reporting demands will come out of the funding for the educational initiatives themselves.
The $39 million over four years for the Indigenous Youth Leadership Program and the Indigenous Youth Mobility Program is another example of this government's ill-conceived and hastily implemented policy on Indigenous education. Aside from being an absolute pittance, these programs do nothing about the state of proper schooling in remote communities or about the problems associated with low retention rates of Indigenous students in city boarding schools. One of the reasons identified by Noel Pearson for the very low retention rates of Indigenous students at boarding school was that they enter at an educational level far below that of their peers due to the poor education in their communities. That in itself should indicate to the government that the narrow approach to funding places in the city is unlikely to produce any different results.
In conclusion, the Democrats will of course support the passage of this bill, but only because the people who would suffer from a delay are the Indigenous students and communities relying on that funding. The funding is again provided at a minimum, as it has been for 16 years. We urge the government to consider the points made in our second reading amendment and to engage communities in the decision-making process regarding the education of their children. I would also point out that this bill has been referred to the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee, which will give the Aboriginal community a chance to have their say on these measures, even if it is after the bill goes through. We hope that the findings and recommendations of that committee will be properly considered. I move: 
At the end of the motion, add:
“but the Senate:
	(a)	notes that:
	(i)	funding for the Indigenous Education Direct Assistance program has had no substantial increase since its inception 16 years ago and that in a time of record national prosperity, Indigenous education should be a matter of priority;
	(ii)	the changes to the Aboriginal Student Support and Parent Awareness (ASSPA) scheme and the Indigenous Tutorial Assistance Scheme (ITAS) are being imposed without any genuine consultation with Indigenous communities and with a disregard for the successful elements of these programs; and
	(iii)	the Government's focus on remote communities actually involves a redirection of funding from urban and regional Indigenous students to very remote Indigenous students, rather than increasing the pool of funds for Indigenous education in recognition of the level of disadvantage of Indigenous students relative to non-Indigenous students; and
	(b)	calls on the Government to: 
	(i)	provide a substantial increase in funding under the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000,
	(ii)	guarantee that targeted assistance funding is indexed at a rate comparable to other schools funding, and 
	(iii)	consult with parents and teachers before going ahead with the restructuring of the ASSPA scheme and the ITAS”.",SENATE,<title>INDIGENOUS EDUCATION (TARGETED ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2004-12-07,"—I rise to contribute to the debate on the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2004. No doubt people who know of my contributions in this chamber will know that this is a fairly passionate subject for me and has been now for the best part of nearly three decades.
The stated purpose of this bill is to amend the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 in order to improve Indigenous education outcomes and to appropriate that money for Indigenous education that is over and above mainstream funding for the period 2005 to 2008. It does so through the provision of funding for both the Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives Program, commonly known in the industry as IESIP—prior to that it was known as AEP, the Aboriginal Education Program—and the Indigenous Education Direct Assistance Program, the acronym of which is IEDA. These include elements of what was the Aboriginal Tutorial Assistance Scheme, which will now be known as the Indigenous Tutorial Assistance Scheme, and what is known as ASSPA funds. ASSPA stands for Aboriginal Students Support and Parental Awareness, and it now seems to be located under what is termed the Whole of School Intervention Strategy, about which I will talk more later.
We all would be only too well aware of the need to improve Indigenous education outcomes in this country. The social justice report of earlier this year was fairly scathing in what it had to say about the Howard government's outcomes in the field of Indigenous affairs as a whole. While some things have improved, the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people remains large and has not closed. This certainly applies across the various levels of education. In his second reading speech, the Minister for Education, Science and Training claimed: 
Closing the education divide between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians remains one of this government's highest education priorities.
When I look closely at the implications of this bill, I fail to see how that will be the case. Associate Professor Boni Robertson, according to an article in the Campus Review, has said that funding for Indigenous education needs to be drastically increased considering the large percentage of young people in the Indigenous population and the discrepancy between the participation and graduation rates of Indigenous Australians across all levels of education and that of the non-Indigenous population. According to the article, she said of this bill that the slashing of affirmative action programs like ASSPA and other Indigenous education in schools this year needed to be urgently addressed. She also said that renewed funding by both sides of government to implement Indigenous language programs and address the extraordinary high levels of truancy, suspensions and inclusions of young Indigenous students from within the education system was of paramount importance to the ongoing development of Indigenous Australia. So there is no resounding support for the changes outlined in this bill, and Boni Robertson is one person who has spoken out about that. 
However, notwithstanding the problems with the fine print of this bill, as is so often the case with this government, it thinks that outcomes will be improved by having more regulations, more accountability and more funding tied to performance indicators—in other words, more government intervention. We would not deny that accountability is important. We do need and want to know how funds are being used and we would like to know what is being achieved. However, as I will discuss later, the changes being introduced under this bill would appear to have been made with little consultation with the stakeholders, the Indigenous people of this nation, and one can therefore certainly question the educational value of the changes.
I have to say that uncovering the implications of the changes in this bill reveals one of the most incompetent exercises in consultation that I have known the officers of the Department of Education, Science and Training to undertake in the 6½ years that I have been fronting up to them at Senate estimates. We now know that there are 3,800 ASSPA committees in this country. We know that DEST randomly selected 400 of those, sent them a discussion paper and only got 10 responses. It is on the basis of that that these changes are being made. Why were 3,800 ASSPA committees not sent the documentation? Why were there not state or territory consultations and face-to-face consultations? Why were questions not asked about why only 10 responses were received? Did people not understand the changes? Were they not asked to respond to the changes? Were they sent a discussion paper for information only? To make the substantial changes that this bill implies after getting feedback from only 10 committees out of 3,800 shows a lack of scrutiny and accountability that I have not known from DEST officers in the 6½ years that I have been in this place.
I have had many representations from my Indigenous constituents in the Northern Territory, particularly from urban Darwin and Palmerston, who have expressed concern not only about the proposed changes to Indigenous education but also about the way in which those changes were made. They came away from DEST-provided information sessions with far more questions and concerns than they went in with. I still believe to this day, having met parents from those ASSPA committees two weeks ago, that DEST still really has no idea how these changes are going to operate. The government has no plan as to how these changes are going to operate, and we are less than three weeks away from the start of the new year. 
Let me first refer to the figures in this bill. Based on the government's announcement on 5 April, this bill provides $641.6 million over the four-year period from 2005 and 2008, so it is in fact the next quadrennium of IESIP funding. Of this, $513 million is for maintenance of supplementary recurrent funding and $128.1 million is for ongoing and new strategic projects. So this is really an increase of only 16 per cent over a four-year period—a four per cent increase for each year—which hardly provides for any real growth, especially when one considers that demographically, certainly in my electorate, the number of Indigenous people, and hence Indigenous students, is rising very rapidly. One would think that funding for this real growth is essential if outcomes are to be improved.
Again in his speech the minister claimed that the government's approach was to provide greater weighting of resources towards those with greatest disadvantage: those in remote areas. There is little real evidence of that in this bill. Although remote areas do get funded more than urban areas, this has been so for some time, to take account of the greater costs of service delivery in remote areas. Strategic funding will be continued at existing levels of $128.1 million—in other words frozen, in nominal terms. So this is hardly a generous funding bill. It is very hard to see how this funding approach will improve Indigenous outcomes or how it redirects resources to the most disadvantaged. Successful projects such as the National Indigenous English Literacy and Numeracy Strategy, NIELNS, and the scaffolding program are continued, but one would have hoped that successful programs might have been expanded and funded for growth, not frozen at present levels.
The structured scaffolding approach to literacy has proved to be very successful. I have seen it in operation and I know the work of Brian Gray, the instigator of this approach, very well. It is especially successful for teaching Indigenous students in remote areas. It has demonstrated some excellent outcomes in improved student performance. But again, this bill gives little sign that there will be any growth in this program to improve outcomes for a larger number of students.
What most concerns both me and my Indigenous constituents, however, is the proposed changes under IEDA to programs such as ASSPA and ITAS, where funding arrangements are changed in a most significant way. Many of these changes that I alluded to earlier we discovered through the process of estimates. The changes are being proposed with minimal consultation. From a government that has abolished the ATSIS organisation, which gave Indigenous people their major voice, I guess it should not come as too big a surprise that there was minimal consultation on these changes.
Let me move to what some of these changes are going to be. In a media release on 5 April the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Brendan Nelson, said:
... we've funded a range of things over the last four years which we've had evaluated that have been found not to deliver the outcomes that they should, for example, the Aboriginal Student Support and Parent Awareness Committees. There are 3,800 of these committees throughout Australia and the review which we conducted—
remember, DEST randomly sampled 400 of those committees and got a response from 10 of them— 
found that they have delivered quite poor outcomes educationally for Aboriginal students.
There is a group of people connected with ASSPA committees working in Darwin and Palmerston and the greater rural area, and I know that Warren Snowdon has been working with a similar group of people in Alice Springs. The work that they have done over the last four or five months is to be absolutely commended. They have formed a group of combined ASSPA committees to fight at every chance they possibly can the changes to this legislation. In a newspaper that they put out in June they say:
What Dr Nelson doesn't say is that ASSPA has never been allocated the level of funding necessary to achieve the educational outcomes he is talking about. The facts are that in urban-based schools, ASSPA gets $110 per ... student a year. That's $2.75 per student per week ($4 for secondary students).
Given those figures and the restrictive funding guidelines, it is completely unrealistic for the Howard government to expect ASSPA to achieve beyond that which it is currently funded to do.
In an age when this government talks about mutual obligation and quid pro quo for access to services by Indigenous people in response to funding from this government, this is an area that absolutely reeks of hypocrisy. It talks about welfare reform for Indigenous people. It talks about mutual obligation. It talks about increased rights and responsibilities Indigenous people need to undertake, yet it attacks the very committees that currently only get $2.75 per Indigenous student per week through the ASSPA committees. One has to seriously question the motivation of this government and, as I said, its absolutely hypocritical stance and the jargon it uses when it talks about welfare reform and mutual obligation. Mutual obligation, according to this government, is a one-way street. Indigenous people will be forced to walk it, and there will be no reciprocal obligation on behalf of this government, and this bill is the very first example of that.
If this government were genuine in its comments about welfare reform and mutual obligation, ASSPA committees would not be abolished or changed, they would be strengthened and their funding increased. But these people are going to have crawl up hill and down dale, put in grant submissions and compete for this funding. That means that some schools will miss out under these changed arrangements. The people that have been working flat out to try and bring about some equity and justice and to get their concerns highlighted are fantastic people like Delsie Tamiano from Palmerston High School. She has been a power of strength in the last couple of months in bringing Indigenous people together in urban centres to get them to understand the implications of these changes. I refer also to Robbie Robinson from Alice Springs, Cherie Holtze from Taminmin high, Mark Munnich, Sharna Raye from Palmerston High School, Sharna Taut from Malak Primary School, Gloria Craigie, Patty Raymond and Eddie McKenzie. There are a whole lot of terrific urban Indigenous people who are fighting for some extra money out of this government to maintain ASSPA committees and keep the system as it currently is, because they believe that they are achieving significant outcomes—outcomes that this government, through a flawed consultation process, has not bothered to look at or consider.
I was told in estimates hearings that consultations were also held with ATSIC and Indigenous education consultative bodies. Unfortunately, there is no Indigenous education consultative body in the Northern Territory, so I am not sure who this government talked to in the Northern Territory. So we missed out on the consultations despite having the largest percentage of the national Indigenous population. I have to say again that the consultations were not good enough; they were cursory, badly handled and managed only minimally before DEST decided on some fairly major changes which are now of serious concern to Indigenous people in the Northern Territory. These changes have been publicised through information sessions, and I am told the minister wrote to all school principals and ASSPA committees. However, this is telling people of changes already made, over which they have not been consulted and for which they can see little reason. 
From next year ASSPA committees as such will be abolished on the ground, according to the government, that they were not working efficiently to achieve outcomes. However, in many cases in the Northern Territory they were the only contact Indigenous parents had with the school. Let us never forget the reason why ASSPA committees were established—a history and a background which I am closely associated with. Of the 21 Aboriginal education goals, goal No. 1 was to encourage more participation by Aboriginal parents in their child's schooling. Goal No. 1 was established in 1989. The outcome of that and the way in which it was implemented—in other words, the performance indicator—was the establishment of ASSPA committees that worked alongside school councils, where they could, and alongside school principals, and were given a discrete bucket of funding in order to set some educational outcomes. In some areas we know that involves breakfast programs so that kids can be fed before they start the school day. It was about homework centres, after-school-hours programs, additional excursions and extending that child's educational program over and above what the school provided. Let us never forget the key reason why ASSPA programs were invented in the first place: it was predominantly to get Indigenous parents involved, committed and participating in their child's education.
There are cases in the Northern Territory where ASSPA committees are the only contact, as I said, between Indigenous parents and the school. In urban areas where Indigenous students are usually in the minority in schools, they were the only school communities that Indigenous parents felt comfortable attending or speaking at. The DEST Review of the Indigenous education direct assistance program at page 40 states:
Improving the participation of Indigenous parents in school education is a national priority—
oh yeah—
to improve student outcomes ...
So this government seeks to abolish the very committees that encouraged that participation, and it talks about mutual obligation! That same review on page 41 said:
There was support for the concept of the ASSPA program among those consulted. Many ... were of the view that ... it [is] one of the most important Indigenous education programs.
So what happens? This government is deciding to abolish them. Are we perhaps back to some hidden agenda of assimilation? I do not think that agenda is hidden anymore; it is well and truly out in the open. So from next year ASSPA funding is to be abolished. No longer will schools with Indigenous students automatically receive the funding amount according to the number of Indigenous students.
What we now know is that those committees, if they seek to exist, No. 1 have to become part of or associated with a school council, and No. 2 will have to put in a grant application to access those funds. In the case where you might have 10 or 20 Indigenous kids in a school and are looking at $110 per student per year, it is probably not a lot of money. But in cases like Yirrkala in the Northern Territory that is $60,000—that is a hell of a decent sized grant application, I would have thought. Who is going to write it—the principal, staff at the school or Indigenous parents? 
I put it to the Senate that Indigenous parents will not have the time. I put it to the Senate that staff are already overloaded with an administrative burden. So I do not understand, in this day and age, when Indigenous education participation and outcomes are at their lowest levels, why we seek to create more hurdles for people to access Indigenous education funding when the system was working fine and needed only to be strengthened and encouraged, not abolished or changed.
In conclusion, there are many aspects of this bill, particularly in relation to the ITAS funding, that I know my colleague Warren Snowdon has addressed in the other place. I am glad that the Senate has referred the implications of the proposed changes to funding arrangements contained in this bill to the Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee for inquiry. The funding changes proposed in this bill need very close scrutiny. I hope the Senate committee will provide Indigenous parents with the chance to be consulted and to voice their views about the changes proposed in the bill. This government has never provided those parents with the chance to have a say about this matter. The Senate will take up those reins, step into the shoes of DEST and the government, and give those parents a voice.

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2004-12-07,"—I had the opportunity to listen to some of the remarks made by Senator Crossin in her contribution to the second reading debate on the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2004. Of course, given that she is a senator for the Northern Territory, she takes a particular interest in these matters. Despite the fact that there is no doubt that Senator Crossin can make intelligent contributions to debates, I never get the feeling that she ever really tackles the central issues. Having listened very carefully to Senator Crossin's comments, I did not get a feeling for where the real, fundamental problems were and what the Labor Party's approach to those problems was. The Labor Party's approach to Indigenous policy over the years has been marked `F' for `fail', in my view.
I will tackle some of the matters that Senator Crossin raised in her remarks. I think it is important, Senator Crossin, when you make a contribution to a debate, that you get your facts straight. I must say that in my consultation with officers I get the distinct feeling that on a number of key issues the facts of the case have eluded you. I would not say that you have deliberately ignored them, because I would not believe that you would do such a thing, but you perhaps need to carry out some further research in order to make sure that your facts are correct.
This bill amends the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 in order to maintain and enhance the Australian government's effort in improving education outcomes for Indigenous Australians over the 2005-08 funding quadrennium. The bill provides funding for both the Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives Program and the Indigenous Education Direct Assistance program for the 2005-08 quadrennium. IESIP provides supplementary recurrent funding as well as funding for significant national initiatives and special projects. IEDA provides funding for the Indigenous Tutorial Assistance Scheme and funding to support a whole-of-school intervention strategy. The bill also provides for the continuation of the away from base element of Abstudy for the 2005-08 funding quadrennium. 
The bill provides additional funding for two new government initiatives: the Indigenous Youth Leadership Program, which aims to identify and develop future Indigenous leaders, focusing mainly on remote communities; and the Indigenous Youth Mobility Program, which will assist young Indigenous people who, with the support of their communities, choose to relocate to capital cities or major provincial centres to take up employment and training opportunities, targeting apprenticeships and other occupations such as nursing, accountancy, business management and teaching. This funding is part of a $2.1 billion package of measures aimed at improving Indigenous education outcomes over the next four years.
The issue of accountability is one which is often raised by senators. The bill includes provisions to strengthen the accountability arrangements for agreements made under the act. It specifies commitments and conditions, including financial and educational accountability conditions, that must be included in agreements. It includes a provision enabling the minister to intervene to address underperformance by funding recipients. The provisions include the introduction of school attendance benchmarks, measuring outcomes at the remote rural, provincial and metro level; the transparent reporting of expenditure on Indigenous education to ensure that all money provided annually gets to the intended recipients; and sanctions for failure to report.
One of the issues that Senator Crossin raised at some length—some would say at some tedious length but certainly at some length—regarded consultation on the IEDA review. The opposition questions the consultation process for the IEDA review. The final discussion points were sent to 400 ASSPA committees, all directors-general of education and Indigenous education consultative bodies and Indigenous support units. Sixty-two written responses were received, including, I point out to Senator Crossin, only 10 from ASSPA committees. In addition, 25 case studies were conducted, at least seven of which focused on ASSPA committees. 
The opposition really needs to get its facts straight on this issue before launching into an attack on DEST. I am advised that the officers have done a very conscientious job. I point out that on 5 April the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Nelson, wrote to all ASSPA committees to inform them of the changes to the way the government proposes to support them during the 2005-08 quadrennium. He informed them—and I quote:
The per student funding formula for ASSPA committees will be replaced by a proactive submission process that will require committees to work closely with schools to identify specific approaches to address Indigenous learning needs.
The opposition is critical of the government for directing its supplementary Indigenous education funding to those Indigenous students at greatest educational disadvantage—those in remote areas. That is a rather surprising attack, I would have thought. Let me assure the Senate that this government will unashamedly direct resources to these students, whilst at the same time maintaining a level of supplementary funding for Indigenous students in metropolitan areas. There is no doubt—
—So we'll have more Indigenous students at Geelong Grammar, will we?
—Senator Carr, you had your chance to make a contribution. You arrived in the chamber late, and that is why I am now speaking. This happens from time to time, but you should have been here if you wanted to make a contribution. There is no doubt that Indigenous students in remote areas are faring far worse than Indigenous students in state capital cities and in Canberra. The report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission on Indigenous funding showed this quite conclusively. 
Let me turn now to the second reading amendment. I have pretty much covered it in my remarks, but it will not surprise senators to hear that the government will be opposing the second reading amendment. I understand that the bill is being supported, despite the critical comments that have been made. I reiterate that I think all the criticisms I have heard have been misinformed and not based on the known facts.

"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-12-07,"—I seek to amend the motion so that the bills can be taken separately. Then we can deal with the issue of the Strategic Investment Program for the TCF industry separately from the issue of reducing tariffs which, in the Customs tariff amendment bill, are not sought to be put in place until 2010. A series of other tariff reduction cuts are already in place and will commence on 1 January 2005. There is no proposal in this legislation or anywhere else for there to be any study or analysis of the consequences of the existing tariff cut reductions that come in on 1 January 2005. So to deal with both the issue of a structural adjustment program to compensate people for the tariff reduction cuts that come into effect in 2005 at the same time as trying to deal with tariff reduction cuts coming into play in 2010 is premature. In order for there to be analysis and report reflection by the parliament on the consequences of the existing tariff cut reductions that come into effect on 1 January, I seek to amend the minister's motion so the two bills can be dealt with separately.
I note that the Labor senators who were on the Economics Legislation Committee which considered this piece of legislation in August this year put forward as a recommendation that these two issues be dealt with separately—both the structural adjustment program for the industry, which relates to the tariffs coming into effect on 1 January, and then the subsequent issue of whether or not there should be further tariff reductions coming into play in 2010. It is a view that has been put forward as a recommendation by the Labor senators who were involved in that committee. It is also a view that was put forward to that committee by the Textile Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia in their submission and hearing before the inquiry in August this year. On that basis and in order for us to be able to evaluate what are the consequences of the tariff reductions coming into play in January, I request that the minister's motion be divided so that the two bills are dealt with separately. 
 (Senator Bolkus)—We will divide the question. The question is that these bills be taken together.

—The question now is that these bills may proceed without formalities and be now read a first time.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2004-12-07,"—My question is to Senator Ian Campbell, the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. I refer the minister to his attempt at a defence of Regional Partnerships funding and I ask whether he recalls his challenge to any critic of funding allegations to `go and buy himself a pair of Blundstones, get them a bit dirty and go and talk to the people who are trying to build regional Australia'. Is the minister aware that a Regional Partnerships grant of $220,000 has been awarded to a project based on Bondi in the electorate of Wentworth, one of Australia's wealthiest urban localities and possibly the latte capital of Australia? Would the minister care to revise his own Blundstone challenge to a pair of thongs, a beach towel and Armani sunglasses?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Regional Services: Program Funding</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,question
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2004-12-07,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I would be interested if the minister could tell us how a grant of $220,000 to a Bondi project in the seat of Wentworth assisted regional Australia. Perhaps he could also tell us why the seat of Wentworth received more money under the Regional Partnerships program than 80 other electorates, including many in rural and regional Australia. Could it have anything to do with the Liberal Party's bitter preselection battle in this blue-ribbon seat that led it to being such a contest?
—The last part of that question, Senator, was asking for an opinion and, as you know, that is not allowed. But I ask the honourable minister if he would answer the parts of the supplementary question that were relevant.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Regional Services: Program Funding</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,question
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-12-07,"—I did sympathise with Stephen Smith when he was talking about the countdown of the number of question times on television recently. Clearly, from the quality of that question, Friday's question time cannot come soon enough for Senator O'Brien and the members of the Australian Labor Party, who would probably do well if they went to Bondi themselves, had a good lie down and soaked up a bit of sunshine. 
This is a question from the Australian Labor Party about programs within the regional services portfolio when yesterday, asking questions about that portfolio and those programs, they criticised Primary Energy Australia Pty Ltd in relation to their grants under the program that Senator O'Brien refers to in his question. Senator Wong, Senator Carr and, more recently, Senator O'Brien, have asked questions about four or five different programs that the company had sought assistance under. I remind Australian Labor Party senators, and in fact all senators, that companies from regional Australia who seek to develop programs that assist employment right across Australia, if they have proposals, quite often come to local, state and federal governments trying to find what sorts of programs are available to assist them to develop their ideas. Usually these ideas are aimed at improving the economy and the employment prospects for people within the region. We saw, in attacking this program yesterday, the Australian—
—Mr President, on a point of order: I have brought this to your attention a couple of times this week, but I think ministers have fallen into the habit of just reminiscing, rambling and attacking the Labor Party rather than actually seeking in any way to answer the question. The minister was asked a question about the Regional Partnerships grant in Bondi. He has not at all attempted to deal with those issues. While I know you allow some leeway, it seems to me the leeway has got to the point where question time is becoming pointless. Please would you ask him to address the question.
—Mr President, on that point of order: I draw the Senate's attention to your statement yesterday about the types of questions that are being asked by the Labor Party in question time. You said that, apart from the point that question time is meant to be a time for questions, senators' questions would be far more effective and telling if they were not surrounded with statements, assertions, allegations, insinuations and other extraneous material. I put to you, Mr President, that that question that the Labor Party are now trying to rule that Senator Ian Campbell is somehow not answering contained all of those issues. 
—Mr President, on the point of order: unfortunately, I was not here yesterday to hear your eminent words, but I would have thought that the question was entirely consistent with many questions asked on both sides of this chamber for quite some time. I was quoting the minister's own comments in an answer to a question back to him and asking him to comment on that. I assert that that is in order and, indeed, there was no suggestion that the question was out of order when it was put and the minister rose to his feet.
—Thank you, Senator. I did circulate my statement yesterday to those senators who were not here. Just as I cannot direct ministers how to answer questions, I cannot direct senators how to ask them, but I would remind the minister that there are two minutes remaining and remind him of the question that was asked.
—Bob Hogg, Michael Costello, Bob McMullan and a range of others do not need any help from me. I will just stick to the issues and the program. They are trying to denigrate the Regional Partnerships program because they do not like the government supporting employment projects, projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions or projects or proponents that support communities and build capacity and jobs in regional Australia. Having failed in attacking—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! Senators on my left: stop shouting across the chamber. And I remind the minister of the question.
—The question relates to the Regional Partnerships program of the government, which has given grants to places right across Australia, including to the Marine Discovery Centre in Bondi, which is a program that supports these projects across Australia and builds jobs in regional Australia. The Labor Party want to tear the program down piece by piece. They are prepared to bring it down in Gunnedah and they are prepared to bring it down in Bondi. What I suggest to the Australian Labor Party is that, rather than tearing down the program and being oppositionist, destructive, negative, carping and whining, they be positive.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-12-07,"—I will do my very best, Mr President, and thank you for your assistance and guidance. The Bondi Marine Discovery Centre has received a $201,000 grant. It is a proposal which will expand the primary school program and create secondary school programs, Indigenous coastal tours, film production, advertising, fit-out, launch, order and evaluation. The project was contracted on 7 October. It has commenced. It is another example of the government helping to improve the understanding of our environment, particularly by our younger generations. The program has also received funding from my own department, $18,282 from the Envirofund, $100,000 from New South Wales Fisheries' recreational fishing trusts and a range of other grants.

"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,2004-12-07,"—My question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate and the Minister for Defence, Senator Hill. Would the minister inform the Senate of progress being made in Iraq in the lead-up to next year's democratic elections? How is the Australian Defence Force contributing to this progress? Is the minister aware of any alternative policies?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,question
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-12-07,"—I thank Senator Ferguson for his question. I know he, as Chair of the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, has a deep interest in these matters. The task of building a new Iraq, politically, economically and socially, after the overthrow of the tyrant Saddam Hussein is enormously complex and challenging. A new political structure, a new system of administration, new instruments for national security—external and internal—and a new economic infrastructure are necessary, and that is just a start. Saddam left little that could be built upon. In so many ways, it has meant building a new nation. The vast majority of the Iraqi people have relished the opportunity for democracy, security, freedom from oppression and economic opportunity. They deserve the support of the international community. They do have the support of the UN Security Council, and many billions of dollars have been internationally pledged to assist with reconstruction.
These tasks would be difficult enough without the opposition of a violent and cruel insurgency determined to defeat these reasonable aspirations of the Iraqi people, an insurgency particularly targeting those Iraqis taking public positions in building the new Iraq—politicians, judges, policemen, government workers and the like—and an insurgency which is also fighting to undermine the 30 January election, that expression of democratic choice, particularly through violent intimidation of the process and participants and through cruelly attacking the families of those Iraqis taking a lead.
Australia is part of a multinational force not only approved by the United Nations Security Council but encouraged by the Security Council to assist the Iraqi people with their task. It is dangerous and difficult work but greatly appreciated by the broader Iraqi community. The Australian contribution is also greatly appreciated by others in the multinational force, particularly those such as the United States, which has committed so much in personnel and funding and has suffered great pain in terms of lives lost and injuries.  
The Australian forces continue to be outstanding in their work, whether it is defending our officials, who are so critical to the political process, training the new Iraqi Army, providing health personnel—and our medical team at Balad received many of the wounded, military and civilian, from Fallujah and did a brilliant job—helping air traffic control at Balad, providing air transport including medical evacuation, maritime surveillance and interception and in so many other ways. Not only is their work of the highest professional standard but their good spirited and cooperative approach is appreciated by all. I was pleased last Friday to meet many of them and to convey the appreciation of the government and the Australian people and the best wishes of all of us. I realise that, particularly at Christmas time, this is a tough time for them and their families.
The Iraqi people are determined to press on with their election, despite the dangers and difficulties. I am told some 240 political parties have registered interest. Candidates' lists are being prepared, registration of voters—including Iraqis outside the country—is proceeding, polling booths will be based on the school system and plans for printing the ballot papers are in place. I am told the independent electoral commission is doing a great job. 
Lastly, I was asked about alternative policies. Apparently the new opposition defence spokesperson, Mr McClelland—the third in three years—and Mr Rudd are going to discuss these issues over Christmas. I also invite Mr Latham to take up the briefing that has been offered to him. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,answer
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2004-12-07,"—Senator Greig asked me a question the other day in relation to the Disability Discrimination Act. I have further information for him which I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
Senator Greig asked:
Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Is it not the case that the fact that the family had not sought a bridging visa had nothing to do with why their application was rejected? More importantly, given that the Australian government recently co-sponsored a United Nations General Assembly resolution on the development of a convention on the rights of people with disabilities, is the minister concerned that Australia's apparently discriminatory immigration policy may place Australia in breach of current and perhaps future international human rights obligations in this regard?
Answer:
Australia's immigration laws are consistent with Australia's international human rights obligations.
Section 52 of the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) exempts decisions under the Migration Act and its regulations from the effects and operation of the DDA. The exemption has had long term and bipartisan support to enable the operation of health criteria as part of visa and entry requirements.
Immigration laws do not stop persons with disabilities from being granted visas. People with disabilities can and do migrate to Australia and Australia values their contribution. However the processes operate so that persons who are assessed as likely to impose significant impact on the community may be refused a visa, as Australia has stringent health criteria for people seeking to enter Australia, particularly on a permanent basis.
The health criteria work to protect Australia not only from diseases that present a communicable public health risk such as tuberculosis but also to limit entry of persons who are likely to require expensive, long term or scarce health and welfare resources into the future.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Immigration: Rophin Morris</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,speech
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2004-12-07,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage (Senator Ian Campbell) and the Minister for Defence (Senator Hill) to questions without notice asked by opposition senators today.
It was quite amusing to see Senator Ian Campbell fall into the same trap that he put himself into previously. The first bit of advice I would give to Senator Campbell is: when you get a brief from the National Party, particularly from Minister Anderson about a program that he has shamelessly used to pork-barrel in National Party electorates and to assist the Liberal Party in electorates that they thought they could win or needed to defend, you should look very carefully at the brief and treat with caution the suggestion that was made to him, very obviously, that the form of defence was to attack the Labor Party and say, `This program is all about regional Australia; therefore the Labor Party is attacking regional Australia by questioning this program.' 
It only took one response for that defence to fall to smithereens, to be absolutely shattered. What better example could there be of divergence of the Regional Partnerships program from regional Australia than the advice to the Senate of a program which appears on Mr Anderson's department's web site as being funded under that program—that is, the project, which has been identified finally by Senator Ian Campbell in his answer today, which is located at Bondi in the seat of Wentworth in metropolitan Sydney. Of course, other answers revealed that there are a number of other projects, valued at over $3 million, which happened to have leaked out of regional Australia into metropolitan Australia. When you examine the profile of those approvals you see that they have been in the main directed towards seats which the government needed to defend or which the government thought it had a chance of winning. That is the reality. Wentworth is a good example. 
Who can forget that preselection battle between the disendorsed sitting member, Mr King, and Mr Turnbull. Mr Turnbull, of course, expended a great amount of money and exhorted a whole lot of people to be branch-stacked into the Liberal Party for him to win preselection from a sitting member. The sitting member then fought back and said he would stand as an Independent. So is it surprising that we see $221,000 going into that great electorate of Wentworth, where some of the wealthiest people in Australia live, which contains some of the most expensive housing in the country—that great electorate of Wentworth that has been held by the conservative parties consistently since it was formed? Yet $221,000 is awarded to that electorate. 
I wonder what Mr Abbott said, because his seat did not get any money. What did Mr Abbott do to Mr Anderson? His seat did not get a cracker. But Mr Turnbull's seat got $221,000. Ross Cameron must be absolutely filthy—he could only get $20,000 in the seat of Parramatta. What would Ross Cameron be thinking now—`What did I do wrong?' He obviously regrets what he said to the Telegraph. He probably regrets not checking out who was sharing the flat. Since Senator Ian Campbell suggested last week to Senator Carr that he should go and buy himself a pair of Blundstones, get them a bit dirty and go and talk to people who are trying to build regional Australia, Mr Anderson was reported in the Australian on Saturday as saying that the Regional Partnerships program does not discriminate against particular parts of the country. What it discriminates against, in the main, are seats that are not of interest to the National Party and the Liberal Party. It discriminates against seats such as Warringah or other northern Sydney seats or Banks, Lowe, Blaxland, Reid or Werriwa, which did not get a cracker. What it demonstrates is that this funding program had a set of guidelines on the web site but a big `get out of jail' loophole guideline overriding all of the rest, kept secret since September last year, which allowed the funding of a variety of programs that did not fit the original guidelines.

"McGauran, Sen Julian",NATS,2004-12-07,"—That was an indication of the interest I took in the previous speaker. The opposition really have been dragging this issue out for the last couple of weeks as they have nothing else to occupy their time. Where are the economic questions from the opposition? Wasn't there a commitment, an understanding and a message sent to the opposition after the election about establishing their economic credentials? Isn't that, by their own admission, exactly where they lost the last election? Yet, since the parliament has sat, we have not heard any economic questions; all we have heard is an attack on a legitimate and proper program established by the government for the regions.
The opposition have jumped on the bandwagon of the Independent member for New England, who first raised this issue. He has now been utterly discredited, but that has not stopped the Labor Party from ploughing on with their frivolous and dead-end attack upon the government on this program. This is their modus operandi. When they run out of puff, have nothing to say and are all tortured inside over leadership matters, what do they do? They single out the bush and the programs. Why not? They have very little support out there, and they know it. It is an easy thing for them to kick around. They have been doing it basically ever since the Labor Party began. Certainly the modern Labor Party have no affinity with the regions at all and this is yet another example.
The opposition tried the same thing in the last term. Who can forget their attack on another perfectly legitimate region based program that brought success—the Natural Heritage Trust? They spent weeks and weeks of parliamentary time with fillers attacking the Natural Heritage Trust. Where did it get them? Nowhere at all. There was no penetration in the community because they knew what a great success the program was for the regions and for the environment. That program has been fully funded to this day. We are proud to back the Natural Heritage Trust just as we are proud to support, and will not step back from supporting, the Regional Partnerships program, formerly the Regional Solutions Program. We will not step back from it, Senator O'Brien. In fact, we are proud of it. 
What we like about this program is that it is a bottom-up program. These regional and rural grants have been fashioned around the regional summit of 1997 because we believe they have to come from the bottom up. These programs have to be recognised by the local community, supported quite often by the local council, state government and certainly those most successful area consultative committees, where local leadership gets together to find out what the region requires. This is a real bottom-up program. It has been an enormous success and we are proud to say that we back it. The National Party, most of all, are proud to say that we back it. We have come under attack for supporting this program, but we are unashamedly supportive of this program and unashamedly spokes men and women for our regions. We are unashamedly trying to win the budget dollar, wrestling over the budget dollar.
—East Melbourne?
—I wonder if those on the opposite side of the chamber will ever understand that when you are in government there is only one cake and there is a wrestle for the dollar. That is why rural and regional members, National and Liberal, do go in to bat for their local constituencies with regard to budgetary allocations. We have been very successful, thank you very much. You highlight our success every day in the parliament. 
I suggest you go to Bondi, lie on the beach and have a rest, as was suggested by Senator Macdonald, then come back and start working on your economic credentials. Drop these fillers. They are a complete waste of time. You know that.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2004-12-07,"—I have to say at the start that it is a bit rich to be lectured on financial responsibility by a bloke who had to be saved by a special favour from the ANZ Bank with respect to his financial irresponsibility. In question time today we saw more evidence of this government-rorted, taxpayer-funded program. This program was rorted by the government in order to win favour at the last election. This program took money from the taxpayer in an endeavour to con them and to buy their votes. It is more evidence of the government using taxpayer funds—as Senator O'Brien said, no matter what it takes—in this case for no baser purpose than to buy votes.
The program was geared to development and to development in rural and regional Australia. We saw through evidence today and over the last week or so that the program's outcomes were far distant from its designed objectives. The program's objectives were development, regional development and rural development. Its outcomes in so many circumstances were not the needs of the electorate but the needs of government members in marginal seats. As we saw in question time today, we have the funding of a dog day centre, so aptly called Happy Tails, in Brisbane; we have funding for a church body to fit out a centre from which Hillsong can deliver its employment and mentoring programs to the Redfern community; and we have in my state of South Australia funding of almost $800,000 in metropolitan electorates—not in rural and regional Australia. 
South Australia is a great example. We should look at South Australia in terms of how a program which could have done a lot of good in addressing the needs of rural and regional South Australia was diverted to accommodate and give priority to the needs of government members. There is real need in rural and regional South Australia. In places like the Pit lands to Port Augusta and Port MacDonnell there are communities in real need. Places like Port Lincoln and Clare are burgeoning economies also with infrastructure needs.
But what do we have? We have the funding of some selected programs in accordance with the electoral priorities of government members. I am not saying that the projects that were funded are not worthy of funding; what I am saying is that under this program they should not have been given the priority that they were. This is a program for rural and regional South Australia, for rural and regional Australia. If projects like these can be funded under this program, what about all the other community groups that also had meritorious claims but did not apply because they believed the government's literature that this program could not be accessed by them? What we have is a misappropriation of funds for rural and regional Australia.
As I said, in the state of South Australia close to $800,000 in funds has gone to metropolitan Adelaide. When you look at those projects, you find that six football clubs, two soccer clubs, one church group and one metropolitan transport hub in metropolitan Adelaide received funds. One program for rural students and one project in Morphett Vale, which may in its operation cover rural and regional South Australia, received funds. The Parrakie Football Club got $35,000; the Modbury Junior Football Club got $60,000; the Ingle Farm football club got $35,000; the Golden Grove football club got $30,000; the Para Hills Knights soccer club got $25,000; and the Modbury soccer club upgrade got $25,000. All those clubs are in the seat of Makin. To top it off, $187,000 went to the Golden Grove church redevelopment, which is also in the seat of Makin. So footy clubs won out—but just some football clubs.
What about those football clubs in electorates like Hindmarsh? What about those sports and soccer clubs in inner city Adelaide, in Thebarton and Mile End? They worked under the apprehension that this program was not for them. They worked under the apprehension that Thebarton, Mile End, Lockleys and Henley Beach were not part of rural and regional South Australia, and clubs in those places did not apply. In Adelaide the Kilburn community and sports club—another sports club—got $250,000; the Ovingham sports club got $30,000; a boarding house for Indigenous students at Northfield got $17,000; and a project for the identification of transport logistics and employment opportunities in Enfield got $44,000. Those places are nowhere near rural and regional South Australia. As well as that, a program in the seat of Kingston, in Morphett Vale, got $99,000. That may actually have an outcome for rural and regional South Australia. Sports clubs have needs. This is not the program for them to have those needs met.

"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2004-12-07,"—I rise to speak to Senator O'Brien's motion and to respond to the allegations made by senators from across the chamber. I want to start by responding to the allegations Senator Bolkus laid at this government and at a particular senator on this side with respect to financial irresponsibility and mismanagement. Those allegations came from a senator who was part of a government that in 1996 left the Australian people with a $96 billion debt. He was a key performing minister—or underperforming minister—during that time. 
—What is the debt now? It is $406 billion.
—That debt has been paid off to the extent that it is now less than $30 billion. The government has not only paid off that debt but also has the ability to fund specific programs, Senator George Campbell, to the extent of $5 billion extra each year. That is a Labor debt that has been paid down. Senator Campbell knows that fact, as does the public, because it is on the public record. Senator Bolkus, when he asked a question in question time today, said that we used the Regional Partnerships program to target key marginal seats. The Labor Party attack was specifically based on the stage 2 redevelopment of the Bondi Marine Discovery Centre, which is in the seat of Wentworth in Sydney. That is known as a blue-ribbon Liberal seat. He talked about the pork-barrelling of marginal seats. His argument contradicts itself. It is lost.
Senator O'Brien in his address today talked about the preselection battles for the seat of Wentworth, but he failed to talk about his own preselection battle. He lost the support of the Left, with David Price, who is the State Secretary of the Labor Party in Tasmania, dumping him from the No. 1 spot to the No. 3 spot. Senator O'Brien, those in glass houses can throw stones. That is what happened. You were fortunate enough to retain that position, after a bit of a scramble. Then you started attacking the Hon. Tony Abbott and former parliamentary secretary Ross Cameron and hitting them with a wet lettuce leaf. Let us look at some of the facts, particularly on the Marine Discovery Centre at Bondi. Let us see who has been supporting this very important project. Do you know who has been supporting it? The state Labor government in New South Wales.
—Fancy that!
—Fancy that! Before you asked your question today, Senator O'Brien, did you ask the state Labor government why they made that allocation, why they spent that money and why they wanted to support such an important tourist venture as the Marine Discovery Centre? I will tell you how much they spent: $100,000, just in 2004. Who else supported it? The local council. There was grassroots support for a local project. The Waverley Council made a community grant over a period of three years. That would make you think it would have a little bit of credibility, a little bit of support, from the local community. Of course the Australian government wants to get behind it and say: `Yes, this is good. It is good not only to create jobs and development in the area but to make this a particular and special event.' Eight hundred and fifty thousand-odd overseas tourists visit each year.
Bondi was the centre of the Olympics in the year 2000. Are you opposed to such events? Let us ask the Labor Party about that. I was there with my family and I enjoyed the events at Bondi. It was a wonderful location for the beach volleyball. It was a great success. Indeed, the Olympics in 2000 were a great success and a credit to all Australians, particularly the Australian government and the state government at the time.
These are the things that have been neglected in the arguments that have been put by the Australian Labor Party. We want to suggest to the opposition that they get out there, get their hands dirty and talk to the people concerned—the local community groups that want to support these projects. They know how important they are. The Marine Discovery Centre met the criteria. That is on the public record. They have met all the criteria. The application was received and it was successful. I want to pay tribute to the volunteers who got behind it as well. They received a little bit of support during the International Year of Volunteers in 2001. The contribution of volunteers should not be forgotten and the Australian government is getting behind them, as it is behind this special community project.

"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2004-12-07,"—I also wish to speak on the motion to take note of the answers to the questions asked by Senator O'Brien during question time, and particularly to deal with the issue of the Marine Discovery Centre at Bondi Beach. I also, like Senator Barnett, looked at the DOTARS web site to see what this program was.
—Your colleagues didn't.
—The title of the program, Senator Barnett, is Regional Partnerships. The state is New South Wales and the location is Bondi. I have to admit that I was a little surprised, given that I live 10 minutes away from Bondi. It is a great privilege to get up and speak on this issue as a constituent of the seat of Wentworth and to learn, through this debate, that I am part of regional Australia. The minister, Senator Ian Campbell, in his response—and Senator Hill in his response to an unrelated question—asked why we are attacking regional Australia. They said: `This is about jobs in regional Australia. Why does the Labor Party single out the bush for particular attention?'
I am a great supporter of the bush. I think the people in regional and rural Australia are great people. They are great battlers and they deserve all the help they can get. They get very little in real terms from this government, and they have got very little in real terms from this government since 1996. But, when it comes to electioneering and being able to target seats that potentially may change hands in an election, this government becomes very focused on what its programs are intended to do. That is why you have a mix of programs entitled Regional Partnerships being used to fund projects in seats in metropolitan Australia that are determined to be marginal or under threat.
Wentworth is about as metropolitan as you can get. It would have the highest number of millionaires in this country within its boundaries. It would have the most expensive real estate in this country within its boundaries. It is hardly a seat that you would say is suffering from disadvantage and despair. I walk around it every week. I happen to enjoy living in Wentworth. I happen to particularly enjoy Bondi. I can tell you about all the best coffee shops and the best lattes in the country—not in regional Australia, in the country. The Zoo Bar in Bondi Junction is one, and Centennial Bites down at Clovelly is another one. They were all visited by their local member, canvassing for votes, during the last election. I can name them one after another—the Gelato Bar in Campbell Parade, the Thai Flora Restaurant in Hall Street—there is a multitude of them. People in Wentworth will not starve or go short of a decent cup of coffee. The current member has probably bought coffee for every person who lives in the seat of Wentworth. During the last election campaign he was seen constantly wandering in and out the coffee shops of Wentworth canvassing votes for himself. To suggest that the people of Wentworth or Bondi need to soak up $220,000 worth of a program that I presume was initially designed to assist the people of regional Australia is an absolute absurdity. 
I am sure that the people at the Marine Discovery Centre in Bondi are very grateful for the $220,000, and I am sure they do a very good job in travelling around the schools of the area to promote knowledge about marine life. Most of the kids in the area spend their life at Bondi Beach anyway; they go and experience the marine life first-hand. They are out on their surfboards from early in the morning until late at night at Bondi, Bronte, Coogee—all the beaches around that eastern suburbs area. It is obvious that this was an election ploy to transfer these moneys into those electorates that the government thought were vulnerable. It had nothing at all to do with promoting partnerships in regional Australia or assisting to build jobs in regional Australia. (Time expired)

"Buckland, Sen Geoffrey",ALP,2004-12-07,"—Before the second reading debate on the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program Amendment (Post-2005 Scheme) Bill 2004 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Textile, Clothing and Footwear Post-2005 Arrangements) Bill 2004 was interrupted by question time today, I was making reference to employment numbers in my own state of South Australia. Perhaps it is sometimes hard for some of us, with our backgrounds, to look at these sorts of bills without giving consideration to the effects they have on workers and their families. I also mentioned a number of closures of clothing or textile factories. Whilst I cannot be specific about those people working in sweatshop situations in the industry, which we know exist—some illegally—I can say that Levi Strauss lost 90 workers in South Australia recently and Fletcher Jones lost 40 in the south-east. 
I was also in the process of commenting that it seems that when there is good news to sell on any industry, including the textile industry—whether there is a new range of clothes, an expansion of factory production or new machinery in a factory—there always seems to be a government minister there with the local member, so pleased to be seen and photographed shaking hands with the workers. But that is not so when it comes to the closure of these factories, some of which I have visited. During the closure of Fletcher Jones in Mount Gambier, not even the local member showed his face or made comment about the situation these workers were placed in.
I mention Mount Gambier because it is one of those rural and regional centres—it is not a Bondi Junction retail outlet or producer; it is a true rural and regional centre and the second largest city now in South Australia. Many of those workers had been in those jobs in that factory for their entire working lives of many years. Some had been there 20 years going on 30 years, producing garments for the Australian market. It is hard to talk to those people and ask them, `What do you do after this?' Happily, some of them have found employment in other areas, but not in the areas that they are trained for. When my late mother was in the work force she pursued her career as a tailor and found that that was the only thing she wanted to do. My mother had a couple of other jobs, and I know she was never happy in them because they were not her chosen vocation. These people were thrown to the wilderness and there was no support from the local members or the ministers who were there when there was good news to tell. That was disappointing.
South Australia has taken a big hit. In fact, as for the known work force in South Australia there are 257 in the clothing sector. As I also said earlier, there is a growing trend towards contractors doing the work at home and calling people in only when they are required. That figure has now grown to 98. So there are 257 in the real work force, if you like, and then 98 contractors, and that figure is growing, because we are told that that suits the needs of industry. I will not go into the footwear sector, which is in an even worse situation and is also suffering.
As I said before, where the government will now be working towards these research and development funds to give some relief to what are further reductions in tariffs, those tariffs will not really take full effect until 2010. That gives the industry time to prepare for the future. The textile and clothing industry never ceases to amaze me. We are always looking for the cheaper products that come in from overseas when in fact we can do it to a better standard here in Australia. I am not entirely sure that you can put it down to wages being the barrier against the industry progressing in Australia. I think funding is required for some research and development into better and more effective ways of dealing with a changing industry. I suppose I am the wrong one to talk about fashion, but I tend to think that the industry is driven by fashion, so there is a lot of change going on all the time. The money that will be available for these companies through the research and development funding may be a little bit late, but it certainly will not go astray. I trust that the industry will give consideration to the effect that they have on the Australian economy and use that money wisely to properly build an industry that is the envy of the world. I think they could. They certainly have, or had, the people, and hopefully many of those people can go back into the work force in that industry. 
We are not opposing this bill. There are many things wrong with it if you really put it under the microscope, as there is with most things, but on this occasion there is the opportunity to work with the industry and with the funding that is being made available to them to get something right for a change. I trust that the government are serious about what they are suggesting will occur and I trust that the industry will work with government and with those people who are there to help them use the money to develop the industry further.
It is widely agreed that the investment must be for innovative processes—and innovative thought processes as well—if the industry is to survive, and it has to survive until 2010 before we can do very much. If the industry just sees this as a handout to help it until 2010 and is not looking to use that investment money wisely and to develop the industry, I would say we are on the verge of seeing the end of the textile industry in this country. That would be a shame and it should be monitored very carefully by the government.
There have been many structural adjustments in this industry in the last two or three decades. The removal and the reduction of the protective barriers were initiated by the Hawke government in 1987, and they have driven much of the change that has taken place. I often think that, as in other industries I have been involved with, you open the gate and say, `We want to see structural change of the industry.' If it is done wrong, it is done wrong forever, and I tend to think that the textile industry might have been one of those that did not do it—I cannot say wrong—as right as they could have to give the industry the opportunities that exist in Australia.
If my family is any judge at all, there is certainly a market for clothing, shoes and other textile products that come through the industry. When you see a place like Sheridan being reduced by 150 people, it is almost not on the market. But you go to the store, as I did recently with my wife, to buy the Sheridan sheets that we have had since we married—different ones, by the way; it is the only brand that we have had in the house—and we cannot get them. We can get something that looks identical to them, but it has a different brand name. They are imported, and I think that is a real shame and something that we should not be proud of.
Labor support the passage of the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program Amendment (Post-2005 Scheme) Bill 2004 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Textile, Clothing and Footwear Post-2005 Arrangements) Bill 2004. We believe that, as I have said many times before, if the industry is serious about it and the government is serious about it—and I tend to think that it may be serious about this particular issue—then we do have an opportunity to not only save the industry as it is now but also expand it and look to better things in the future.",SENATE,"<title>TEXTILE, CLOTHING AND FOOTWEAR STRATEGIC INVESTMENT PROGRAM AMENDMENT (POST-2005 SCHEME) BILL 2004</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2004-12-07,"—I also rise this afternoon to speak to the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program Amendment (Post-2005 Scheme) Bill 2004 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Textile, Clothing and Footwear Post-2005 Arrangements) Bill 2004. The TCF industry is a critical one, as we all know, and the Productivity Commission dealt with this particular issue. They reported on it in 2000-01. Australia's 5,000 TCF firms have generated a turnover of some $9 billion and provided factory based employment for at least 58,000 Australians. The commission also noted that there is also the equivalent of as many as 25,000 full-time employees engaged in outwork. 
As the Productivity Commission report pointed out, TCF manufacturing in Australia covers a diverse range of activities, including early stage processing of leather and natural fibres; the production of textiles; the transformation of leather, yarns and textiles into clothing and footwear; carpets and other fabric products for the home and office; and technical textiles such as shadecloth, medical and sanitary products, filtration products and insulation materials. The report also noted how important the TCF sector is in certain states and, more particularly, in regions accounting for six per cent of all value-added production and nine per cent of total employment in Victoria's manufacturing sector. There is also significant TCF production in regional centres such as Albury-Wodonga, Wangaratta, Geelong, Bendigo and Devonport.
The report of the Productivity Commission review of TCF assistance was released last July. The government considered the commission's recommendations and in November last year the minister, the Hon. Ian Macfarlane, announced that there would be a five-year pause on tariff reductions from 2005 for the TCF industry and that that would be followed by a gradual 10-year program of tariff reduction. Tariffs will be maintained to the 2005 level until 1 January 2010; however, in 2010 the 10 per cent tariff on cotton sheets, woven fabrics, footwear and carpets, and the 7½ per cent tariff on sleeping bags, table linen and footwear parts will be reduced to five per cent. The 17½ per cent tariff on clothing and finished textiles will be reduced to 10 per cent in 2010, and this 10 per cent tariff will be reduced to five per cent in January 2015.
Essentially, it is all being done to enable the industry to adjust to the new tariff arrangements, and the government has announced that a $747 million assistance package will be implemented. Of that, the package includes $500 million for an extension of the TCF Strategic Investment Program to 2010; $100 million for an extension of SIP for the clothing and finished textile sectors to 2015; $50 million for a 10-year structural adjustment program to assist displaced workers; $50 million for an import credit scheme; and, lastly, $25 million that is set aside for a 10-year grants based program for small business.
This is an issue that I have been following for many years. I have certainly been involved in inquiries and I have met with people in the industry. The Australian Democrats believe that the strategic investment program is a valuable industry support mechanism. It has had a positive effect on the industry as it has adjusted to major tariff reductions in the last 10 years. The extension of the scheme for a further five years does have unanimous support in this place. The Democrats, though, have expressed our support for the extension of the program, and we would be very pleased to vote for legislation that would achieve that as an outcome.
However, the Australian Democrats do not support making this extension conditional upon a further program of tariff reductions. We support the position that has been put forward by the TCFUA—that is, that the federal government is seeking to force the industry to accept tariff reductions as the price of further industry assistance, despite there being no evidence that this will result in benefits to Australians. We do not believe that it is necessary at this point in time. We believe that a more suitable approach would be to extend the SIP until 2009 and then review the need for a further round of tariff cuts post 2010 close to that time. Guaranteed tariff reductions that will not come into effect until after this round of SIP funding expires do not need to be included in this legislation, so we see that, really, as an anomaly. 
The Democrats' industry policy states our belief that manufacturing and industry have been undermined by an array of government policies, including the reduction in tariffs, the restrictions on the research and development tax concession, the cuts to industry assistance programs, an unsympathetic tax system and a failure to engage in strategic industry and regional development planning. The Democrats believe that the fundamental problem is this government's, and previous governments', blind faith in market solutions and untrammelled competition policy.
We do support the freezing of any further reduction in tariffs and reducing them only if our trading partners are doing the same. As stated in a submission to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee's inquiry into these bills, this industry has experienced substantial employment losses over the past decade. That is no secret, and I think we are all well aware of that. Policies that seek to decrease tariffs further when our trading partners are not following our lead—in my mind at least—exacerbate the problems that currently exist.
The TCF industry has been vocally lobbying on these bills. Representatives from the big end of the TCF town have negotiated this package with the government, accepting a program of tariff reduction and the need to know exactly the terms under which this will happen over the next 10 years. It seems to me that this will enable them to strategically plan their investment and development activities to develop niche areas and expand their export activities to ensure the long-term sustainability of their own particular part of the industry. They are understandably concerned about certainty and the need to base their future capital investment decisions on the fact that they are being guaranteed reimbursement through the SIP. They have been particularly concerned about the timing of the bills and were keen to see them progress through the parliament even before the election. These firms are unlikely to be affected by the proposed tariff reductions. One of the lobbyists that I met with put this to me: `The tariff reductions are so small I could lose more than that each day based purely on currency fluctuations.' For firms the size of the firm that person represents this is certainly true, and I think we ought to keep this in mind in how we deal with these bills and with issues for the future concerning this industry.
The vocal lobbying on these bills has come from firms that represent only a small percentage of the total industry—fewer than 500 of the more than 4,000 firms that engage in the TCF business. The remainder of the 4,000 that I talk about are smaller firms. They range in size from very small to medium sized enterprises. These firms do not get the benefit of the strategic investment program. Given that this is a scheme that reimburses major capital investments, these firms do not spend enough money to get any money from the SIP pool. When it comes to fairness, we ought to keep that in mind. It seems to me that when you talk about tariff reductions they will be disproportionately affected by these cuts. Smaller margins and the volumes of production render them much more sensitive to fluctuation in tariff levels, and the potential for job losses in their case can be significantly high. The TCF Union—I think rightly—has lobbied hard in the names of these smaller firms, arguing that, while the SIP is unanimously supported, coupling this scheme with mandatory tariff reductions probably is unnecessary and will disproportionately affect those firms at the small end of the industry, with a potentially devastating effect on employment especially in regional areas like the ones I mentioned earlier. 
I understand that, on the one hand, business owners and employers within the industry are keen to have some certainty in turn, and that is understandable. They have accepted a program of tariff reduction and the need to know exactly the terms under which this will happen over the course of the next 10 years. This will enable them to strategically plan their investment and development activities to ensure their long-term sustainability. On the other hand, employees of the TCF industry are justifiably concerned about the real prospect of job losses under these new arrangements. They also raised the question about whether or not the structural adjustment program will provide enough incentives for transitions where there are job losses.
The National Secretary of the TCF Union has also expressed serious concerns about the government's proposed amendments to the program—that the reduction in funding of SIP will possibly see the loss of up to 30,000 jobs in the TCF sector by 2010. A significant loss of jobs over that period of time ought to be a cause for concern for all Australians. As I mentioned earlier, the government has promised $50 million for a 10-year structural adjustment program to assist displaced workers as part of its plan for post-2005 arrangements. The government's media release describes this as a program to `offer case-by-case help to workers who are affected by large plant closures'.
At first glance, this would seem to be insufficient for what is likely to be a major program of labour market adjustment. If, for the sake of argument, we were to accept the TCFUA's figure of the loss of 30,000 jobs as a result of these changes to the industry, that $50 million figure would essentially amount to $1,667 per newly jobless worker over the course of the next 10 years. I believe the government has failed to prove that the transitional assistance component of its proposed changes to the assistance scheme is sufficient to help employees develop and adapt their skills or to retain or find new jobs. Again, that ought to be cause for concern.
I also want to mention the issue concerning the Homeworkers Code of Practice. During the inquiry into this bill the committee heard disturbing and heartbreaking evidence about outworkers in the garment industry working terrible hours for very little pay and under dreadful conditions. We heard about a woman who receives $7 an hour to sew swimwear and who sometimes has to work up to 16 hours a day to support her family. These conditions are having a terrible impact on her health. We also heard the story of an outworker in the fashion industry who has made ladies blouses for at least the past 15 years. She used to receive $11 per garment but in the last five years she has received only $5.30 per garment, and the work has become more complicated. For instance, for some of the garments—not that I would know much about these things, not purchasing blouses—she has to join as many as 13 pieces together. She usually starts work at six o'clock in the morning. If there is the stress of an urgent order, she has to start work when she wakes up at three o'clock or five o'clock on that day.
We fight hard to ensure that all Australians have a decent working environment, and it is disgraceful that there are people in this country who are treated so very badly by their employers. There was a report into outworkers in the garment industry in 1997, before I came to the Senate. In the years since that report came out the government has done virtually nothing to implement any of the recommendations to make life better for garment workers. It is a disgrace that we still hear stories about the continued and systematic of exploitation of outworkers in the TCF industry. The Australian Democrats believe that all participants in the TCF industry should sign up to the FairWear Homeworkers Code of Practice or an equivalent code of practice and end the exploitation of outworkers in this industry. This should be a mandatory condition to receiving SIP funding under this legislation. 
I want to conclude by expressing my extreme disappointment in the opposition. I believe that, desperate to prove some form of economic credentials in the wake of their recent election loss, they sold out on their key principles to their constituents, not so much to the union but to the potential 30,000 people who would presumably support them and who may well be out of work. I believe that, if they had stuck to their guns and insisted that the tariff reduction provisions in this bill be de-linked from the extension to the SIP program, there was leverage to negotiate with the government to pass that part of the bill that we all agree on and to delay the tariff reduction component until a later date. I think it is fairly clear—the writing is on the wall—that they have decided to let this get through. No matter about all the passionate speeches we have heard in this place about this issue over the past year, all of the effort that went into the committee inquiry and report has pretty much come to nil.
I sincerely hope that the anticipated outcomes of this legislation are not as dire as some of us might fear. If they are, I think we have only ourselves to blame because the inquiry was pretty clear in elucidating many of the issues. The policy response does not seem to be commensurate with what we had on the table and is certainly not with what we have before us on this occasion.",SENATE,"<title>TEXTILE, CLOTHING AND FOOTWEAR STRATEGIC INVESTMENT PROGRAM AMENDMENT (POST-2005 SCHEME) BILL 2004</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2004-12-07,"—These bills give effect to key elements of the package of measures that the Howard government announced for the textiles, clothing and footwear industries in November 2003. The Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program Amendment (Post-2005 Scheme) Bill 2004 extends the TCF strategic investment program for a further 10 years effective from 1 January 2005. Under this program, $575 million will be provided to support eligible industry investments in R&D expenditure. The SIP bill also provides for the establishment of a $25 million TCF small business program. The Customs Tariff Amendment (Textile, Clothing and Footwear Post-2005 Arrangements) Bill 2004 provides for further TCF tariff reductions in 2010 and in 2015.
The substance of the bills currently before the Senate was introduced by the government on 16 June this year, and on 24 June both bills were passed in the other place after a Labor amendment to split the bills was defeated. On the previous day, the bills had been referred by the Senate to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. That committee reported on 30 August and included minority reports from Labor and Democrat senators. Senator Ridgeway has elaborated on those concerns. But the 2004 federal election was called before the Senate could consider either the bills or the report, so the bills should be seen as a single package. Legislatively, they are linked through the commencement clause in the SIP bill.
Before addressing the bills in detail I would like to say something about the recent history of the TCF industry and the competitive challenges it will confront in the future. The TCF industry provides a wide range of goods, including basic yarns and textiles, carpets, clothing, footwear and sophisticated technical textiles. The profile of TCF firms is equally diverse, ranging from large factories employing hundreds of people to a multitude of small to medium sized enterprises. While estimates vary, TCF firms employ at least 58,000 people in the formal sector and another 25,000 or so outworkers. The industry's revenue in 2000-01 was over $9 billion. TCF firms make a substantial contribution to a number of regional economic centres, including Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo, Victoria; Albury, New South Wales; Devonport, Tasmania; and the Gold Coast, Queensland. Many TCF manufacturers can also be found in our major capital cities. 
In the decade following World War II, steep protective barriers and other forms of industry support shielded the TCF industry from international competition. These policies skewed and distorted the development of the industry, encouraging an inward-looking orientation and a fragmented, high-cost and ultimately unsustainable industry structure.
Since the early 1970s, Australia's TCF industry has been progressively exposed to greater competition, and Labor governments have played a decisive role in this process. Change in the TCF industry has also been driven by market forces. Responses within the TCF industry to these policy changes and market trends have not been uniform. Some TCF firms have adapted well, building a strong competitive advantage in niche areas, including some technical textiles, but others have struggled in the face of imports from low-cost competitors.
In overall terms, there has been some rationalisation in the industry. Between 1996-97 and 2000-01, TCF employment and production levels fell and TCF imports secured an increased share of the local market. Over the same period, however, TCF firms lifted productivity levels and increased exports, albeit from a low base, but high levels of protection have not inoculated the industry from employment reductions and greater import competition. While the TCF industry has plainly been through a difficult period of adjustment, there can be no turning back to its highly protected, high-cost and uncompetitive past. The key to the industry's survival and prosperity lies in investment and innovation, in high value-added production and niche marketing and in phased adjustment away from uncompetitive activities. This is the only way to ensure secure, sustainable jobs for the thousands of Australians employed by TCF firms.
In November 2003 the Howard government announced a $747 million package of measures for the TCF industry. Key components of this package included an extension of the strategic investment program, SIP, for a further 10 years effective from 1 January next year. Under the new version of the SIP, the number of grant types will be reduced from five to two, with subsidies to be provided for capital investment type 1 grants, representing a 40 per cent subsidy, and R&D expenditure type 2 grants, with an 80 per cent subsidy. Also, there is a $25 million TCF small business program for companies that cannot meet the $200,000 threshold for SIP claims. There will be further reductions in TCF tariffs in 2010 to 2015, with tariffs applying to all TCF products, except for clothing and finished textiles, falling in 2010 to five per cent—the general manufacturing rate. Tariffs on clothing and finished textiles will fall to 10 per cent in 2010 and five per cent in 2015. There is also a $50 million structural adjustment program to assist displaced workers and encourage community restructuring.
The bills now before the Senate implement the first three elements of this package—the extension of the SIP, the establishment of the TCF small business program and the tariff reductions in 2010 and 2015. The government's TCF assistance package provides substantial support for needed investment and innovation within the industry. It is worth noting that the government's proposed further TCF tariff reductions will not take place until 2010, giving affected firms time to prepare and adjust. Under already existing legislation, tariffs for all TCF producers—save for makers of clothing and finished textiles—will fall to between five and 10 per cent on 1 January 2005. While tariffs for clothing and finished textiles remain substantially higher, this part of the industry is being given longer to adjust—until 2015—to reach the target tariff rate of five per cent. 
Tariff reductions inevitably entail adjustment pressures for local TCF firms. It is increasingly widely recognised, however, that they will not be the main source of competitive pressures that these firms face in coming decades. The short- to medium-term outlook for the TCF industry is being shaped by three non-tariff related factors: the appreciation of the Australian dollar; regional and global trade liberalisation trends, including a possible free trade agreement with China; and other non-tariff barriers affecting Australian TCF exports.
I turn to Labor's position on the TCF bills. Labor supports the package of the government's TCF bills currently before the Senate. Passage of the SIP bill will deliver much-needed certainty for the TCF industry. With this legislation in place, TCF firms throughout Australia can plan, finetune and implement their investment strategies with confidence. As I mentioned earlier, further TCF tariff reductions in 2010 and 2015 are part of the government's TCF legislative package.
On 15 November this year the shadow minister for industry, infrastructure and industrial relations wrote to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources suggesting that the government split its two TCF bills. This would have allowed the time-sensitive SIP bill to be passed before the end of the year and consideration of the TCF tariff bill to take place in 2005. The minister confirmed that the government would not accept Labor's proposal to split the TCF bills. The minister subsequently indicated that the government would agree to Labor's proposal that a review of the TCF industry be conducted in 2008. Some of those opposed to Labor's position on this legislative package have drawn attention to language adopted at the ALP national conference in January 2004 which called for TCF tariffs `to be held at current levels pending a review to be undertaken by a new Labor government' and flagged Labor's opposition to `the government's TCF legislation to be introduced ... prior to the next election which further reduces tariffs'.
The simple, yet powerful, point I would make about this language is that it was premised on Labor winning the 2004 federal election. With that election lost, we have rethought our approach. In particular, we have confronted two unarguable facts. First, with the government securing a majority in the Senate from 1 July 2005, further tariff reductions for the TCF industry will be an inevitable legislative consequence of this parliament. Second, failure to pass the government's TCF legislative package before the end of the year will delay the extension of the SIP—denying the TCF industry much needed certainty and disrupting investment plans predicated on SIP assistance.
An important outcome of the opposition's discussions with the minister was his agreement to hold a review of the TCF industry in 2008, if in government. In a letter to the shadow minister for industry, infrastructure and industrial relations dated 29 November, Minister Macfarlane states:
The Government is prepared to agree to a Review on the operational effectiveness of the TCF post-2005 Assistance Package in 2008 in return for the Australian Labor Party's support for the passage of these Bills.
The Review would consider the effectiveness of the programs in assisting the industry to improve its competitive position and would take into account changes in the global competitive conditions at that time. It would not extend to the Government's program of tariff reductions or the level of financial assistance made available to the industry as part of the TCF post-2005 Assistance Package. 
Given the lack of support from the industry and the Australian Labor Party for this Review being conducted by the Productivity Commission, I am proposing that the Review be undertaken by government officials, either from my portfolio or from relevant Government Departments.
The minister subsequently gave this undertaking to the House of Representatives. The effect of this commitment from the minister is that a review of the TCF industry is now a bipartisan commitment. On the basis that Labor wins the next election, such a review will still take place. 
Labor is strongly supportive of a proposed 2008 review. The review will be well timed, taking place after the extended SIP program has been in operation for three years but before the 2010 round of tariff reductions comes into effect. The review represents an excellent opportunity to take stock of the competitive pressures that the TCF industry will face in coming years, including pressures resulting from the state of the Australian dollar, the expected ASEAN-CER FTA and a possible FTA with China. It will also enable the government's TCF assistance package to be carefully scrutinised, including those elements of this package which Labor has reservations about.
I will single out two aspects of the government's assistance package for particular attention here: first, the 10-year, $50 million structural adjustment program, SAP, to assist displaced workers and encourage industry restructuring; and, second, the exclusion of leather and technical textile firms from R&D grants under the SIP. The $50 million quantum of assistance provided under the SAP is geared to the government's estimates of expected job losses in the TCF industry. According to the government, the SAP supplements assistance already available through the Job Network and in addition provides customised support for retrenched TCF workers. The program replaces the TCF labour adjustment program, or LAP, which operated between 1990 and 1996.
Serious questions have been raised about the SAP's size and effectiveness. In submissions to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, the Victorian state government and the City of Geelong, for example, expressed concerns that the SAP, which over its 10-year life will provide an average of $5 million per annum, might not be adequate to meet expected demand for this assistance. The TCF Union of Australia has also been critical of the SAP, arguing that it has not been properly consulted on this scheme. During his discussions with the shadow minister for industry, infrastructure and industrial relations on the government's TCF legislative package, Minister Macfarlane indicated that he would be happy to discuss the design and implementation of TCF labour adjustment measures with the relevant unions. He said he had an `open door' to the unions and would be happy to discuss any concerns that they might have about these measures. Given his commitment, the opposition urges Minister Macfarlane to meet with the TCF Union of Australia and other interested unions as soon as possible.
Another part of the government's TCF assistance package which has attracted critical attention is its exclusion of leather and technical textile producers from R&D grants under the extended SIP. This matter was raised by Labor senators in the Senate Economics Legislation Committee report on the government's TCF bills. The government's rationale for this exclusion is that SIP support is intended for those parts of the TCF industry facing the most serious adjustment pressures. Leather and technical textile firms, which are already subject to five per cent tariffs, do not, in the government's view, fall into this category. The leather and technical textile industry associations—the Technical Textile and Nonwoven Association and the Australian Association of Leather Industries—have disputed this, arguing that their members must continue to invest in R&D, and therefore access the type 2 grants, to be internationally competitive. This matter, together with the effectiveness of the structural adjustment program for displaced workers, should be examined carefully in the 2008 TCF review.  
The competitive environment facing the TCF industry has changed markedly over recent decades. The pace and scale of change will only intensify in the coming years as globalisation deepens, China and India continue their emergence as major economic powers, consumer preferences evolve and technology is transformed. The survival and future health of Australia's TCF industry depends on investment, innovation, a highly skilled work force and international competitiveness. If there is one overarching lesson from the 20th century's economic history it is that protectionism is not a sustainable industry strategy and not an effective way to guarantee jobs. Australia's economic success over recent decades has been built on openness to global trade and investment flows, greater competition in local markets and the emergence of a more innovative, entrepreneurial and efficient business culture. 
The Hawke and Keating governments' economic reforms played a decisive role in fostering these changes. The TCF industry and its employees have taken significant strides in meeting the restructuring challenges set by those Labor governments. The Howard government's TCF assistance package provides continued support for the industry's efforts and its workers' efforts. The success or failure of this package will hinge on its capacity to foster a competitive, efficient and dynamic TCF industry—an industry able to offer sustainable jobs to the thousands of Australians who work in its factories and workshops. Labor supports the passage of the two TCF bills before the Senate. They will ensure certainty for the TCF industry and foster investment in sustainable jobs. And Labor strongly supports the proposed TCF review in 2008. I commend the bills to the Senate.",SENATE,"<title>TEXTILE, CLOTHING AND FOOTWEAR STRATEGIC INVESTMENT PROGRAM AMENDMENT (POST-2005 SCHEME) BILL 2004</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-12-07,"—Both the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program Amendment (Post-2005 Scheme) Bill 2004 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Textile, Clothing and Footwear Post-2005 Arrangements) Bill 2004, when taken together, implement the changes to industry assistance for the textile, clothing and footwear sector and at the same time impose further tariff cuts. There is absolutely no justification for linking these two bills. That has been said many times by the Labor members of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee that looked at this legislation and by 24 out of the 42 submissions to that particular inquiry. Something I attempted to do earlier today was to stop the unnecessary linking of these two bills, for which there has been no justification. Indeed, the Labor senators on the committee recommended that the bills be dealt with separately. They recommended that the Labor Party decline to pass the customs bill. Of course they have reversed their position and now plan to support another round of hefty tariff cuts that will cost thousands more jobs, with the potential to make the industry so small that it becomes unviable.
If this is another attempt by the ALP, post election loss, to make itself more attractive to business then it is misguided, because the industry assistance package put forward in this legislation does not assist those businesses that are most in need—that is, small- and medium-sized businesses—nor does it provide anywhere near adequate assistance to TCF workers, who, according to the experience of the sector over almost three decades, will have considerable difficulty finding work if they lose their jobs as a result of the tariff changes. 
The Greens will oppose the customs bill, but we will also be moving an amendment to ensure that, if the bill passes, the provisions cannot take effect until such time as the government conducts a review of the impact on the sector of bilateral and multilateral trade agreements and the 2005 tariff cuts. Given the previous speaker's contribution and justification for why Labor is supporting this reduction in tariff cuts, we look forward to the ALP's support for that review. Although the structural adjustment bill is inadequate, we will support it, but we will urge the government to examine additional measures proposed in the Senate Economics Legislation Committee inquiry into this bill, such as a requirement for labour impact statements to be provided by businesses in receipt of funds under the program; a requirement for proper labour market adjustment programs; a requirement that those people who receive funding under the bill meet the Fair Wear code of conduct with regard to the treatment of, and wages and conditions for, outworkers; and access to the structural adjustment program for small business.
The textile, clothing and footwear sector is a substantial component of manufacturing in Australia. It directly employs 64,000 people, or seven per cent of the manufacturing work force. It accounts for four per cent of manufacturing turnover. According to a Productivity Commission report released last year, exports—excluding wool scouring, leather tanning and dressing—are worth $1.1 billion per year. An indication of the impact of earlier tariff cuts can be seen in the fall in turnover in the sector, down almost 16 per cent in the 10 years to 1999-2000, whilst employment declined by 37 per cent.
The Textile Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia, in their evidence to the Senate committee that looked at this legislation, said that from 1986 to 2000 there was a halving of the number of workers employed in the TCF industry. Many of those workers have been unable to find other jobs. There was a study carried out last year by Monash University entitled The long goodbye: TCF workers, unemployment and tariff deregulation. It looked at what happened to 400 workers in the TCF industry in Victoria who lost their jobs between 1999 and 2003. Half of these workers never found another job. Those who did had fewer hours, lower wages and less favourable conditions than they had enjoyed working in the TCF industry.
Both men and women had lost their jobs, but women had a disproportionately greater load of the job losses because the TCF sector is dominated by women, many of whom are migrants who have been in the industry for most, if not all, of their working lives. I had a delegation of TCF workers from Victoria come and visit me and Michael Organ last year. One of the women from there told me about her circumstances. Not only had she and many other women in her community lost their jobs in the TCF industry and factories in their small regional towns; many of them had husbands who also worked in the same factories. So they had been hit with a double whammy, with their families losing their entire source of income.
The TCF sector comprises many small- to medium-sized businesses. According to the Productivity Commission report, businesses employing 20 or fewer people account for a quarter of the sector's production and one-third of its jobs. Gerard Kitchener, who is the National Industry Policy Adviser to the TCFUA, in his evidence to the Senate committee into the bills stated that he believed that 80 per cent of companies in the TCF industry employed fewer than 20 employees. I really worry for the future of an industry when I consider together: the upcoming international trade agreements, with the likely consequence of the Australian marketplace being flooded with cheaply made clothing products from elsewhere in the region; the impact of job losses on women, particularly women from non-English-speaking backgrounds, in regional parts of this country; the impact on the whole regional community through these job losses; and the government's intention to make it easier for employers in small businesses with fewer than 20 employees, which make up 80 per cent of the TCF industry, to be able to sack their work forces. Already we have reports saying that 50 per cent of TCF workers who lose their job cannot get another one. If this government's unfair dismissal legislation is passed then they will have no avenue for redress if they are unfairly dismissed. 
The TCF sector is of particular importance to local economies in a number of regions—to name a few, Geelong, Bendigo, Wangaratta, Albury-Wodonga and Devonport. In addition, there are many substantial employers in both Sydney and Melbourne. The Prime Minister reportedly told Melbourne radio in April this year that he understood the importance of the textile industry, particularly in regional areas. He said:
We want to keep a strong textile industry in Australia, but we've also got to have regard for the levels of assistance that it receives relative to the rest of manufacturing.
Yet we see this government, who are driving the TCF sector offshore and whose actions have resulted in such significant job losses within the sector, now proposing that there be further tariff reductions.
The government has had no difficulty in shovelling billions of dollars every year to big companies through corporate welfare. Indeed, the coalition bought its way back into office on 9 October with an unprecedented spending spree that contradicted the constant refrain of the need for fiscal responsibility. Yet when it comes to genuine assistance for the TCF sector, for the employees and for small and medium sized businesses, the government is acting like Scrooge at Christmas time. It has found $747 million for business for a 10-year program but precious little for the workers who stand to lose their jobs—jobs which some of these people have held for most, if not all, of their working lives.
The TCF sector has endured a series of tariff cuts for decades, and a further round of tariff cuts takes effect on 1 January 2005. On top of this we will have the impact of the Australia-US free trade agreement under which US trade barriers will stand—barriers like the yarn forward rule, which allows for the make-up of garments in overseas countries so long as the home country made the fabric or the yarn that is used. Singapore's experience has been that they have found the yarn forward rule so hard to clear that they no longer even bother to apply for tariff reductions; they simply pay the tariff. They cannot meet the tariff-free status with the US yarn forward rule in place, a rule that will exist for Australian manufacturers as a result of the Australia-US free trade agreement.
The Australian TCF sector has substantially increased its exports in its drive to remain viable, but it is struggling against other countries that have retained their tariffs to protect their domestic industries. This makes it extremely difficult for Australian companies to compete in the export field. In addition, there is likely to be an impact from the Australia-Thailand free trade agreement and there is the prospect of a bilateral agreement with China and possibly a multilateral agreement with ASEAN members. All of these agreements have the potential to place even further pressure on the TCF sector in Australia. 
The words of those affected convey the social impact of this government's blind drive to eliminate tariffs. The Geelong Advertiser some time ago quoted a woman who fled war-torn Croatia with her family and who now works in a carpet factory in Geelong. She said:
When I started here seven years ago, I could hardly talk and didn't know about the job or how to speak to people. A girl I worked with for six years here taught me. I have good friends here. I love Geelong, I love working here ... and now I am better with my English.
She went on to say:
I feel happy to go to work each day. Every day I thank God I have work and I hope to keep my job for many years.
For those who have lost their jobs, life is much harder. A Bendigo woman in her 40s told the Monash University study looking at people who had lost their jobs in the TCF industry in Victoria:
When I started, there were six or seven textile factories in Bendigo. There's only one left now ... you think: where's the job? What am I going to do? Where am I going to go?
A woman in Moe said: `Making us relocate is wrong. Why should we have to relocate our whole life to get another job?' The Monash University study found that:
... across urban and rural settings, person after person spoke of loving their jobs. Sometimes it was because she liked to do the job well; sometimes it was because she liked to be with `friends (like) sisters, family'. Sometimes it was because he felt he had no place in the world if he was not a man out there earning for his family. Always, there was pride expressed in `doing a job well'. “We like to do our job well,” said a middle aged garment worker born in Greece. She sat up straighter, and smiled when she said this, and the women around her nodded ...
TCF workers need a committed program of genuine assistance that meets the specific needs of individual workers if they are to find new jobs, having lost their jobs as a result of tariff reductions. This may sound difficult, but the most significant skill requirements for people who have been forced out of the TCF industry have already been identified. As Michelle O'Neil from the TCFUA told the Senate committee hearing:
... some really critical points for workers, such as providing both vocational training and English language and literacy training. There are a high number of workers in this industry whose first language is not English and who need not only new skills but also the capacity to read and write in English to be able to access other jobs.
At the Senate committee inquiry Michelle O'Neil quoted the Monash University study which found:
... most focus group respondents said they were given no or inadequate information about entitlements and little information about what to expect from, and how to work with, Centrelink. This was particularly the case for those people whose first language was not English. The percentage of workers who received any formal assistance in terms of non-financial assistance such as retraining was below 20 per cent. So less than 20 per cent of workers received any formal assistance. Of the workers who had found employment, the great bulk of them had found only casual, insecure or part-time employment, and not one of the participants had found work that was paying the same or better wages. So every person who had lost their job—
over the four years of this study—
and had then found one ended up in employment where their income had reduced, and the great bulk of that was casual employment.
This does not have to be the case, and Michelle O'Neil, in her evidence to the Senate committee, went on to describe a situation which could be the case if there is genuine government investment in real structural adjustment programs that assist the workers at the coalface with their individual needs. She described the situation this way: 
We had a very successful program that was run a couple of years ago after a major retrenchment at a place called Bradmill in Yarraville, Victoria. We managed to negotiate with the receivers of that business to run an assistance program that was called `Life after Bradmill' to assist some 400 workers who lost their jobs as part of that company changing and reducing its work force. From that study, we found that the great bulk of workers had never written a CV in their lives and that the majority did not have English as a first language and had never entered a Centrelink office or any other training institution. It was only with very intensive direct support that they managed to access English language training and other jobs ...
Every economic policy has a human consequence; it affects people's lives. TCF workers made jobless because of the government's drive to eliminate tariffs have the right to proper assistance to find other work, and regional communities that rely on the sector for their economic wellbeing deserve proper support.
This government is big on talk about the need to encourage people back into the work force and about the rise in the number of people drawing the disability support pension. But when it comes to addressing structural change in the labour market, this government is found wanting. It is interesting to note that the government has no difficulty committing itself to the continuation of one of the most destructive, unsustainable industries in the country—the logging of old growth forests for woodchips for export. The Prime Minister promised in Launceston in October that no single forestry job would be lost under a re-elected coalition government, but the government has not committed to putting the forestry industry on a viable, long-term footing to ensure the preservation of both our ancient forests and long-term jobs. But it is very different for TCF workers, many of them women, many of them from a non-English-speaking background and many of them with few other skills for earning a living. The government is prepared to sacrifice these workers to the uncertainties of the global market.",SENATE,"<title>TEXTILE, CLOTHING AND FOOTWEAR STRATEGIC INVESTMENT PROGRAM AMENDMENT (POST-2005 SCHEME) BILL 2004</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2004-12-07,"—I want to make a brief contribution with respect to the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program Amendment (Post-2005 Scheme) Bill 2004 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Textile, Clothing and Footwear Post-2005 Arrangements) Bill 2004. They are, of course, very important bills, particularly with regard to the strategic investment program funds. There are a couple of things that I want to raise, and I guess I will raise them further with the government when the bills reach the committee stage. They are matters that relate to the overall operation of the program. Of course, we know that there is a significant amount of money and it is very important for this industry to receive these funds to assist it both to adjust and to meet the continuing competitive pressures we are seeing in goods being brought in from overseas.
With regard to the competitive aspect, in the funding provided for in the bill it is interesting to note that there is little focus being given to the opportunities that can and do exist in export to overseas countries, particularly to countries like China. The government, through some agency such as Austrade, has a responsibility to ensure that industries such as the TCF industry are given great opportunity to maximise the opportunities that exist in exporting to overseas countries. Because they do exist. Often it is the case that individual companies have neither the expertise nor the financial capacity to make inroads into those markets. 
In visits I have made to China, I have looked at the retailing of clothing and footwear in some of the major department stores in the big cities—that is, stores like David Jones or Myers here. You will see that a great deal of the clothing available on the retail racks there is far more expensive than it is here. These are name brands. We have an opportunity to actually create some name brands in this country to provide to people in those countries that can afford to pay money for imported clothes—indeed, that are in fact looking for imported clothing. They do not want to buy clothing manufactured within their own country. They are looking for something different. They are no different to people in other countries who want to buy something that somebody else has not got. I would have liked to see a bit of thought given in this package to how those sorts of markets can be accessed and further developed.
With regard to the structural adjustment program, I had a meeting with the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources on 22 June, at which I raised a number of concerns with him about certain aspects of the bills. In particular I raised concerns I had about the structural adjustment program, which was formerly known as the labour adjustment program, which ran from I think 1990 through to 1996. The minister responded in writing on 29 July. I would like to read his response to the chamber. He said this:
I would also like to clarify the assistance, which would be provided to displaced TCF workers under the proposed TCF Structural Adjustment Program (SAP). I share your view that this is a critical part of the package. The level of available funding for the TCF SAP is $50 million over ten years, nominally at $5 million per annum but with flexibility to shift any unspent monies in a particular year forward to subsequent years. This flexibility is required because it is highly likely that employment losses in the industry will be “lumpy” and unpredictable in nature.
The level of funding for the TCF SAP is commensurate with the best analysis of likely job losses in the industry. In its final report the PC—
the Productivity Commission—
quoted employment losses of up to 9,563 over the 15 year period from 2005 to 2020. This was based on the adoption of the PC's recommendations. This modelling has been subsequently updated to take account of the actual policy announced by the Government and the analysis concludes that employment losses will be 5,815.
The TCF SAP is intended to supplement rather than substitute for existing assistance. The Government, via Job Network, has in place a national network of private and community organisations dedicated to finding jobs for unemployed people. Most retrenched TCF workers would be eligible for Job Network services but some may not be fully eligible (for example those who do not qualify for income support due to working spouses or do not pass the income and asset test).
The TCF SAP will broaden Job Network to take account of the particular needs of retrenched TCF workers, who tend to be mature aged and from non-English speaking backgrounds. The TCF SAP will enable retrenched TCF workers to obtain immediate access to Intensive Support customised assistance, irrespective of whether or not the retrenched TCF worker would otherwise be eligible for Job Network services. In normal circumstances a job seeker would have to wait up to 12 months to receive this support. This means that retrenched TCF workers will receive substantial and individually tailored employment assistance as well as access to complementary employment and training programs and to a supplemented Job Seeker account. The range of complementary employment and training programs includes appropriate vocational and preparatory job training, and language skill courses.
This program contrasts markedly with the TCF Labour Adjustment Program (LAP) that operated from 1990 to 1996 and was predominantly focused on assisting people in Melbourne and Sydney. Under the TCF LAP there were strict eligibility requirements that meant benefits could only be accessed if a retrenched TCF worker had worked 24 out of the previous 36 months in the TCF industry, and support was only available for 12 months. Additionally, as you noted in our meeting, workers were not allowed to return to the TCF industry. There will be no such restrictions under TCF SAP. 
I believe the combination of TCF SAP and the existing Job Network structure has the capacity to more greatly improve the job prospects of retrenched TCF workers than a revamp of the former TCF LAP.
I appreciate the minister's explanation but it still leaves the concern I have. The previous program had its problems: a significant amount of money was expended and a great deal of it did not deliver any real outcome. That is why it is so important that this particular program gets it right.
I expressed concern to the minister with regard to union involvement. There seems to be no clear plan to have a group of people who will look at what previously worked under the LAP, because there were some things that did work. I urge the government and the minister to include the relevant trade union, the TCFUA, at the table to ensure that the things that did work are implemented. It is important that the people on the ground representing those workers, who understand better than most the needs of those workers, be included in the process.
As far as job losses are concerned, the minister in his letter stated with respect to the government's analysis that the modelling had been subsequently updated. The Productivity Commission in its report referred to the loss of 9,563 jobs, and the analysis of the updated modelling concluded that this figure would be reduced to 5,815. That represents a significant difference. I will be interested to hear from the government during the committee stage what happens if the figure is higher than 5,815. What happens if the figure is 7,000 or 10,000? What funding will be made available and how will it be made available? 
I believe there are many questions that remain unanswered at the moment. I would have thought that the opposition, in looking to approve this legislation, would have been more mindful of this aspect of the package and would have pursued the issue more strongly than it seems to have done. It should have tried to put in place a clearer and more concise approach to how we will deal with workers who are displaced as a result of the proposed changes.
On the occasions when I met with industry representatives they raised with me that they are yet to be advised about how the package will work. We assume—and I think the minister says, in effect—that the program will work as it has previously. I think the industry would be interested to know—they may know by now; I have not heard that they know—what the eligible expenditure, the five per cent total eligible revenue, will comprise. 
Those are the questions I would like to ask when we get to the committee stage. I hope the government will respond by giving some answers that are clearer than the answers I have received so far from the minister. The package does need to be passed because it is important that companies that have been receiving assistance be able to commence their forward planning. It is probably a little unfortunate that this issue was not dealt with earlier. 
The other important matter involves the structural adjustment package. It would be very useful if we were able to say what specific types of programs will be involved. Given that we have already had experience of this from 1990 to 1996, we ought to be able to say, `Yes, this is how we will deal with the issue of English language training; this is how we will deal with employment retraining; these are the sorts of areas that we will focus on.' I cannot understand why some more concise explanation cannot be given regarding these issues. It would be very helpful if that could occur when we reach the committee stage. ",SENATE,"<title>TEXTILE, CLOTHING AND FOOTWEAR STRATEGIC INVESTMENT PROGRAM AMENDMENT (POST-2005 SCHEME) BILL 2004</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2004-12-07,"—Labor is supporting the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program Amendment (Post-2005 Scheme) Bill 2004 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Textile, Clothing and Footwear Post-2005 Arrangements) Bill 2004, not because we believe they represent good policy but because we recognise the reality of the political situation. Voting the bills down would have no effect on tariffs and would only serve to delay the implementation of the strategic investment program scheme, known as SIPS. We do support the SIP scheme, albeit with modifications, and we do want to provide certainty and assistance for an industry that is facing an extraordinarily difficult future.
In terms of principle, Labor rejects this crude effort by the conservatives at social and economic engineering. These bills and the Howard government approach have made, and are making, TCF industries the sacrificial lamb of Australian industry. The Howard government's approach to TCF industries is kamikaze, contradictory and callous. The conservatives have turned tariff reductions into a bizarre chess gambling game where they pick the industry winners and the workers who are winners, and decide which industries get sacrificed and which workers get burnt. TCF companies and workers are pawns that have been advanced way out in front and are waiting to be cut down.
Australia is an interesting case in the world of TCF tariffs and tariff reductions. The reductions foreshadowed in this legislation are not about economic gains. They are not for product innovation gains, they are not for job gains and they are not for consumer gains, because all of these will be in the negative. They are all about ideology only. It is a government strategy that will inevitably see the decimation of the Australian clothing, footwear and textile industry. These bills are about reducing tariffs applicable to clothing and certain finished textiles to 10 per cent from 1 January 2010 and to five per cent from 1 January 2015. The customs bill also seeks to reduce tariffs applicable to other textile clothing and footwear goods to five per cent from January 2010, and the other tied bill sets out amendments to the SIPS.
Labor does not see TCF industries as pawns and we do not see TCF industries as expendable or doomed. We see a viable future for the Australian clothing, footwear and textile industries. We think it is essential that our country maintains these industries. Labor recognises the need for competitiveness but not in forcing the industry offshore to achieve it. Labor believes that we must ensure the TCF sector grows and creates jobs in the communities in which these industries are located—and good jobs for future generations in all these areas. Labor's approach is about helping to maintain TCF industries and assisting them to adjust. We want to see a set of principles and practical implementation plans in place to help TCF industries make a transition, not a plan to soften the extinction of these industries in Australia.
We want adequate support for labour market adjustment and maintenance of a critical mass for TCF manufacturing in Australia, improved export market access, increased R&D and the development of a highly skilled work force. Labor supports a continuation of the strategic investment program until 2015 but believes it should be reconfigured to give greater reward to innovation in product design, productivity and delivery. Labor's approach is about helping those communities which sustain TCF industries to adjust—particularly those in regional and rural Australia. We need to slow the rate of tariff reductions, making them more gradual and giving employers and workers time to adjust. A proper and rigorous case for any future reductions should also be made before any decision is taken because at the moment there is no case whatsoever. 
There are 64,000 Australian workers in TCF industries, many in regional areas that rely heavily on this industry. The industries are critical to many regional towns, including Ballarat and Geelong in Victoria, Devonport and Launceston in Tasmania, Wollongong in New South Wales and so on. The effects will be felt particularly in Victoria where about half of the industry is based. As a Victorian senator, this concerns me greatly. The worst five areas affected will all be in Victoria: Barwon and Geelong, Melbourne, the Wimmera, the Central Highlands, Lodden-Campaspe and the Ovens Murray.
Modelling commissioned by the Productivity Commission on future tariff reductions, undertaken by Econtech, estimated that 5,000 jobs will go in Melbourne and about 1,500 will go in Western Victoria. The National Institute for Economic and Industry Research, NIEIR, estimated the loss of a total of 6,300 TCF jobs plus 19,600 indirect jobs in Victoria alone. These communities are being sacrificed by this government's proposed post-2005 arrangements. Why are they doing this? Let us look at some of the logic and reasoning that they have put forward. The government argue that they want to make TCF industries more competitive but I wonder how this will occur. The Productivity Commission has acknowledged, following econometric modelling, that, whilst in the past there were some economic gains to be made in TCF tariff liberalisation, that debate has now shifted. The Productivity Commission has made it clear that it cannot be assumed that further liberalisation will result in any substantial economic gain. The Productivity Commission report states:
... removing special support for TCF production would provide little measurable `allocative efficiency' gain.
But it is not just the Productivity Commission saying this. The NIEIR study says the same; so, too, the Centre for Policy Studies and the Victorian Department of Finance and Treasury. They all say that any gains would be negligible—less than four-hundredths of one per cent or even negative gains. They all agree on that. And they all agree on one other thing: there would be massive job losses and serious effects in regional Australia. They all agree on that too.
The government says that, as a result of reduced tariffs, there will be lower prices for consumers but the Productivity Commission has not established that any competition resulting from tariff reductions would lead to lower prices for Australian consumers either. No-one has established that case. Recent free trade agreements with Thailand and the USA will have a severe effect on Australia's TCF industries from next year, compounding current problems facing the industry today. Should a free trade agreement be negotiated with China, as the government seems intent on doing, the effect on Australia's TCF industries will be enormous. The global industry is also facing the abolition of quotas in the European and US markets in January 2005, the implications of which are profound for all TCF industries outside of China.
So the coming couple of years in particular are set to be extremely unstable for Australia's TCF industries. Surely, this is not the time to be considering this legislation. There is no reason why these tariff cuts should be made now. There have already been substantial tariff reductions in recent years, and tariff reductions which have already been legislated for 2005 remain in effect until 2010. Even if you support further tariff reductions, there is no need for tariff reduction legislation to be in place until 2009. And there is absolutely no logic in tying these two bills together.  
One of the key arguments put forward by the federal government for tying the tariff legislation to the industry assistance measures is that industry assistance is compensation for the effects of tariff reductions. Besides contradicting its own argument that all tariff reductions are beneficial for the industry, the government's argument is flawed because not all of industry receives industry assistance. There is no logical reason to tie the SIPS legislation for post-2005 assistance to tariff reduction legislation, which does not come into effect until 2010. The federal government is seeking to force the industry to accept further tariff reductions as the price for further industry assistance, with no evidence that this will result in benefits to Australia overall.
The Productivity Commission's economic modelling also shows that the removal of TCF assistance will result in the deterioration of Australia's current account deficit through an increase in imports. If we go on past experience, we can clearly see this. The Productivity Commission has said that in the 10 years of tariff adjustments between 1991 and 2001 there was a reduction of national output of around $1 billion. This is a policy for more of the same. The current account deficit is one of Australia's major economic weak points. This policy will simply exacerbate the problem.
The decision also does not make sense when we consider Australia's international trading policy and direction. By unilaterally cutting tariffs on TCF products at this unnecessary time we are throwing away a valuable bargaining chip available to us in future trade negotiations. Blind Freddy can see that this legislation will compromise Australia's negotiating position in future bilateral and multilateral trade negotiation rounds. The illogicality of the conservatives astounds me. At a time when Australia's TCF industries are being prevented from accessing key international markets because of high tariffs and non-tariff barriers affecting their export products, we are expecting them to adapt to lower trade barriers in the domestic market. It is just not fair. To tie general tariff reductions to industry assistance is to blindly pursue an ideological approach to industry policy that benefits no-one. The gains are all theoretical, illusory, ideological gains bringing satisfaction to the minds of this conservative government. But the costs are not illusory. They are very real and they are felt by people and communities.
The TCF industry has experienced substantial employment losses over the past decade. Policies that seek to decrease tariffs further when our trading partners are not following our lead will only exacerbate the problem. Neither the federal government nor the Productivity Commission have ever presented any evidence regarding the economic costs of job losses because their economic modelling has a base assumption that all displaced TCF workers find other jobs, despite all the evidence to the contrary. Similarly, they have presented no evidence regarding the economic cost to regional Australia of further job losses. Whilst the Productivity Commission outlines the modelling done for the PC on regional implications, this modelling is based on no net job losses in regional Australia. The assumption is that if Victoria loses jobs, other states gain. The best modelling we have to go on suggests that regional workers displaced by TCF closures find it harder to find new employment, especially where TCF assumes a high proportion of the total work force, as it does in Victoria.  
A study by Monash University's Centre for Work and Change in the Global Era, WAGE, gives strong evidence of the employment problems TCF workers face. There is no recognition by the federal government in their TCF package, or by the Productivity Commission in their review, that women have borne the brunt of job losses over the past decade. Full-time female employment has suffered the most since tariff rates began reducing in the late 1980s. In 1985 there were 67,000 full-time women employed in TCF jobs. This had reduced to 30,000 in 2002. Male full-time jobs over the same period fell from 37,000 to 31,000. The fact that many of these workers are also older and from non-English-speaking backgrounds contributes to their difficulty in finding new employment. Past research by Weller and Webber in 2001 demonstrated that a large proportion of employees in the TCF industries are older unskilled women from non-English-speaking backgrounds who find it extremely difficult to regain employment. The research showed that five years after being retrenched one-third of workers studied were still unemployed and only one-third had found commensurate employment. 
Labor want to see properly targeted labour adjustment programs that will ensure re-employment and keep people in Australia's regional communities. We want to see properly targeted labour adjustment programs based on reality, based on the facts. There is a lot that we need to know before we can properly weigh up the pros and cons here—things that the conservatives and the Productivity Commission appear not to have even thought about. As the TCFUA—the organisation, the union, that deals face to face every day with people affected by tariff reductions—has said before, the Australian community needs to know the answers to some very detailed questions about these matters. 
The Australian community needs to know the economic cost of a sacked worker being on unemployment benefits. What does it cost to pay welfare and what revenue is lost through less taxation? What spending power is lost to the economy overall by this reduction in income? What is the flow-on effect of job losses to other business through both the closures of businesses and the loss of spending power? Are there resultant social costs through people spending long periods unemployed? Are these social costs, including sickness, depression, alcohol or other drug abuse taken into account? When TCF factories close is there a calculation about the loss of business other businesses suffer as a result? Are the flow-on effects calculated for those companies who no longer supply or service machinery or provide raw materials? Are the effects on their suppliers calculated? Is the cost to regional Australia of workers and their families having to move to seek other employment ever calculated? 
The huge reduction in employment in TCF industries as a result of tariff reductions has had a massive effect on Australian families, particularly on women. There has been a reduction of approximately 37,000 full-time female jobs, and about 6,000 male jobs. The federal government is in denial about the effects of unemployment on TCF workers and their families. A study by the Centre for Work and Change in the Global Era of over 300 displaced TCF workers in August 2003 found that the mean time since retrenchment was 39 months—more than three years. Only 54 per cent of those surveyed had found work and only one in five had found work broadly commensurate with their former TCF job in terms of hours, pay and conditions. Although 96 per cent had worked full time before retrenchment, only 21 per cent now work full time, with the mean number of hours worked per week after retrenchment being 27 hours. 
One-fifth of the sample has found only casual employment after losing their jobs—approximately the same number as have found full-time employment. Sixty-six per cent had received no financial assistance from the government since retrenchment. Of those who had received financial assistance, 29 per cent had received unemployment benefits. To properly assist these TCF workers who are displaced we need a properly funded labour adjustment program. The federal government's current TCF package does not address this issue.
The Strategic Investment Program Scheme is discriminatory towards families in certain segments of the TCF industry. SIPS favours particular industry sectors and is disproportionately favourable to the largest TCF companies. The government should expand the scheme to enable the inclusion of a broader range of companies. This can be achieved by lowering the eligible expenditure threshold from $200,000. Only about 400 of the 4,900 TCF companies receive SIPS, yet all 4,900 companies are being asked to absorb the costs of tariff reductions. To access SIPS, companies must have eligible expenditure in excess of $200,000 in order to qualify for assistance. Many companies that otherwise may meet the SIPS guidelines cannot meet this threshold and therefore are excluded from the scheme. Many of the 4,500 TCF companies which do not receive SIPS funding are family companies, and TCF tariff reductions affect the families of all these companies—owner families and the workers whose families are dependent on the wage income. A lower threshold would increase the amount of eligible companies receiving assistance and would also ensure that TCF clothing companies currently underrepresented in receiving SIPS would receive a more proportional share. Small companies with fewer than 20 employees constitute about 80 per cent of TCF enterprises, yet in 2002-03 companies of this size comprised only 25 per cent of the companies actually receiving SIPS funding. Any new scheme must address these disparities and assist all Australian families affected. Our approach is about helping families and family companies stay in business, not just focusing on the giants in the TCF industries.
And let us not forget a very vulnerable group of workers which could also be decimated by this government legislation—outworkers. Outworkers in TCF industries are some of Australia's most exploited workers. Outworkers are very often mums trying to earn income to support their families, to support their children. Sometimes the outworkers are indeed children. This legislation is only likely to exacerbate their plight. 
The Productivity Commission estimates that it would cost 75c per Australian per year to assist the TCF sector. It is my clear view that if we were to ask Australians whether they would be prepared to pay this to maintain these industries in this country the overwhelming answer would be yes. The good sense of Australians is infinitely superior to the poor logic of this conservative government. When there is clearly no proven case, when the public authorities, academics, private think tanks, commentators and analysts, union and industry stakeholders are all saying there is no benefit to Australia or Australians, why would you sacrifice this industry? Why would you sacrifice Australian companies and jobs? Why would you throw away international trade bargaining chips?

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2004-12-07,"—I spoke about the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program Scheme legislation earlier this year and I took the opportunity then to express my concern that the Strategic Investment Program Scheme funding—which, as we all know, is very good funding by and large and I think has broad support—was to be linked to tariff cuts to take place in 2010 and 2015. There is, as I argued, no need to decide the tariff cuts now. I listened to particularly the contribution by Senator Murphy, and I was appreciative of that because he knows the industry. I repeat: there is no need to decide upon the tariff cuts now as we are being asked to. I do not think the case has really been made for further tariff cuts, and I agree with what the opposition said in March, the last time we dealt with this: why not review the situation closer to the time and then decide whether there is a benefit in tariff cuts?  
I am surprised that the opposition has now apparently decided to support both the SIPS funding and the tariff cuts after its strong opposition to the legislated tariff cuts earlier this year. As Senator Carr commented on that occasion:
We take the view that there should be no further tariff cuts without a comprehensive review of the TCF industries. We take the view that there should be a proper inquiry into the effects of reductions in tariffs up to 2010 and that that should occur before further tariff cuts are undertaken.
Senator Carr highlighted the fact that the Productivity Commission has stated it is not able to show that further tariff reductions would generate a net national benefit. If there isn't a net national benefit, why cut tariffs? 
Of course, the government has been intransigent in linking the SIPS payments and funding to tariff cuts. When dealing with concerned industry groups looking to make sure of continued SIPS funding, all it has done is to send those industry members on to the opposition, Independent senators, the Democrats and Greens to act as government lobbyists. The various industry groups that have approached me and my office have said that they do not want tariff cuts but that they would wear tariff cuts some years into the future if they had to in order to get certainty now on funds through SIPS. They were concerned that the government was so uncompromising but were not able to persuade the government to shift its position. So the government is willing to use industry groups to try to blackmail senators into supporting a bad measure because a good measure is linked to it and may be lost. I am sad to see that the opposition has caved in to that blackmail and that the government has not allowed us a vote on each of the two bills on their separate merits.
As far as Tasmania is concerned, there are about 1,500 TCF workers in Tasmania, with around 10 per cent of Devonport's work force employed in the industry. As was said by Senator Marshall, the last speaker, and by others, the back-up industries are also facing job losses. So the impact of tariff cuts on workers in this area is certainly of concern to my state. Workers losing jobs might be forced to look for work elsewhere and leave the state, taking their families with them. Any job losses have a big effect across the community. The lives of real people are affected by these decisions. The unions, of course, who represent the workers on the ground in the various TCF industries around the country, are quite opposed to further tariff cuts.
My concern about tariff cuts on workers' jobs has really not been addressed. I would find it very difficult indeed to vote without the necessary review and examination, and in fact against the will of the Productivity Commission. There is no proven national benefit for cutting tariffs. I would find it very difficult to support this legislation which cuts tariffs, but of course I support very strongly the continuation of SIPS funding.
I believe that we ought to at least bat the legislation back to the House of Representatives. Let us see who stands up on this occasion when faced with the predictability of job losses as a result of tariff cuts. This should be exposed, but obviously it will not be, and I understand why—the opposition have decided on what they will do. At least I would have thought it would be important to highlight this particular measure as unacceptable blackmail.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2004-12-07,"—I thank honourable senators for their contributions in the second reading debate on the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment Program Amendment (Post-2005 Scheme) Bill 2004. Undoubtedly there will be matters that will be raised during the committee stage. I thank those senators who flagged those issues during the second reading debate, because it allows us to have some answers prepared in anticipation of those questions being raised again during the committee stage.
As honourable senators would be aware, I am a senator from Tasmania. There are a number of TCF industries in Tasmania, such as Blundstones, the Australian Weaving Mills at Devonport and Ulster Tascot. As a result, I and my colleagues, especially the new members for Braddon and Bass, have been following this debate very closely and are supportive of the measures being introduced in the Senate today. From my personal perspective, especially welcome is the new small business program, which will provide, if I recall correctly, up to $25 million worth of assistance.
A number of senators have made contributions, and there has been an ongoing debate in this country about tariffs for now a considerable time. I recall, albeit not all that clearly, that in 1975 the then Whitlam government took the axe to tariffs in a very high-handed fashion which saw literally hundreds of people in my home state of Tasmania being thrown out of work. That is why this government, in seeking to reduce tariffs, is providing, and linking with a reduction in tariffs, assistance to these various industries. It should be remembered that basically one man's tariff is another man's tax and, as a result, a burden is placed on every Australian in relation to the placement on tariffs—
 (Senator Bolkus)—Keep on going, Senator Abetz. Don't be provoked. It is very hard not to be provoked by Senator Conroy sometimes.
—Do we have an agreement?
—There are no amendments.
—If the suggestion is that there might not even be a committee stage, that might be even better. But, having said that, the arguments are fairly clear as to why the government has been seeking to reduce tariffs. Tariffs in the TCF area are considered to cost consumers up to $1 billion a year, which is about $150 a year for each household. Therefore, there is a need to make these reductions. But we seek to bring them in in a phased period with certainty so that industry can adjust. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2004-12-07,"—The Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill (No. 2) 2002 and the Superannuation Guarantee Charge Amendment Bill 2002 were passed in 2002. Amongst the changes these bills introduced was the introduction of quarterly payments of superannuation guarantee contributions by employers. Quarterly payments were introduced for a number of reasons, including the safety and financial advantages more regular payment provided for employees, gains in government revenue and administrative advantages for the ATO. At the time, approximately 90 per cent of employers were paying on a quarterly or monthly basis, so the changes impacted only on the remaining 10 per cent—overwhelmingly small businesses.
As part of the introduction of quarterly payments, a further requirement that employers report superannuation guarantee contributions paid on an employee's behalf to that employee within 30 days of the payment was introduced. This measure was seen as enabling the employees to follow up quickly where the employer might be defaulting on SG contributions. Labor had for some time been arguing for these changes and, prior to the government introducing the bills in 2002, had moved amendments on two occasions. After a year of quarterly payments and reporting to members, the government has now introduced legislation that removes the requirement to report to members superannuation guarantee contributions paid on their behalf.
The removal of the reporting requirement was announced by the government during the election as part of its small business policy. The government's view is that reporting to employees creates an unnecessary compliance burden on employers and, in particular, small business. The government admits that by removing the requirement there will be a higher burden placed on superannuation funds that will have to deal with greater numbers of inquiries regarding the payment of contributions but believes that it is more important to reduce the burden on employers. The removal of the reporting requirement creates a major gap in the safety net for employees. The reporting enables the employee to keep track of his or her superannuation guarantee contributions. If they are reported regularly, it gives the employee the opportunity to follow up before the situation becomes irretrievable. If an employee is only notified annually by the fund, which is the most common situation, it may well be too late to remedy that situation. 
There are significant non-payment problems in relation to the superannuation guarantee, and often the problem is not identified until the business concerned is bankrupt or in the hands of a liquidator. Whilst it is difficult to obtain an accurate number of superannuation guarantee payment defaults on business failure, it is certainly in the tens of thousands each year. Many workers have lost years of superannuation in these circumstances. Most often they are those workers who can least afford to lose their superannuation savings—low-income workers and those who will face difficulty finding employment after the collapse of their employer's business.
Labor's comprehensive employee entitlements protections scheme would have provided full compensation. Although the employee may still contact the fund to find out if contributions are being made, it is unreasonable to expect employees to do this on a regular basis and it is also unreasonable to place the extra burden on the funds—an extra burden that will involve costs which in turn will reduce fund returns and ultimately the retirement nest eggs of Australian workers. Superannuation industry organisations and superannuation funds across the board have attacked the proposed change as a watering down of the safety provisions. Of particular concern is the so-called choice of fund legislation commencing 1 July 2005. Nonetheless, there is an argument for exempting from the reporting requirements employers who have a high turnover of employees. Examples have been given to Labor of some employers in the rural sector that employ seasonal and/or transient employees and the hospitality industry, which has a high turnover of casual employees.
There is some irony in the government's stated concern about the impact of superannuation legislation on employers when from 1 July 2005 employers will be hit by a massive new wave of regulation as a consequence of the so-called choice of super fund. New forms, new regulations, extra costs and additional legal liability will come with so-called choice—but more of that closer to the time. Labor is most concerned about the effect the removal of the reporting requirements will have on the ability of employees to monitor the payment of their superannuation guarantee contributions. Labor will reluctantly support this bill but will move during the committee stage of the bill to have it amended to ensure that the ATO reports on the levels of non-payment of superannuation contributions, as follows:
(1)	Schedule 1, page 3 (after line 10), at the end of the Schedule, add:
3  At the end of section 44
Add:
	(2)	A report prepared in accordance with subsection (1) must include:
	(a)	the number of employers who have failed to pay one or more of their employees' superannuation guarantee contributions by the date required by law;
	(b)	the number of employees whose employers have failed to pay their superannuation guarantee contributions by the date required by law;
	(c)	details of the total amount of superannuation guarantee contributions outstanding at the close of each reporting year;
	(d)	the number of defaulting employers who paid outstanding superannuation guarantee contributions after the payment date required by law;
	(e)	the number of actions taken by the Australian Taxation Office to enforce the payment of unpaid superannuation guarantee contributions; 
	(f)	the number of actions taken by the Australian Taxation Office to enforce the payment of unpaid superannuation guarantee contributions that were fully or partially successful;
	(g)	the total amount of outstanding superannuation guarantee contributions recovered at the close of the reporting year.

"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2004-12-07,"—The Tax Laws Amendment (Superannuation Reporting) Bill 2004 is in some respects a surprise. It removes an election promise the government made in 2001 and replaces it with what is clearly a very opportunistic election promise they made before the last election. It is a surprise because the legislation to actually introduce quarterly reporting on superannuation and quarterly reporting in respect of employer contributions back to employees was only debated in this place two years ago. In fact it is a pity that Senator Coonan, the then Assistant Treasurer, is not in the chamber today because I want to read back into the Hansard what she said when introducing this reporting requirement on 27 June 2002. She said:
The new regime will provide much more certainty to employees. More frequent contributions will create higher superannuation benefits because of compounding interest, a lower risk of workers losing superannuation entitlements if a company falls over and more timely evidence of noncompliance making it easier for the ATO to detect those employers who are failing to pay, and will lower the risk that a member's death and disability insurance where it is provided by a super fund might lapse between annual contributions. Furthermore, the bills require employers to report to their employees the amount and destination of their SG contributions. This will encourage employees to take an interest in their superannuation and alert them to any noncompliance sooner.
It is also worth noting that, as I said, this was actually part of the government's 2001 superannuation election policy. I want to quote now from the Prime Minister's press release of 5 November 2001 announcing his A Better Superannuation System policy. He said:
In order to ensure fairness between employees and to encourage employers to make regular superannuation contributions, the Coalition will require all employers to make at least quarterly superannuation contributions on behalf of their employees.
All of this makes it quite clear that the government recognised not only that superannuation should be paid to employees quarterly but also that employees needed to know that they were receiving it. Really that is a fundamental part of education. In fact when the government announced this backflip back in July 2004, when they decided to remove the requirement to report to employees, they were panned by not only the unions—the usual suspects—but also pretty much the entire superannuation industry and large chunks of the press. It is not often I find a Financial Review editorial criticising the government, but after this particular announcement was made the Financial Review went to press. On the one hand it was very positive about the government's superannuation agenda, such as the government's co-contributions scheme, which was increased in June last year and cut the surcharge, and the introduction of choice of funds legislation. On the other hand, the Financial Revieweditorial of 9 July this year said:
The super week has been soured by political opportunism. Prime Minister John Howard abruptly announced a reversal of the rule that employers have to notify fund members each quarter that their contributions have been paid into their super fund ... Every employer has to pay the amounts each quarter anyway, so the burden consists mainly of having to write to employees. Small employers do struggle in industries with a lot of itinerant employees, but why not tackle these problems with a suitable “best endeavours” clause? 
Instead, we have seen the minister in charge of superannuation, Helen Coonan, who talks endlessly about safety in super and reducing the amount of “lost” super, praising this overreaction. Even though it will take away the most basic protection—that members know contributions are actually paid—the minister believes “a combination of practices and safeguards found throughout other ... legislation will allow employers and employees to remain informed about superannuation”.
How does the government expect fund members to take greater interest in their super, track their money or choose the right fund if they're told about their account balance only once a year?
That is a pretty good summary of the issues tied up with this legislation. I think it is a real pity that we see this legislation coming forward from the government at this particular point in time. The actual explanatory memorandum attached to this bill is, in my view, misleading about the impact of this bill. It says quite clearly in the regulation impact statement:
The provision of information to employees will be maintained by a combination of reporting provisions in other Australian workplace legislation that requires reporting on payslips, and annual reporting from superannuation funds.
The ACTU, in their submission to the Senate committee looking into this bill, said the problem is that employees not covered by an award or whose award or agreement does not provide for superannuation contributions to be made do not have an entitlement to information about superannuation contributions. There is a real problem that the industrial relations system does not provide the information that the explanatory memorandum says it does. In addition, the ACTU points out:
It is not correct that state legislation necessarily provides for superannuation information to be supplied in payslips. In New South Wales, South Australia and Queensland, payslips are required to contain information about contributions but not the funds to which they are paid.
So we see that what the explanatory memorandum is saying about this bill is not in fact what it does. The simple fact is that a large number of employees will now again no longer have much clue as to where their superannuation is going. This makes it much more difficult for choice of funds to operate effectively and for the education of employees to actually be effective. I want to also quote the contribution from the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia to the Senate committee because I think it made a very important point. It said:
The superannuation industry saw the reporting obligation as particularly useful in tackling the problem of lost superannuation accounts as it will help employees keep track of their contributions. At an even more basic level, contributions reporting is a form of employee education as it is quite likely that an employee will take more notice of information about what the employer is paying to a fund on their behalf when it is associated with current entitlements to salary and wages. It is perhaps more difficult for fund communications to claim this level of attention.
So you can see that the superannuation industry, the unions and, indeed, the financial press recognise that reporting back to employees was a fundamental part of developing security and certainty in superannuation and reducing that huge body of $7 billion in lost accounts in this country. We in the Democrats recognise that you need to reduce compliance costs to business, and I think that is appropriate. You do not want to impose a compliance cost on business unless it is absolutely necessary, and whenever you do you seek to minimise that compliance cost as much as possible.
The advice from the Australian Financial Review's editorial was that we seek to ensure that best-endeavours reporting is picked up. The advice from ASFA is that we at least expand out the reporting on payslips to make sure that that picks up reporting back to employees. Indeed, if we are going to take the actual assertion in the explanatory memorandum that payslips is where all this stuff is reported, why don't we actually say that if they report it in payslips they do not have to report? That would actually pick up a large chunk of the compliance problem and reduce it significantly whilst actually confining the compliance issue to that very small number of employees not covered by awards and not covered by agreements which include superannuation clauses that provide for reasonable reporting back to their employees. That would actually significantly reduce the compliance cost burden and ensure that we were making a contribution to reducing the incidence of lost accounts and reducing the incidence of people not knowing where their superannuation is going. 
That is why in the committee stage the Democrats will be moving an amendment, which I have just circulated, to actually broaden the reporting requirement in this particular bill to cover this and to recognise that a reporting requirement is met where the information is provided on payslips or in a form that the employee can reasonably understand, such as a letter. For the vast majority of employers who already provide this information through payslips, that would mean that the actual compliance cost would not be there, and hopefully it would encourage employers to put this information in payslips, which would be the best place for it to be provided. It would at least ensure that there is reporting back to employees so that they can in fact track their superannuation.
This is a very disappointing bill. When this legislation was introduced two years ago, it had unanimous support in the Senate. We had all been calling for a long time for quarterly reporting. We had all been calling for a very long time—I have been involved in superannuation debates going back to 1993—for efforts to actually reduce the incidence of lost accounts. This legislation to introduce quarterly reporting as well as quarterly payments was actually a very positive step towards reducing the incidence of lost accounts. It is a pity that, as part of a small business compliance measure, the importance of that has been lost. It is a pity that we are going to actually see less, rather than more, reporting and that we are going to actually let business off the hook over developing decent and reasonable reporting back to their employees.
As I said, we have a whole bunch of ideas on how to actually reduce the compliance cost. Recognition through payslips is one idea, and that is the subject of the amendment that I will move today. It could also be done through the tax system, to augment the tax reporting which employers are already required to do. It could be done in other ways to actually ensure that the report does get back to employees in a way that minimises the cost to employers. That debate has not been opened. As the AustralianFinancialReview editorial said, this is very much about an opportunist statement—a bit of a big bang announcement following up on the Prime Minister's small business compliance announcement back in July last year.
I am pleased that Senator Coonan has joined the debate in the chamber. It is certainly disappointing to see this legislation coming forward. The Democrats will be opposing this legislation. That does not mean we are not open to discussing how to reduce the compliance costs of superannuation reporting; we are very open on that issue. But let us have a debate about how we actually balance, on one side, the importance of compliance costs and, on the other side, ensuring the employees get the information they need to actually protect their superannuation and make it safe and secure. Let us not engage in these opportunistic, simplistic solutions which may benefit certain categories of small business but will actually reduce the certainty and security facing employees in this country in terms of their superannuation. Particularly with the choice of funds legislation coming, it is absolutely crucial that we ensure that employees have more information to make informed decisions about their superannuation rather than less. 
I will ask the minister to address, in her second reading debate comments, what the government intends to do to overcome the very large hole that is now going to appear in superannuation reporting and to ensure that, when the choice of funds legislation comes in, employees do not lose the information they are receiving through quarterly reports. How are employees going to be informed of what they have actually received, given that the assertions in the explanatory memorandum are not correct about the role of the award system and the role of state legislation? How are you going to ensure that employers are encouraged to continue to provide this information so that employees can in fact follow their superannuation and make reasonable and informed choices, and so you actually reduce the incidence of lost accounts?",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (SUPERANNUATION REPORTING) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2004-12-07,"—I thank honourable senators who participated in the second reading debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (Superannuation Reporting) Bill 2004. The small business sector has for some considerable time been concerned at the administrative burden of the superannuation guarantee employer reporting requirement. The government recognises the high cost faced by employers in complying with this requirement, particularly those employing high levels of casual and itinerant workers. The government has responded to these concerns, which it regards as well founded, with amendments that will remove the requirement for employers to report to employees under the superannuation guarantee arrangements from 1 January 2005. This initiative will significantly reduce paperwork and costs for employers and remove duplication of information for many small businesses. 
Some senators have raised concerns that this amendment will have adverse consequences for employees. In fact, I think both of the speakers in this second reading debate have raised this issue. Obviously the government disagrees with this proposition or this bill would not be coming forward in its current form. The basis for the government's disagreement is that, whilst it is important that employees remain informed and engaged in relation to their superannuation entitlements, there is already a combination of practices and safeguards found throughout other Australian legislation that will allow employees to remain informed about their superannuation. Currently, superannuation funds provide members with at least annual reports, showing both employer and member contributions. Only information from funds can provide the certainty to members that contributions have been received by the fund and allocated to the correct account, and members can contact their funds as frequently as they wish.
There are also a number of provisions in Australian workplace legislation and awards that require employers to report superannuation contributions more regularly on pay slips. These amendments will not affect those obligations, nor will they affect an employer's obligation to make superannuation contributions at least quarterly. That brings us to consider the extent to which the notification, in addressing the concerns of small business, can be modified. The Workplace Relations Act 1996, for example, requires employers operating under federal awards, certified agreements and Australian workplace agreements—as well as Victorian and territory employers—to provide information in relation to superannuation contributions on pay slips. That requirement exists already. Queensland and South Australia have similar provisions requiring employers to disclose information about certain superannuation contributions on pay slips. So the government recognises the importance of employees knowing that their superannuation entitlements are being met and having a sense of ownership over their retirement savings. We have talked about that a great deal in debates on superannuation over the past three years. As I have already noted, employees will continue to receive at least annual statements from their superannuation funds and, importantly, even critically, they can contact their funds as frequently as they like to satisfy themselves that their entitlements have been received by their funds and allocated to their accounts. This level of conclusiveness is not provided by current employer reports. 
I was disappointed to hear that Senator Cherry is not supporting the bill in its current form. I was hoping that the good sense of the objectives behind this bill would receive support, given the great importance of keeping compliance costs at a level that is not unjustifiably burdensome on our business community and of getting the balance right between keeping employees informed of their contributions and meeting the need for business efficiencies and reducing the compliance burden. We are all aware that small business continually complains about compliance. If I may just foreshadow, it seems that the amendments that are being proposed ignore the fact that the objective of this bill is to significantly reduce the compliance burden on employers, particularly small businesses. We will get to it later but I think I can apprehend Senator Cherry's amendment, and my response to it is that it simply does not achieve this objective and is not aligned with the government's intent in this bill. The amendment would fail to assist small business and would maintain an onerous quarterly reporting requirement that has in effect been made redundant by the existence of other measures and safeguards that I have outlined in my remarks. For all of these reasons the government will be urging the Senate to pass the bill without amendment.
Question agreed to. 
Bill read a second time. ",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (SUPERANNUATION REPORTING) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2004-12-07,"—Mr Acting Deputy President, you would recall the debate we had in this chamber back in August for the passage of the Australia-United States free trade agreement. During that debate Labor amended the FTA bills. Those amendments were necessary to ensure the FTA did not undermine our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and to protect local Australian content on television. There was great controversy at the time about Labor's amendments in regard to the PBS. The Prime Minister said they would be unworkable, they were a mistake, they were not consistent with the spirit of the agreement and they would cause us great problems with the Americans; Labor was trying to sink the FTA. That was what the Prime Minister was suggesting. If the FTA failed to come to fruition because of Labor's amendments it would be Labor's fault.  
We are debating this Copyright Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 today not because of any mistake on the part of the Labor Party, not because Labor's PBS amendments have threatened to prevent the US FTA being implemented—no, not at all. Rather, this bill is necessary to address this government's incompetence. This bill is required to address all of the mistakes that the government made in its US FTA implementation bill, although it also appears to go further than that. It was not Labor's amendments that threatened the US FTA. It was the government's incompetence, the government's mistakes, the government`s failure to correctly amend Australian law to ensure that we complied with our obligations under the US free trade agreement. Accordingly, in light of the government's failure, I move the following amendment to the motion for the second reading of this bill:
At the end of the motion, add:
“but the Senate:
	(a)	notes:
	(i)	with concern, the failure of the Government to previously correctly implement its obligations under the United States Free Trade Agreement Implementation (USFTAI) Act;
	(ii)	with concern, that this Bill has the potential to enable persons other than copyright owners or exclusive licencees to force an internet service provider to take down allegedly infringing copyright material from their system and that this potential new ground for ISP liability is not contained in the USFTAI Act;
	(iii)	that this Bill was sent to the Legal and Constitutional Committee which heard evidence that the Bill may disrupt the balance of interests between copyright owners, users and internet service providers;
	(iv)	that the Government intends to respond to these concerns through Regulations that will flesh out legislative safe harbour provisions and will consult with stakeholders in the preparation of these provisions; 
	(v)	the commitment by the Government to keep implementation of the safe harbour scheme under close review and, as necessary, consult with stakeholders on any issues that may arise, including appropriate responses; 
	(vi)	that Labor's amendments to the Australia-US FTA are not contrary to the terms of the FTA, our international obligations under WTO TRIPs and are not referred to in this Bill;
	(vii)	with concern, that the diplomatic note of exchange from the US refers to Labor's amendments and the Senate therefore calls on the Government not to weaken in response to US pressure and to reaffirm its commitment to Labor's amendments to protect the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and local Australian content for television; and
	(b)	calls on the Government to restate its view that Australia has a different approach to the US on the criminalisation of pirated satellite signals in the home and to therefore give an explanation of its commitment to the US to undertake a review of Australia's domestic policy relating to criminalisation of all forms of satellite signal piracy, including unauthorised distribution or receipt of signals by commercial establishments and within the home, that shall conclude no later than 1 July 2005”. 
The government says that this bill is necessary to make various minor and clarifying amendments to the Copyright Act and the US FTA Implementation Act. These amendments are not minor and clarifying. Indeed, items 11 and 13 of the bill that address the copyright obligations of Internet service providers have, we understand, appeared without consultation with the Internet industry and come as a complete surprise. The text of the FTA commits Australia to a scheme for determining ISP liability based on the safe harbour concept—that is, if they meet certain conditions, ISPs will not be liable for breaches of copyright that may occur on their network by users. The text of the FTA is broad. ISPs may be liable if:
... they fail to act expeditiously to remove or disable access to the copyright material once they become aware that the material/s infringing, or become `aware of facts or circumstances from which the infringement was apparent'.
The government's FTA implementing legislation apparently did not adequately reflect this requirement. This bill therefore sets out further conditions that ISPs will have to meet to access the safe harbour. The bill raises complex issues affecting the balance of rights between copyright owners, copyright users and ISPs.
The Australian Digital Alliance and the Internet Industry of Australia have expressed considerable concern about the potential impact of these amendments. It was for these reasons that Labor sent this bill to the Senate Legal and Constitution Affairs Legislation Committee for examination. Just as Labor had to establish a Senate Select Committee on the US FTA to give the public the opportunity to have their say on the FTA, Labor was required to refer this bill for examination by committee.
At the hearing of the committee held last night, the Australian Film Industry Coalition advised that the arrangements in the bill do ensure a fair balance between owners and users. These arrangements are essential, they suggested, to ensure artists, performers and owners of copyright are adequately rewarded for their efforts. These are very valid points. However, it was also suggested that there are major problems with the bill. In particular, it will undermine the FTA safe harbour scheme, removing immunity for ISPs who act in good faith under the new arrangement and remove important protections for ISPs' customers. Internet users may no longer be able to prevent their legitimate material from being taken down.
The committee heard evidence that these new provisions go further than Australia's obligations required by the FTA. If we are to encourage the development of a knowledge based economy in Australia, this is not the way to do it. If we are to encourage an open and free flow of information across the Internet, this is not the way to do it. Officials from the Attorney-General's Department advised the committee that many of the concerns raised by ISPs would be addressed in accompanying regulations. However, these regulations have not yet been made available. The Senate is not in a position to scrutinise them.
We are, once again, put in a position of assessing legislation without the accompanying regulations that will affect the operation and impact of the legislation. Notwithstanding the inadequacy of this arrangement, Labor accept an assurance received today from Minister Vaile that the concerns of ISPs and copyright users will be resolved through regulations. The government has made it quite clear that these regulations will flesh out the legislative safe harbour provisions and the rights and obligations of copyright owners, users and ISPs. Labor also take assurance from Minister Vaile's commitment that: 
... the Government will keep implementation of the scheme under close review and, as necessary will consult with stakeholders on any issues that may arise, including appropriate responses.
Mr Acting Deputy President, I seek leave to table the letter that the shadow trade minister received today from Minister Vaile, as it is the intention of the shadow minister to table the letter in the other place.
Leave granted.
—The exchange of diplomatic notes between Australia and the US on 17 November was the final step between our two countries to bring the FTA into force on 1 January 2005. The content of those letters was very instructive for the references that have been made to key areas of Australian public policy. The government appears to have made further commitments to the US on key areas of public policy without adequate—indeed any—consultation with Australian stakeholders. Notwithstanding Labor's rock solid legal advice that our amendments to the PBS are compliant with the text of the FTA and our obligations under the WTO TRIPs agreement, the US has expressed concern in their letter. Specifically, the US has said Labor's amendments:
... impose a potentially significant, unjustifiable, and discriminatory burden on the enjoyment of patent rights, specifically on owners of pharmaceutical patents.
The US goes on to:
... urge the Australian government to review this matter, particularly in light of Australia's international obligations.
Labor's amendments to protect the PBS, were developed on the basis of sound legal advice, released publicly, fully scrutinised and supported by the accompanying legal counsel advice. No such advice was released by the government to support their argument that Labor's amendments may have contravened the deal. Nor has the US released any advice to support its claims.
The government supported Labor's amendments. It is therefore the responsibility of the government to recommit to those amendments and to push back on any US attempts to challenge those amendments in the future. It is incumbent upon, and the responsibility of, the government to respond robustly if the US were to challenge Labor's amendments at some point in the future. Those amendments were based on sound legal advice. They were supported by the government and passed by the parliament. They were necessary to protect the PBS and must not be diminished in any way by any future action the US—or the government—may take.
The US has made it clear that the exchange of letters between Australia and the US enabling the FTA to come into force on 1 January was dependent upon this bill successfully passing through this parliament. This raises a very serious concern. Once again, we are confronted by this government's continuing arrogance and lack of respect for the authority of this parliament. The parliament is not here merely to rubber stamp decisions of the executive. Once again, the Senate is being presented with a bill as a fait accompli. The bill was developed in full consultation with the US to ensure that they were satisfied with the laws that this government intended to introduce. Minister Vaile attached a copy of this bill to his letter to Ambassador Zoellick. The government consulted the US—a stakeholder in the FTA, but another country. The government consulted with the US on the contents of key elements of this bill before consulting fully with its own citizens, its own stakeholders. We have again been presented with another signed and sealed deal with accompanying legislation that the parliament must rubber stamp. 
For these reasons Labor is committed to introducing a new mechanism for parliamentary scrutiny of free trade agreements. Prior to commencing negotiations for bilateral or regional free trade agreements, a Labor government will table in both houses of parliament a document setting out its priorities and objectives. This will include an assessment of the costs and benefits of any proposals that may be negotiated. Once the negotiation is complete, the government will table in parliament a package including the proposed treaty, together with any legislation required to implement the treaty domestically. Labor is committed to giving the Australian public an effective democratic and transparent process to review any FTA being negotiated to ensure it is in Australia's national interest. Labor will not conduct FTA negotiations in the secret manner pursued by this government. This government's arrogance and contempt for the parliament is unacceptable and must not be allowed to continue.
Senator NETTLE (New South Wales) (7.46 p.m.)—I seek leave to incorporate Senator Ridgeway's contribution to the second reading debate on the Copyright Legislation Amendment Bill 2004.
Leave granted.",SENATE,<title>COPYRIGHT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2004-12-07,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—
I rise this evening to speak to the Copyright Legislation Amendment Bill 2004.
I would like to begin by saying that, in my view, we should not be dealing with this Bill today. This is an immensely complex Bill, which will have a major impact on Australian copyright industries. The Senate is being asked to enact this Bill without due consideration, without taking a thorough look at these provisions and working out what their impact will be. This is a house of scrutiny, and the opportunity for scrutiny is being denied.
The question of liability for Carriage Service Providers is the most talked-of example, but the fact remains that there are many other problems with this Bill as well. The Parliamentary Library Briefing—which was released only this morning—raises a number of other issues that need to be considered. Will the test for `temporary reproductions' cause confusion within Australian law? Will there be unintended consequences? Could the provisions with respect to the definition of `profit' be drafted more clearly? Why has the non-commercial end use of encoded broadcast not been included in this Bill, when it is clearly required by the FTA? These questions, and many more, need to be examined thoroughly by a Senate Committee.
Delaying this Bill will NOT invalidate the US Free Trade Agreement. The Agreement has been signed, the letters have been exchanged. The deal WILL come into force on 1 January irrespective of what is decided here today. No matter what our Minister has agreed to with the US behind closed doors, no matter what compromises have been made or concessions offered, this Parliament has a right to do its job properly.
The events of this week do not constitute the Senate doing its job properly. The Government released the text of the Bill only days ago, after what seems like only the most cursory of consultations with Industry. The Minister describes the Bill as making `minor and technical' amendments, a claim that is patently false. We then find out that the
Industry was consulted on a version of the Bill that didn't even include the most controversial provisions. They were sneaked in at the last moment. These are not the actions of a Government who has nothing to hide.
What has been promised to the US that we don't know about? I can only wonder. 
Then the Senate refuses to exempt this highly technical, extremely complicated Bill from the cut-off. The Selection of Bills committee holds an extraordinary meeting to refer this Bill to a special committee—with a 24 hour reporting deadline. The Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee met for two hours last night. Two hours! The provisions of the Bill are so complex that the first witnesses—who had only been allotted 25 minutes to give evidence—were kept before the Committee for a full hour. Even then, they were asked to provide substantial amounts of further evidence on notice. The same story followed for the second and third witnesses. By the time we got to the Attorney-General's Department and DFAT witnesses, only FIFTEEN minutes were available for questioning. Needless to say, the Committee did not get the answers it was looking for. In fact, I would go so far as to say that the hearing raised more questions than it answered.
The Committee doesn't even have time to issue a report. No, instead we are tabling the Hansard, as if that proves that there was a process of scrutiny undertaken at any point. What anyone who reads this Hansard will find is that last night's hearing was confusing and dealing with very complicated matters. Each Senator on that Committee, both Government and non-Government expressed their incredulity that the provisions of this Bill clearly go beyond the requirements of the Free Trade Agreement.
Why are we being asked to enact these shockingly onerous provisions,
when the FTA doesn't even ask us to? Why are we being asked to scuttle the internet industry in Australia, when we are not required to by the Agreement, and in fact, what we are proposing goes WAY beyond what the US has imposed in its own country!
This Bill is a mess. It needs to be thoroughly considered and debated, not rushed through this place in the final week of sitting. If the Government couldn't get its act together to draft these provisions before now, that is not the Senate's fault. We have to do our job properly, and it is for that reason that I will be proposing a second reading amendment that will refer this Bill to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee for a full and proper Inquiry after the second reading stage.
As we discussed in August, the IP chapter of the Agreement is the most significant—with the most far-reaching reforms which will have a direct and serious impact on Australian innovative industries. Some of these changes, such as the ratification of the WIPO treaty, are positive reforms. However, aspects of the chapter relating to extension of the copyright term, provisions relating to anti-circumvention devices, and liability of ISPs relating to copyright infringement are very dangerous developments.
We are changing the future of Australian copyright law through a trade agreement, rather than through thorough, reasoned, considered debate here in our own country about how we want our future media landscape to be structured. These changes are being implemented for strategic political and trade objectives, as items to be horse-traded in negotiations—a compromise here, a concession there—rather than with an eye to what is best for Australia. This is an unacceptable way to go about policy development. These commitments have been locked in, with no opportunity for the Australian people to have their own say.
The fact remains, however, that even IF we supported the USFTA, the specific provisions of this Bill are sufficiently controversial that the Bill should be opposed in its own right.
I want to spend a moment discussing the various sections of the Bill, and the potential problems that may arise. Then I will turn to the most controversial aspect of the Bill, and that is the provisions relating to Carriage Service Provider liability.
This Bill amends the wording of the general exception for the making of temporary reproductions. However, under these provisions, the protection from infringement would only apply to temporary reproductions made as a necessary part of a technical process of use. The problems with this test lies in the definition of the terms `temporary' and `necessary'—a matter I had intended to pursue further at the third reading stage, but given that this Bill now has Opposition support, we have made the judgement call that there will be no point us bringing up these very important matters. 
The Bill also amends the criminal offence provisions of the Copyright Act, to do with making infringing copies of copyright material to obtain profit. It changes the test that is required to be met to prove that profit has been obtained. Rather than simply replacing one version of the test with the version mandated by the FTA, the Government is seeking to implement an `either/or' test, which may produce some unexpected results as courts try to grapple with the differences between the two elements.
The Bill also criminalises the showing of illegally obtained encoded broadcast material (such as subscription television or radio) for commercial advantage or profit. However, the Bill does not provide a criminal offence for the non-commercial (that is, personal) end-use of infringing broadcasts, which is clearly required by the Agreement. The United States' view that Australia has not complied with AUSFTA is almost certainly correct. While the Australian provisions fulfil this requirement for commercial purposes, the question of personal use has been ignored completely. Why the Government would deliberately choose to avoid implementing the FTA in this case is a mystery.
The USFTAI Act established a new regime for determining when Carriage Service Providers (businesses that provide internet or telecommunications services) might be liable for copyright infringements by users over the CSP's network or service. The effect of the existing CSP provisions is to create a `safe harbour' of conditions where a CSP can avoid liability if certain criteria are fulfilled or certain processes are followed. This Bill amends the USFTAI Act tests for `financial benefit' and `awareness' that determine whether a CSP has `safe harbour' protection.
The new provisions relate to `Category C and D' activities—which relate to hosting websites that may contain copyright infringing material, or linking to sites that contain copyright infringing material. While the Bill applies to all `carriage' service providers, Category C and D apply mainly to Internet Service Providers (ISPs).
The new aspects of the `financial benefit' test are problematic in themselves, but given that I only have a short time here today, I will defer further discussion of this matter.
I want to focus instead on the provisions of this Bill that establish that mere awareness of category `C' or `D' activities creates liability. These are the most controversial aspects of this Bill.
Under AUSFTA, the awareness test is linked to the process for notification of infringement. This process provides a system for copyright owners to send `take-down notices' informing ISPs of copyright infringements across their network. It also provides an opportunity for the alleged infringer to provide a counter-notice refuting the allegation. Different obligations arise for ISPs depending on the nature of the take-down notice and whether a counter-notice is received. Also, AUSFTA requires that monetary remedies be available against people providing false information in notices and counter-notices. In the original USFTAI Bill, this ground of liability was going to be established by regulation, together with the specifics of the `take down notice' system as it will operate in practice.
There were serious concerns about the potential effect of this system in the original USFTAI Act, although some players in the industry were content that the scheme provided for a fair balance of the rights and obligations of copyright owners, ISPs and copyright users.
However, this new Bill goes even further than the original Act, and upsets this balance. Under the new provisions, ISPs must take material down if they are aware that material is infringing, or if they are `aware of facts or circumstances that make it apparent the material is likely to be infringing'. This removes the copyright owner from the equation, and places the entire responsibility for enforcing the scheme onto ISPs. ISPs will be required to take action on even the slightest suspicion that a copyright infringement may have occurred.
ISPs will be responsible for making decisions on infringement or not—and their liability is at stake. The onus will be on the ISP to err on the side of extreme caution—taking all suspect material down to avoid liability from legal action by copyright owners. However, if they do take material down which is later proven not to have infringed copyright, the copyright user will be able to sue for damages. 
We have not yet seen a copy of the proposed regulations that will provide the detail of how this scheme will operate in practice. The Senate is being asked to enact the punitive aspect of this test, but with no detail of any checks and balances that may be provided in the regulations. This is unacceptable—and yet another reason why consideration of this Bill should be delayed—we must see the proposed Regulations before this Bill can be passed.
In his second reading speech, the Minister claimed that industry had been consulted on this Bill, and were satisfied with its provisions. However, this has been shown to be false. Representatives of the internet Industry Association have publicly expressed their deep concern about this new test. While they were consulted on an earlier version of the Bill, these new provisions have been included in the final Bill without any consultation at all. The IIA are supported by the Australian Digital Alliance and the Australian Vice Chancellor's Committee in their opposition to these provisions.
So far, the Attorney-General and Trade Minister have not been forthcoming with convincing explanations as to why these provisions are necessary. They are not required by the AUSFTA, they go further than the USA's own system under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, and will create major burdens on Australian ISPs.
This Bill is a mess. While parts of it may be interpreted as enacting the AUSFTA more effectively (not that this is a good thing!), other parts go far further than the FTA, and others still stop short of implementing the deal at all. We have no idea what has been agreed behind closed doors between Vaile and Zoellick, and whether compromises have been made in regard to the IP chapter of the Agreement to make up for concessions to do with pharmaceuticals. The Bill cannot be supported, and at the very least must be amended to overcome the more onerous aspects of its provisions.
As I discussed earlier, I firmly believe that we should not be dealing with this Bill at this time. I had intended to move a Second Reading Amendment to refer this Bill to a Committee for thorough consideration before the Senate is asked to deal with it any further. However, the Opposition has indicated that they will not support our proposed amendment, so we have elected not to move it. I must say, I am very disappointed with the Labor Party in this matter. Not content simply with letting the FTA through in August—albeit with token amendments that will achieve very little—they are now going to let through a bill that they actually KNOW will do significant harm. We had also prepared amendments that would have removed Items 11 and 13 from the Bill, which would have enabled us to still implement the terms of the FTA, but refrain from doing real damage to the Australian internet industry, but the Labor Party has rolled over.
Why are we even here for the next six months? It seems to me that the Government doesn't need to wait until July 2005 to gain control of the Senate—they already have it. The ALP is willing to let anything get through this place—even when they know full well that they are condemning sectors of Australian industry to ambiguity, confusion, and unquantifiable harm.
I would like to end by recording my apologies to the Industry representatives who worked so hard to bring us up to speed on this Bill so quickly—I thank them for their assistance, and express my regrets that we weren't able to achieve a better result.",SENATE,<title>COPYRIGHT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-12-07,"—The US-Australia free trade agreement is a disaster for Australia's economy, culture and society. The impact of the agreement is even clearer with this Copyright Legislation Amendment Bill 2004, which will further transform Australia's intellectual property law to align it with the worst aspects of the US copyright law. It was clear from the beginning of the negotiations that, despite government claims, any agreement reached on the trade agreement would benefit US corporations at the expense of Australian industry, workers and consumers. The final deal was a dud for Australian agriculture and manufacturing industry and traded away important regulation of access to cheap medicines and intellectual property. 
Earlier this year the government, with the support of the opposition, rammed through the implementing legislation for the deal, despite widespread public opposition to the agreement. We now know that even the weak amendments passed by the Senate regarding the evergreening of pharmaceutical patents are likely to be challenged by the United States. US Trade Ambassador Zoellick, in his recent letter to the Minister for Trade, Mark Vaile, released by the government last week, states:
If subsequent practice reveals problems with the full exercise of US rights I have discussed above, Australia should expect that we will take appropriate remedial action.
This is exactly the danger the Greens and other critics of the trade agreement warned of. The US will use the agreement as a stick with which to break open the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, undermine generics and force up the price of medicines for sick Australians—all this so that big US pharmaceutical corporations can boost their profits.
While there has been a lot of debate about the PBS and the cultural components of the free trade agreement, in many ways some of the key issues in the agreement have not been properly explored yet. While the government claims the agreement is about free trade, this intellectual property component of the trade agreement—the harmonising of our laws with the US intellectual property laws—means less free trade and more government enforcement of private monopoly rights. Chapter 17 of the free trade agreement covers trademarks, patents and copyright. Most of the clauses on intellectual property reproduce those in the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act 1998 and those in the Singapore and Chile free trade agreements. They are part of an ongoing agenda of the United States to push through bilateral trade agreements that enhance the control and ownership of US corporations in the IT and entertainment industry.
The US wanted these changes, because according to a new book by trade experts Linda Weiss, Elizabeth Thurbon and John Mattews:
The intellectual property protected sector is now by some accounts the largest sector of the entire US economy. Everything from life forms to movies is covered in this sector. Its exports now exceed the exports of automobile, automobile parts, agricultural and aircraft industries combined. This is the real reason for the US concern to extend and strengthen IP rights. The copyright-protected sector on its own—covering films, TV programs, home video, digital video-discs, business and entertainment software—was estimated to be worth 5.2 per cent of US GDP in 2001, US$535 billion. In the same year, this sector achieved foreign sales of US$89 billion, making it the leading export sector in the United States ... Thus in the area of intellectual property, the US has a very definite agenda backed by very real economic interests.
The US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act 2004 implemented this agenda in Australian law: for example, extending the life of copyright from 50 to 70 years, the so-called `Disney' clause. The Greens opposed this legislation and the IP component of this legislation not only because it increased the powers of US corporations but also because it did not even include some of the few protections that do exist in the United States for users and consumers in the form of fair use and the free speech provisions that exist in the US constitution. The Australian Libraries Copyright Committee explained at the time:
The detrimental consequences of this will be felt broadly amongst educational, consumer, cultural and research institutions. Without expansion of the fair dealing provisions to balance the stronger copyright owner rights, institutions functioning for the benefit of the public, will bear the burden of a longer copyright term, more stringent copyright owner rights, and tougher penalties for incidental, minor and non-commercial breaches of Copyright. This will expose institutions to greater costs and greater risks. Ultimately this will adversely affect the end users of these institutions, who will not be able to access the same level of knowledge via copyrighted material. 
The agreement in the legislation also went well beyond what Australia had even signed on to in the highly criticised WTO agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property rights, known as TRIPS. Australia and Australians will not benefit from these laws if they come into force on 1 July next year. Australia already has a balance of payments deficit when it comes to intellectual property. We are a net importer of ideas and technology and our payments of royalties to foreign companies exceed our income in 2002 by more than $A1 billion. Thanks to the Howard government we now have some of the most unbalanced and restrictive intellectual property laws in the world, with holders or owners of copyright—that is, primarily big business—holding all of the cards at the expense of users and consumers such as libraries, universities, Australian industry and ordinary consumers. 
But post the election in United States the US has come back for more. The Minister for Trade, Mark Vaile, has caved in yet again, agreeing to changes to Australia's intellectual property law that go even further than international agreements and even further than the US law in protecting the US corporate owners of intellectual property at the expense of users and consumers. Why? The US are going to do whatever they can get away with in terms of furthering their own agenda, and it seems that the Howard government are all too willing to cooperate. The clauses contained in the bill—and the US has managed to get the Australian government to agree to them—will go far further than international agreements. They will set a new benchmark for the United States when it comes to their negotiations either with bilateral agreements or with multilateral agreements.
The government claim that the changes contained in this bill are merely technical or minor. But that is not what the industry groups or consumer groups are saying. Groups as diverse as Optus, Telstra, libraries, universities and the Australian Consumers Association are all very concerned by the proposals put forward in this legislation. In particular, changes which will effectively remove the safe harbour provisions that were introduced in the earlier legislation, the implementing bill, mean that diversity on the Internet will be threatened.
The bill includes provisions which will do a range of different things. They will broaden the scope of offences to which criminal provisions apply to commercial piracy that does not occur in a trade context and strengthen the criminal regime for business end-user piracy, increase the obligation of copyright users to go behind the person or corporation named on the item to find out if there are additional copyright owners, narrow the scope of the incidental copies exception to temporary copies made as a necessary part of using a copy of the work and limit the transition period in which copyright users can claim compensation due to the extension of copyright from 50 to 70 years. But the provisions that the Greens and community groups are particularly concerned about regard the liabilities of Internet service providers, and these are complainants whom we believe can have the greatest impact. However, other industry groups have been pointing out concerns about other parts of this legislation as well.
Changes to copyright law forced by the US free trade agreement made earlier in the year imported from the US the so-called safe harbour scheme for Internet service providers. This scheme meant that ISPs, the Internet service providers, that operated within the guidelines and the requirements of the safe harbour would not be subject to liability for infringing copyright from materials through the hosting of a user's web sites or services. This included the transmission of infringing material, the caching of material, the hosting of web sites with infringing material and the linking to infringing material. 
Internet service providers under the existing legislation must still remove infringing material if they have actual knowledge of an infringement, but they are not required to monitor their web sites and servers for infringing material. For example, if they receive a court order requiring them take down material, they need to comply. But they do not need to go looking for that material on their sites. However, items 11 and 13 contained in this bill will mean that the safe harbour provisions will go out the window. Item 11 and item 13 of the bill will have a significant and detrimental effect on the Australian IT industry and, more importantly, on ordinary consumers and users of the Internet. Item 11, which is the same as item 13, states:
The carriage service provider must act expeditiously to remove or disable access to a reference residing on its system or network if the carriage service provider:
(a) becomes aware that the copyright material to which it refers is infringing; or—
and this is particularly concerning—
(b) becomes aware of facts or circumstances that make it apparent that the copyright material to which it refers is likely to be infringing.
Similar clauses in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act 1998 in the United States have led to a burgeoning industry of take-down notices and claims which have meant that Internet service providers are forced into taking off line web sites and services rather than risking potential legal action.
The key problem with these items is that they force ISPs to take action regardless of the substance of the claim, or risk legal action. Claims can be spurious and unfounded yet, because they are not tested in a court prior to the ISP needing to take action, they are wide open to abuse. Some ISPs have been served with tens of thousands of take-down notices. Often these notices are automatically generated by software which searches the Internet for potential infringements. According to the Internet Industry Association, which represents a range of industry players including Optus and Telstra through to the smaller IT companies, this bill will cause huge problems. They say, `Internet service providers will be caught between a “rock and a hard place”—liable to copyright owners if we don't act, liable to customers if we do.' The careful balance of the rights of copyright owners, users and ISPs is severely undermined.
The Electronic Frontiers Foundation, EFF, a leading advocate for organising Internet rights and freedoms, have compiled a list of examples of some of the abuses that have occurred under similar provisions in the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act. This has meant that information in the public domain has been taken down. For example, Wal-Mart have used take-down provisions to stop web sites occurring that compare their prices to the prices of their competitors; the Church of Scientology have served take-downs on web sites that host articles critical of the Church of Scientology; and the owners of trademarks have tried to use take-downs against their competitors.
The number of notices served on one company can often, as I said before, number in the thousands or, indeed, the tens of thousands. A conference was held at the University of New South Wales in April this year, at which Sarah Deutsch, from Verizon, a major American ISP, told the symposium: 
A US ISP received from January to today—
that is, from January until the end of April this year—
over 30,000 notices, only two of them actually related to materials that were on its system of network. So these were all non-compliant notices and in the past 12 months the same ISP—
which received 30,000 notices from January to April—
received over 90,000 notices.
So this is the number of notices that we are talking about being automatically or otherwise—but predominantly automatically—generated. The Australian Consumers Association has described this proposed regime as a `recipe for disaster'. They say it `turns Internet service providers into a policeman of other people's copyright, solely based on some sort of assertion of ownership'. The Australian Digital Alliance, which represents libraries and universities, say that a scheme such as that contained in this bill `has to address the potential for owners to send out spurious take-down notices without reasonable claim to a copyright breach', and they have called for these clauses to be removed—something that the Greens will address in amendments.
The problem, of course, is that ISPs have no real way of testing the claims of take-down notices and will always err on the side of caution and immediately remove material subject to notification. They will always do this regardless of the rights or wrongs of the claim, because they do not want to risk the big legal battles that we have seen recently in cases such as the music industry's pursuit of Kazaa, the Internet file-sharing software company. Of course, such take-down notices could also be used politically with, for example, a take-down notice being served on the ISP of a political opponent's web site. The result, even if only temporary, could mean that the web site would be off line for weeks. It could, for example, be at a crucial or important point in an election campaign. The effect is a reduction in diversity and freedom of speech on the Internet and a huge impost on Australian IT's small and large business.
The Greens' amendments will remove from the bill the provisions which would effectively shut down the safe harbour for Internet service providers in Australia. Those are items 11 and 13 of the bill. The effect of removing these items will not prevent the enactment of alternative provisions in the future, so the government would be able to do so by regulation, as was originally envisaged in the legislation—certainly in the consultations that occurred with the industry. Hopefully, it means that government will consult further with industry and address the problems these items will cause.
This legislation is unnecessary and unwelcome. It will take us even further down the path of the US monopoly copyright law but without the protections. In the cases I am talking about, it will be worse than the US law. It is not at all about protecting Australian consumers and the IT industry but everything about helping giant US media and IT corporations. The Greens opposed the US free trade agreement implementing legislation, and we will also be opposing this bill today as well as moving the amendments I have outlined and others that are yet to be circulated. We will continue to campaign in support of genuine fair trade rather than free trade. We will also campaign for a better deal for Australian industry and ordinary people who are affected by such agreements, not just on the IP component of the legislation that we are talking about today but also more generally.",SENATE,<title>COPYRIGHT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1,speech

Leave granted.
The section of the document read as follows—
Senate Amendments 1, 2 and 5
These amendments seek to insert a definition of `need' into the Act. They also require States, Territories and non-government education authorities to commit to give priority in the allocation of funding according to need. The Government supports the provision of funding to schools on a needs basis and this principle underpins Australian Government funding for schools.  
The Australian Government funds non-government schools according to a formula which measures the socioeconomic status (SES) of the communities from which a school draws its students.
The SES funding model involves linking student residential addresses to Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) national Census data to obtain a socioeconomic profile of the school community (based on occupation, education and income) and measure its capacity to support the school. The SES approach, unlike the Education Resources Index (ERI) system which it replaced, is transparent and objective, based on independent data that are consistent for all schools.
One of the key principles that underpin the SES model is that private investment in education should not be discouraged, and therefore, it does not take into account a school's private income from fees or any other sources. The amendment contradicts this principle.
To include a definition of “need” in the legislation, which covers a range of schools programmes, unnecessarily limits how need may be interpreted and could adversely affect the funding of schools. The definition of `need' is very broad and potentially could make it difficult for States/systems to target funding for specific needs groups of students.
Any definition of need is best accommodated within specific programme guidelines for particular programmes, as is currently the case. The Australian Government provides funding for schools under the Capital Grants Programme and a number of targeted programmes such as the Literacy, Numeracy and Special Learning Needs Programme, the Country Areas Programme, the Languages Programme, and the English as a Second Language—New Arrivals Programme. Funding for these programmes are predominantly allocated according to need and educational disadvantage.
State and Territory government and non-government school education authorities are responsible for the detailed administration of the school funding programmes in their systems and schools. Under the current arrangements, school education authorities have the flexibility to make decisions on which schools have the greatest need for additional assistance, including for educationally disadvantaged students, and to determine appropriate funding amounts for those schools. Schools also have the flexibility to use funding to meet the needs of their students.
The Agreement conditions are also comprehensive and set out the expected outcomes and reporting and a commitment to meeting the National Goals for Schooling, which are already agreed by all governments.
In addition, the subject matter of the Bill as it currently stands has been the subject of consultations with all State and non-government education authorities, peak bodies and other major stakeholders. The Government is conscious of previous strong criticisms from State Governments and the non-government sector where it undertakes amendments to Commonwealth legislation which can have implications for government and non-government school authorities without the opportunity for prior detailed consultation on the form of procedures of this type and their implementation.
There has been no correspondingly extensive consultation with the education sector on the proposed amendment.
Accordingly the House of Representatives does not accept these amendments.
Senate Amendments 3 and 6
These amendments propose to change the wording on the commitment concerning principal autonomy to provide flexibility for system wide recruitment incentives particularly in hard to staff schools in isolated regions. The Government has already responded to this concern by including in the Bill a provision that a commitment to give the principal and governing body autonomy over matters including staffing should be “within a supportive framework of broad systemic policies” [Refer to Part 2, sections 14(k) and 31(k) of the Bill]. 
The proposed amendment is superfluous and does no more than express in different words the existing provision for teacher appointments to be made within a supportive framework of systemic policies. That provision recognises the need for school systems to implement policies and practices that ensure good teachers are available in the required numbers for all schools—especially in the case of rural and remote schools. The specific requirements in relation to this provision will be set out in the Regulations as part of the school performance reporting element and will reflect this consideration also. 
Recent educational research indicates that highly effective schools have strong and effective school leaders who drive the development of school policies and practices. The provision (on school/principal autonomy) will strengthen the ability of school leaders to make effective teacher appointments for their schools.
Accordingly the House of Representatives does not accept these amendments.
Senate Amendments 4 and 7
These amendments propose to insert a number of principles for reporting on students' learning and school performance. The Bill already contains a strong accountability and reporting framework with a focus on improving student outcomes. The educational interests of students are best served through commitment and focus to improving student outcomes
Parents need student reports that are meaningful and use plain English enabling them to better assist their child's learning and development. It's time to place parents more firmly at the centre of schooling.  
The Bill includes provisions for greater disclosure by schools of their performance. There is an urgent need for greater transparency and accountability from schools to parents and the community.
	School performance information is not readily accessible or meaningful and parents need better information to inform decisions about their child's schooling;
	It is important that schools publish a broad range of information on their achievement and programmes so that parents can choose a school that best suits their child's needs;
	It is important to keep a strong focus on outcomes, not just inputs. How many school students are achieving national literacy and numeracy benchmarks? What are the outcomes in senior secondary schools—retention rates and academic achievement?; 
	Regulations accompanying the Bill will set out minimum requirements for school performance information. Schools will be able to inform parents and publish information of other their policies and programmes on offer.
An earlier report prepared by Professor Peter Cuttance and Shirley Stokes, Reporting on Student and School Achievement, surveyed over 500 parents to identify principles of best practice in reporting student and school achievement. These have played an important role in forming a stronger accountability and performance framework seen in the current legislation 
Accordingly the House of Representatives does not accept these amendments.
Senate Amendment 8
This amendment requires non-government schools to publicly report all sources of gross income received and all gross expenditure. The Australian Government strongly supports all educational authorities publishing the total amount of public funds that the school receives. The Australian Government has published the amount of general recurrent funding that every non-government school in Australia will receive each year from 2003-08. 
The Australian Government does not believe it appropriate to require the publishing of the detailed financial accounts of non-government schools as they are independent entities. Further, such a requirement has not been discussed with the Catholic and Independent school sectors. The Australian Government believes that the sector should be consulted before new requirements are imposed on them.
Non-government schools provide detailed financial information to the Australian Government in order to ensure full accountability of the public funds that they receive from the Australian Government. Non-government school authorities must, among things, provide financial accountability each year, in the form of a certificate, signed by an accountant, to the effect that funds have been spent, or committed, for the purpose for which they were provided. 
Accordingly the House of Representatives does not accept these amendments.
Senate Amendment 9
This amendment requires non-government schools to publish any exclusion policy and practices. As private entities it is the right of individual schools to implement whatever enrolment policies are in line with their educational philosophies. However, to be eligible for Australian Government funding, all non-government schools must meet the same obligations regardless of their particular religious or educational philosophy. It is also a condition of funding that the schools commit themselves to Australia's National Goals for Schooling in the Twenty-First Century.  
The National Goals include the provisions that “students' outcomes from schooling are free from the effects of negative forms of discrimination based on sex, language, culture and ethnicity, religion or disability; and of differences arising from students' socio-economic background or geographical location” and that “all students understand and acknowledge the value of cultural and linguistic diversity, and possess the knowledge, skills and understanding to contribute to, and benefit from, such diversity in the Australian community and internationally.”
Accordingly the House of Representatives does not accept these amendments.
Senate Amendments 10 and 11
These amendments seek to provide a process for system or state-wide priorities for the assessment of the allocation of capital grants for government and non-government schools; an explicit reference to the distribution of capital funding on a relative needs basis for schools, and require parents to be explicitly involved in the process of setting priorities for capital expenditure. These amendments are unnecessary. It is not necessary to legislate this level of detail in relation to programme administration and consultation. The Administrative Guidelines, which form part of the funding agreements specify detailed requirements for the Capital Grants in terms of allocating funding, assessment and reporting requirements.
Under these guidelines, the Block Grant Authorities (which administer the capital money for non-government schools) already determine the priorities for funding on the basis the relative educational disadvantage of the schools. In determining educational disadvantage, they take into account the SES score of the schools, number of isolated and special needs children and health and safety issues.
Accordingly the House of Representatives does not accept these amendments.
Senate Amendment 12 
This amendment seeks a review of resources for all schools before 31 December 2005 including a report on the buildings, facilities and equipment available at every school in Australia. Australian Government capital funding for government schools has been maintained in real terms and increased in actual dollars. The principle responsibility for maintaining the fabric of Australia's schools systems rests with State and Territory governments. The States and Territories have the major responsibility for State schools, which they own and manage. The Government encourages States to undertake proper planning for all their schools consistent with their responsibility for managing their school system. The undertaking of such a review on government schools would need to be considered by States and Territories.
In 2002, DEST published an analysis of non-government school infrastructure Taking Stock—Report of the Survey of Non-Government Schools Infrastructure in Australia 2000/2001. The report presents key findings from the National Survey of Non-Government Schools Infrastructure in 2000 and 2001. The survey collected a broad range of data that demonstrate sufficiency, condition and suitability of infrastructure in the non-government sector. This information has been valuable in informing procedures under the Capital Grants programme. In addition Block Grant Authorities have a sound knowledge and understanding of the state of school infrastructure in their respective regions.
Accordingly the House of Representatives does not accept these amendments.
Senate Amendment 13
This amendment seeks a review of the impact of the reforms enacted under the Bill to be completed before 30 June 2006. The Australian Government does not believe it should mandate such a significant review without the opportunity for detailed consultation on scope and processes with government and non-government school authorities and with other relevant agencies. Adding such amendments to this legislation without consultation is not the way to proceed 
The Australian Government is the single largest funder of school education. As such it has the right to set financial, policy and administrative directions. The Australian Government will exercise its leadership role in schooling in areas where national reform is required. This may involve consideration by Ministers through MCEETYA processes on specific matters. However the Australian Government has the right and the responsibility to attach conditions to its very significant schools funding to ensure that these important reforms are implemented.
Accordingly the House of Representatives does not accept these amendments.",SENATE,<title>SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE (LEARNING TOGETHER—ACHIEVEMENT THROUGH CHOICE AND OPPORTUNITY) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2004-12-07,"—The opposition is clearly very disappointed by the government's shoddy response to this matter. It was obviously not particularly prepared to even come in here and argue a case. At least we have obliged the government to perfunctorily table its statements. It is an extraordinary proposition that, for a bill of some $32 billion in funding where the Senate moved some very reasonable amendments, the House unilaterally says, `We are not interested,' and does not even bother to put a case to the Senate as to why that is. I think there is good cause for disappointment.
What we have here is a government that has seen quite extensive expansions in the schools program for particular schools. It has rejected funding on the basis of need. It has sought to extend a program for funding which, in terms of the proceedings put before this chamber and the Senate committee, has been demonstrably unfair. It has seen a quite elaborate expansion in the opportunities for those already wealthy and already privileged, and it will further entrench in the system a method of funding which will encourage the already wealthy and the already privileged to do exceptionally well.
The amendments that the Labor Party moved in this chamber sought to get the government to acknowledge that there is an opportunity here to actually address these fundamental principles of social justice and to put into a schools bill of this size an explicit definition of need and a requirement that we have a clear understanding that that is the basis on which schools should be funded. It is not on the basis of how well off you are; it is not on the basis of whether or not your dad has a lot of money in the bank. It is on the basis of actually trying to make sure that everyone in this country gets a fair go. It is quite apparent that the government is not interested in that. It is even not interested to the point where it has not actually come to this chamber with a view to arguing its case.
We have also sought, through these amendments, to provide a framework for school reporting that is, amongst other things, a requirement that reporting must be in the educational interests of students. Of course, this government has sought to make much of its capacity to tell the states how to run schools. It has gone to the point where it says, `We'll provide more money for those schools that already have fees in excess of $20,000 a year. The schools have already been provided with Commonwealth subsidies so that there are boarding facilities for children's pets. But we will make sure that we tell the states how to run a state school system as well.' On both sides of the argument, on both sides of the ledger, the Commonwealth seeks to impose a policy which is essentially very unfair and very unreasonable and that stands against what parents actually want.
The Labor Party proposed, and this chamber accepted, a set of amendments to improve the framework for school reporting and to make sure that school reporting is actually in the educational interests of students. The government says, `We're not actually interested in the argument about that.' The Labor Party also sought to make sure that the overly prescriptive interventions by this government in the handling of state schools by school authorities, especially for teachers in hard to staff schools and hard to staff disciplines, were in fact removed so that genuine partnerships were developed within the education system. The Commonwealth also says, `We're not interested in that.' What the Commonwealth then says is, `We'll give support and comfort to one particular denomination in the education system and we'll make sure that the interests of a particular educational authority structure will be supported without reference to any other educational authority within the system.' This is unique and unprecedented, but the government is not interested in discussing the implications of that new and extraordinarily prescriptive intervention in the education system of this country. 
None of the things that the Senate proposed ought to be controversial. But, as we have seen, the government is not prepared to see reason and is pressing ahead with its position willy-nilly in the face of logic. We are now in the situation where a piece of legislation in front of us is, in fact, unsustainable. In the longer term the existing circumstances for a majority of non-government schools, which are not actually funded according to the stated policies of the government with regard to the SES model, will become even more acute. The increasingly divisive nature of this government's policies will become apparent. It is quite clear to me that the arrogance of this government's position is now transparent—we have an arrogant response from an arrogant government. By rejecting out of hand each and every one of the amendments put up by this chamber, the government is suggesting that it has this education bill absolutely right and that it does not need any amendment at all. We will wait and see about that. We will see whether or not that is the case. If it is anything like the higher education bill it will be only a matter of time before the government is back in this chamber seeking amendments because it knows that it cannot sustain the regime that it is imposing by this bill.
Labor is fundamentally opposed to the unfair funding increases contained in this bill. We will not let the government's irresponsible and unjustifiable increases in funding to some of the wealthiest schools in the country get in the way of funding the 9,500 needy government and non-government schools in this country. We will not allow the government's foolishness to stand in the way of the provision of education facilities for the millions of Australian students that require support from the Commonwealth government. That is the great irony of the situation: it is the poorest and the weakest in this country that require the Commonwealth to intervene effectively. It is a tragedy that this government sees fit to give aid and comfort to those already privileged and powerful and to insist upon entrenching that privilege.
As my colleague Jenny Macklin has indicated in the House, Labor will not be insisting on our amendments. The various schools need the money now; they need the money to flow before Christmas. The opposition will not stand in the way of the funding of needy government and non-government schools. The opposition, however, will certainly continue to put forward our view that the funding must be delivered on a fairer basis so that children in all schools, from all social classes and from all communities are able to attract the support they need from the Commonwealth. That position will stand in sharp contrast to the position this government is now pursuing. We will argue that children in all schools, whether they be government or non-government schools, should be funded on the basis of need and that they should be able to look to the Commonwealth to get assistance for their education. All schools should be funded on the basis that all children should have equal opportunity. Unfortunately, this is an objective that will not be met through this legislation. 
 (Senator Watson)—For the benefit of Senator Carr, Senator Nettle and Senator Brown, I am advised that the reasons for the House of Representatives disagreeing with the Senate's amendments have been circulated. They are found on about page 6 of a document entitled, Schools Assistance (Learning Together—Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004: Schedule of the amendments made by the Senate to which the House of Representatives has disagreed. That is where the confusion may have arisen.",SENATE,<title>SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE (LEARNING TOGETHER—ACHIEVEMENT THROUGH CHOICE AND OPPORTUNITY) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2004-12-07,"—Mr Temporary Chairman Watson, you saved me pointing that out to Senator Carr, who was not so much ranting and railing but offended that no reasons were given. In fact, when I inquired—
—You didn't know!
—That is right; I did not know. Frankly, I assumed—
—That I did?
—No, that some reason would be available with a message, and apparently that is the case. I was inquiring into that when you were ranting and railing.
—I thought I wasn't ranting and railing.
—All right, Senator, you were putting your view. In any event, you were more interested in getting stuck into the government. Perhaps before you do that next time you might just check and see whether things have been made available to you.
—I asked three questions.
—Mr Temporary Chairman, the honourable senator has had his moment and was left pretty much undisturbed to put his view. I would like to just briefly put mine. The first point I would like to make is that, presumably, we are all moderately adult in our mentality here. We understand the views of the opposition and the Greens, and they understand ours. They were put in this chamber and the House of Representatives disagreed. That was made clear and it has come back. If we were amused at the prospect of this whole edifice of parliament being here just for us, we could, if we wanted to, sit here and repeat all those arguments at vast expense to taxpayers. We could indulge ourselves. If that is what you want to do, you are welcome to do it.
I simply put this to you: this government believes that all kids should have equal opportunities, that some parents will decide that they want to send their kids to private schools and that the fees a school charges are not of themselves an indicator of the parents' wealth. As I said last night, and I will briefly repeat the argument, you might find a family that either by luck or hard work has ended up a wealthy family and for them the fees are immaterial. But you also find at private schools families where that is not the case, families where the mother and/or the father are working, some of them in two jobs, in order to meet those fee entitlements. The fees are not an indicator of a family's wealth. That was made very clear. What this government uses as an indicator of wealth are the SES social indicators by the postcodes of the students going to the schools.  
I do not know that you could ever find a mechanism whereby somebody did not fall on the wrong side of the line. But to look at the fees charged is not a good way to do it, for the reason I have given you: you can find two parents that work extremely hard, sometimes in a couple of jobs, in order to meet that fee requirement. You sometimes find parents, for example, that extend the mortgage on their house because of the value they place on education. The fees are not an indicator of wealth. The payment of them might be an indicator of the effort and the risk that a family is prepared to take in order to send their children to a private school.
As to the national reporting requirements, we had that debate here last night. From my perspective and that of the government it is very clear that senators on the other side of this place would like the reporting requirements to focus on what goes in. Let us talk about what goes into the schools so that the teachers and the principals can yada, yada, yada at length. But there was a refusal to look at what comes out. My conclusion from that debate last night is that senators opposite are interested in the bureaucracy and the teachers, and we are interested in the parents and the students. We want information publicly available. The Democrats say, `Oh no, you cannot make it publicly available; people might get the wrong idea.' That is an extraordinary view to put, that information about schools and the outcomes that they achieve should not be publicly available.
We stand very firmly in favour of saying to Australian families: we do not want to dictate what you do in terms of schooling. You might send your kids to a state school that is primarily funded by the state, although with significant contributions from the Commonwealth. So you will get taxpayer funding if you go to a public school. But we also say: if you choose to send your kids to a private school you will get a degree of taxpayer funding that will very largely come from the Commonwealth government. We do not think that you should say to kids: your parents are either hard workers or lucky so you are not getting anything from us. That is more of the lowest common denominator argument that we so often hear from those who are bereft of a capacity to see how to make this country grow. I just put that briefly on the record to indicate—let us not pretend that the case has not been put here—that the case has been put and it is understood. The issue here is that you do not agree with it. I understand that and I accept that, but rehashing those arguments is not going to change anything.",SENATE,<title>SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE (LEARNING TOGETHER—ACHIEVEMENT THROUGH CHOICE AND OPPORTUNITY) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-12-07,"—What a pejorative dish-up that was to the chamber. By implication it gets stuck into and puts down the parents of the 70 per cent of kids who go to public schools in this country 
—It did not!
—Yes, it did. It was laden in the words used and what Hansard will not record is the tone of voice from Minister Vanstone as she laid into parents and kids in the public school system. `Yada, yada, yada,' she says of teachers—a disgraceful performance and delivery late at night in the chamber. It sums up what not just this minister but also this government thinks about the public school system and the teachers and the students in it: people who go to private schools are those with enterprise, those with go, those who work hard. By implication, read into it what you like about those who are in the public school system. It was just a disgraceful delivery to the chamber.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2004-12-07,"—The National Water Commission Bill 2004 establishes the National Water Commission and the Australian water fund. It was introduced into the House of Representatives on 18 November 2004. The National Water Commission, as contemplated in the significant June 2004 COAG agreement, will have two key responsibilities: firstly, assessing the implementation and promoting the objectives and outcomes of the National Water Initiative intergovernmental agreement; and, secondly, advising on financial assistance to be provided by the Commonwealth under components of the Australian water fund. Schedule C of the intergovernmental agreement outlines the institutional arrangements of the National Water Commission, the role of which is to provide advice on national water issues and, in particular, to assist with the effective implementation of the National Water Initiative agreement. 
The bill gives the National Water Commission the power to make recommendations for the government's final decision concerning the allocation of the Australian water fund. This fund will predominantly be distributed through the Water Smart Australia program and the Raising National Water Standards program. Labor have concerns about this bill and are proposing some amendments, but we acknowledge the important advance that has been made through the cooperation of the state governments and the Commonwealth to produce the National Water Initiative.
Our water supplies have all but reached their limit of our abuse. Australia, like many nations, is facing a desperate future if we do not learn to manage and respect our water. We continue to endure the ravages of drought, and we are facing the significant challenge of climate change influencing the reliability of the resource into the future. As the population increases, our economy advances and the degradation of our river systems continues, our existing potable water supplies are strained, to say the very least.
In my state of New South Wales, we are facing some real challenges. The Nature Conservation Council of New South Wales recently reported that over 50 per cent of wetlands in inland New South Wales have disappeared. The amount of water reaching the sea has reduced by 80 per cent and native bird and fish numbers have declined significantly. Unchecked agricultural run-off has led to increased turbidity, a build-up of small particles of soil and other organic matter that blocks sunlight needed by aquatic plant life. By 2020, drinking water in the major regional centre of Dubbo is expected to be unsuitable for consumption due to increasing salt loads in the Macquarie River in our central west. Any amount of salt in rivers will damage aquatic life and, when used for irrigation, it threatens agricultural production. A decline in native fish species has been compounded by the explosion in the number of introduced species, such as European carp, that thrive in the altered conditions and feed off aquatic plants and the eggs of native fish.
The issues we face in New South Wales are shared right across this country. We are all living with water restrictions and we understand that we can never return to the wasteful practices that were once so common. We must find a way to balance the needs of agricultural production, rural and regional economies, urban demand and the environment. Continued degradation of land and water resources will achieve none of these goals and will add to the crippling burden of uncertainty facing many in the community.
We have a great example of the near ruin of one of our rivers and the return of environmental flows to it—the once great Snowy River. The Snowy Mountains Scheme diverted 99 per cent of the water from the Snowy River and turned it inland to generate electricity and to use on the developing irrigation areas of the Murrumbidgee and Murray valleys. The Snowy River had been reduced to a creek for four decades as a result of this diversion. Then in August 2002, water was redirected from the Mowamba River weir back into the river. At present, it is at six per cent of its original flow. While enough water is now flowing to stop the decline, much more is needed to bring the river back to life. Eventually it is hoped that fish such as blackfish and bass will return. Water is being released from the Mowamba River weir upstream and, after work on the Jindabyne Dam, 21 per cent of the flow will be restored over the next 10 years. It is expected that it will take at least this long before the river returns to working order. I read with interest in the Canberra Times recently the recollections of Mr Eccleston, who is aged 72. He remembers when the Snowy was alive and well. The article read: 
Mr Eccleston remembers the Snowy mountain river, when platypuses rippled the surface with mysterious rings.
The swiftly flowing water was so clear it was a magical place for meeting friends and neighbours. Rapids tested the strongest swimmers.
Mr Eccleston despaired at the state of the river and the terrible impact it had had upon the little community of Dalgety. I am delighted to say that Dalgety now has something to celebrate with the Snowy flowing once again. The town held a festival last week to celebrate the river behaving like a river.
The case of Dalgety demonstrates how intertwined we are as people and as Australians with our environment and, in particular, our waterways. Without environmental flows, river systems begin to collapse. The impacts are felt not simply by the ecology of the rivers but in our communities. These effects are economic and social, direct and indirect. Rivers are part of our national identity and we need to do all we can to use our water more efficiently so that we are able to bring life back to our precious waterways.
I go now to the background of this bill and the developing of a national framework for water. The move towards a national approach to managing our water resources took a significant step in February 1994. The Council of Australian Governments agreed upon a strategic framework for necessary water reforms covering water pricing, institutional arrangements, sustainable water resource management and community consultation. Many years later and after much dragging of feet by the Howard government, COAG came together again to attempt the next step towards a truly national water initiative. In June this year, New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory signed the National Water Initiative agreement. The agreement builds on the 1994 COAG strategic framework to provide greater certainty for investment and the environment and to underpin the capacity of Australia's water management regimes to deal with change responsibly and fairly. The National Water Initiative aims to develop a nationally compatible market, regulatory and planning based system of managing surface and groundwater resources for rural and urban use that optimises economic, social and environmental outcomes. It is the National Water Commission that will drive the national water reform agenda.
In Australia, the responsibility for water resources rests with state governments. As such, any national response requires the collaboration of the states and a coordinated legislative approach. Since 1994, significant progress has been made by the states and territories towards more efficient and sustainable water management. However, in the past 10 years many factors have changed. There has been an increased demand for water, an increased understanding of the management needs of surface and groundwater systems, including their interconnection, and an enhanced understanding of the requirement for an effective and efficient water market. It was agreed by COAG that there was a need to refresh the 1994 reform agenda. New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, the Northern Territory and the ACT signed that national water agreement in June 2004. It built on that COAG strategic framework of 1994 to provide greater certainty for investment and the environment. It was a significant step in national water reform. 
In September 2004 the Howard government released its long-term water policy, Securing Australia's Water Future. The centrepiece of the policy is the establishment of a $2 billion Australian water fund. Investments by the Australian water fund are to further the objectives of the Living Murray initiative and the National Water Initiative. The primary purpose of the water fund is to direct $1.6 billion over five years to water smart projects aimed at accelerating the implementation of new water technologies and practices. Two hundred million dollars is committed to recovering water for the Living Murray initiative. One hundred and sixty-seven million dollars is being committed to the cost of constructing the proposed Wimmera-Mallee pipeline in north-western Victoria. That pipeline is to replace open channel domestic and stock supply systems that are currently in operation. It will lift the capacity to measure, monitor and manage water resources. The fund will help to implement a nationally consistent system for collecting and processing water related data. There will be $200 million committed to rewarding communities that demonstrate a culture of water wise usage through the Water Wise Communities initiative. 
With so much goodwill generated by the June COAG meeting, it was a shock to all state and territory governments when the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anderson, released the policy during the election campaign revealing that, of the total pledged for the fund, the Howard government expected the states to contribute $1.6 billion from funds allocated to them under the national Competition Principles Agreement. This is not what was agreed at the COAG meeting in June. The government did not signal its intentions then, preferring to wait until the cover of the election campaign to recant what was a monumental agreement. The state premiers wrote to the Prime Minister to announce that they would pull out of the National Water Initiative because of the federal government's plan to withdraw the competition payments to pay for the water initiative promises. The premiers accused Mr Howard of breaching agreements reached at the COAG meeting and failing to consult on the future distribution of competition payments. They argued that the decision to divert competition payments breaches the national competition policy agreements. They said:
Your decision to fund the water policy by cutting at least $1.6 billion in competition payments to the States means you are effectively robbing the States to pay for your policy. In addition to this you seek additional payments from the States to fund the key projects promised in your policy.
This will put intolerable pressure on the delivery of key services by the States. It will inevitably have an impact on hospitals and schools. This is an unnecessary assault on State and Territory Budgets given the Commonwealth Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook (PEFO) released on 10 September 2004 showed a cumulative underlying surplus of over $25 billion over the forward estimates period.
Either this government is serious about water reform or it is not. I understand the Prime Minister has written again to the states and territories since the election wanting to revisit COAG arrangements. At this stage we are at a critical impasse in terms of this National Water Initiative. It is a tragedy for our waterways that the political goodwill was squandered so willingly by the government.
The Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee inquiry into rural water usage brought down a very specific report which urged collaborative action through COAG on the issue of water. We have yet to have a formal response from the government. Perhaps this is an example of actions speaking louder than words. Certainly the state and territory governments are committed. New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, South Australia, the ACT and the Northern Territory signed the agreement. Western Australia and Tasmania have not because the federal government has tied the national water plan to the $500 million Living Murray initiative. Both the Western Australian and Tasmanian governments believe that the National Water Initiative is too skewed to the Murray-Darling region and does not focus on other problem areas. 
The Western Australian government are also rightly concerned that the agreement offers little benefit to Western Australia and is not appropriate for their state. They argue that Western Australia is at a very different stage of the development and understanding of its water resources to many other areas of Australia, which brings with it a different set of priorities, issues, challenges and opportunities. They fear that the National Water Initiative may result in Western Australia having to commit to complex management, monitoring and planning before there is a need for this level of sophisticated management, given their state of development. There are likely to be significant disadvantages for Western Australians in being tied to such a highly prescriptive model or timetable. The Western Australian government feel it is important to ensure that Western Australia retains the flexibility to implement change in a way and time frame suited to its needs.
But none of this matters to the federal government, which is driven by an ideological position on federal intervention. It is truly a disgrace that a government so willing to go on a multibillion-dollar spending spree during the election campaign—a government happy to throw money around at a variety of other ventures—will not put up new funds to address the urgent issue of water in our nation. The New South Wales and Victorian state governments in particular have responded with urgency to the water shortages confronting those states. In 1995 the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council—involving federal and state ministers from New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Queensland—announced a cap on diversions from rivers in the basin covering much of south-eastern Australia at 1993-94 levels in an attempt to ensure that adequate water remained in the rivers.
In 1995 the New South Wales government launched its water reform process in order to bring state laws up-to-date with the growing acceptance of the importance of the river systems to the health and sustainability of the environment and the community. This process culminated in the passing of the New South Wales Water Management Act 2000. The Water Management Act brought sweeping changes to legislation that had been in place since 1912. For the first time the role of the environment as a user of water was recognised, ensuring that all decisions taken to manage our river and creek systems and our groundwater resources must consider the needs of the environment. That act was followed this year by the Water Management Amendment Act 2004. This contained changes designed to be consistent with the National Water Initiative agreed to by COAG at its June meeting. So what does the National Water Commission Bill 2004 deliver for us? We are very concerned that there is such a lack of transparency in the processes in this bill. We will propose some amendments to improve the transparency aspects of the bill. We look forward to having the support of the minor parties and the consideration of those amendments in committee.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL WATER COMMISSION BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2004-12-07,"—The National Water Commission Bill 2004, as has been outlined by my colleague, creates the National Water Commission, a new statutory commission that is to have two key aims: firstly, assessing the implementation and progress of the National Water Initiative and, secondly, advising on the financial assistance to be provided under the Australian water fund. The simple fact is that, as far as water is concerned, Australia is living beyond its means. Our consumption of water is rapidly eating into our supply. The dams supplying our major cities are running at record low levels, the use of groundwater is seriously affecting the water table and the flow through our creeks, streams and rivers is vastly inadequate. Australia faces this water crisis largely as a result of past policies and inaction in the face of a changing climate—a matter that we have debated often in this chamber. There is no doubt that rainfall has the single largest influence on the availability of water for consumption. It is also clear that southern Australia is experiencing the prolonged below average rainfall that in some places, such as my home state of Western Australia, has taken place over many decades. Increasing population, new industries and more water intensive agriculture demonstrate that we have not adjusted quickly enough to these changes. We have continued, whether in the cities or in the bush, to consume water like there is indeed no tomorrow. The single greatest problem that we face is that we treat water as a single-use commodity. We turn on a tap, have a shower, use a washing machine or fill our pools, and once we have done all that we simply pull the plug.  
Although our habits at a domestic level are slowly starting to change, over the last five years we have concentrated purely on the domestic consumption of water. Even though the domestic consumption of water is a minor section of overall consumption, most if not all government action to date has been aimed at the domestic consumer. Inefficient water consumers, such as industry and agriculture, have been immune to the restrictions that we all face, increased prices or requirements to actually recycle water. Now that we are at crisis point, the federal government wants to take a leadership role and invest significant funds to start to address this problem. Whilst this is a very good thing, one wonders about the wasted opportunities over the years to address our record levels of water consumption.
One example that springs readily to mind is rainwater tanks. I am sure that many of us can remember a time when many houses and sheds had attached rainwater tanks. Over time government agencies, in their desire to see all of us connected to scheme or town water because they had built these wonderful dams and had the capacity to charge us for the use of that resource, started to push us to stop using rainwater tanks because of contamination concerns. Of course, this had the desired aim in that people stopped using their rainwater tanks or no longer installed them as part of new residential developments. But now we are in the situation where various governments are offering rebates and other incentives to encourage households to again consider installing rainwater tanks. In fact, a recent study by the University of Newcastle concluded that a family living on the eastern coast of Australia that had a 10,000-kilolitre tank would meet 65 per cent of their annual water needs through the use of that tank. It needs to be pointed out that no longer are rainwater tanks large cylindrical structures that require a lot of space and are a potential eyesore. The newer products on the market these days are designed to sit next to the exterior wall of the house and do not extend beyond the eaves. They come in a variety of designs, shapes and sizes. You have to ask yourself whether the many and varied programs could be reduced to getting people in urban areas to install rainwater tanks.
As it is, what little rain there is that currently falls on the urban areas of Australia becomes stormwater and ultimately passes out to the sea, so surely a program that aimed to at least use this water capacity in some way would be a major step forward. Indeed, just yesterday in the paper there was an article about two inventors who have designed a device that attaches to a hot water tap that stores and then blends the cold water in the pipe with the hot water as it comes through from the hot water system. This simple device—likely to cost in the vicinity of $300 to $500—would save some 25,000 litres per year in the average household. This method and many more would make a significant difference to water consumption within our domestic market. 
However, the two major users of water— agriculture and industry—do not seem to attract the same level of regulation, encouragement or restriction. Why is more emphasis not put on industrial users recycling and reusing water? Water used in most industrial processes does not require the same water quality standards as are required for our domestic consumption. The question becomes one of providing sufficient incentive to industries to go down the path of water recycling and reuse. Perhaps a more realistic pricing structure for industrial consumers is also required. If industries can see the bottom line benefits of introducing recycling and reuse, then there is a significant opportunity for them to invest. As long as industries have access to cheap single use water, we should not be surprised that they will always choose that option.
Agriculture, water rights and water flows in our rivers have been areas that have attracted significant research and interest over the last few years. Indeed, to many urban Australians it appears that farmers having to give up rights to water is equated to compensation, which of course means that taxpayers' dollars are to be expended to get farmers to stop taking so much water out of our river system. Perhaps it will see the end of cotton and rice production in one of the driest countries on earth—Australia. It has always seemed to me to be counterproductive in a dry place to grow crops such as cotton and rice that require such huge amounts of water to thrive. Australian farmers are looking at innovative and efficient means of water usage, but we have to break the habits of lifetimes to ensure that our rivers regain an adequate flow. Most of us have been through studies early in high school that teach us the water is a closed system—there is no more or less water in the system at any one time than at any other. However, human consumption of water is reducing the amounts of fresh water, and with decreasing rainfall we can no longer afford to do nothing.
The bill will establish the National Water Commission as a Commonwealth statutory authority. The Commonwealth will nominate three commissioners and the states will nominate three commissioners. The commission will meet at least eight times per year. In fact, I trust that the commission will meet more than eight times a year as this issue is vital for the future of our country. Unless we can develop sustainable usage of fresh water we risk having a less affluent future. The Australian water fund will work with two main programs: water smart Australia and raising national water standards. The water smart Australia program will accelerate the development and uptake of smart technologies and practices in water use. We are told that competitive bidding will determine which projects are funded. 
The National Water Commission will make recommendations to the minister, but like so many other programs there is to be a degree of flexibility with this program. It is all very well to talk about new technology and practices that may impact on improving water flows in our rivers but it can also be about improved water storage projects. It will be a program that those of us on this side of the Senate will pay close attention to. This government should not be in the business of disbursing $1.5 billion over five years through the Australian water fund unless there are some targets and firm guaranteed savings as the outcome. If some bright spark turns up with new technology that is funded and then found not to deliver the outcomes that were claimed, what action will be taken? Probably none. This program has the potential to be yet another exercise in picking winners, if we are all not careful. The Commonwealth had better put its money on sure things. I only hope that it will not be in the business of picking projects like the Asia Pacific Space Centre on Christmas Island that this year was meant to launch at least eight space rockets. That was another example of trying to pick winners that has failed spectacularly. It would be disappointing to all Australians to watch $1.5 billion being expended over five years on a bunch of projects that fail to deliver. 
The other key area for the Australian water fund is the program called raising national water standards. We are told that this program will invest in Australia's national capacity to measure, monitor and manage its water resources. This program will cost $200 million over five years. Its centrepiece is the introduction of a new rating system for household appliances—something that we already have in Western Australia. Yet again we are seeing that the approach to water management is to bash the domestic consumer over the head. One of the key problems with this national approach to water management—as has been outlined by my colleague Senator Stephens—is that two states, Tasmania and my home state of Western Australia, have not signed up to the policy. As a Western Australian, I can say that it is difficult to understand why these two states should sign up to the initiative. Like many other programs this one has a distinct flavour—and that is the Murray-Darling river system. Essentially, those states which have signed up have the Murray or the Darling flowing through them. It speaks volumes that those states that do not have these rivers have failed to sign up. The clear implication is that there is no pressing requirement to do so.
Water is a major concern to Western Australians and we have the Gallop government taking significant steps to solve our problems in Western Australia. Whether it is moving market gardeners off ground water mounds to reduce the outflow from ground water, the commissioning of a desalination plant or the feasibility study with private industry to investigate the possibilities of canals bringing water down from the north, the Gallop government have taken the lead. Why would they sign up to such an Eastern States-centric approach as is demonstrated in the Howard government's approach to water management? For not much more than is planned to be expended over the five years, Tenix plans to move water from the northern rivers to Perth via a canal. The total cost of this project is only $2 billion—not much more than is planned for the Australian water fund.
The simple facts are these: Perth uses about 310 gigalitres of water per year and the Fitzroy River pushes 9,000 gigalitres out to sea each year. What has been the position of the Howard government on this approach? Western Australia will not sign up so they can go it alone! Going it alone is something that Western Australians are getting used to doing. So far we have introduced policies that have restricted water consumption in our domestic markets, we have moved agricultural producers off ground water mounds, we have looked at new and innovative ways to increase water supplies through existing methods and we are building a desalination plant. We are examining proposals to solve Perth's water needs for the next century.
What is the benefit for Western Australia to sign up to this national approach when we are doing it ourselves without the need for the creation of a new water bureaucracy? For at the heart of the Howard approach to water management is the creation of a new bureaucracy—more bureaucrats dispensing more public moneys for projects that may or may not deliver. Over in Western Australia we are taking action, while the Howard approach is to fund projects that may or may not deliver. I support the approach of the current Western Australian government, which is working to solve its water management problems without the need to create a new bureaucracy. Over time I am sure that the people of Australia will see which approach will deliver a sustainable water future. ",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL WATER COMMISSION BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Lees, Sen Meg",APA,2004-12-07,"—The National Water Commission Bill 2004 establishes a new national body, the National Water Commission. The aim of this body is to facilitate and oversee water reform. Finally we are seeing people at government level and at all levels taking water seriously and valuing water properly, as it should be valued. This body has been put in place to ensure that all of us use water wisely. I support the bill as it is one way—perhaps now the only way—to ensure that we have the water that we need now and for the future. We need to ensure that our rivers and ground water systems are healthy and that we do not take more water than the particular system can sustainably provide. A whole raft of issues will be on the COAG table for debate, such as water efficiency and provision of water for domestic purposes, industry and agriculture. All of this will be scrutinised, and hopefully they will get the planning right this time. I will be moving an amendment that deals with opening up the process to ensure that we really do have the information we should have and that the public needs. I believe that, if we ensure that it really is a public and open process, we will get a much better result. I will talk more to that at a later date.
The key functions of the National Water Commission, which will be an independent statutory body, will be to assess the implementation and promotion of the National Water Initiative and to advise on which projects should receive financial assistance from the Commonwealth through the Australian water fund. I see this as the last throw of the dice for many of our river systems, in particular for the Murray-Darling Basin. If we do not get it right, we and in particular future generations will be in serious trouble. By no means is the Murray-Darling Basin the only river system that will be dealt with, but I do want to focus on it for a moment because it really is in serious trouble. I have spent quite an amount of time over the last few years travelling up and down the river, particularly the South Australian section, and it is in serious trouble. The red gums along the river, particularly those in South Australia around Chowilla—at the back of the locks, which are now preventing regular access to water for those trees—at the back of Banrock Station and basically all the way down the river are in serious trouble. They are sick, they are dying or they are dead.
They desperately need a drink. They could have had a drink in 2000. The decision was made then not to do that but to actually drop the levels of the locks so that the water flowed straight through. I still have not got a commitment from the government that, when we finally do get some rain, rather than dropping the weir and lock levels and pushing the water through we will have the locks raised. They have been upgraded to make sure that it can be done. We will have small floods produced to push the water out into the red gums.
A recent study shows that, just in the last 18 months, tree decline has increased substantially, from 51 per cent of all trees counted in 2002 being in trouble to 75.4 per cent of all trees counted in 2004. In places like Chowilla it is just a graveyard. I used a photo of one of the old trees there on my Christmas card about three years ago, and that tree has gone. This decline was found by researchers to be a `universally severe phenomenon' across hundreds of kilometres of the flood plain. There really is no time left. We have to get water out to those trees in the next 15 to 18 months. 
I also notice that there are algal blooms in the Darling already, and we are only just getting into summer. With the impact of the fires on the catchment areas and the reduced run-off that is expected this year, not to mention climate change itself, which is playing havoc with rainfall right across that part of the basin, we now do not have any other chance. If we do not get this right now, if this new body does not work with the Murray-Darling Basin Commission, with COAG and with all other authorities in all states—and it is unfortunate that Western Australia and Tasmania are not full partners to this—then I think that right across the basin we will have an economic disaster as well as an environmental one. We are already seeing that 500 gigalitres simply will not be enough, looking at the additional water use that has occurred just over the three years as more sleeper and dozer licences are woken across the basin. But at least if we can get that in place fairly quickly we can get some of the flooding that we need. 
The primary objective of the National Water Initiative is to achieve sustainable use of water across Australia. The plan is to claw back any overallocated water and to ensure ecologically sustainable levels of extraction in all river systems, to put in place an open water accounting system that allows us to see what is happening to water and to acknowledge that landscapes require water to flourish. I want to talk about this accounting system for a moment because this is one of the issues that will make or break this whole process. In South Australia a few years back now the Loxton irrigation scheme was upgraded. There were promises about leaving water in rivers and promises, particularly to the locals, that what was saved would be allowed to flow in the Murray. Very soon we found that the state government had made the decision that that water could go out into the Barossa Valley, and it was piped out there. I commend those in the Barossa who operate the bill scheme for having now made the decision that they will go and source water on the open market rather than use that Loxton water. The priority in South Australia for many years has been to make money by selling water. It is one of the reasons that we have not had water restrictions in Adelaide as long as many other states have had water restrictions, particularly other capital cities. The South Australian government still requires SA Water to put several hundred million dollars a year into the public coffers to help with the budget bottom line. It makes it very difficult to honestly and openly put in place water-saving initiatives.
In talking with farmers up and down the river, I have heard that they want to see this work. Indeed, some of them say that they are prepared to sell a percentage of their water if they can see a public process, if they can be guaranteed that this water is not going to be on-sold and that it will be left in the river. One of the suggestions has been that we use the Net. We have got that facility to track where the water comes from, where it is stored and then, when it is used to top up a flood, that too is accounted for, so we can track exactly where water has been used for the environment. It is one of the reasons I will be moving my amendments, so that we can get a process that farmers really do want to be a part of and that people have real confidence in. 
Looking at this new body we are setting up with this bill, the National Water Commission, I see it does not really have any teeth. It is basically there only to assess, promote, advise and look at the funding of the National Water Initiative. The Murray-Darling Basin Commission also lacks teeth. So some of the questions we can put to the minister when we get into the committee stages of this bill relate to where the teeth are and how we are going to see that the decisions that have been made are actually enforced and the results are on the board. How do we make sure that water savings that are made through measures—some of which are already on the drawing board, such as piping the Darling Anabranch and Water Proofing Adelaide through recycling water and stormwater—will actually stay in the river? Again, we come back to an open accounting process or system.
There are some very good stories on recycling stormwater in Adelaide. Michell, the wool producers, used to use nine per cent of Adelaide's water every day but, thanks to the Salisbury Council and their stormwater recycling program, Michell is basically totally off River Murray water. There is only a very end-of-stage process in one of their wool processing lines that uses any Murray water at all; the rest is all recycled stormwater. When they have got too much stormwater, they pump it into the underground aquifer for storage. It is the type of program that can make a difference. But if we are going to have SA Water, if any savings are made in Adelaide, going out and trying to resell or on sell that percentage of water that is saved, this is all going to be defeated and we are not going to get anywhere.
It is public accountability that will make or break this process. Through it we can see whether water savings have been made, where they can be made, where they will be made or should be made and where this saved water has gone. I think great pressure will be put on the Commonwealth to ensure all of this is an open and public process, as the public is now ready for water reform and certainly the farmers I have spoken to throughout the Murray-Darling Basin are ready for it.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL WATER COMMISSION BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-12-07,"—I congratulate the previous speakers for their contributions to this debate about one of the most important issues facing Australia now and one of the most important issues for the lives of everybody alive in this country in 2004. We all know the problems but we have to take them in concert with an increasing population, an increasing use of resources and, more particularly, the advent of global warming through the human use of resources. This threatens in the Murray-Darling Basin, for example, to reduce the flow of the rivers there by 30 per cent by mid-century—on top of everything we have at the moment. When you see the almost impossibility, according to conventional thinking, of taking 30 per cent of flow from current users and putting it back in for environmental use, and add to that global warming taking out 30 per cent of the natural flow over the next 40 or 50 years, you wonder how on earth the generations who will live in the Murray-Darling Basin and depend upon it in the middle of the century are going to look back on this debate in this parliament tonight. They will see how far short of the mark the legislation we are dealing with is compared to what is required from governments who have the long-term national interest in mind.
We are effectively establishing another bureaucracy, and it is to dispense money to unspecified projects to reach unspecified goals. It is all very nebulous. It is in many ways typical of the Howard government's approach to the great environmental responsibilities it has, which is to say: `We'll put in place a watchdog mechanism but we're not going to put in place goals and commit ourselves to meeting those goals. We won't sign the Kyoto protocol. We won't commit to a time line for returning a proper environmental flow to the Murray River.' There is massive environmental damage occurring in the meantime while this government effectively sits on its hands. There is the loss of species in the river, including fish species but going on to all the in-water species, and the massive damage to the riverine environment. 
Senator Lees has just referred to the study showing the impact on the river red gums. It is a national calamity, and there is nothing in this bill to adequately deal with that. Senator Lees says action is required to get water to the dying red gums, the majority of them stressed and dying, this year. There is nothing in here to address that at all. The Prime Minister, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage and the cabinet are together turning their backs on those trees as they die and on the ecosystem which depends on those trees and which dies with them. It is grossly irresponsible for the Prime Minister and the cabinet to have turned their backs and to be a `do little' government in the face of such a calamity. This is not something facing future generations; this is right now in front of our very eyes, described by scientists. And this government says: `We won't deal with that. We'll set up a commission with vague, nebulous guidelines but we will not deal with that immediate problem.' If the government cannot deal with the immediate problem, how is it going to deal with the long-term and greater problem of looking to the health of the Murray-Darling and, indeed, of all the other river systems of this country?
The Greens have some amendments to try to rescue the ineptness of this legislation and the establishment of this superbureaucracy without the superpowers and discrete and specific goals that it should have. The first amendment requires the National Water Commission to meet specific goals for providing environmental water to really deal with the crisis that we have. Part (a) says that the National Water Commission will secure the entire 500 gigalitres required for the Living Murray First Step by 31 December 2005. That is 500 gigalitres when we are dealing here with a natural river flow in excess of 12,000 gigalitres. So we are dealing with something like four per cent of the natural flow being added to the Murray River through this first step. That is four per cent, when Senator Webber or earlier Senator Stephens was talking earlier about a minimal return of 28 per cent recognised as being required to go to the Snowy—and that took 10 years to get around to. We are talking about four per cent here as an emergency measure, and this government has not got it on the slate. It is looking at that somewhere out at 2010 or 2014.
Senator Lees has talked about her Christmas card of three years ago and the magnificent tree on it that is now dead. Add all the pictures you could take of the river red gums now and see where they will be in three years, let alone in 2014—and we do not know that 500 gigalitres is going to go anywhere near reversing the fortune, or misfortune, of the river red gums.
The Greens amendment effectively says that the Commonwealth and states agreed on the 500 gigalitres and committed $500 million in November 2003. A year later, in November 2004, they agreed on specific measures to secure and fund the first 240 gigalitres. But as things stand not one dollar will be spent and no water will flow because of the fight over competition payments. What is the National Water Commission going to do about that? It is being established under this legislation, but what is it going to do about the Prime Minister's failure to get one drop of water returned to the river during his nine years in office? This Prime Minister has not returned one drop of water to the Murray-Darling to rescue this grand ecosystem which is dying in front of his face in the nine years he has sat in that chair in his office. It is a national disgrace. 
The second part of the Greens amendment would secure an additional 2,500 gigalitres of water for the environment by December 2007—a minimum of 1,000 gigalitres for the Murray. This takes the Murray allocation to 1,500 gigalitres within three years. That is what the scientists retreated to saying was the minimum required to get an environmental rescue, environmental health, for the river. This would provide another 500 gigalitres for either the Murray or elsewhere in the basin—for example, the Macquarie Marshes. I will be asking the government about the plight of the Macquarie Marshes when we get to the committee stage.
I notice that there are no advisers in the box. I do not know whether there is anybody at the other end of the phone. I do not know whether there is anybody watching on television. I do not know whether the government gives a cuss at all about this. Certainly the minister is not here. The advisers are not here. Is there anybody at the other end of the phone? Who knows, because as far as the minister is concerned this bill does not matter. I have never seen a situation where a bill like this has been before the Senate and there are no advisers in the place and no minister to deal with it during the second reading debate, let alone the committee stage, which we may guess will be coming shortly.
The third part of the first tranche of amendments by the Greens is to return rivers and wetlands to environmentally sustainable extraction levels by 2010. The National Water Initiative commits to returning overallocated systems to environmentally sustainable extraction levels—but with no time line. The Australian Conservation Foundation, the Farmers Federation and the Banking Association agreed to do it by 2014. The government could not even follow through with that time line in this legislation—and this is the place to be laying down the directives to the National Water Commission. But it is not here, so the Greens are providing a time line which we think is minimal if you are really talking about environmental rescue of the Murray and the Darling.
The fourth part of the amendment is to give the Murray-Darling Basin Commission responsibility for managing environmental water in the Murray-Darling Basin—that is, the return of flow to the rivers. The management of environmental water should be in the hands of an organisation with environmental expertise.
The second amendment is to lift the entrenched secrecy which this legislation gives to the National Water Commission. Mr Acting Deputy President Sandy Macdonald, as you live in the basin, I know you will be concerned to see that everything is open and transparent to the public. The Greens amendment will provide you with the ability to support that. The amendment requires specific documents produced by the commission to be tabled in parliament when they are given to the minister and generally to operate in an open and transparent manner.
I will be asking the minister, if he appears, to explain the need to hide any matter that the National Water Commission is dealing with. It is public money, public water and the national environment that we are dealing with and the public should know about it. According to the bill as written, the minister has complete control over all the information produced by the commission. The public do not get a go unless the minister deigns to release that information. That information includes the assessment of Australia's water resources and their management, whether plans are consistent with the National Water Initiative and should be accredited, whether commitments under the National Water Initiative are being implemented, the monitoring of the impact of interstate trade in water access entitlements, assessing the performance of the water industry against national benchmarks, a comprehensive review of the National Water Initiative in 2010, and assessments of the implementation of the water reform framework. Is any senator going to say that any of those matters should be kept secret at ministerial discretion and, if so, why? 
In relation to the 500 gigalitres for the Murray as agreed by the government—and specifically the first 240 gigalitres agreed with much fanfare last Friday week—I will be asking the minister, should he be here, when the works will begin and the water made available. Is there a seasonal requirement for when water needs to flow to the wetlands: for example, is it spring? If so, when is the latest that money has to be allocated in order for water to be available in spring 2005—or is it spring 2006? Some water will be released through policy decisions. Some requires infrastructure, such as the Wimmera-Mallee pipeline, which may take 12 to 18 months to complete, or more.
—Tedious!
—The minister interjects that this is tedious, because he is not interested. This is a tedious matter as far as the government is concerned. 
—Come on, Bob!
—He is making the wrong call there, and it shows what the government thinks about this: it is all tedious, says the wrong minister in the chair for this legislation. `Tedious!' says the government. But `extremely important and critical' say the other senators who have contributed to the debate tonight.
The Independent report of the expert reference panel on environmental flows and water quality requirements for the River Murray system was finalised in 2002. It assessed the likelihood of having a healthy Murray River under different conditions, including environmental water allocations ranging from 350 gigalitres, with a low likelihood of a healthy Murray but some localised improvements, to 4,000 gigalitres, with a high likelihood of a healthy Murray. Remember that that is one-third of the natural flow. Fifteen hundred gigalitres was assessed as a moderate likelihood of a healthy Murray. A second more detailed report was constrained to look only at options up to 1,500 gigalitres, with a moderate chance for the river. I will be asking questions about these flows and how the assessment has been made, why the government believes 500 gigalitres is adequate in the coming period and what its target is going to be after that.
Another question the Senate must have answered is how much water is needed for the Darling, its tributaries and the dependent wetlands. Again, I refer to the absolute catastrophe of the Macquarie Marshes, one of the nation's great waterbird breeding areas, reduced by half and enormously degraded by its having been simply robbed of the water that for thousands of years had flowed to it during flood periods. These are important matters and they require specific answers. There will be some beating of the chest by the government about setting up this commission, this bureaucracy. But of itself it will do nothing in terms of that all-important, immediate and urgent critical need to return water to the river. That is going to be the test.  
After nine years you would think the Prime Minister would have done something to make that return, but he has not. One can only conclude that the 70 per cent of users who take water for crops and for irrigation, including grass, have the power over the government; it is not game to take them on. One has to wonder whether the $2 billion being spoken about here for the National Water Commission would not be better spent, in concert with the states, to get rid of Cubbie Station, to get big returns back into the Darling and the Murray. Senator Lees has spoken about the way in which users of water along the Murray would not mind some of their water being bought back if they knew it was going to environmental management. But effectively there is nothing here to give rural water users, irrigators, any sort of real confidence that if they do the right thing the government will stand by them and do the right thing in return. ",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL WATER COMMISSION BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2004-12-07,"—I intend to make only a brief contribution to the debate on the National Water Commission Bill 2004. I want to focus on clause 44 of the bill. In doing so I refer to the government's explanatory memorandum on the bill and go to page 5 in the explanatory memorandum as it relates to the function of the National Water Commission. Its explanation of clause 7(1)(a) says:
Amongst other activities, the Commission could be expected to: undertake analysis; inform policy making by governments; help facilitate coordinated government action to achieve national outcomes; promote debate; enhance communication with (and between) communities, stakeholders and decision makers; and otherwise promote national water reform through initiatives and actions to advance the objectives and outcomes of the NWI.
I refer to the second reading speech of the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. At the end of it the minister says:
The National Water Commission will be instrumental in ensuring that water issues in Australia continue to capture the public's imagination and energy in working towards practical water solutions. The importance of water to securing Australia's economic and environmental future demands no less.
Clause 44 of the bill goes to the public availability of assessments by the National Water Commission. Clause 44 says:
(1) The NWC may make its assessments under paragraphs 7(2)(a), (g), (h) and (i) and 3(a) and (b) available to the public only with the agreement of the Minister.
(2) The NWC must not make any other advice or recommendation available to the public.
I am not sure how you actually intend to achieve national outcomes, promote debate and enhance communication with and between communities, stakeholders and decision makers if you are not making any information available. We should make this information available. Of course, the minister should reserve the right to direct the commission not to make things available, as is the case with some other government organisations, but the minister should then table an explanation in both houses of parliament as to why that direction has been given. There could be some good reason for giving the direction, but the minister should explain that. If we are to promote debate and, as was said at the end of the minister's speech, agree on `the importance of water to securing Australia's economic and environmental future demands no less' and on the need to capture `the public's imagination and energy in working towards practical water solutions', we should make information available. It should be a transparent process. If you are going to put $2 billion into it, it should be transparent. 
We should have a process where people are able to see what this commission's views are and what they recommend to the government. I will be moving an amendment to give effect to that. I will move that the commission will be required to make publicly available its assessments and recommendations within a period of six months after making those assessments and recommendations unless otherwise directed by the minister. The minister shall reserve the right to direct the commission not to make publicly available those assessments and recommendations, but the minister must then table an explanation for the reasons for taking that course of action in both houses of parliament. I think the public deserve no less if they are to be able to make an informed assessment as to whether this is actually going to work. They ought to have access to the information that this is going to generate, and that is what is important. I will move that amendment in the committee stage of the bill, and I hope the government will support it.
Senator IAN CAMPBELL (Western Australia—Minister for the Environment and Heritage) (10.41 p.m.)—I seek leave to incorporate a speech in the second reading debate from Senator Lyn Allison. I believe it has been circulated.
Leave granted.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL WATER COMMISSION BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-12-07,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—
There is little doubt that water use in both urban and rural areas is of primary importance to Australians and fundamental to establishing a sustainable and enjoyable standard of living in this country. Australia is a dry continent. Demands on water resources continue to rise with expanding populations, and with the expansion of agricultural land-use and efficiency.
At the time of its announcement the Australian Democrats welcomed the Coalition's $2 billion Australian Water Fund, a policy made up substantially of initiatives recommended in the 2002 Democrats-initiated urban water Senate inquiry report and through the Senate inquiry into rural water use. The Democrats have for a long time now supported and promoted a national approach to water through the Council of Australian Governments to move Australia towards the end goal of sustainable use of water resources.
The Democrats have done much work on water use in the Senate and through its inquiry processes. Senator Aden Ridgeway chaired the inquiry into Rural Water Use, and I chaired the Senate Inquiry into Australia's Urban Water Management. These two inquiries provided a clear basis for water reform strategy and as a result we will today move a second reading amendment urging the targets, recommendations and proposals that came out of the committee's work will continue to be acted on. Two years after the urban water inquiry reported, I feel that we may be finally making headway towards best use of Australia's precious water resources. The Water Efficiency Labelling scheme was a recommendation of the urban water inquiry and one the Democrats negotiated a year or so ago as part of the Measures for a Better Environment. I look forward to dealing with that bill early next year.
Considering the great importance of this issue, and the absolute necessity of bringing the states on board for all negotiations, the Democrats are concerned the Federal Government has attempted to steam-roll states regardless of whether agreement has been reached or not. This is amply demonstrated by the submissions received from state governments following the Democrats' referral of the National Water Commission Bill to Senate Inquiry.
Despite the Federal Government's efforts to curtail the inquiry by insisting on an extremely tight reporting date, state governments, farming bodies and conservation groups acted in record time to submit comments expressing concerns about the reporting and decision-making procedures as drafted by the government in this bill. 
As an example, I quote the Victorian Minister for Environment John Thwaites in a letter received by the Senate Environment Committee today when he says “The Victorian Government does not believe the Bill reflects the spirit of cooperation which resulted in the signing of the National Water Initiative by the Council of Australian Governments. The Victorian Government considers it imperative that the National Water Commission provides advice and reports direct to COAG following consultation with the States and Territories, not report direct to the Prime Minister as is currently proposed. “Minister Thwaites goes on to point out “the National Water Initiative Intergovernmental Agreement (clause 107) states that the National Water Commission reports to COAG will be publicly available”.
The Democrats are concerned the Howard Government is seeking to renege on that agreement through this bill. We do not believe that amendments made by the government in the House of Representatives will result in the appropriate level of transparency or spirit of cooperation and as such will present our own amendments to the Senate.
Wasteful water use practices have resulted in the degradation of many of our water resources, particularly in eastern, south-eastern and south-western Australia. The Democrats believe the establishment of a National Water Commission and commitment of funding to ensure the National Water Initiative is extremely important. At the time of the announcement of the Australian Water Fund, we were pleased to see recognition from the Federal Government of the need for a significant cultural shift in water use and management. We can only hope that state and Federal Governments will adopt the second unanimously agreed recommendation from the Senate Inquiry into Rural Water, namely that COAG should negotiate an ongoing shared programme for funding the reforms in the Intergovernmental Agreement on a National Water Initiative.
We are concerned that this bill would make the Federal Minister the key conduit for advice and appears to have the discretion to act, or not act upon the NWC's advice. We also note, that as drafted, the legislation stipulates that the Minister is not required to publish the National Water Commission's advice or recommendations. Hardly in the spirit of the National Water Initiative which states the Commission's reports will be publicly available.
Within the policy framework of the National Water Initiative, the Democrats are not satisfied with the lack of targets for environmental flows for the Murray Darling, and the significant delays in delivering funding and real outcomes toward recovery of the Murray Darling system. We urge the Federal Government to release funding from the Living Murray program to ensure actual on ground action that will release more water into the river and relieve its parched wetland ecosystems in the shortest possible timeframe.
The Australian Democrats recently called for the Federal Government to ensure Australia's northern region's water resources are properly assessed prior to any large-scale expansion farming or ranching activities. We urge the Government to keep a close watch on moves to establish large scale cotton crops in Northern Australia.
We have already seen our most productive agricultural area, the Murray-Darling basin, decimated due to misuse and misunderstanding of the water resources of the area. Australia must not make the same water use mistakes in the north, or we will be facing similar huge bills for reparation and arguments over water rights as we are seeing in the southern states.
Similarly, over the last few weeks, we have seen reports that Western Australia, which I remind the Government is yet to sign on to the National Water Initiative, is under pressure to implement plans to channel water from northern Australia. Coupled with expanding cattle-ranching and cotton-farming, the north's biodiversity and water resources look like being under substantial pressure in the near future. The Murray Darling should not be the sole focus of efforts to move Australia towards sustainable use of water.
Once again I would like to express the great hopes the Australian Democrats hold for the National Water Initiative, and our eagerness to see it pass. However, without a cooperative approach to management of water resources, we fear the process will be stalled. We urge all governments to work together towards a transparent, open and most importantly effective program to move Australia's water use towards sustainable levels. I urge the Senate to re-visit the unanimously endorsed recommendations on water that have come out of the Senate inquiry process, in order to ensure they are implemented in the shortest possible timeframe.

At the end of the motion, add “, and condemns the Government for:
	(a)	its failure to take the threat of climate change to ongoing water supplies for both our farmers and our rivers seriously;
	(b)	its failure to deal with water issues with an appropriate sense of urgency, allowing the COAG water reform process of 1994 to stall, and failing to provide any environmental flows for the Murray River in over 8 years;
	(c)	its failure to adopt Labor's national water policy framework, and ensure that Commonwealth funds are directed towards securing environmental flows; and

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-12-07,"—In the first instance, I thank all honourable senators for their contributions to a very important debate on the National Water Commission Bill 2004. I listened as much as I could to the contributions. I think it is quite clear that all senators have identified the problems. Australia is a continent that is short of water in many places and abundant in it in other places. We are a nation that is challenged by how we deal with water. Many of the challenges are created because of the nature of Australia. Other challenges have been created because of how we have changed Australia during European occupation. European activities on the land have changed it, and there is no greater example of that than the Murray-Darling system, which is now a highly artificially controlled channel that happens to have some magnificent pieces of Australian wetlands and a range of other important pieces of landscape around and within the basin.
The government have recognised the need to address the water challenges. That is why we have established a $2 billion fund to work with the states and the Territory in addressing these problems. Senator Lees made reference to a number of problems within South Australia with regard to the plans and sometimes failures of the water authority there. I think water authorities across Australia have been challenged. We have pricing systems that create perverse outcomes. We have water authorities that make a lot of money from selling potable water which then gets pumped onto tennis courts, golf courses and a range of other places. At the same time we get potable water, flush it down our toilets and through our sewerage systems and straight out into the sea. We have what rational and sensible people looking at this nation would see as some very strange ways of dealing with a very scarce commodity. The National Water Initiative, to be supported by major investments through the national water fund, is without any doubt the largest and most ambitious program to address these challenges in Australia's history.
During the election campaign the Australian Labor Party came up with a plan, for example, to put 1,500 gigalitres back into the Murray. Mr Garrett and Mr Latham stood on the banks of the Murray River and promised that they would find 1,500 gigalitres. They did not say where they would get it from. They did not say how they would do it. They had no detail. It made a nice photo opportunity on the banks of the Murray in the middle of the election campaign, as did former Senator Graham Richardson, the then minister for the environment, and Mr Bob Hawke, the then Prime Minister, standing on the banks of the Murray in exactly the same spot promising to plant, I think, one billion trees. It was a promise that went the same way as Mr Hawke's promise that no child would live in poverty. Promises made standing on the banks of the Murray will be treated with scorn by people who live in that basin and by all other Australians if they are not backed up by practical action and major investments. 
The Labor Party has made criticisms. In the pious second reading amendment moved by the opposition we see criticism of the funding of the national water fund. The states—and Labor federally seems to be supporting them in this—say that the funds come from money earmarked by the states for other purposes. The hypocrisy of that statement is that during the election campaign the Australian Labor Party took exactly the same money and sought to spend it on other things. This money is not the states' money. As the Labor Party knows full well, it comprises the competition payments, as they are called. The national competition policy concludes in 2006 and the competition payments are not scheduled after 2006. The states know that very well. The Labor Party knows that very well because it took the money to spend it on its own programs. You cannot have it both ways. The Commonwealth is using legitimate Commonwealth sources of funding to pay for a major and long overdue addressing of the water challenges of this nation. You cannot complain or challenge our source of funding when you were, during the election campaign, using that money for your own purposes.
The fact is that Australia needs this major investment. Australia must spend money on water. It has to be done in cooperation with the states and the territories through the COAG process and with the leadership of all governments. The investment is overdue. It is needed. If we are to hand this continent on to the next generation with a much more sustainable environment and with water supplies that are reliable in communities around Australia—keeping those communities alive—then this initiative is needed. The Commonwealth is very keen to see the commission established, the National Water Initiative put in place and the investments commenced. The Prime Minister made it clear that he wants 20 major projects going in the next year. We want to see the benefits of the initiatives. Those projects will do a lot of the things that all of the senators here have spoken about tonight. A lot of those investments are major capital investments. They are investments that water authorities in the past have been reluctant to put in place but they will be able to do it, as will other proponents, with the significant support provided by the Commonwealth government using taxpayers' money. I commend the legislation to the Senate.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2004-12-07,"—Too often the works of great Australians receive insufficient recognition. I would like tonight to outline some of the achievements of my friends Charles and Eva Curran. I rise to pay tribute, in effect, to two remarkable Australians who just happen to be married to each other. I have often thought that the ancient words of the Roman poet Ovid best typify the marriage of Charles and Eva. Ovid said: 
If you would marry suitably, marry your equal.
Having recently attended their 40th wedding anniversary, I know there could not be a more apt phrase to describe their lifelong companionship. Charles Curran is many things: a devoted family man, a successful businessman, a generous philanthropist, a keen sportsman, a patron of the arts and, perhaps most importantly, a loyal friend to the many and varied people within his wide orbit. The term `Renaissance man' is an appropriate description of Charles. It encompasses his passion for education and advancement, intrinsically describing his interest in the advancement of business and learning.
Eva Curran is, like Charles, a person for whom others have profound respect. Her role as philanthropist, devoted parent, constant friend and supporter of charitable causes is widely admired. Together, they make true the old adage that `the whole is greater than the sum of its parts'. Theirs is an open-hearted partnership that provides a role model for others. It is the touchstone and the inspiration for the magnificent contribution they make to their community and to their nation.
The many impressive achievements of Charles Curran in business are made more so for being based on the highest ethical and moral considerations. His success in a diverse range of industry sectors including media, banking and insurance is built on business acumen, a sharp intellect and a tireless work ethic. Some of the highlights of Charles's career include his chairmanship of such diverse organisations as Perpetual Trustees Australia, the Greater Union Organisation, the Medical Benefits Fund of Australia, Capital Television Holdings Ltd, the New South Wales Government Commission of Audit and the Australian Wool Exchange. Additionally, he has held a directorship of QBE Insurance and is an international adviser for Goldman Sachs. Charles has also had a longstanding interest in agriculture, particularly in the field of viticulture. He has brought these interests to the fore on his property Noojee Lea, at Canowindra, which produces premium wine, under the Nassau Estate label, and the finest merino wool. 
In the Australian business community, Charles Curran's name is something of a byword. His integrity has made him an example to all who take executive and non-executive roles within companies. Corporate governance has benefited and will continue to do so from his example in an era when ethical behaviour is a much discussed attribute of good business. This integrity, exemplified in the business world, is perhaps more sharply seen in the activity of the Currans in their charitable endeavours. In addition to their financial contributions, Charles and Eva devote their time to a variety of charitable organisations by providing business and practical advice and activity. It is rare that this couple, so self-sufficient, would ask anything of their friends unless of course it is for a beloved charity. They have no hesitation in knocking on the doors of business and personal contacts in search of assistance for the benefit and support of others. 
Some of the charities that have particularly benefited from Charles's business acumen are the Royal Institute for Deaf and Blind Children where he served as vice president, St Vincent's Hospital, the Sydney Health Service, the Eastern Sydney Area Health Service and the Garvan Institute of Medical Research where he has served as a past and present chairman. The support of the Currans for specific health charities emanates from the time-worn yet true phrase, `If you don't have your health, you don't have anything.' They have taken this as their guide and have espoused causes and supported initiatives that have seen the recovery and rehabilitation of innumerable sufferers. One special example that I would like to dwell on from the impressive list is the involvement of Charles and Eva with St Vincent's Hospital and the Garvan Foundation. In 1984, the Currans became aware of the critical state of discretionary funds held by St Vincent's Hospital. Charles's parents established the Curran Foundation with an initial contribution of $500,000. Charles's father, Paul, who is still alive, recently celebrated his 90th birthday. 
Another substantial contribution of $800,000 was later made to the foundation by Charles which assisted the Garvan Foundation Library, the Capital Appeal and the Peter Wills Centre for Bio-Informatics. Today, the foundation has assets of $8 million and has given $4.3 million in grants since its establishment for the provision of medical equipment and patient care facilities. Anyone who knows this family is aware that they do not give for self-aggrandisement but give in the spirit of improving the lives of those less fortunate. 
With Australia as their first love, Charles and Eva are also established citizens of the world, spending considerable periods of time abroad for business and charity. They have combined their love of other cultures and their philanthropic nature in their involvement with the Australian Ireland Fund. This fund has raised over $4.2 million to combat terror and violence in Ireland. As chairman, Charles Curran, with Eva's enthusiastic support, embodies the spirit of improvement through education and understanding. I recently attended a function of the fund at which Charles spoke about the projects that the group are involved in. One of these projects was the establishment of the Sir Warwick Fairfax Trust for Integrated Education in Northern Ireland. Lady Mary Fairfax generously made the initial contribution of $1 million to the trust, with the goal being to educate children, Catholic and Protestant, in an integrated environment. Prejudice springs from ignorance and missed opportunities in education. The beneficiaries of this trust will do much to consolidate the achievements of the 1998 Peace Accord which has promised so much. The contributions of Charles to his immediate and wider community were officially recognised in 1987 when he was awarded an Officer of the Order of Australia. 
Yet another example of the extreme versatility of Charles Curran is his fascination with the sport of sailing. As skipper, crew and owner, he has demonstrated his inability to pursue a project as a half-measure. This love of sport is not confined to sailing. Charles has also served as a member of the New South Wales Committee of the Australian Olympic Committee. 
In addition to his impressive repertoire of achievements and philanthropy, Charles also has a real passion for the arts. Charles was appointed a director of the National Gallery of Australia Council in 2003. He was chosen on the basis of his business skills and his knowledge of finance. Sculptures by the Sea at Bondi, an annual event featuring some of the most creative and innovative artists in Australia, benefited from his and Eva's considerable involvement. This exhibition is one of the most widely visited annual events in Sydney and truly delivers a burst of colour to those who might not see how the arts speak to all Australians in diverse ways.
The 40 years that Charles and Eva have been married have seen them raise five delightful and successful children, with seven grandchildren to keep them forever young. From personal observation I know that family life for the Currans is filled with laughter, love and a refreshing tendency to rousing debate! One of their sons said recently: 
It is through his role as a father that I think Dad has outshone his business and community achievements. He is, quite simply, an outstanding father. I remember as a young school boy, Dad arriving home late, very tired, but happy to help us with our homework.
Eva continues to play the pivotal roles of wife, mother, confidant and friend which have made the Curran marriage the focus of admiration, delight and a source of inspiration for their many friends. The diverse achievements of Charles and Eva Curran are remarkable, and the label of `great Australians' sits comfortably on their shoulders. Those close to Charles and Eva marvel at their ability to manage such diverse activities in their sometimes hectic lives. They are never too busy to find time to catch up or to mentor the young and are the first at your door to share in both the good times and less fortunate times. I believe that the mutual respect they have for one another is the foundation for their many achievements and the basis of their successful and loving marriage. They regard everything they do as a work in progress. I am both honoured and privileged to have enjoyed their friendship for many years. On behalf of your many friends and admirers, I can think of no better gift than to wish you both sustained good health and continued success.
