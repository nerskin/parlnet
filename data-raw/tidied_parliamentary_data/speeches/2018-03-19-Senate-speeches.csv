Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (10:06):  Right now we are witnessing the end of an era. The sun is setting on the coal empire and we are transitioning to a new future powered by renewable energy. It's an exciting future, but it's well past overdue.


The government has been doing everything it can to slow this country's transition to renewable energy, and Australians are bearing the brunt of their failure. In the last few days, we've seen bushfires savage Tathra, Bega and south-west Victoria. We've seen a cyclone hit Darwin. In Tathra, we heard this morning that 70 homes and other buildings have been destroyed. Four people were treated for smoke inhalation and one RFS volunteer was injured. By all accounts, we are very lucky that more people were not hurt.


In my home region of south-west Victoria, 18 homes have been destroyed around the towns of Terang, Garvoc, Camperdown and Gazette; 40,000 hectares have been burnt and farmers have lost their livestock. I know a bit about this part of the world because it's where I live. It's where my family lives and it's where my community is. In our everyday lives we are seeing climate change have an impact on the risk of bushfires to our communities, and we can't any longer be complacent about bushfires once the end of summer comes around. Right now we would normally be talking about the end of the bushfire season, and yet here we are with bushfires ravaging my home state and, indeed, my community.


In Western Australia they are now calling their autumn a 'second summer'. And on the other side of the country, in the Top End, Cyclone Marcus has rolled through Darwin and, according to forecasters, it was the strongest storm to hit Darwin in 30 years. The impact has closed schools, it's shut down the public service and cut off electricity to tens of thousands of people.


Of course, we know that it's not just Australia that is feeling the impact. To pick one of many disturbing recent events, the Arctic has just experienced an unprecedented heatwave, forcing scientists to reconsider even their most pessimistic forecasts of climate change. Temperatures in Siberia were as much as 35 degrees Celsius above historical averages. I'll say that again: 35 degrees above historical averages. Greenland experienced three times as many hours above freezing than usual. We are seeing extremes.


In spite of this overwhelming evidence of the impact of climate change, what we're seeing is a Turnbull government dangerously wedded to coal. It's pushing against the tide of clean energy and all the benefits that brings. As we transition to a renewable energy future, we'll no longer be contributing to dangerous global warming as we generate and use electricity. It is that simple. We can start making this transition now. The good news is it brings so many other benefits to our community. By moving away from coal and taking advantage of clean, green renewable energies, we won't be emitting toxic chemicals like mercury and sulphur dioxide anymore. These are the poisonous gases that our communities inhale when we mine and burn coal. We know that coal has serious health impacts. We know that it leads to respiratory disease, it leads to heart disease, it leads to the development of some cancers and it leads to low birth weight in babies. There are so many good reasons to move away from dirty, polluting coal to clean, renewable energy that are beyond the advantages we get when we move to cleaner sources of energy.


Of course, there is the question of reliability. We won't be relying on unreliable, old coal-fired power stations that don't do the job in extremes of hot weather. Let's look at the facts. We've heard a lot questions about South Australia, but let's look at the facts of what happened this summer. During heatwaves in New South Wales last year, Liddell Power Station was unable to perform because two of its generator units failed to switch on due to unforeseen boiler tube leaks. On New Year's Day, Millmerran Power Station in Queensland stalled. One of the coal-fired power stations there stalled, taking out 156 megawatts from the National Electricity Market. In January, one of the four units of Victoria's Loy Yang A Power Station broke down, taking out another 230 megawatts. We could go on and on, but suffice to say we know that coal-fired power stations can't be relied upon to deliver power in extremes of weather.


These are old stations, well past their use-by date, and we know that it is now cheaper to build a new solar farm or more wind turbines than it is to build a new coal-fired power station. For years we've heard from the Turnbull and Abbott governments about the dangers of so-called intermittent renewable energy. They deceitfully blamed power outages in South Australia on renewables after wild storms, when the real cause of the blackout was downed poles and wires. It was a problem with transmission, not generation. That's just one of the many examples of the Liberal and National parties' denialist anti-renewable energy ideology. It also saw them spend obscene amounts of taxpayer dollars on the National Wind Farm Commissioner, for example, to listen to a range of debunked claims about the medical impacts, amongst other things, of wind farms. Imagine if that money had been spent in more renewable energy generation.


Of course, disappointingly for the government and their cabal of deniers, we know that when coal-fired power stations fail, it's not other coal stations that come to the rescue; it is renewable energy that manages to bridge the gap. When Loy Yang shut down without warning on 14 December last year, taking out 560 megawatts and putting the whole electricity network in danger, it was South Australia's big new Tesla battery that sprang into action to help save the day. It is renewable energy that is meeting the shortfall that occurs when coal-fired power no longer operates.


We also know that the coal industry is in structural decline. No-one in the private sector is building new coal-fired power stations anymore. It does not stack up economically in this day and age. We know the environment arguments are clear, but so too are the economic arguments. No-one is interested in investing billions of dollars into a giant coal-fired power station that we won't want to switch on in a few years' time. No-one wants to do it. No-one is interested in sinking capital investment into an ageing technology when the cost of renewables is plummeting. Investing in coal is about as sensible as investing in dial-up internet: there is no argument for it and the technology has moved ahead of it. Yet we have this government desperately clinging to the past—to the electricity equivalent of fax machines and typewriters.


We've seen our Treasurer wave coal around in parliament in a desperate bid to try and make it more popular. We've seen the minister for trade and also the then minister for resources, Barnaby Joyce, spruik Adani's dirty, great big coalmine to Chinese financiers. Most recently, we saw the returned minister for resources, Senator Canavan, talking about how Australia's coal is more beautiful than Donald Trump's coal. What sort of competition is that? It's not one we want to be part of. It doesn't get more farcical than what we've seen played out on the floor of this parliament over recent years.


The cost of renewables is plummeting. That's a good news story and something we should be embracing. If the Turnbull government had any vision, it would be positioning Australia to take advantage of this energy revolution that is sweeping across the rest of the world. We have so many natural advantages here. We live in one of the sunniest, windiest places in the world. We have abundant space. We have the technological expertise. We could be leading the charge, but instead we are an international laggard dragging our heels behind so much of the developed world.


Last year I thought we'd hit rock bottom when we saw the Prime Minister pressuring a private company, AGL, into prolonging the life of that decrepit, old coal-clunker Liddell. Liddell is something that's more at home in 1960s Soviet Russia than it is in a modern 21st century economy. Liddell is falling apart. It's hanging together with spit and string. AGL knows that it's a dud investment. It doesn't want to throw good money after bad in keeping it open. The company itself has said that it would have to invest nearly a billion dollars to keep it open for an extra five years, which would push up the cost of its output to around $106 per megawatt hour. This is the market responding to a Prime Minister who wants us to turn the clock back.


AGL now has a plan to replace Liddell with 1.6 gigawatts of renewables, plus storage and a range of other technologies, yet the Turnbull government and its state cronies are talking about dipping into the public purse to help Liddell stay open for another few years. It should be illegal to use public money in this way. Taxpayer dollars—dollars that belong to everybody—should be spent on investing in the things that we know are the foundations of a decent society: public health care and hospitals; public education and schools; and science and research. It should be spent on doing something about the growing gap between the rich and poor—reducing inequality—and ensuring everybody gets access to a social safety net and a decent education. We should be spending our hard-earned dollars on securing a long-term energy future that's based in renewables. We should be investing in the public interest, not on a handout that will burn our planet and make climate change worse. That's why it should be illegal.


The Coal-Fired Power Funding Prohibition Bill 2017 prohibits the Commonwealth from providing financial support to refurbish, or indeed to build, a coal-fired power station. It also prevents the Commonwealth from purchasing or assisting with the purchase or transfer of ownership of a coal-fired power station. The bill does make sure that the government can provide public money to transition affected workers into new industries and that it can use public money to manage the closure of a coal-fired power station. This is a transition that is happening and that will happen, despite this government trying to slow it down.


We have a choice. We can look after those workers in those industries and manage this transition in a way that ensures that their future is looked after as well, or we can leave them to the vagaries of the market, not manage the transition, and see workers left on the scrap heap. It is the Greens that want a just transition.


We know that no major financial institution wants to fund coal. Our experience with the Adani coalmine has made that abundantly clear. They simply can't find the finance.


The Turnbull government needs to listen to the science, listen to what the economics are telling us and listen to what the rest of the world is saying. Coal is obsolete; it has no long-term future, and we need to invest in those things that do.


Of course, we still don't know where the ALP sits on this issue. We certainly know where the Liberal and National parties do; we know that, for them, it's coal all the way. But we know that the Labor Party is also beholden to those vested interests in the fossil fuel industry—it takes major donations from the fossil fuel industry. We know that there's a revolving door between the parliament, for former members—Liberal, National and Labor—and their staffers, and big coal. That revolving door between parliament and the coal industry has never swung faster.


Well, we have a plan. We want Australia to run on 100 per cent renewable energy. We're proud of that fact. We have a plan to transition workers from coal communities into the jobs of the future. We want to ensure that people are looked after. We will re-regulate electricity prices to bring costs down and provide much-needed relief to Australian families.


I urge all members of this place—and, in particular, the ALP and the crossbench—to show some courage in supporting this bill. This is our opportunity to stake what it means to have a long-term future for future generations. This is our opportunity to say: 'The past is the past, and we understand what a 21st-century modern economy looks like. It's one that's powered by renewable energy. It's one that looks after people. It's one that ensures that, in any transition, no matter how difficult, those workers are looked after.' This is an opportunity for the Labor Party and the crossbench to take a stand against the dangerous Turnbull government's obsession with coal, and to ensure that we lay out a clear path for this nation.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2018-03-19,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (10:22):  The Greens political party have been called many things, but, clearly, they are now a party in denial. If ever you'd wanted to know why the voters of Tasmania and South Australia and Batman have at last turned against the Greens, you've had a classic example now, with that speech of denial from the current Greens leader in the Senate. Fifteen years ago, when the Greens parties in Europe started to fail, I predicted then that the Greens political party in Australia would, not long after, follow suit. Following the result, even in Tasmania, can I say, and then even in South Australia, which used to be the Greens heartland at one stage, and now of course in Batman, the voters of Australia have eventually woken up to the hypocrisy and fraud of the Greens political party.


Let me start by asking Senator Di Natale, or any of the Greens speakers who might speak in this debate, this question I always ask and can never get an answer to from the Greens. According to the Greens, Australia's emissions of carbon are what's causing global climate change. I repeat that. This is the Greens' claim, and you've just heard Senator Di Natale say that: what Australia emits in carbon is why the world's climate is changing. It is an incontestable fact that Australia emits less than 1.4 per cent of the world's carbon emissions. You can shut Australia down completely, stop our emissions totally, which in world figures is 1.4 per cent, but what impact will that have on the changing climate of the world? Don't listen to my answer; listen to the answer of Australia's Chief Scientist who, when asked that question, said, 'virtually none.' Yet Senator Di Natale has spent 20 minutes trying to confuse the dwindling band of supporters of the Greens political party that somehow it's Australia's fault, and if we open up the Adani coalmine that is going to cause greater cyclones, huge floods and snow storms around the world. The Greens are completely hypocritical, and completely fraudulent, when it comes to this debate.


Even Senator Di Natale started off by saying the storm in Darwin is the biggest storm ever for the last 30 years, and that's the same with everything. The floods in Brisbane a few years ago were the biggest floods in Queensland since 1927. Cyclone Yasi was the biggest cyclone ever to hit Australia since 1918. These events have happened before, they will happen in the future, and nothing Senator Di Natale says will change that.


I ask Senator Di Natale to tell me how you and your Labor Party mates—well, you used to be mates—think by doing something in Australia we're going to stop world climate change? I'm fascinated to hear how, with 1.4 per cent of emissions, something we do in Australia is going to save the world. It is just nonsensical. It's a question I keep asking and no-one from the Greens political party has ever even attempted to answer the question on how Australia, which emits less than 1.4 per cent of the world's emissions of carbon, can possibly have any effect on the changing climate. Sure, when the rest of the world—the other 98.5 per cent of emitters—reduce their carbon emissions, then Australia should do something as well. But until then why are we destroying Australian jobs—the jobs of Australian workers? I used to think the CFMEU and the Labor Party were interested in them, but they are clearly not anymore. They go for the Greens' ideology, and I hope after Batman the Labor Party will at last realise that the Greens' message is failing and failing rapidly.


Please can someone from the Greens political party or the Labor Party, who seem to subscribe to this foolish fantasy, tell me how Australia, which emits less than 1.4 per cent of the world's carbon emissions, is affecting world climate change?


Senator Di Natale says renewables are the way to go. Certainly the government's position is that it is technology neutral for investment in the energy sector, and we've introduced legislation to remove the prohibition on the Clean Energy Finance Corporation from providing finance to carbon capture and storage projects.


I will point out to the Senate, and anyone who might be listening to this, that in all the world agreements on reduction in emissions Australia is one of the few countries in the world that has actually met all of its targets. It's done it mainly under Liberal governments by cleverly managing the economy, but not destroying jobs, and particularly not destroying the futures of other countries. Senator Di Natale rails in one breath against the Indian company Adani—there seems to be a bit of a racial tone to the accusations against Adani—and then in the next breath he will say how the Greens political party is always looking after those poor people around the world. Yet here is the chance for the poor people in India to get the electricity that Senator Di Natale has been using for the last 50 years —I might say it is coal-fired power electricity. Why do we deprive the poor people of India of that opportunity? And that's what the Adani project is all about.


We have unlimited reserves of high-quality, low-emission black coal in the Central Queensland area, where I come from, which is there to be exported to India, to establish new coal-fired power stations, to give the people of India the very limited luxury of electricity, which they don't have now. Senator Di Natale and the Greens would deny the Indian people this opportunity. The Indian people will get coal-fired power stations because they need it for their country to progress, but they'll get dirty coal from Indonesia and other places. They could get coal from Australia—a cleaner power, a cleaner coal—and that would bring jobs to Australians and help the Indian people. Yet, the Greens will never answer my question. I challenge anyone to come back to me in the hundreds of times I've asked this question in this chamber: how is it that Australia, which emits less than 1.4 per cent of the carbon emissions of the world, is going to affect climate change? I know I'm repeating myself, but I will keep saying this until the people of Australia—all of them—understand that it is not Australia's doing. Australia emits less than 1.4 per cent, and even the most revered scientist in the world—Australia's Chief Scientist—in Hansard in answer to my question: 'What impact would it have if we reduce Australia's emissions by 1.4 per cent?', answered: 'Virtually none.' This just shows the fraud and hypocrisy of the Greens political party and the voters of Australia are at last waking up.


Senator Di Natale talks about clean, green renewables. We all like that but, of course, when the sun stops shining and the wind stops blowing, how do we get power? The South Australian former government, the Labor government, had a great idea. They were going to turn on all these diesel fired generators, hundreds of diesel fired generators polluting the Australian atmosphere. It just shows the absolute hypocrisy and stupidity of the argument of the Greens political party and, I might say, their mates in the Labor Party on this. Sure, you have to have a mix, and under the Turnbull government we are getting that mix. We are encouraging renewables where they work and we are encouraging other forms of energy.


I know I'm old, but I remember the time when Australia's main competitive advantage in this world was that we had cheap power, because we are blessed with high-quality coal. It was that cheap power that in the fifties and sixties burst Australia to the head of the world economies. Now, unfortunately, because of the actions of the Labor Party, I have to say, more than the Greens political party, that is coming into difficulty. Senator Di Natale says Adani can't get money for their project. I don't know how he knows that—quite frankly, I don't either—but I suspect they do have the money. But why would you invest in any project in Australia? One government, the Liberal government in Canberra, and the Labor government in Queensland have said: 'Yes, this coal project in Central Queensland can go ahead, providing all these environmental conditions are met. it provides jobs for Indigenous people there. Yes, it can all go ahead.' So you invest your money and start the project on the basis of approvals given by the state Labor government and the federal Liberal government, and then Mr Shorten, to win votes in Batman, comes along and says, more or less: 'It doesn't matter what's happened in the past. If you invest your money, I'm going to introduce federal legislation to stop it.'


Why would you invest in a project when you have a government—an alternative government, I might say—saying to the world, 'It doesn't matter what the current governments, including the Labor one in Queensland, say; if I get into power I'm going to stop Adani, after they've invested all this money.' If you ever wanted a way of chasing investment in all of its forms away from Australia, you only have to look at Mr Shorten's stupidity in the recent Batman by-election. He was so keen to win that seat from the Greens that he just said anything that he thought might attract a few of the loony Greens voters over to his party, and he succeeded in that.


But in doing that, what's he done to the workers—the coal workers and the mining workers of Queensland, the state that I represent, the people up my way? The people of Townsville are looking to the Adani project, a project of billions and billions of dollars, to kickstart the economy of the Townsville region and the North and to provide literally thousands of jobs for CFMEU members—well, people who would be CFMEU members, although we know the statistics: the number of people joining unions these days has plummeted to nine per cent of the private workforce; only nine per cent join the unions. Why? Because the union they thought was looking after them—the construction, mining and forestry union—has sided with Labor and the Greens to deny them jobs in the mines, for no purpose. As I've demonstrated, it's not going to make one iota of difference to climate change. All it does is send Australia's jobs offshore and make our energy bill much higher than it should be.


The hypocrisy and lack of truth and rigor in the Greens' speech is demonstrated by Senator Di Natale's comment that 'No-one's building coal-fired power stations these days.' Well, sorry: in China there's about one new coal-fired power station built every week. And in India there are coal-fired power stations being built all the time. Even in Germany these days there is a new interest in coal-fired power stations. Why? Because with carbon capture and storage, with these new HELE plants, you can have the benefits of coal and affordable energy at the same time as grabbing particulates and other elements from coal that aren't as useful to the world as they should be. So, again, you've got to understand that the Greens are in denial. After the last awful couple of weeks that they've had, I can well understand that. But clearly the Australian voters have woken up to the hypocrisy, the stupidity and the outright lies of the Greens political party and have deserted the Greens in droves.


A lot of very positive action has been taken by the Turnbull government, and all credit to Mr Josh Frydenberg, the energy and environment minister, and Matt Canavan, the resources minister, led by our Prime Minister. We are taking a balanced and sensible look at Australia's energy needs. Under the Greens political party, now supported by the Australian Labor Party, power prices for ordinary Australians are skyrocketing through the roof. Yet we have this unlimited supply of high-quality coal in central Queensland, near where I live, which is readily available to give Australia that competitive advantage that it had in years gone by.


I know I'm being repetitive, but I want to again demonstrate this. I want to ask anybody from the Labor Party or the Greens political party to tell me how anything we do in Australia, which emits less than 1.4 per cent of the world's carbon emissions, is going to affect the changing climate of the world, assuming, as I do, that carbon emissions do have some impact on climate change—although I acknowledge I'm not one who gets into this debate, because I am not a scientist and I don't understand it, but I do know that equally qualified scientists have very divergent views on this same subject. But even accepting that carbon emissions have an impact on climate change, I asked this question of the Greens political party. I must have a look in Hansard, because I think I've asked this same question 100 times and, would you believe, never once has there been an answer. You don't have to be terribly bright—and I'm not terribly bright—you just need to have a little bit of common sense: Australia emits less than 1.4 per cent of the world's carbon emissions and, according to the Chief Scientist, even if we stop that completely—that is, shut down every car, turn off every light and stop any use of Australia's principal source of energy, which is coal-fired power—it would have, to quote the Chief Scientist, 'virtually no' impact on the changing climate of the world.


Do I think that perhaps today, after the flogging the Greens have received in the ballot box in the last few weeks, I will get an answer to that question? I suspect not. The Greens will continue in denial of the facts, of the truth of these matters, of the absolute common sense. The Greens want to reduce Australia's emissions by 50 or 80 per cent—I don't know what it is—but even if you reduce it by 100 per cent not one iota of difference would it make to the changing climate of this world.


This bill, which seeks to prohibit forever investment in coal-fired power stations, is just another loony lefty creation of a party not only in great denial but in steep decline in voter support. I'm delighted to say that my fellow Australians have eventually woken up to the hypocrisy, the lack of truth, the outright lies of the Greens political party and I am sure that they, like a lot of their theories, will be confined to the dustbin of history, and the sooner that happens, the better for Australia.

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2018-03-19,"



Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (10:42):  I feel as though I've heard this debate many times and I think we'll find some of the allegations and cross-allegations listed in Hansard over and over again over at least the last 10 years. Labor has long recognised that Australia needs to transition to clean forms of electricity generation. Our ministers in previous governments Greg Combet and Tony Burke, and now the shadow minister, Mr Mark Butler in the other place, have argued consistently that we do need to have a strong commitment to renewable energy. We have a strong set of policies, which are all on the record, which talk about why we need to have a commitment to achieve 50 per cent renewable energy by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2050. That's consistent with the commitments and statements we made under the Paris accord. That is clear. We understand that we have to move energy production in this country. We need to work with community, with science, and with people in this place to ensure we don't have statements like we just heard, which completely debunk any kind of positive discussion or argument about how we can make this change.


We recognise the importance of ensuring this transition is a just one. We talk so much about the fact that we need to work with communities—particularly the communities that Senator Macdonald I think referred to in his contribution—that have been relying on the coal industry for over a century. You cannot make decisions about our community without engaging with them and ensuring that we have a just transition. We won't let coal power workers and communities be left behind, as we, a parliament, a government, actually tackle climate change. The inevitability of this transition is recognised. Finally, I think, we can say together that the inevitability of the transition is recognised by the energy industry and, as a result, the planned and managed phase-out of coal-fired power is something the industry accepts and includes in its forward plans. The head of the Australian Energy Council, Mr Matthew Warren, has previously said that new coal-fired power stations in Australia are 'uninvestable', a view held widely by companies and put about clearly in the finance sector. Put simply, the debate about what Australia's energy future looks like has really been won not in this place but in corporate boardrooms and communities across Australia.


Australia's energy future is one that is increasingly renewable, increasingly flexible, increasingly distributed and increasingly high tech. We are never going to go back to the old 20th century model of a central coal plant and passive customers; even if we try to put our climate change obligations to one side, which I believe I've heard debated in this place, we mustn't, we shouldn't and we won't. The fact is that renewable energy is the cheapest form of new electricity generation, and storage and energy management technologies are seeing advances and cost reductions that mean a reliable, affordable renewable energy system is well within Australia's grasp.


The current debate about energy policy isn't about a coal-fired future versus a renewables future. Though I believe that debate will continue to happen in this place, that is not the real debate. We must have a renewables future. The real debate is really about a well-managed transition versus a transition that is chaotic and costly, which is what the approach of the Turnbull government is delivering.


That does not mean that Labor are supporting the bill that's before this place this morning, the Coal-Fired Power Funding Prohibition Bill 2017. We don't believe that it's a sensible bill. We don't believe that it actually engages in the debate we need to have. The debate we should be having in this place includes the questions: how can the transition to clean energy be best managed? What policy framework best delivers a clean energy future whilst safeguarding reliability and affordability—that is, not denying that affordability and reliability can occur but actually safeguarding reliability and affordability? What must governments, at every level, do to ensure coal power workers and their communities see and are part of a bright and prosperous future? How can we ensure that renters and those in community and social housing can access the benefits of solar and battery systems?


We must also talk, in this place and in our communities, about how we are going to be part of the ongoing international discussion that is clearly outlined in the sustainable development goals—the sustainable development goals that our nation, with many others, signed on to with great protestations of faith two years ago. At least four of these goals are a core part of this debate and what we should be talking about in this place. We have goal 7: affordable and clean energy. That's what this debate is about—affordability and clean energy. It's also about industry, innovation and infrastructure: working with the people who have the skills, the ability and the finance to make sure we have the infrastructure, the innovation and the science that will ensure we have the strong, clean renewable energy future we must have. We must also talk about sustainable cities and communities—that is, ensuring strong, secure and effective energy processes so that people are not struggling, on a daily basis, with energy costs. We also need to have responsible consumption and production. Nothing is more central to this debate than responsible consumption and production—again, understanding the importance and the essential nature of energy in our community.


Goal 13 is climate action. I do believe that any debate about whether there is a link between carbon emissions and climate action should be over, though every now and then you hear echoes in this place about whether it is still open for debate. We know that there are people in the parliament that will continue to deny, continue to say that there is no link. Even if they don't understand the science, they believe that even if Australia took action it wouldn't make any difference, so why should we do anything? We have very clearly the partnerships for the goals for it to actually come together. These things provide the framework about which we can put our debate, about which we can make our policies and how we can bring communities along with us, so it's not just Australia involved in this debate but that it's debated internationally.


I think there are things in the bill we've got before us that overstep the mark. In their enthusiasm, the people who drafted the bill have been caught up into debates that are not really clear. The bill is not carefully worded. Its full consequences can't be known. The bill states that the Commonwealth must not provide financial or other support in connection with the refurbishment of coal-fired power stations. What does that exactly mean? Does it include the processing of approvals and licences or other regulatory processes? Does it include public research funding through universities or the wonderful CSIRO into technologies that might be used in connection with a future coal-fired plant refurbishment to reduce carbon emissions? What about the carbon price?


Even though the Greens voted with the Abbott Liberal opposition against Labor's carbon pricing scheme in 2009, they claim that they do support a carbon price. You must know that a carbon price provides a financial incentive for the refurbishment of coal-fired power plants to lower their carbon emissions and carbon pollution. Would this bill that's saying that there shouldn't be any engagement in this way make a carbon price unlawful because it would provide other Commonwealth support for the refurbishment of coal-fired power plants? The bill says the Commonwealth must not assist the transfer of ownership of a coal-fired power station. How about the regulatory processes that may be triggered by a purely private transfer of ownership? Is this bill saying that the usual regulatory functions of government should not apply to coal-fired power stations, simply because of the emission intensity of coal power? In certain circumstances, that is exactly what this bill would seem to deliver. These questions need to be asked and they need to be answered. We can't just have a flat political statement that people don't like coal power stations. We need a legislative framework that will respond to the needs that we have. The wording and the drafting need to respond to the real questions.


We've heard much about where this debate should be, and we heard Senator Macdonald wax lyrical about the strong reactions of the government. A strong admiration and respect and love of coal, which led to people bringing lumps of coal into this place, seem to still be the dominant features of the Turnbull government's approach to renewables and coal. Labor fought in 2014 and 2015 to block the government's then attempts to get rid of the renewable energy targets, which are the key element of what we have in our current system about renewable energies and our process. We have put our policies into the public domain. People know there's a strong commitment from Labor to renewable energy but there is not the same trust, the same acceptance and the same knowledge that the government has that same commitment to an effective renewable energy future.


Recently, Senator Di Natale talked about the issues around the Liddell plant in his contribution to the debate in the Senate. Two large coal-fired power stations have closed, with the federal government refusing to help workers and the communities deal with the impacts. This refusal goes directly against the obligation of the governments to deliver a just transition under the Paris accords. This was the opportunity for governments across the world to sign up to the Paris accords for a future that would see a transition from a coal-determined process to one that looked openly at renewables. A part of that has got to be bringing the workers and the communities along with the decisions so that there is what we talk about very openly, a just transition. 


We know that industries across this country have been crippled by policy uncertainty and that the government have been key to delivering this uncertainty. You just know that no matter how many statements are made by this government about their commitment to renewables, there is this ongoing push within the government from certain individuals, who are very open in their views, that this will not happen, that somehow we in Australia have this special form of coal that is clean and that our clean coal doesn't need to be considered as the coal industry. In fact, as you know, Mr Acting Deputy President Fawcett, the government has made very clear that they believe clean coal should actually be considered as renewable energy.


Within this space, this means that industries—the very people on whom we rely to work towards effective scientific change and to bring innovative practices as per the Sustainable Development Goals about innovation and production and the very people upon whom we rely to develop our industries—are confused and, in fact, crippled by this uncertainty from government.


We know, and we've talked about it in this place before, the Finkel review. The government came to this place and suggested that they would have the Chief Scientist look at the whole issue of energy and our future. The Finkel review, on which $1.7 million was spent, then came up with recommendations and, after six months of these considerations, the government rejected much of what Finkel said. We had statements in this place calling for communities, scientists and people in this place to work together, to have a common aim and a common acceptance into the future, and the government said no. Instead of taking up the recommendations put out by Finkel, which had come through after many months of consultation all across the country—at Senate estimates we found out how many organisations and how many people with whom Professor Finkel spoke—we had the review and the recommendations, and then the government decided to take another road to the future. This was, obviously, one that was looking to a new future and that was looking very carefully at where we were going, and now we're concentrating on the National Energy Guarantee.


Again, we've talked many times in this place about the National Energy Guarantee. It came out as a very, very small document; one that could be easily read because there wasn't much in it. Now, as time goes by, and after the last round of Senate estimates, a bit more detail is being built around the National Energy Guarantee. But we've been able to find out that the scheme has been estimated to cut utility-scale renewable energy investment by a massive 95 per cent compared to today's level. Today, a report has been released which says that the NEG will deliver no additional renewable energy investment at all. If that is the result and if that is the planned future by this government, how can we be confident that we will see any just transition—a just transition to renewable energy, a just transition for workers and a just transition to security in our country? It just doesn't add up.


Labor continues to be committed to finding a cross-party framework to support the badly-needed investment to transition our energy sector and to deliver reliable and affordable energy. But we can't sign a blank cheque and we won't support a policy that strangles rather than supports transition to clean energy.


When it comes to the government's NEG or, indeed, to today's Greens bill, the real devil is in the detail. Neither the government nor the Greens bill have given enough thought to this or enough detail for us to be certain that they have an effective future for our country in their sights. That's why Labor won't support this bill and why we can't commit to a barely-thought-out NEG. We are interested in serious answers to the country's serious problems, and we just can't rely on short media grabs that talk one way or the other about what the magic result is going to be.


In Bangkok, in February this year, there was an international meeting based on the Sustainable Development Goals, looking at goal No. 7, which is the one around affordable and clean energy. This was an attempt to put a benchmark on what is happening across the world now. People from all over the world, people from all levels of industry, people who really understood not only the way energy should operate but the impact of energy on communities, came together at this meeting in Bangkok. This was a prelude to a further meeting which is going to take place in New York later this year where we will look clearly at an understanding that energy is inextricably interlinked with the whole sustainable development goal agenda, which is focused on poverty eradication.


Sustainable development goal No. 7 was the first ever universal goal on energy. A high-level political forum on sustainable development later this year will be considering SDG7 along with a range of other goals that look at what is happening on energy in our community. That forum will be occurring in New York. I'm really hopeful that Australia will be present at that meeting with information about what we have achieved—not short answers but clearly thought-out policy about how our nation is going to be part of the international response around the need for clean, safe energy for everybody, not just in Australia but around the world. This conference will be important. When Australia does go to that particular conference, I am truly hoping that we will not be having confusion about what our progress will be and lingering doubts among people across this chamber about whether there will be a renewable energy future. I am hopeful that we will be part of a global response so that we will be able to have respectful debates in this place but bring our community along behind us so that a just transition to renewable energy will occur in this place and across the communities and we won't be leaving anyone behind.


Debate adjourned.

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2018-03-19,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (10:06):  Right now we are witnessing the end of an era. The sun is setting on the coal empire and we are transitioning to a new future powered by renewable energy. It's an exciting future, but it's well past overdue.


The government has been doing everything it can to slow this country's transition to renewable energy, and Australians are bearing the brunt of their failure. In the last few days, we've seen bushfires savage Tathra, Bega and south-west Victoria. We've seen a cyclone hit Darwin. In Tathra, we heard this morning that 70 homes and other buildings have been destroyed. Four people were treated for smoke inhalation and one RFS volunteer was injured. By all accounts, we are very lucky that more people were not hurt.


In my home region of south-west Victoria, 18 homes have been destroyed around the towns of Terang, Garvoc, Camperdown and Gazette; 40,000 hectares have been burnt and farmers have lost their livestock. I know a bit about this part of the world because it's where I live. It's where my family lives and it's where my community is. In our everyday lives we are seeing climate change have an impact on the risk of bushfires to our communities, and we can't any longer be complacent about bushfires once the end of summer comes around. Right now we would normally be talking about the end of the bushfire season, and yet here we are with bushfires ravaging my home state and, indeed, my community.


In Western Australia they are now calling their autumn a 'second summer'. And on the other side of the country, in the Top End, Cyclone Marcus has rolled through Darwin and, according to forecasters, it was the strongest storm to hit Darwin in 30 years. The impact has closed schools, it's shut down the public service and cut off electricity to tens of thousands of people.


Of course, we know that it's not just Australia that is feeling the impact. To pick one of many disturbing recent events, the Arctic has just experienced an unprecedented heatwave, forcing scientists to reconsider even their most pessimistic forecasts of climate change. Temperatures in Siberia were as much as 35 degrees Celsius above historical averages. I'll say that again: 35 degrees above historical averages. Greenland experienced three times as many hours above freezing than usual. We are seeing extremes.


In spite of this overwhelming evidence of the impact of climate change, what we're seeing is a Turnbull government dangerously wedded to coal. It's pushing against the tide of clean energy and all the benefits that brings. As we transition to a renewable energy future, we'll no longer be contributing to dangerous global warming as we generate and use electricity. It is that simple. We can start making this transition now. The good news is it brings so many other benefits to our community. By moving away from coal and taking advantage of clean, green renewable energies, we won't be emitting toxic chemicals like mercury and sulphur dioxide anymore. These are the poisonous gases that our communities inhale when we mine and burn coal. We know that coal has serious health impacts. We know that it leads to respiratory disease, it leads to heart disease, it leads to the development of some cancers and it leads to low birth weight in babies. There are so many good reasons to move away from dirty, polluting coal to clean, renewable energy that are beyond the advantages we get when we move to cleaner sources of energy.


Of course, there is the question of reliability. We won't be relying on unreliable, old coal-fired power stations that don't do the job in extremes of hot weather. Let's look at the facts. We've heard a lot questions about South Australia, but let's look at the facts of what happened this summer. During heatwaves in New South Wales last year, Liddell Power Station was unable to perform because two of its generator units failed to switch on due to unforeseen boiler tube leaks. On New Year's Day, Millmerran Power Station in Queensland stalled. One of the coal-fired power stations there stalled, taking out 156 megawatts from the National Electricity Market. In January, one of the four units of Victoria's Loy Yang A Power Station broke down, taking out another 230 megawatts. We could go on and on, but suffice to say we know that coal-fired power stations can't be relied upon to deliver power in extremes of weather.


These are old stations, well past their use-by date, and we know that it is now cheaper to build a new solar farm or more wind turbines than it is to build a new coal-fired power station. For years we've heard from the Turnbull and Abbott governments about the dangers of so-called intermittent renewable energy. They deceitfully blamed power outages in South Australia on renewables after wild storms, when the real cause of the blackout was downed poles and wires. It was a problem with transmission, not generation. That's just one of the many examples of the Liberal and National parties' denialist anti-renewable energy ideology. It also saw them spend obscene amounts of taxpayer dollars on the National Wind Farm Commissioner, for example, to listen to a range of debunked claims about the medical impacts, amongst other things, of wind farms. Imagine if that money had been spent in more renewable energy generation.


Of course, disappointingly for the government and their cabal of deniers, we know that when coal-fired power stations fail, it's not other coal stations that come to the rescue; it is renewable energy that manages to bridge the gap. When Loy Yang shut down without warning on 14 December last year, taking out 560 megawatts and putting the whole electricity network in danger, it was South Australia's big new Tesla battery that sprang into action to help save the day. It is renewable energy that is meeting the shortfall that occurs when coal-fired power no longer operates.


We also know that the coal industry is in structural decline. No-one in the private sector is building new coal-fired power stations anymore. It does not stack up economically in this day and age. We know the environment arguments are clear, but so too are the economic arguments. No-one is interested in investing billions of dollars into a giant coal-fired power station that we won't want to switch on in a few years' time. No-one wants to do it. No-one is interested in sinking capital investment into an ageing technology when the cost of renewables is plummeting. Investing in coal is about as sensible as investing in dial-up internet: there is no argument for it and the technology has moved ahead of it. Yet we have this government desperately clinging to the past—to the electricity equivalent of fax machines and typewriters.


We've seen our Treasurer wave coal around in parliament in a desperate bid to try and make it more popular. We've seen the minister for trade and also the then minister for resources, Barnaby Joyce, spruik Adani's dirty, great big coalmine to Chinese financiers. Most recently, we saw the returned minister for resources, Senator Canavan, talking about how Australia's coal is more beautiful than Donald Trump's coal. What sort of competition is that? It's not one we want to be part of. It doesn't get more farcical than what we've seen played out on the floor of this parliament over recent years.


The cost of renewables is plummeting. That's a good news story and something we should be embracing. If the Turnbull government had any vision, it would be positioning Australia to take advantage of this energy revolution that is sweeping across the rest of the world. We have so many natural advantages here. We live in one of the sunniest, windiest places in the world. We have abundant space. We have the technological expertise. We could be leading the charge, but instead we are an international laggard dragging our heels behind so much of the developed world.


Last year I thought we'd hit rock bottom when we saw the Prime Minister pressuring a private company, AGL, into prolonging the life of that decrepit, old coal-clunker Liddell. Liddell is something that's more at home in 1960s Soviet Russia than it is in a modern 21st century economy. Liddell is falling apart. It's hanging together with spit and string. AGL knows that it's a dud investment. It doesn't want to throw good money after bad in keeping it open. The company itself has said that it would have to invest nearly a billion dollars to keep it open for an extra five years, which would push up the cost of its output to around $106 per megawatt hour. This is the market responding to a Prime Minister who wants us to turn the clock back.


AGL now has a plan to replace Liddell with 1.6 gigawatts of renewables, plus storage and a range of other technologies, yet the Turnbull government and its state cronies are talking about dipping into the public purse to help Liddell stay open for another few years. It should be illegal to use public money in this way. Taxpayer dollars—dollars that belong to everybody—should be spent on investing in the things that we know are the foundations of a decent society: public health care and hospitals; public education and schools; and science and research. It should be spent on doing something about the growing gap between the rich and poor—reducing inequality—and ensuring everybody gets access to a social safety net and a decent education. We should be spending our hard-earned dollars on securing a long-term energy future that's based in renewables. We should be investing in the public interest, not on a handout that will burn our planet and make climate change worse. That's why it should be illegal.


The Coal-Fired Power Funding Prohibition Bill 2017 prohibits the Commonwealth from providing financial support to refurbish, or indeed to build, a coal-fired power station. It also prevents the Commonwealth from purchasing or assisting with the purchase or transfer of ownership of a coal-fired power station. The bill does make sure that the government can provide public money to transition affected workers into new industries and that it can use public money to manage the closure of a coal-fired power station. This is a transition that is happening and that will happen, despite this government trying to slow it down.


We have a choice. We can look after those workers in those industries and manage this transition in a way that ensures that their future is looked after as well, or we can leave them to the vagaries of the market, not manage the transition, and see workers left on the scrap heap. It is the Greens that want a just transition.


We know that no major financial institution wants to fund coal. Our experience with the Adani coalmine has made that abundantly clear. They simply can't find the finance.


The Turnbull government needs to listen to the science, listen to what the economics are telling us and listen to what the rest of the world is saying. Coal is obsolete; it has no long-term future, and we need to invest in those things that do.


Of course, we still don't know where the ALP sits on this issue. We certainly know where the Liberal and National parties do; we know that, for them, it's coal all the way. But we know that the Labor Party is also beholden to those vested interests in the fossil fuel industry—it takes major donations from the fossil fuel industry. We know that there's a revolving door between the parliament, for former members—Liberal, National and Labor—and their staffers, and big coal. That revolving door between parliament and the coal industry has never swung faster.


Well, we have a plan. We want Australia to run on 100 per cent renewable energy. We're proud of that fact. We have a plan to transition workers from coal communities into the jobs of the future. We want to ensure that people are looked after. We will re-regulate electricity prices to bring costs down and provide much-needed relief to Australian families.


I urge all members of this place—and, in particular, the ALP and the crossbench—to show some courage in supporting this bill. This is our opportunity to stake what it means to have a long-term future for future generations. This is our opportunity to say: 'The past is the past, and we understand what a 21st-century modern economy looks like. It's one that's powered by renewable energy. It's one that looks after people. It's one that ensures that, in any transition, no matter how difficult, those workers are looked after.' This is an opportunity for the Labor Party and the crossbench to take a stand against the dangerous Turnbull government's obsession with coal, and to ensure that we lay out a clear path for this nation.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2018-03-19,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (10:22):  The Greens political party have been called many things, but, clearly, they are now a party in denial. If ever you'd wanted to know why the voters of Tasmania and South Australia and Batman have at last turned against the Greens, you've had a classic example now, with that speech of denial from the current Greens leader in the Senate. Fifteen years ago, when the Greens parties in Europe started to fail, I predicted then that the Greens political party in Australia would, not long after, follow suit. Following the result, even in Tasmania, can I say, and then even in South Australia, which used to be the Greens heartland at one stage, and now of course in Batman, the voters of Australia have eventually woken up to the hypocrisy and fraud of the Greens political party.


Let me start by asking Senator Di Natale, or any of the Greens speakers who might speak in this debate, this question I always ask and can never get an answer to from the Greens. According to the Greens, Australia's emissions of carbon are what's causing global climate change. I repeat that. This is the Greens' claim, and you've just heard Senator Di Natale say that: what Australia emits in carbon is why the world's climate is changing. It is an incontestable fact that Australia emits less than 1.4 per cent of the world's carbon emissions. You can shut Australia down completely, stop our emissions totally, which in world figures is 1.4 per cent, but what impact will that have on the changing climate of the world? Don't listen to my answer; listen to the answer of Australia's Chief Scientist who, when asked that question, said, 'virtually none.' Yet Senator Di Natale has spent 20 minutes trying to confuse the dwindling band of supporters of the Greens political party that somehow it's Australia's fault, and if we open up the Adani coalmine that is going to cause greater cyclones, huge floods and snow storms around the world. The Greens are completely hypocritical, and completely fraudulent, when it comes to this debate.


Even Senator Di Natale started off by saying the storm in Darwin is the biggest storm ever for the last 30 years, and that's the same with everything. The floods in Brisbane a few years ago were the biggest floods in Queensland since 1927. Cyclone Yasi was the biggest cyclone ever to hit Australia since 1918. These events have happened before, they will happen in the future, and nothing Senator Di Natale says will change that.


I ask Senator Di Natale to tell me how you and your Labor Party mates—well, you used to be mates—think by doing something in Australia we're going to stop world climate change? I'm fascinated to hear how, with 1.4 per cent of emissions, something we do in Australia is going to save the world. It is just nonsensical. It's a question I keep asking and no-one from the Greens political party has ever even attempted to answer the question on how Australia, which emits less than 1.4 per cent of the world's emissions of carbon, can possibly have any effect on the changing climate. Sure, when the rest of the world—the other 98.5 per cent of emitters—reduce their carbon emissions, then Australia should do something as well. But until then why are we destroying Australian jobs—the jobs of Australian workers? I used to think the CFMEU and the Labor Party were interested in them, but they are clearly not anymore. They go for the Greens' ideology, and I hope after Batman the Labor Party will at last realise that the Greens' message is failing and failing rapidly.


Please can someone from the Greens political party or the Labor Party, who seem to subscribe to this foolish fantasy, tell me how Australia, which emits less than 1.4 per cent of the world's carbon emissions, is affecting world climate change?


Senator Di Natale says renewables are the way to go. Certainly the government's position is that it is technology neutral for investment in the energy sector, and we've introduced legislation to remove the prohibition on the Clean Energy Finance Corporation from providing finance to carbon capture and storage projects.


I will point out to the Senate, and anyone who might be listening to this, that in all the world agreements on reduction in emissions Australia is one of the few countries in the world that has actually met all of its targets. It's done it mainly under Liberal governments by cleverly managing the economy, but not destroying jobs, and particularly not destroying the futures of other countries. Senator Di Natale rails in one breath against the Indian company Adani—there seems to be a bit of a racial tone to the accusations against Adani—and then in the next breath he will say how the Greens political party is always looking after those poor people around the world. Yet here is the chance for the poor people in India to get the electricity that Senator Di Natale has been using for the last 50 years —I might say it is coal-fired power electricity. Why do we deprive the poor people of India of that opportunity? And that's what the Adani project is all about.


We have unlimited reserves of high-quality, low-emission black coal in the Central Queensland area, where I come from, which is there to be exported to India, to establish new coal-fired power stations, to give the people of India the very limited luxury of electricity, which they don't have now. Senator Di Natale and the Greens would deny the Indian people this opportunity. The Indian people will get coal-fired power stations because they need it for their country to progress, but they'll get dirty coal from Indonesia and other places. They could get coal from Australia—a cleaner power, a cleaner coal—and that would bring jobs to Australians and help the Indian people. Yet, the Greens will never answer my question. I challenge anyone to come back to me in the hundreds of times I've asked this question in this chamber: how is it that Australia, which emits less than 1.4 per cent of the carbon emissions of the world, is going to affect climate change? I know I'm repeating myself, but I will keep saying this until the people of Australia—all of them—understand that it is not Australia's doing. Australia emits less than 1.4 per cent, and even the most revered scientist in the world—Australia's Chief Scientist—in Hansard in answer to my question: 'What impact would it have if we reduce Australia's emissions by 1.4 per cent?', answered: 'Virtually none.' This just shows the fraud and hypocrisy of the Greens political party and the voters of Australia are at last waking up.


Senator Di Natale talks about clean, green renewables. We all like that but, of course, when the sun stops shining and the wind stops blowing, how do we get power? The South Australian former government, the Labor government, had a great idea. They were going to turn on all these diesel fired generators, hundreds of diesel fired generators polluting the Australian atmosphere. It just shows the absolute hypocrisy and stupidity of the argument of the Greens political party and, I might say, their mates in the Labor Party on this. Sure, you have to have a mix, and under the Turnbull government we are getting that mix. We are encouraging renewables where they work and we are encouraging other forms of energy.


I know I'm old, but I remember the time when Australia's main competitive advantage in this world was that we had cheap power, because we are blessed with high-quality coal. It was that cheap power that in the fifties and sixties burst Australia to the head of the world economies. Now, unfortunately, because of the actions of the Labor Party, I have to say, more than the Greens political party, that is coming into difficulty. Senator Di Natale says Adani can't get money for their project. I don't know how he knows that—quite frankly, I don't either—but I suspect they do have the money. But why would you invest in any project in Australia? One government, the Liberal government in Canberra, and the Labor government in Queensland have said: 'Yes, this coal project in Central Queensland can go ahead, providing all these environmental conditions are met. it provides jobs for Indigenous people there. Yes, it can all go ahead.' So you invest your money and start the project on the basis of approvals given by the state Labor government and the federal Liberal government, and then Mr Shorten, to win votes in Batman, comes along and says, more or less: 'It doesn't matter what's happened in the past. If you invest your money, I'm going to introduce federal legislation to stop it.'


Why would you invest in a project when you have a government—an alternative government, I might say—saying to the world, 'It doesn't matter what the current governments, including the Labor one in Queensland, say; if I get into power I'm going to stop Adani, after they've invested all this money.' If you ever wanted a way of chasing investment in all of its forms away from Australia, you only have to look at Mr Shorten's stupidity in the recent Batman by-election. He was so keen to win that seat from the Greens that he just said anything that he thought might attract a few of the loony Greens voters over to his party, and he succeeded in that.


But in doing that, what's he done to the workers—the coal workers and the mining workers of Queensland, the state that I represent, the people up my way? The people of Townsville are looking to the Adani project, a project of billions and billions of dollars, to kickstart the economy of the Townsville region and the North and to provide literally thousands of jobs for CFMEU members—well, people who would be CFMEU members, although we know the statistics: the number of people joining unions these days has plummeted to nine per cent of the private workforce; only nine per cent join the unions. Why? Because the union they thought was looking after them—the construction, mining and forestry union—has sided with Labor and the Greens to deny them jobs in the mines, for no purpose. As I've demonstrated, it's not going to make one iota of difference to climate change. All it does is send Australia's jobs offshore and make our energy bill much higher than it should be.


The hypocrisy and lack of truth and rigor in the Greens' speech is demonstrated by Senator Di Natale's comment that 'No-one's building coal-fired power stations these days.' Well, sorry: in China there's about one new coal-fired power station built every week. And in India there are coal-fired power stations being built all the time. Even in Germany these days there is a new interest in coal-fired power stations. Why? Because with carbon capture and storage, with these new HELE plants, you can have the benefits of coal and affordable energy at the same time as grabbing particulates and other elements from coal that aren't as useful to the world as they should be. So, again, you've got to understand that the Greens are in denial. After the last awful couple of weeks that they've had, I can well understand that. But clearly the Australian voters have woken up to the hypocrisy, the stupidity and the outright lies of the Greens political party and have deserted the Greens in droves.


A lot of very positive action has been taken by the Turnbull government, and all credit to Mr Josh Frydenberg, the energy and environment minister, and Matt Canavan, the resources minister, led by our Prime Minister. We are taking a balanced and sensible look at Australia's energy needs. Under the Greens political party, now supported by the Australian Labor Party, power prices for ordinary Australians are skyrocketing through the roof. Yet we have this unlimited supply of high-quality coal in central Queensland, near where I live, which is readily available to give Australia that competitive advantage that it had in years gone by.


I know I'm being repetitive, but I want to again demonstrate this. I want to ask anybody from the Labor Party or the Greens political party to tell me how anything we do in Australia, which emits less than 1.4 per cent of the world's carbon emissions, is going to affect the changing climate of the world, assuming, as I do, that carbon emissions do have some impact on climate change—although I acknowledge I'm not one who gets into this debate, because I am not a scientist and I don't understand it, but I do know that equally qualified scientists have very divergent views on this same subject. But even accepting that carbon emissions have an impact on climate change, I asked this question of the Greens political party. I must have a look in Hansard, because I think I've asked this same question 100 times and, would you believe, never once has there been an answer. You don't have to be terribly bright—and I'm not terribly bright—you just need to have a little bit of common sense: Australia emits less than 1.4 per cent of the world's carbon emissions and, according to the Chief Scientist, even if we stop that completely—that is, shut down every car, turn off every light and stop any use of Australia's principal source of energy, which is coal-fired power—it would have, to quote the Chief Scientist, 'virtually no' impact on the changing climate of the world.


Do I think that perhaps today, after the flogging the Greens have received in the ballot box in the last few weeks, I will get an answer to that question? I suspect not. The Greens will continue in denial of the facts, of the truth of these matters, of the absolute common sense. The Greens want to reduce Australia's emissions by 50 or 80 per cent—I don't know what it is—but even if you reduce it by 100 per cent not one iota of difference would it make to the changing climate of this world.


This bill, which seeks to prohibit forever investment in coal-fired power stations, is just another loony lefty creation of a party not only in great denial but in steep decline in voter support. I'm delighted to say that my fellow Australians have eventually woken up to the hypocrisy, the lack of truth, the outright lies of the Greens political party and I am sure that they, like a lot of their theories, will be confined to the dustbin of history, and the sooner that happens, the better for Australia.

Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (10:42):  I feel as though I've heard this debate many times and I think we'll find some of the allegations and cross-allegations listed in Hansard over and over again over at least the last 10 years. Labor has long recognised that Australia needs to transition to clean forms of electricity generation. Our ministers in previous governments Greg Combet and Tony Burke, and now the shadow minister, Mr Mark Butler in the other place, have argued consistently that we do need to have a strong commitment to renewable energy. We have a strong set of policies, which are all on the record, which talk about why we need to have a commitment to achieve 50 per cent renewable energy by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2050. That's consistent with the commitments and statements we made under the Paris accord. That is clear. We understand that we have to move energy production in this country. We need to work with community, with science, and with people in this place to ensure we don't have statements like we just heard, which completely debunk any kind of positive discussion or argument about how we can make this change.


We recognise the importance of ensuring this transition is a just one. We talk so much about the fact that we need to work with communities—particularly the communities that Senator Macdonald I think referred to in his contribution—that have been relying on the coal industry for over a century. You cannot make decisions about our community without engaging with them and ensuring that we have a just transition. We won't let coal power workers and communities be left behind, as we, a parliament, a government, actually tackle climate change. The inevitability of this transition is recognised. Finally, I think, we can say together that the inevitability of the transition is recognised by the energy industry and, as a result, the planned and managed phase-out of coal-fired power is something the industry accepts and includes in its forward plans. The head of the Australian Energy Council, Mr Matthew Warren, has previously said that new coal-fired power stations in Australia are 'uninvestable', a view held widely by companies and put about clearly in the finance sector. Put simply, the debate about what Australia's energy future looks like has really been won not in this place but in corporate boardrooms and communities across Australia.


Australia's energy future is one that is increasingly renewable, increasingly flexible, increasingly distributed and increasingly high tech. We are never going to go back to the old 20th century model of a central coal plant and passive customers; even if we try to put our climate change obligations to one side, which I believe I've heard debated in this place, we mustn't, we shouldn't and we won't. The fact is that renewable energy is the cheapest form of new electricity generation, and storage and energy management technologies are seeing advances and cost reductions that mean a reliable, affordable renewable energy system is well within Australia's grasp.


The current debate about energy policy isn't about a coal-fired future versus a renewables future. Though I believe that debate will continue to happen in this place, that is not the real debate. We must have a renewables future. The real debate is really about a well-managed transition versus a transition that is chaotic and costly, which is what the approach of the Turnbull government is delivering.


That does not mean that Labor are supporting the bill that's before this place this morning, the Coal-Fired Power Funding Prohibition Bill 2017. We don't believe that it's a sensible bill. We don't believe that it actually engages in the debate we need to have. The debate we should be having in this place includes the questions: how can the transition to clean energy be best managed? What policy framework best delivers a clean energy future whilst safeguarding reliability and affordability—that is, not denying that affordability and reliability can occur but actually safeguarding reliability and affordability? What must governments, at every level, do to ensure coal power workers and their communities see and are part of a bright and prosperous future? How can we ensure that renters and those in community and social housing can access the benefits of solar and battery systems?


We must also talk, in this place and in our communities, about how we are going to be part of the ongoing international discussion that is clearly outlined in the sustainable development goals—the sustainable development goals that our nation, with many others, signed on to with great protestations of faith two years ago. At least four of these goals are a core part of this debate and what we should be talking about in this place. We have goal 7: affordable and clean energy. That's what this debate is about—affordability and clean energy. It's also about industry, innovation and infrastructure: working with the people who have the skills, the ability and the finance to make sure we have the infrastructure, the innovation and the science that will ensure we have the strong, clean renewable energy future we must have. We must also talk about sustainable cities and communities—that is, ensuring strong, secure and effective energy processes so that people are not struggling, on a daily basis, with energy costs. We also need to have responsible consumption and production. Nothing is more central to this debate than responsible consumption and production—again, understanding the importance and the essential nature of energy in our community.


Goal 13 is climate action. I do believe that any debate about whether there is a link between carbon emissions and climate action should be over, though every now and then you hear echoes in this place about whether it is still open for debate. We know that there are people in the parliament that will continue to deny, continue to say that there is no link. Even if they don't understand the science, they believe that even if Australia took action it wouldn't make any difference, so why should we do anything? We have very clearly the partnerships for the goals for it to actually come together. These things provide the framework about which we can put our debate, about which we can make our policies and how we can bring communities along with us, so it's not just Australia involved in this debate but that it's debated internationally.


I think there are things in the bill we've got before us that overstep the mark. In their enthusiasm, the people who drafted the bill have been caught up into debates that are not really clear. The bill is not carefully worded. Its full consequences can't be known. The bill states that the Commonwealth must not provide financial or other support in connection with the refurbishment of coal-fired power stations. What does that exactly mean? Does it include the processing of approvals and licences or other regulatory processes? Does it include public research funding through universities or the wonderful CSIRO into technologies that might be used in connection with a future coal-fired plant refurbishment to reduce carbon emissions? What about the carbon price?


Even though the Greens voted with the Abbott Liberal opposition against Labor's carbon pricing scheme in 2009, they claim that they do support a carbon price. You must know that a carbon price provides a financial incentive for the refurbishment of coal-fired power plants to lower their carbon emissions and carbon pollution. Would this bill that's saying that there shouldn't be any engagement in this way make a carbon price unlawful because it would provide other Commonwealth support for the refurbishment of coal-fired power plants? The bill says the Commonwealth must not assist the transfer of ownership of a coal-fired power station. How about the regulatory processes that may be triggered by a purely private transfer of ownership? Is this bill saying that the usual regulatory functions of government should not apply to coal-fired power stations, simply because of the emission intensity of coal power? In certain circumstances, that is exactly what this bill would seem to deliver. These questions need to be asked and they need to be answered. We can't just have a flat political statement that people don't like coal power stations. We need a legislative framework that will respond to the needs that we have. The wording and the drafting need to respond to the real questions.


We've heard much about where this debate should be, and we heard Senator Macdonald wax lyrical about the strong reactions of the government. A strong admiration and respect and love of coal, which led to people bringing lumps of coal into this place, seem to still be the dominant features of the Turnbull government's approach to renewables and coal. Labor fought in 2014 and 2015 to block the government's then attempts to get rid of the renewable energy targets, which are the key element of what we have in our current system about renewable energies and our process. We have put our policies into the public domain. People know there's a strong commitment from Labor to renewable energy but there is not the same trust, the same acceptance and the same knowledge that the government has that same commitment to an effective renewable energy future.


Recently, Senator Di Natale talked about the issues around the Liddell plant in his contribution to the debate in the Senate. Two large coal-fired power stations have closed, with the federal government refusing to help workers and the communities deal with the impacts. This refusal goes directly against the obligation of the governments to deliver a just transition under the Paris accords. This was the opportunity for governments across the world to sign up to the Paris accords for a future that would see a transition from a coal-determined process to one that looked openly at renewables. A part of that has got to be bringing the workers and the communities along with the decisions so that there is what we talk about very openly, a just transition. 


We know that industries across this country have been crippled by policy uncertainty and that the government have been key to delivering this uncertainty. You just know that no matter how many statements are made by this government about their commitment to renewables, there is this ongoing push within the government from certain individuals, who are very open in their views, that this will not happen, that somehow we in Australia have this special form of coal that is clean and that our clean coal doesn't need to be considered as the coal industry. In fact, as you know, Mr Acting Deputy President Fawcett, the government has made very clear that they believe clean coal should actually be considered as renewable energy.


Within this space, this means that industries—the very people on whom we rely to work towards effective scientific change and to bring innovative practices as per the Sustainable Development Goals about innovation and production and the very people upon whom we rely to develop our industries—are confused and, in fact, crippled by this uncertainty from government.


We know, and we've talked about it in this place before, the Finkel review. The government came to this place and suggested that they would have the Chief Scientist look at the whole issue of energy and our future. The Finkel review, on which $1.7 million was spent, then came up with recommendations and, after six months of these considerations, the government rejected much of what Finkel said. We had statements in this place calling for communities, scientists and people in this place to work together, to have a common aim and a common acceptance into the future, and the government said no. Instead of taking up the recommendations put out by Finkel, which had come through after many months of consultation all across the country—at Senate estimates we found out how many organisations and how many people with whom Professor Finkel spoke—we had the review and the recommendations, and then the government decided to take another road to the future. This was, obviously, one that was looking to a new future and that was looking very carefully at where we were going, and now we're concentrating on the National Energy Guarantee.


Again, we've talked many times in this place about the National Energy Guarantee. It came out as a very, very small document; one that could be easily read because there wasn't much in it. Now, as time goes by, and after the last round of Senate estimates, a bit more detail is being built around the National Energy Guarantee. But we've been able to find out that the scheme has been estimated to cut utility-scale renewable energy investment by a massive 95 per cent compared to today's level. Today, a report has been released which says that the NEG will deliver no additional renewable energy investment at all. If that is the result and if that is the planned future by this government, how can we be confident that we will see any just transition—a just transition to renewable energy, a just transition for workers and a just transition to security in our country? It just doesn't add up.


Labor continues to be committed to finding a cross-party framework to support the badly-needed investment to transition our energy sector and to deliver reliable and affordable energy. But we can't sign a blank cheque and we won't support a policy that strangles rather than supports transition to clean energy.


When it comes to the government's NEG or, indeed, to today's Greens bill, the real devil is in the detail. Neither the government nor the Greens bill have given enough thought to this or enough detail for us to be certain that they have an effective future for our country in their sights. That's why Labor won't support this bill and why we can't commit to a barely-thought-out NEG. We are interested in serious answers to the country's serious problems, and we just can't rely on short media grabs that talk one way or the other about what the magic result is going to be.


In Bangkok, in February this year, there was an international meeting based on the Sustainable Development Goals, looking at goal No. 7, which is the one around affordable and clean energy. This was an attempt to put a benchmark on what is happening across the world now. People from all over the world, people from all levels of industry, people who really understood not only the way energy should operate but the impact of energy on communities, came together at this meeting in Bangkok. This was a prelude to a further meeting which is going to take place in New York later this year where we will look clearly at an understanding that energy is inextricably interlinked with the whole sustainable development goal agenda, which is focused on poverty eradication.


Sustainable development goal No. 7 was the first ever universal goal on energy. A high-level political forum on sustainable development later this year will be considering SDG7 along with a range of other goals that look at what is happening on energy in our community. That forum will be occurring in New York. I'm really hopeful that Australia will be present at that meeting with information about what we have achieved—not short answers but clearly thought-out policy about how our nation is going to be part of the international response around the need for clean, safe energy for everybody, not just in Australia but around the world. This conference will be important. When Australia does go to that particular conference, I am truly hoping that we will not be having confusion about what our progress will be and lingering doubts among people across this chamber about whether there will be a renewable energy future. I am hopeful that we will be part of a global response so that we will be able to have respectful debates in this place but bring our community along behind us so that a just transition to renewable energy will occur in this place and across the communities and we won't be leaving anyone behind.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister for Finance, Special Minister of State and Vice-President of the Executive Council) (14:00):  I seek leave to make a short statement on the bushfires that have ravaged New South Wales and Victoria this past weekend and on the impact of Cyclone Marcus on the Northern Territory.


Leave granted.




Senator CORMANN:
  I thank the Senate. As Australians we know we live in a country whose landscape is unpredictable and where nature can bring us as much misery as it does joy. Sadly, this past weekend many of our fellow Australians have experienced that misery firsthand. Devastating bushfires have ravaged both Tathra on the South Coast of New South Wales and the Barwon South West district of Victoria. It is being reported that at least 88 homes have been destroyed, mainly in Tathra, but there remains the horrible prospect that there will be more, once we know the full scale of the disaster. Thankfully, there are no reports that lives have been lost, and I urge everyone in or near the bushfire areas to pay close attention to the advice of local authorities, to keep themselves as safe as possible.


Of course, our first concern is for the safety and needs of the people directly affected by these fires, especially those whose homes have been lost or damaged and the people who have been evacuated. The Australian government remains in contact with the New South Wales and Victorian governments and stands ready to provide any assistance requested to support these communities.


Australia's emergency services are the best in the world, and, on behalf of the local communities hit by these terrible fires and all Australians, I express my heartfelt thanks to all the emergency service workers and volunteers who worked so tirelessly over the weekend and continue to do so.


I also thank the men and women of the Australian Defence Force who are already providing clean-up assistance in the Northern Territory after Cyclone Marcus hit Darwin and the Territory on Saturday. Again, the Australian government stands ready to provide any further assistance requested to support these communities, and I'm sure all of the people of Australia join me in expressing our sorrow for those hardest hit by these natural disasters and our hope that those in the affected areas continue to be safe.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (14:02):  by leave—I thank Senator Cormann for his words and for the opportunity for the opposition to speak also today about terrible events that are, sadly, too familiar in this country. Perhaps few weekends more graphically illustrate that famous descriptor of Dorothea Mackellar's, of our land being one of beauty and terror and flood and fire. At one end of the country, we saw Cyclone Marcus, which swept through Darwin and the Kimberley; at the other end, terrible fires destroyed homes, farms and businesses in Victoria and at Tathra on the New South Wales South Coast.


It is good that there have been no deaths, only minor injuries, which, given the scale of these disasters, is extremely fortunate but also a tribute to the extraordinary skill and bravery of our emergency services workers and volunteers. Many homes and businesses stand today only because of their dedication and sacrifice, and we once again stand in their debt—the many thousands of people who consistently give up their time and risk their lives to help their fellow Australians at these times.


The damage from Cyclone Marcus is mostly confined to power damage and trees down. However, sadly, in the bushfire areas, it is a different story. In Tathra, more than 70 homes and businesses have been destroyed by a fire that came so quickly and with such force that many of those who fled had no time to do anything other than escape with their lives. It's a beautiful town, beloved as a holiday destination, and the damage and loss will be felt by many who have fond memories of time spent at the famous Tathra pub, on the wharf or just relaxing at the beach.


A short time before question time, I spoke to Mike Kelly, the local member for Eden-Monaro, who asked me to express three points in this contribution. Obviously, one is that there are many properties destroyed and damaged, and the assessment is still underway. He asked me to particularly pass on the thanks of the community to the very brave helicopter pilots who continued to engage in water bombing of the fire, in extremely difficult circumstances, as it approached the town. Finally, being a good fundraiser, he wanted me to make sure everybody knows there is a donation fund and to ask if we could please all contribute.


No less devastating, of course, are the losses in the south-western part of Victoria near Warrnambool, where at least 18 homes and businesses have been destroyed, along with a huge number of livestock, which will take a terrible toll on the farmers concerned.


In the face of this sort of loss and shock, we offer our words of comfort and our expressions of solidarity, but, of course, more is always needed. Government and communities are stepping forward in providing financial and emotional support. I thank my colleagues in New South Wales and Victoria for their quick response with financial and material aid and their pledges to ensure that the towns, farms and communities are not forgotten when these fires are out. Federal Labor stands ready to assist this government and the community in whatever way we can.

Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (14:06):  by leave—On behalf of the Australian Greens, I would also like to express our sympathies for those people affected in the fires that have ravaged Tathra, Bega and south-west Victoria, along with people impacted by the cyclone that's recently hit Darwin.


The fires in south-west Victoria are in part of my home patch. This isn't far away from where my family live. Every time I pack up my bags and come to Canberra during summer, we know that there's a risk that I'm leaving my family in a situation that many of our neighbours are now facing. We've seen 18 homes destroyed around the towns of Terang, Garvoc, Camperdown and Gazette; 40,000 hectares burnt; a lot of livestock lost; and farmers who are now seriously suffering.


We heard this morning that in Tathra 70 homes and other buildings have been destroyed. Four people have been treated for smoke inhalation. We have seen a volunteer injured. And, by all accounts, we're extremely lucky that there have not been more casualties.


As we've heard, on the other side of the country, in the Top End, Cyclone Marcus has rolled through Darwin and, luckily, while the impact has resulted in schools being closed, some services being shut and electricity being lost, there are no major casualties as a result of that cyclone.


I want to commend all of those people in their local communities who have been affected by these disasters and who have rallied together to help each other. It's always, I think, interesting that when we're faced with adversity like this we see the best in people. We see people rallying together, helping their neighbours, ensuring that they're safe and, quite literally, giving them the shirt off their back. I want to pay tribute to the emergency service workers, many of whom are still working tirelessly to get fires under control, and those people in the Northern Territory who are cleaning up after Cyclone Marcus.


On behalf of the Australian Greens, once again, I'd like to express my sympathies to people who have lost property and people who have suffered hardship, including the farmers who have lost their livestock. We give thanks that, at this stage, we have not seen any serious casualties.

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (14:10):  by leave—On behalf of the Nationals I join with the Leader of the Government, Leader of the Opposition in the Senate and leaders of other parties in this place to acknowledge the natural disasters currently impacting upon many parts of our country. The bushfires have devastated a number of communities and have resulted in the destruction of schools and property around Victoria as well as the New South Wales coast. We should reflect for a minute that these are very small communities. Almost no-one who lives in these communities is not known to everyone else, along with their houses and properties. These events have a huge impact on small communities. I take this opportunity to add my tribute to the remarkable fire crews of the CFA in Victoria and the fire crews who work round the clock in New South Wales.


As a senator for the Northern Territory I also acknowledge the impact Tropical Cyclone Marcus has had and continues to have on residents of Darwin, Palmerston, Coolalinga, Batchelor, Litchfield, the Tiwi Islands and a number of communities right across the Cobourg Peninsula. At its peak Tropical Cyclone Marcus was categorised as a category 2 system. The eye of the cyclone passed over the Darwin region, with winds in excess of 164 kilometres per hour, which caused power outages across Darwin and brought down trees, blocking roads. My latest advice is that Tropical Cyclone Marcus is now moving towards the north-west Kimberley. As you can imagine, the tropical cyclone has left behind a path of destruction in the Greater Darwin region. Hundreds—in fact, probably thousands—of trees have fallen, and many power lines have been downed. There have been widespread power outages. Power has now been restored to 11,000 customers, but 18,000 remain without power, including the majority of the schools in the Darwin area. I'm advised that around half of Darwin's traffic lights still remain out, so we urge caution on the roads. Until further notice I understand that there's some advice about boiling water, due to the damage to the water infrastructure.


I acknowledge the Australian Department of Defence has also provided some emergency clean-up assistance immediately. On behalf of the Northern Territory and Darwin, please pass on my thanks to those Defence personnel. It's a very difficult time. I urge all Territorians to be patient and calm as authorities coordinate the clean-up effort. I encourage everyone to give each other a hand. As Senator Di Natale has indicated, it is wonderful that, in the worst of circumstances, the best of people come out. I acknowledge and thank the Northern Territory police, fire, ambulance and other emergency service personnel, as well as all the volunteers that have come out of the woodwork, for their work at this difficult time. It is such a huge relief that we've experienced no loss of life as a result of any of these disasters so far. I implore everyone to heed the advice of the authorities, and apart from that, go to the ABC. People can keep up to date with the latest advice from the Northern Territory government, Emergency Management Victoria and Emergency New South Wales websites.

"Ketter, Sen Christopher",ALP,2018-03-19,"



Senator KETTER
 (Queensland—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:17):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Finance (Senator Cormann) to questions without notice asked by Senator Keneally and the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Wong) today relating to taxation and dividend imputation.


It's quite clear that, when Labor puts forward responsible, principled, well-considered proposals for tax reform, the only response from those opposite is hysterical claims which, once again, bring down the quality of our national debate. For those people listening to this session today, there need to be a number of facts put on the table, because one would be forgiven for thinking that the sky was going to fall in relation to Labor's changes to the dividend imputation. It is clear that nothing could be further from the truth. Under Labor's plan, no-one will pay a single cent more in tax, no-one will lose a single cent from their super contributions, no-one will lose a single cent from their pension and no-one will lose a single cent from their share dividends. It's also important to note, for those listening, that none of the changes that Labor is proposing are retrospective. If Labor were elected, they would apply from 1 July 2019 under the announced policy.


I was quite gobsmacked yesterday when I was listening to the Insiders program on the ABC to hear Ms Bishop, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, saying in an offhanded comment that Labor's proposals were going to take away the savings of pensioners. That is just straight out misleading for Australians and causes unnecessary concern out there in the general public. That's what happens when we have Labor putting out principled positions on tax reform, sensible reform that is absolutely necessary. We have a provision in the tax system here that is unaffordable in the longer term. The government know that. They've done work in relation to this issue, but they won't come clean on it.


We know why dividend imputation was brought into existence. It was a Hawke-Keating era measure, but it was Prime Minister Howard and Treasurer Costello who made the changes to the system that have made it unaffordable. Even former Liberal leader John Hewson has talked about the fact that the tax refund aspect doesn't make any sense. We've heard credible commentators making the point that there is a need for change. We've seen a representative from KPMG making a similar comment. We've seen Saul Eslake coming out and talking about the commonsense aspect of this proposal. We know that what we are talking about is well-considered, and it is supported by a number of credible economic commentators.


If you were to listen to those opposite you would think that they were the party defending pensioners. Once again for the benefit of those listening to this broadcast, one just needs to put into context this famed indignation and objection of those opposite to Labor's responsible changes. What have they tried to do? They tried to cut pension indexation, a change that would have meant pensioners would be forced to live on $80 a week less within 10 years. They cut $1 billion from pensioner concessions, meaning pensioners in some states are paying more for things like rates and vehicle registration. I know that pensioners in Queensland are grateful for the work of the Labor government in stepping up to the plate and mitigating the impact of that cut. We've seen their changes to the assets test, which saw nearly 100,000 pensioners kicked off the pension entirely and cut the pension for more than a quarter of a million pensioners. We know the government are increasing the age pension eligibility age to 70—the oldest of comparable countries. This will deny the age pension for 375,000 older Australians over the first four years alone. This is a $3.6 billion hit to the retirement income of Australians.


Pensioners are facing higher power bills and greater out-of-pocket health costs, and yet here we have the government pretending that they are concerned about the impact of this change on pensioners. They are conducting a good old-fashioned scare campaign. The foreign minister made some comments yesterday on Insiders; we've seen the Treasurer coming out with hysterical claims about the impact of these changes—in fact, he's misleading people by saying that many of those who will be impacted are on low taxable incomes. Of course low taxable income means that people can still receive quite a lot in superannuation. This is a responsible reform and needs to be supported.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2018-03-19,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania) (15:23):  Labor's promotion of its ugly politics of envy seems to know no bounds. Jealousy and envy motivates Labor's policy settings these days, and that undermines the virtues on which our nation's success was built. Indeed, as Australia's great Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies opined in his Forgotten People speech:


If the motto is to be, ""Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow you will die, and if it chances you don't die, the State will look after you; but if you don't eat, drink and be merry, and save, we shall take your savings from you"", then the whole business of life will become foundationless.


Wasn't he so right? And what he has shown is exactly what the Australian Labor Party are seeking to descend Australian society into.


The simple fact is that there are many hundreds of thousands of men and women right around Australia that have scrimped and saved to ensure that they are self-reliant in retirement. And what are the Labor Party seeking to do? Deny them the benefits and the rewards of that thrift and that self-reliance. We, in the coalition, want to build this nation by encouraging the virtues of thrift, savings and self-reliance, but Labor today seeks to tear down those virtues with scant regard for the actual consequences.


Senator Ketter suggested that the Labor policy on tax credits in relation to the shareholdings of pensioners and superannuants was responsible and well considered, and that the facts were on the table. Let me put one fact on the table. I wonder who said this: 'We will now complete the implementation of the imputation system by allowing excess credits to be funded to resident Australian shareholders, complying superannuation funds and registered charitable organisations.' Further on, it continues: 'Many thousands of pensioners who have modest investments in public companies currently obtain no tax benefit from the franked dividends they receive. The full value of these credits will now flow through to the pensioner shareholders.' That was the Australian Labor Party policy, in a bipartisan way, only 20 years ago. Men and women around Australia, on that basis—




Senator McAllister:
  Things have changed.




Senator ABETZ:
  The current Labor leadership in the Senate seeks to scoff at that, but people in their 40s and 50s, relying on that promise, scrimped and saved and organised their retirement income and lifestyle on the basis of that promise, only to have this current Labor leadership, which is motivated by jealousy and envy and class warfare, rip this rug out from underneath them. Those retirees, on the promises made by the Labor Party 20 years ago, ordered their retirement funds and income accordingly. The Labor Party in this place will scoff, but the simple fact is that, unless we as a community and a society are willing to support and salute those who are willing to help themselves, the burden becomes much greater on everybody else. That is why Robert Menzies was so right when he said: if you don't provide encouragement and if you instead say to people, 'If you save, if you set money aside and if you invest in Australian companies in the hope of receiving a retirement income, the government will snatch it away from you,' why would they bother investing in Australian companies? Why would you bother looking after yourself in retirement? You can just rely on all your fellow Australian taxpayers. You know what happens? You can have the tax grab today, but that is like killing the goose that lays the golden eggs. You will get the extra golden egg for one day, but the cost will be quite substantial in the years to come. That is why Labor's policy is so divisive and so short-sighted and needs to be rejected.

Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:28):  I have to be honest: I find the government's approach to economic policy truly perplexing. We have as our Prime Minister a man who was so interested in and committed to economic reform that he put forward his own taxation policies and paid himself to have them costed during the Howard government. This is a man who toppled former Prime Minister Abbott because he felt that only he could provide the economic leadership that we need. Those were his words. Yet, having fulfilled his ambitions, having achieved the power to actually do things, he instead chooses to do nothing. I think many Australians find this genuinely disappointing. Many Australians are confused about where Q&A Malcolm has disappeared to. I'm not sure myself. It's possible that the Prime Minister is held back by internal division.




Senator Colbeck:
  On a point of order, it would be nice if the senator referred to the Prime Minister by his correct name or title. 



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator McAllister, I wondered if you were quoting, but you didn't say you were. I remind you, please refer to others by their correct title. 




Senator McALLISTER:
  I certainly will. It is hard, you have to observe, to move forward if you're always looking back over your shoulder at who's sitting behind you. I think it's the case that the only policies that he can put forward are the ones that no-one—absolutely no-one—in his party room can possibly disagree with, and we know that the only thing that really unites the coalition party room is attacking unions, attacking the representatives of working people. Or perhaps his ministers think that the purpose of government is to deliver for the rent seekers who show up for the meetings rather than for ordinary Australians. But it doesn't matter what the reason is; the result is the same: the government has no economic vision for Australia.


The government should be embarrassed that it has left policies like our reform on dividend imputation sitting in the desk drawer. Treasury and experts have been calling for this reform for years. In 2009, the NAB chairman and former Treasury secretary Ken Henry called for reform as part of his review of the tax system. It has become clear that Treasury considered dividend imputation reform in the lead-up to Treasurer Scott Morrison's last budget, creating a dossier entitled 'Tax policy: dividend imputation'. A white paper on tax reform commissioned by Treasurer Hockey in 2015 found there were some revenue concerns with the refundability of imputation credits. And it's clear what they meant: the department was receiving lower tax revenues than it expected. The department said:


… it provides a greater incentive for shareholders of closely held companies to delay distributions until a time when individual owners are subject to a relatively low tax rate, to receive a refund of tax paid by the company.


The government have received the advice. They know this is a good idea—they've considered it in the past—but they lack the courage or the will to follow through. Their only plan is to deliver corporate tax cuts for their donors, and, in the meantime, while they thrash around on the hook of a rational policy that would restore the budget and provide $11 billion extra in budget repair over the next four years, they cry crocodile tears for low-income earners in their retirement years.


Well, I'll ask you this: where was the concern when the government was busily trying to cut the rate at which the pension was indexed? Where was the concern of those coalition frontbenchers who've been so eager to climb all over the idea of people who've been disadvantaged by this policy? Where was their concern when they did a deal with the Greens political party to kick a whole lot of people off the pension by changing the asset test? Where's the concern even today, when it's clear from the remarks made by Senator Fierravanti-Wells that those on the pension are in fact a burden on the Australian taxpayer? Where is the concern in the remarks made by Senator Abetz that the virtues we look for are thrift, savings and self-reliance? I've got some news for Senator Abetz: you can work hard all your life and exhibit the virtues of self-reliance and of thrift and you still won't have a very large superannuation balance at the end of it—and that is the experience of the majority of Australian women.


People know, when they hear this, how ridiculous it is to hear the coalition, who, at every budget, have tried to cut the pension, cry these crocodile tears. Labor's policy is fair. It is a fair way to pursue budget repair, and it's a policy that ought to have been adopted by the coalition.

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania—Minister for Tourism and International Education and Minister Assisting the Minister for Trade and Investment) (15:33):  It was interesting listening to the commencement of Senator McAllister's presentation, because it was almost as if the only thing she didn't want to talk about was Labor's policy. Labor talk about fairness, and you hear them talk about fairness a lot. Senator Ketter also talked about what Labor's policy wouldn't do, including that it wouldn't take the pension and wouldn't take dividends. But what Labor's policy is doing is taking away pensioners' and self-funded retirees' and part-pensioners' income.


These returns form an important part of their income. When you consider that more than half of the individuals receiving these refunded franking credits have taxable incomes of less than $18,200—more than half—and 86 per cent have incomes less than $37,000 and the discussion amongst members of the Labor Party is that perhaps the revenue from this measure, or the saving from this measure, could be put towards a tax cut, how fair is it that that tax cut is off the reduction in the direct income, the direct available funds, of people earning less than $37,000 or $18,200? With 86 per cent of these individuals having incomes less than $37,000, how fair is it that the rest of the community gets a tax deduction on the back of this measure? How fair is that?


How fair is it that a constituent who was in touch with me last week, with a total income of $23,000 including these franking credits, is going to lose $5,000 of that income? How fair is that? That is the on-the-ground, practical effect of what's going to happen. Now, this couple don't have a huge, multimillion-dollar retirement fund. They have a couple of hundred thousand dollars worth of shares, and that's what they live on. That is what they live on. This measure is going to directly reduce their current available funds to live on, $23,000, by about $5,000. How fair is it that that then goes into a tax deduction for someone who could be a millionaire or someone on $300,000? How fair is that?


If this is such a good policy, as Labor is claiming, why is it that Labor backbenchers are building dossiers to bring to Canberra to put before caucus to tell what a devastating effect this policy is going to have on their constituents, particularly in regional communities? A farmer sells their farm. After 20, 30 or 40 years on the farm, they've got $300,000 or $400,000. They put it into Australian shares. Three hundred thousand dollars at seven per cent is going to earn them about $20,000 a year. If they get tax credits on all of those, that's probably another $5,000 or $6,000. That's how much you're reducing their income. It's not hard to work this stuff out if you really think about it.


What is it that the Labor Party have got about people who have worked hard, have bought some shares, probably cumulatively over a long period of time, and are now fully dependent on the income from those shares for their daily living expenses? The Labor Party want to rip out, in some cases, 20-odd per cent of their income directly—just take it away. And then they'll go out and brag that they can give that away as a tax cut to the rest of the community. How fair is that?


Where is the Labor Party's so-called fairness nerve when it comes to this measure? Most of the impact is on people on low incomes, not the high-flyers that the Leader of the Opposition likes to portray it as. Most of the impact of this measure is on people on low incomes. You are taking away their living expenses. That is exactly what's happening. They're ringing our offices just the way that they're ringing Labor backbenchers' offices, because their income is being drastically reduced, and it's going to affect their way of living.

"Kitching, Sen Kimberley",ALP,2018-03-19,"



Senator KITCHING
 (Victoria) (15:38):  Despite the government's rhetoric and their self-aggrandising talk of being good economic managers, they are not. They are poor economic managers. Let's look at the federal debt level as an example. They have more than doubled federal debt since they came into government in 2013. Federal debt is now about $600 billion. It's a toxic debt crater that will smoulder for generations to come. It's all rhetoric all of the time from those across the chamber, but their substance is rip-offs and the distortion of our tax system and—even worse than that—being too weak to desire, let alone make, any changes or make any reforms. They say they don't like deficits yet spend like drunken fiscal sailors. They are a government suffering from the ill-effects of having two weak treasurers, firstly Joe Hockey, the former member for North Sydney, and now the member for Cook.


It was the Labor Party that reformed the tax system. The Labor Party got rid of the double-taxation that occurred on the ownership of shares. In 1987, the then Labor government of Prime Minister Hawke and Treasurer Keating introduced imputation credits. When the federal budget was in surplus under former Prime Minister John Howard and former Treasurer Peter Costello—oh, those heady days; how the current members of the ERC must dream about having a surplus—it was they who introduced the scheme allowing people who were not paying any income tax to get cash back under the imputation credits scheme. The cash refunds actually avoid paying single-taxation on dividends. So, it went from double-taxation to single-taxation and, with the method that is in place now, if you are not paying income tax you receive the cash-back and you don't pay any tax at all.


My favourite definition of this scheme is from the member for Fenner, who calls it 'the cane toad of the taxation system'. That is because it cost around $500 million when it was first introduced, but soon it will cost around $8 billion. We heard Senator Cormann say that Treasury advice has been given on this. There have been discussion papers aplenty. Why? I bet Treasury is telling the government, telling the members of the ERC, that these cash-back payments are no longer affordable for our economy. We are the only country with a full refundable imputation system—and that is from the tax centre at KPMG.


What is the government doing? Well, they are weak. They are never going to make any big changes, because they know they are essentially an unstable government. They know they are tick-tocking closer to 30 Newspolls and they know there are murmurings and mumblings from all quarters of the government, so the question that is most pressing for some of those opposite is: should the Prime Minister be taken out in a one-stage or a two-stage process, and should that be done before the mid-year break?


Labor knows the resources accumulated by the state are and should be limited. They know this because it has been the Labor Party that has been the economic reformer in this country. This is because we are willing and we are able to make hard decisions. In a word, we are able and we are willing to govern. It was the ALP that made the hard decision to means test the age pension. No-one wanted to do that. The coalition opposed it, but imagine the state of the federal budget if that hard and difficult decision had not been made.


Senator Abetz says that this policy is motivated by envy. It is not motivated by that at all. It is motivated by knowing that the budget cannot be all things to all people and that hard choices must be made. It is not a divisive policy. It was announced before the Batman by-election. Imagine the hue and cry from those opposite if it had been announced this week: 'Oh, how cynical! You're doing it after the by-election!' Well, it was announced before the by-election. It was given full transparency and the people in Batman voted in Labor. The ability and capacity to make society fair and equitable is perhaps something only the ALP is able to do. (Time expired)

Senator McGRATH:
  The coalition government is acting to ensure Australia's fiscal sustainability by maintaining our path back to budget balance in 2021 and tackling rising debt. Everything this government is delivering is designed to reduce the burden on families and guarantee essential services. That's why we're committed to keeping taxes as low as they possibly can be. Reducing the corporate tax rate would make a strong contribution to Australia's economic growth and raise productivity, employment and wages in Australia. A lower company tax rate would result in higher earnings and more investment. This will lead to longer term capital gains and higher dividends in the future for domestic shareholders of Australian companies including retirees. Our comprehensive plan to boost investment in Australia also includes a defence industry plan, a national energy guarantee, $75 billion in infrastructure investment and record investments in skills and education.

Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (15:55):  by leave—I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the 38th General Assembly of the ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Assembly, which took place in Manila, Philippines, from 14 September to 20 September 2017. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.


Leave granted.




Senator GALLACHER:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


The 38th AIPA General Assembly was held last year in Manila, Philippines. As a member of the Australian observer delegation, it was an honour to attend this important forum of the ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Assembly. 


Last year was a significant year—2017 was the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and it was also the 40th anniversary of the creation of the parliamentary arm of ASEAN: the ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Assembly. As was noted during the first plenary session, the common goal of establishing an ASEAN community by 2025 will require stronger coordination between governments and legislatures. In this context, the General Assembly focused on how AIPA and ASEAN can work together to bring about inclusive change to the communities in the region. The assembly also dealt with important regional concerns, including humanitarian situations in parts of the region; combating illegal drugs, terrorism and trafficking; and enhancing cooperation in the use of science and technology for peaceful purposes. As with previous general assemblies, maritime disputes were also raised, and parties were urged to work towards a peaceful resolution in accordance with international law. All countries reinforced AIPA's important contributions to maintaining peace and stability in the region, promoting cultural exchange and understanding, enhancing cooperation on transnational matters and improving prosperity in the region. 


One of the key meetings for the delegation was a formal dialogue session with representatives of ASEAN member countries. The dialogue session was an important opportunity to discuss cooperation and engagement between our parliaments. The warm discussions with our regional colleagues centred on strengthening cooperation in the areas of disaster management and combating transnational crimes—in particular, terrorism, violent extremism and trafficking in persons. Our parliamentary colleagues in the region were particularly interested in the work being done by our parliament to establish a modern slavery act in Australia.


One of the most common messages during the dialogue session was the extent to which our regional partners value our friendship and cooperation. The dialogue session gave our delegation the opportunity to renew ties with our parliamentary colleagues overseas and to reinforce Australia's commitment to the South-East Asia region.


In addition to representing Australia at the AIPA General Assembly, the delegation also attended appointments to reaffirm our ties with the Philippines parliament. The delegation was pleased to meet with several of our parliamentary colleagues and appreciated the opportunity to discuss defence cooperation between our two countries; the situation in Marawi; and shared concerns, such as transportation and economic development.


Australia has a meaningful and longstanding relationship with our neighbours. We have had a multilateral relationship with ASEAN since 1974, and our ongoing presence at AIPA general assemblies reinforces Australia's ongoing commitment to engaging with South-East Asia. Our commitment to attending AIPA general assemblies is an important opportunity to demonstrate Australia's support for ASEAN and one that I would support continuing into the future. On behalf of the delegation, I would like to record our thanks to the host of the 38th General Assembly, the parliament of the Philippines, for its excellent hospitality and a very well run general assembly.


Before concluding, I would like to acknowledge the work of the Australian Embassy in Manila in assisting with arrangements for the delegation's meetings at the Philippine parliament, which enhanced the visit's overall success. I would also urge the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to give their full assistance to future parliamentary delegations to the AIPA General Assembly. It is imperative that parliamentarians are properly briefed on the broader foreign relations context and considerations in order to maximise this important opportunity for Australia in the South-East Asian region.


Finally, I would like to acknowledge my colleague on the delegation, Mr George Christensen MP, whose leadership, cooperation and keen interest in the Philippines made a valuable contribution to the visit.


As always we were resourced by excellent work from the parliamentary secretariat. That is always worth noting. It is always of an exceptionally high standard.


I commend the report to the Senate.

"Chisholm, Sen Anthony",ALP,2018-03-19,"



Senator CHISHOLM
 (Queensland) (16:06):  It is opportune that this is the matter that we are discussing today, in light of the events of the weekend and, particularly, the Batman by-election. I want to put on the record my congratulations to Ged Kearney, the new Labor member for Batman, and the federal Labor leader, Bill Shorten, who really threw himself into the campaign. There has been a real consistency about what Labor have been talking about since Bill Shorten became the Labor leader, and I think that bore fruit in the Batman by-election. When you look at the issues in this matter of public importance, they are issues on which Labor has been campaigning strongly and has put significant positions on the public record.


But there is a real contrast between what Labor took to the Batman by-election and what we saw from the Greens. The repercussions have already started on the Greens side. We have seen Senator Di Natale having to deal with them over the last 48 hours. But, if the Greens had learnt anything out of the Batman by-election, in the Senate chamber today they would have withdrawn that stunt of a bill that they had, the Coal-Fired Power Funding Prohibition Bill 2017. If they'd really learnt the lessons from what happened on Saturday in the Batman by-election, they would have pulled that stunt of a bill—because that's all it was, an absolute stunt.


Contrast the stunts that the Greens have been pursuing around important issues with the behaviour of someone like Ged Kearney, who has a history of standing up for people, standing up for organisations and fighting for things for matter. She is a person of substance, a woman of substance, not someone who is going to fall for stunts or the latest tricks but someone who's been standing up and advocating for workers, advocating for social services, for decades. This was the contrast in Batman.


But in the Senate today the Greens came in and pursued, as always, a stunt—something that was going to have no consequence but something that the Greens were happy to pursue because they have learnt nothing out of what happened on Saturday. We have seen this time and time again, where basically they seek purely political advantage out of substantial issues. Nothing for them can be boiled down unless they can seek some political advantage out of it. Then they are happy to pursue it. We absolutely are going to hold them to account for that. They've learnt nothing out of the Batman by-election, and they showed again in the Senate today that they have learnt nothing in that regard.


The reality is that the current-day Greens are nothing, not even a patch, on the Bob Brown Greens from a decade ago. They are leaderless, they are visionless, they are divided and they have basically become inconsequential. Once upon a time, the people around Australia would listen to Bob Brown; they'd at least hear what he had to say. But, when it comes to Senator Di Natale, no-one hears what his contribution is. No-one wants to hear what his contribution is, because it's inconsequential. It's full of stunts. There's no substance behind it, and what we saw on Saturday, and what we've seen in other elections around the country in recent times, is that the Australian people are waking up to him.


They're not a patch on the Bob Brown Greens that we were used to a decade ago—people who even the other side would have to listen to. They've got more and more desperate. And the more desperate they've become, the worse they go. Unfortunately, I think that we're going to see a pattern from them where they increasingly pursue stunts and cynical politics, all to seek a little bit of political advantage for themselves—not trying to tackle some of the big challenges that this country faces but all for seeking some little political advantage. But they were held up in Batman, and full credit to the Labor campaign for doing it.


When it comes to the issues raised in this matter of public importance, they're about addressing cost-of-living issues; tackling climate change; the undermining of wages and conditions; and ensuring that children from any postcode in Australia get a quality education. And, when it comes to these issues, the federal government have dithered, or delayed or done nothing. They really aren't listening to the concerns of the Australian people in regard to these issues.


When it comes to the cost of living, they have dithered on energy policy now for over 12 months. The uncertainty that they have caused is causing prices to rise, and still we have not seen the National Energy Guarantee go through their party room. We come in here, and Senator Birmingham likes to try to lecture us about what our position is. We've said that we're happy to work with the government on the National Energy Guarantee, but they can't even get it through their own party room. They won't even present it to get it through their party room. How can we negotiate with a party that can't even get their own caucus to agree—let alone all the states—and put a position to the opposition that we can come to an agreement on?


Their dithering is having a real consequence for Australian families, through higher prices, and also for Australian workers. This dithering is inconsequential for those who rely on gas as feed stock for their business, whether it be the Gibson Island fertiliser plant or the smelters in Gladstone or around the country. The government are more focused on their internal squabbles than they are on the Australian people—Australian workers or Australian families, it is no matter to them who it is.


When it comes to tackling climate change, they've actually achieved a rare feat. They've seen energy prices increase whilst they've also seen a rise in pollution—quite remarkable! That's what we've seen from the other side. This has been a double whammy to the Australian people but also to future generations. So we're still no closer to hearing where they stand on the National Energy Guarantee. Once again, I re-emphasise that this has not gone through their party room. Those same Neanderthals on the backbench who always want to play up around tackling this issue are causing ongoing grief that they have still not been able to resolve, and it leaves us here, who are willing to work across the aisle to resolve this issue, none the wiser about what their final policy is.


The next one is around undermining of wages and conditions. This has been a really significant one across Australia but also one that I've seen firsthand in Queensland, with the devastating impact that this is having. We know that the LNP supports the cuts to penalty rates. We know that they've argued against a decent increase to the minimum wage. We know that they voted against Labor's proposals to make big business liable for underpayment of workers along the supply chain and also by subcontractors. They've got their heads in the sand around the changing nature of the labour market, and they've gone missing in action completely when it comes to the discussion about the future of work.


This is their record when it comes to wages and conditions. Is it any wonder that the workers of Australia don't trust this mob? They don't trust them when it comes to wages and conditions, and we know that the government  loves nothing more than attacking workers and attacking their representatives in the unions. And, when it comes to education, the LNP are busy selling their cuts. Those will have a negative impact on children and, I fear, particularly on those children from remote and regional areas—those who need it the most.


So, when you look at the key issues in this matter of public importance, we know that the LNP are failing them on every single one. They're failing when it comes to the issues about cost of living. We know that they're failing on the issues when it comes to tackling climate change; we've actually seen pollution go up under this government. And we know that the undermining of wages and conditions is something that is happening unabated under this government.


They constantly attack unions and constantly attack workers. We know what they have done with penalty rates and we know what is happening in places like regional Queensland, where labour hire is rampant. The government are doing nothing to crack down on that. We've seen casualisation increasing, making it harder for people to get a loan to get into the housing market or to buy a car. This is having a devastating impact on regional towns. It's actually changing the nature of those regional towns. These towns were once very attractive places to go and live and work, but the fact that in some of these places you can only get casual employment is making them less attractive. It means that people are going to have to move away. It means that kids who are growing up who are potentially third or fourth generations living in that town are having to move away for opportunities. This is what casualisation is doing; this is the uncertainty that it is causing. We also know that the LNP have not been able to resolve their internal challenges around energy and the impact that's having.


Labor are the only party listening when it comes to responding to these challenges. The Greens are divided. We know that there are repercussions internally that they have to deal with after what happened in Batman—but, still, they haven't changed their behaviour. We know that the LNP are not listening to these people. We know that they are not taking these issues into account in determining how they are going run their government. But Labor are listening. We are spending as much time as we can on the ground in these communities and hearing directly from them. We will continue to ensure that we represent the views of all Australians in this place.

 (Western Australia) (16:16):  I was a little bit bemused by this MPI when I read it and I thought, 'Senator Collins, you're really not trying hard enough with these MPIs.' We've got a grab bag of issues here: cost-of-living pressures, climate change, undermining wages and conditions, and the importance of ensuring that children of any postcode in Australia, city or country, can get a quality education. They are all very important issues, but it is a very strange way of phrasing an MPI. I was wondering to myself, 'What could this possibly be about?' Of course, what it is really about is a chance for the Labor Party, as we've just seen from Senator Chisholm, to have a whack at the Greens—a whack at the government on the way through, of course, but a whack at the Greens. It isn't surprising at all that, after we saw the Labor Party tacking to the left and following the Greens on various issues as they chased a result in Batman, they are now attempting to tack back to the centre now the Batman by-election is out of the way. It's a pretty cynical exercise. It's an exercise that the Australian people see through pretty clearly.


In addressing this grab bag of issues, one of the key issues on the table at the moment is the current enterprise tax plan from this government. The enterprise tax plan is coming in multiple parts and it has at its foundation the idea that keeping Australian business as strong as possible by encouraging economic growth is how we drive business growth, wages and employment growth. We grow the economy for everyone by making the economy a positive experience for as many people as possible in Australia. That's why what we're trying to deliver is so important.


We have already seen the first part of that legislated in this place for businesses earning up to $50 million in turnover each year and with particular changes that assist those smaller businesses with $2 million to $10 million in turnover every year. In addition to the tax cut itself, there are things like the small business incentive and the instant asset write-off, which I know has been used extensively by small businesses to upgrade plant and equipment, to invest in new technologies for their business, to help grow their business and to employ more people. We've also seen the pooling of depreciation and GST being able to be calculated on a cash flow basis—all things that advantage these small and medium businesses, which is very important.


The next part of the enterprise tax plan grows those tax cuts to larger businesses. The most important thing to remember in that regard is that larger businesses feed through to smaller businesses in terms of employment, growth and opportunities. You see this throughout the economy but certainly in my home state of Western Australia. I was recently at what you'd have to say is a medium-sized business, Legeneering. It's a business that employs around 200 people, is based in the electorate of Fremantle and services, largely, mining industry clients. That is a business that started just 12 years ago, in 2005, with three employees and an apprentice. As I said, today that business employs around 200 people. It's a very successful business. Who does that business contract to? Who does that business derive its business from? One of its major clients is Woodside, which, we all acknowledge, is a large business. Woodside is a company that started about 64 years ago, and that is a business that started with just one person and an idea.


The idea is that we are trying to lower tax rates so more people can grow their businesses and take their businesses from one person to two people to 20 people to 200 people to many thousands of people. Woodside currently employs about 3,000 people directly and indirectly provides opportunities to about 20,000 people. Every big business started off as a small business and it's really important to recognise that, in this space, we have to stay globally competitive if we are going to encourage and allow those small businesses to grow to medium-sized businesses and then grow to large businesses. That bastion of low taxes, France, has a corporate tax rate of 15 per cent. In Hong Kong it is 16½ per cent, in Canada it is 15 per cent, in Ireland it is 12½ per cent and in Singapore it is 17 per cent and lower for some companies. In the United Kingdom it is 19 per cent, with a plan to drop to, I believe, 17 per cent. In the US currently, at the federal level, it is 21 per cent, with a plan to drop to 15 per cent. In a world where capital is mobile—and it certainly is—and business decisions are made on a long-term horizon, for Australia not to look at its corporate tax rate would be a severe problem in the future. We need to encourage those businesses to want to invest in Australia long term and we need to keep our corporate tax rate competitive with the rest of the world.


In this grab bag of an MPI, we also have climate change. Obviously, the National Energy Guarantee is very important in order both to address our energy security issues and to meet our international commitments. Again, this feeds directly into business profitability. The modelling that was conducted on the National Energy Guarantee by Frontier Economics shows that a medium-sized business such as a supermarket could save over $400,000 a year. This is a significant amount of money to those small and medium-sized enterprises that employ Australians. This is the key thing. I recently met with the owner of a small supermarket from South Australia whose electricity bill had gone up in one year by $100,000. How many small and medium-sized businesses can sustain an increase in their costs of $100,000 in 12 months? We need policies in place to drive down energy costs, and the National Energy Guarantee clearly will do that. We need everyone to come on board this policy. Hopefully, with a new government being elected in South Australia in recent days, we will see a much more productive conversation taking place in this area.


When it comes to emissions, what does the National Energy Guarantee provide? It will see a 26 per cent reduction in the emissions from the National Electricity Market. This is a significant contribution to our international commitments and a significant way in which this government is both addressing the issues of energy efficiency and energy production and reliability and meeting our international commitments.


As I said, I wondered why I came in here, and it was clearly so the Labor Party could try and tack back to the centre and have a whack at the Greens. I feel like making a contribution between the Labor Party and the Greens. I should let them go at it. But I will reflect again on why it is important that this government gets support from the crossbench for its enterprise tax plan. It is a very important economic reform. Growth is not an abstract number in the budget; growth is what will drive businesses to employ more people, for wages to be able to increase over time. Growth is what will give people the opportunities for the jobs for the next generation. It is certainly something that all people in this place should support, and I would encourage the crossbench to seriously consider that as they consider their position on the government's enterprise tax plan in the future.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AG,2018-03-19,"



Senator BARTLETT
 (Queensland) (16:25):  Senator Chisholm, from the Labor Party, spoke earlier in this matter of public importance debate. I agree that it is important—the need for policies that address cost-of-living pressures, climate change, the undermining of wages and conditions, and the importance of ensuring children from any postcode in Australia, city or country, can get a quality education.


Being from Queensland, Senator Chisholm would know, and he should know, the good news: he's in luck that those policies already exist, and it's the Greens that have those policies. Being from Queensland, he would have seen up close how strongly the Greens promoted policies targeting exactly these issues in his own state, getting results from the electorate as a consequence of that. This from the Labor Party, who have presided over massive increases in electricity costs in Queensland because of their adherence to the neoliberal ideology that has meant that they pursued that approach of privatisation and corporatisation of public entities that were previously there to deliver for the interests of community rather than for corporations and for profit.


Senator Chisholm was talking about climate change and the need for policies on climate change on the very day that the Labor Party voted once again to adopt a new subsidy to explore for thermal coal. Perhaps Senator Chisholm and the Labor Party could look in the direction of the Greens and see the policies that already exist if they wanted to ensure that there is action on cost-of-living pressures, on climate change and on the undermining of wages and conditions.


It is the Greens that have led the way unequivocally in being the first out to oppose cuts with regard to penalty rates, to promote the importance of increasing the minimum wage substantially and to push up substantially an increase in Newstart and pensions—one way to address cost-of-living pressures and ensure that those people that are being paid the least, that have the lowest incomes, have their income increased. The Greens policies are to address housing affordability by investing in building more houses that are affordable for people, by ensuring that electricity is affordable, by ensuring all energy networks and generation corporations are changed back to being efficient public authorities and by ensuring that public transport is significantly cheaper and reliable. We are getting the opposite with the state Labor government in Queensland—and I'm sure in many other states around Australia—which is putting up public transport fares, and, certainly in the south-east, the rail system is becoming an embarrassment.


We have this problem with cost-of-living pressures because, under the ideology of neoliberalism, of free market fundamentalism, we have seen the steady march of privatisation of our essential services like energy, housing, hospitals and education. Neoliberalism, this free market fundamentalism, is an ideology that ruins communities and lives and it's an ideology that both the old parties of the political establishment are still wedded to. They both sold off essential services that provided for basic human rights and basic human needs so that they could be run for profit. They both continue to support an approach where corporate profits are put ahead of community needs.


With climate change, it is important and pleasing to see the ALP are acknowledging the need for more action, but what we need is not just an acknowledgment of better action; we need an adoption of effective policies. Let me remind the Senate about the fact that it was the Greens in this parliament who pushed and—no-one can deny—were pivotal in delivering what many independent observations say is the world's best practice in regard to a carbon reduction mechanism that also ensured that people weren't hurt by increased cost-of-living impacts. It was shown to be effective in the very short period of time before it was disgracefully dismantled—vandalised by the coalition. It delivered a reduction in emissions—emissions that are now going back up again under this government at a time when energy prices are also going up further under this government.


This isn't just a matter of protecting our environment and protecting the future of our planet—fundamental as those things are. It is about the impact on people's lives right now. The failure to act on climate change is putting people's lives at risk and is also contributing to those cost-of-living pressures. In my own state of Queensland, in Far North Queensland, which I've already spoken about in this chamber, people, individuals and businesses have faced over the last five to ten years massive increases in their insurance premiums specifically linked to increased severity of weather events. It's having a direct cost impact on the community in Far North Queensland right now. The people of the Torres Strait Islands are having their homes and islands made uninhabitable by rising sea levels, increased severe weather events and higher storm surges. Hopefully, all of us here will be aware of the major damage wreaked in the Torres Strait Islands just a couple of months ago for this reason. Entire island communities and cultures are at risk of being wiped out due to climate change right here in the Australian community, in the Queensland community, within decades. Yet we get nothing, in terms of any meaningful action, from this government. In fact, we're getting action that makes things worse.


People's lives are being put at risk. The future of their communities is being put at risk. They are facing cost-of-living impacts right now because our politicians, in league with massive fossil fuel corporations, are putting profits and corporate donations ahead of human lives. Just as does tobacco, we know fossil fuels put lives at risk. But here in Australia the two parties of the political establishment are in the pockets of the big fossil fuel corporations, so they continue to not act or to not act adequately to address what needs to be done.


When we're talking about wages and conditions, let's not forget that wages are not just flatlining but, for many people, particularly those on lower incomes, going backwards. They're not keeping up with the cost of living, yet corporate profits are at record highs. And let's not forget that this is under Labor's so-called Fair Work Act. The Your Rights at Work campaign in 2007—and I was in this parliament at the time—showed just how much ordinary Australians care about their working conditions and how they will get behind an imaginative and progressive union campaign and a community movement that is focused on people's direct needs and direct experiences. But it's also a lesson in how grassroots movements can be betrayed by politicians, given that when Labor got into government they introduced this unfair work act, which has failed to deliver on the promise of the campaign, so much so that the union movement is now launching another major campaign to get our industrial relations laws to work to fix Labor's Fair Work Act.


In regard to education—and it's pleasing to see this particularly specified—the importance of ensuring children and, frankly, people of all ages are able to access a quality education from anywhere in the country is something where we've been going backwards for a long period of time now. This is another area where the neoliberal agenda has caused so much damage to our communities, to human opportunities and to what is a crucial sector not just for economic and employment opportunities in the future; let's not forget that the education area itself is a major employer, particularly in regional areas. For all of the talk about mines in Central Queensland, the biggest employer in Rockhampton is the Central Queensland University. In Cairns, when I was meeting with the chamber of commerce just last week, they reminded me that, after tourism—which is, not surprisingly, the top employer, the top job generator, for that region—the second biggest is education. So, when we have our education sector being harmed and cuts to university funding under this government, it's the regional universities and it's the jobs in those regions that are being put at risk right now, as well as the future opportunities for the young people of those regions being put at risk.


We have a world-class system of vocational and further education that has been deliberately destroyed purely on ideological grounds. One of the great reforms of the Whitlam era was the abolition of university fees, yet they were reintroduced in 1988 by another Labor government, which reflected just how much they and the political class as a whole had been captured by neoliberalism. People can only get a quality education, as is emphasised in this debate, if it's affordable and if it's available at all. Under the policies of both the parties of the political establishment, things have been going backwards there. The Greens will continue to turn things around with the policy suite they've been promoting proudly and strongly.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2018-03-19,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (16:36):  Before I start, can I just remind Senator Bartlett that it was the Greens who helped the Liberals cut pensions. There was a quote from someone—I can't remember who it was—on the other side along the lines that Senator Di Natale had constructively engaged with the government on this measure, so you might just like to remember that, Senator Bartlett.


There's something that our now Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, said 2½ years ago that will come back to haunt him. He said this when he announced that he was challenging Mr Abbott for the leadership of the Liberal Party:


The one thing that is clear about our current situation is the trajectory. We have lost 30 Newspolls in a row. It is clear that the people have made up their minds about Mr Abbott's leadership.


Well, Mr Turnbull is now two Newspolls away from failing his own test, and he can't walk away from what he said. It's not a test that his party set for him. It's not one that the media set, and it's not one that we set for him. This is the test that Mr Turnbull set for himself.


It should be obvious to those opposite, as it is to most Australians, what the core of the problem really is. It's not just the chaos and the disunity within this government, as loud and as broad as that is; it's its failure to come up with policies that address the challenges facing everyday Australians and their aspirations for the future. Those on the other side have squandered any opportunity they had to be a government that is focused on the future and that governs for all Australians.


Set out in Senator Collins's MPI are a number of policy areas where this policy failure is particularly apparent. On climate change, Mr Turnbull's Direct Action climate policy has been a complete failure, and his long-awaited climate change review has offered no new or alternative climate policy. The government's own projections show carbon pollution rising between now and 2030 rather than going anywhere near its target of a 26 to 28 per cent reduction. The government has no climate change policies beyond 2020 and has made no commitment to long-term emission reduction targets.


On cost-of-living pressures, the government has comprehensively failed to tackle the rising costs of housing, school and childcare expenses and electricity bills, and in many cases it has made it worse. Australians wanting to afford health care are hit with the double whammy of skyrocketing private health insurance and the government's Medicare rebate freeze.


Cost-of-living pressures have of course been exacerbated by the pressures on Australia's incomes. Wages growth is now at a record low, thanks to the government's relentless attack on the pay and conditions of Australians. The failure of wages growth to keep pace with Australia's economy is leading to growing levels of inequality. The situation certainly hasn't been helped by the Turnbull government's cut to penalty rates for retail and hospitality workers, which has cut the wages of thousands of Australia's lowest paid workers by up to $77 a week, and now the government is talking down the minimum wage increase too. As for the government's education policy, their $17 billion cut to schools has hit school systems hard. Most of the cuts have hit the schools that need the funding most. Eighty-six per cent of the cuts have been borne by public schools and 12 per cent by Catholic schools.


By contrast, Labor want to see schools across Australia able to invest in regional and remote students, in students with disability, in Indigenous students and in students from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. We want to see schools where teachers can get the support they need in the classrooms for those students who need that extra assistance, and this is why we initiated the Gonski review and followed its recommendations, and this is why we will reverse the Turnbull government's savage $17 billion cuts to schools.


We also have comprehensively costed plans to address the other areas where this government has failed dismally to show any leadership. We will legislate within the first 100 days of a Shorten Labor government to restore the penalty rates for workers who've been affected by the government's cruel pay cuts. We will reform negative gearing so that we can help young Australians to buy their first home. We will modernise the National Electricity Market to give more power to consumers, and Labor will take real action on climate change with a six-point plan which includes achieving a 50 per cent renewable energy target by 2030.


But right now we're stuck with a government that are sleepwalking towards electoral defeat because they are gripped by policy paralysis. They have no serious policies to address the problems facing Australians. They have no serious policies around facing the rising cost of living, stagnating wage growth, the threat of climate change or the need for a quality education. The major policy platform of this government seems to be more about union-bashing— (Time expired)

"Hume, Sen Jane",LP,2018-03-19,"



Senator HUME
 (Victoria) (16:41):  I rise today to speak in response to the matter of public importance submitted by our Senate colleague from Victoria Senator Collins. Senator Collins would like the chamber to consider an extraordinary breadth of subjects in a single MPI, breaking with the convention—and, dare I say it, the commonsense tactic—of using an MPI to raise a single issue for consideration by the Senate. Senator Collins has instead unloaded a stream-of-consciousness diatribe in policy areas, and one might better ask the question: what didn't Senator Collins ask the chamber to consider this afternoon? Nonetheless, Senator Collins has asked the Senate to consider:


The need for polices that address cost of living pressures, climate change, the undermining of wages and conditions, and the importance of ensuring children from any postcode in Australia, city, or country, can get a quality education.


While I barely know where to begin, begin I must, and particularly on cost-of-living pressures—an issue that, you know, Mr Acting Deputy President O'Sullivan, is particularly important to this government and one that we take very seriously indeed. How very galling it is that a representative here of the Labor Party would bring up cost-of-living concerns, when in fact her party's contribution to the energy debate has been limited to an obstructive and blind commitment to a 50 per cent renewable energy target. Or—hang on—is it a 75 per cent commitment? No, wait—it's a 40 per cent renewable energy target. To be honest, I am not sure what it is, because it changes with the winds of political expedience. It really depends on whether you're campaigning in South Australia or whether you're campaigning in Batman. The Labor Party's commitment to the truly random 50 per cent renewable energy target is nothing more than a capitulation to the green-left flank of its own party, and Senator Collins knows full well that it will have absolutely no effect whatsoever on global temperatures or climate change. It will, however, dramatically reduce energy reliability and, ultimately, increase energy prices for Australian households. So does Senator Collins really want to discuss this today—a day after the Labor Party lost government and was sacrificed in South Australia on the altar of renewable energy zealotry? It beggars belief.


It is amazing, too, that Senator Collins has asked this chamber to consider cost-of-living pressures, when the ACTU's Sally McManus has come up with the perfect solution—a living wage. Betraying an Alberici-esque grasp of economics, Sally McManus has lobbied for a massive living-wage increase of 60 per cent of the average wage. But do not for a second be fooled, for a living wage is nothing more than a significant increase in the minimum wage, and the last person to implement a living wage increase of this magnitude was in fact former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, who, in 1973, raised minimum wages by 27 per cent. And, of course, in its wake, we saw unemployment balloon and inflation skyrocket, harming the very people that Prime Minister Gough Whitlam wanted to protect—low-income earners and pensioners.


Even Mr Whitlam was forced to concede that employees can in fact price themselves out of the market, and the ALP's then Minister for Labour, Clyde Cameron, complained in 1974 that—wait for it—'union bloody-mindedness' was 'slowly but surely pricing thousands of Australian workers out of employment'. Will history repeat itself? If Sally McManus is pulling the strings of the opposition leader then inevitably it will, for the call on an unrealistic rise in the minimum wage is exactly what Mr Shorten announced to the National Press Club earlier this year. The politics of envy and grievance form the foundation of Labor's pitch to voters, and that is the elephant in the room.


Labor want to talk about cost-of-living pressures, but they want to address that not with effective policy at the source but through fistfuls of handouts for sectional interests. Rather than growing the economy, increasing the number of jobs and using basic laws of supply and demand to organically increase wages in a non-inflationary and sustainable way, the Labor Party have absolutely no plan whatsoever to grow the economy. They have no plan for jobs, no plan for growth and no plan for business growth—nothing. Instead, there are plenty of announcements of how Labor intend to punish people that they don't like—people who don't vote for them, people who invest, people who save, people who run a family business, people who don't want to be a burden to the public purse, people who just want to get ahead and people who choose to manage their own superannuation. And therein lies the nub.


I think we can agree that last week's policy announcement was a massive misfire. At the behest of the industry superannuation fund sector, who are the only beneficiaries of a less-attractive self-managed superannuation fund market, the Labor Party announced it would be removing legitimate refunds of tax already paid on dividends to those who pay low or no tax, calling them 'rorters', 'fat cats' and 'the top end of town'. When it became all too apparent that this harebrained policy disproportionately affects low-income earners and pensioners who have set that little bit aside in blue chip Australian shares, Mr Shorten generously told them that he will make it up to them through an increase in their part-pension. 'Don't worry,' he said. 'It may be rightfully your money, earned legitimately, tax already paid, but I am going to take it from you and redistribute it where I think it could be better used. Trust me; I'm from Labor.'


Make no mistake, Mr Shorten is a clear and present danger to the future prosperity of our great nation. He has no plan to create jobs, no plan to increase wages and no plan to grow our economy. And now, by promising to steal dividends earned legitimately from the savings of those who deserve our thanks and not our condemnation, Mr Shorten has tipped over Labor's promises into more than $200 billion of new taxes. That is almost the GDP of New Zealand that Mr Shorten will be taking away from your pay packet, from your pension, from your investments and from your business. He has forgotten the Winston Churchill proverb that a nation trying to tax itself into prosperity is like a man standing in a bucket and trying to lift himself up by the handle; it is simply impossible. 'Shortenomics' is the greatest threat this country has seen in decades.


Much as I would love to, I simply haven't got the time here today to go into the importance of ensuring that children from any postcode can get a quality education. But, if the meandering words of today's MPI, let alone the dodgy maths of the policy announcements coming from the ALP, are anything to go by then, please, let that quality education include some basic economics because, if it was taught at school when Senator Collins was there, I think she must have been taking a sickie.

"McCarthy, Sen Malarndirri",ALP,2018-03-19,"



Senator McCARTHY
 (Northern Territory) (16:48):  I rise to speak on today's MPI and do so to agree with the statement, particularly in reference to ensuring children from any postcode in Australia, city or country, can get a quality education. I point to commentary last week—hurtful commentary by government ministers, members, candidates and the media—in which those opposite have been advocating for a one-size-fits-all approach to the adoption of children in Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory. It is frightening and it is ill informed. I understand some of their concerns. Indeed, I share some of their concerns in regard to the safety, wellbeing and future of our children, which we know is absolutely paramount for any child, in any postcode, in any city, in any bush country town.


Sexual violence is a terrible crime and is even more horrifying when committed against a child. It's tragic and it's awful, but our responses should not become a competition of outrage, of who is more outraged than the next person. It is actually about humanity rising above—transcending—the differences that we have, and knowing that it is about caring. It does not mean that we should revert to removing children from their homes, their families and their culture. 


As part of educating and protecting our children, the Territory government has already taken substantive steps to reform youth justice and child protection, investing in new bail support services, accommodation facilities and family and youth supports. This demonstrates the absolute seriousness with which the Territory government has taken the royal commission's findings and its understanding of the need for wholesale reform of a broken youth justice system. I urge the Turnbull government to take responsibility and negotiate in good faith and work collaboratively with Chief Minister Michael Gunner and the Northern Territory government so that the royal commission's findings can be implemented and so that every child, everywhere, has a solid future. 


First-nations people and organisations must be front and centre in developing solutions. Governments must work with first nations people in the co-design and delivery of programs. It's absolutely unhelpful to take the advice of ill-informed commentators—for example, the commentators on the Channel 7 Sunrise program, who have yet to include first nations people in their conversations. Safe, secure housing has to feature in keeping children safe. It will also play a critical role in addressing the cost-of-living pressures for the parents and/or guardians of vulnerable children. 


Unfortunately the Turnbull government has walked away from investing in remote housing. We know of the high rates of homelessness. Katherine has one of the highest rates of homelessness in the Northern Territory. We have families who are living with 15 people in their homes because these houses cannot be built. There are no commitments to SA, WA and Queensland. The minister has backflipped on his original commitment to match the NT's $1.1 billion investment in regional and remote housing. We desperately need this funding so our communities can thrive. Closing remote communities, calling for another NT intervention and calling for the removal of more Indigenous children from their families is a knee-jerk response to complex, deep-rooted issues. 


We know widespread child removal is not a panacea. We know culture and child safety are not mutually exclusive. The safety of the child is always paramount. Unlike those opposite, Labor will do something positive to ensure our children have the best chance in life. In our first 100 days in office, Labor will convene a national summit on first nations children. The summit will bring governments and experts together to help find solutions to this crisis, working with first nations people. 


Every child has a right to grow up healthy, happy and safe. Every child has a right to a roof over their head. Every child has a right to world-class education, no matter where they live. Kids in the Northern Territory don't deserve to have their future stifled. They don't deserve the $15 million in funding cuts from the Northern Territory's premier university, Charles Darwin University. They deserve to be more than safe; they deserve to have a roof over their heads; they deserve proper access to medical facilities— (Time expired)

Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (16:53):  They say that a camel is a horse designed by a committee. I think we can say with great confidence that this matter of public importance today was definitely designed by a committee. It would have been fascinating to have been a fly on the wall in the Labor tactics committee meeting this morning. I'm assuming that perhaps Senator Farrell, after a devastating loss in his home state of South Australia on the weekend, having learned his lesson that the environmental policies pursued by the Weatherill government came at a great political cost to the Labor Party and having no doubt recognised the detrimental effect that his ideological embrace of renewable energy has had on household budgets, came into the meeting and said: 'Guys, we have to talk about the cost of living. Can we make sure that's the MPI today.' Perhaps it was Senator Pratt from WA, passionate environmentalist that she is, who said: 'No, no, no, no. We shouldn't be talking about the cost of living. We have to talk about climate change. That's what the people of Australia want to hear from us.' Maybe it was Senator Carr, devoted union man that he is, who said: 'No. We should be talking about the wages and conditions of Australian workers.' Probably, it would have been Senator Collins herself who said: 'No. I'm on the education committee; I'm passionate about schools. Why can't we make an MPI today about education?' Clearly, they couldn't agree. So instead of making the difficult decision of picking just one topic for the MPI today they said: 'Why not have four?' It's like the ad for Old El Paso: 'Por que no los dos?' I apologise for my ineffective pronunciation.


That's why today we have an MPI covering four issues. It's a 37-word motion, as I counted. The English teachers of Australia are calling out for a full stop in there somewhere. Reading out the MPI is liable to make one run out of breath.


I faced a dilemma myself when thinking about my contribution to this debate: which of its many and varied issues would I choose to make a contribution on? I couldn't go past the cost-of-living pressures, because it has been particularly galling to hear the Labor Party come into this chamber today, one week after announcing a plan to smash the household budgets of retirees, and talk about the cost-of-living pressures that Australians face. I will make one political observation before I get to the substance of the policy. I have been very bemused in the last 24 hours to hear it said by some of those opposite and by some of their allies and friends in the media that the Batman by-election victory for the Labor Party is vindication of their policy to abolish dividend imputation. I have to say that I don't think that the Labor Party retaining a seat that it has held for 100 years, more or less—against the most shambolic and hopeless Greens campaign that we've seen in their recent attempts to take that seat—is exactly an endorsement of their policy. I'm not sure that Batman, regarded as the most left-wing seat in the country, could be taken to be representative of the rest of Australia, and I suspect that had that by-election been held somewhere else in Australia, perhaps in the suburbs of my home state of Victoria or any other state in this country, the result might have been different. No doubt it would have been different, given the absolutely insane nature of this policy.


Let's be honest about the political strategy being employed by the opposition and Mr Bill Shorten. He is clearly setting out to raise revenue through new and higher taxes from groups in the community who he thinks are unsympathetic—who he may not have sympathy for, who the Labor Party might not have sympathy for. For example, he has identified people who own investment properties and said, 'We'll take some money from you.' He has looked at companies and thought, 'They're not very popular. We'll take some money from them.' He's looked at people who operate family trusts and thought, 'We'll take some money from you;' at people on high incomes: 'We'll take some more from you;' and now, finally, at pensioners and self-funded retirees: 'We'll take some money from you, as well.' What he plans to do with this money he takes from groups in the community that he thinks are unpopular is spend it in ways that are more politically beneficial for him. He's going to spend it in populist ways. He's going to hand it out to groups in the community who might be more open to voting Labor. That is clearly the political strategy here.


We shouldn't pretend that this is a policy that has been carefully thought through or has been carefully designed. We shouldn't pretend that this is a policy that is trying to respond to genuine public policy issues. It is a smash-and-grab raid for the money saved by many retirees to provide for their own retirement so they're not reliant on the pension or are less reliant on the pension in their old age. Mr Shorten wants to come and take it so he can give it to others in the community who he thinks are more likely to vote for him.


It's a $59 billion tax hit, yet another of the many tax hits announced by Mr Shorten since the last election, now totalling more than $200 billion. It will mean less money in the pockets of more than one million Australians, especially retirees and pensioners on low incomes. As we have now discovered from ATO tax statistics, more than half of the franking credit refunds were paid to individuals who are over the age of 65. Of the individuals who receive a franking credit refunds, 97 per cent have an income below $87,000. I wouldn't have thought that Mr Shorten or the Labor Party would regard people with an income below $87,000 as being in any way, shape or form rich or wealthy people, yet these are the people that he is going after in order to raise revenue to give to others.


More than half of all the refunded franking credits are paid to individuals with a taxable income below the $18,200 tax-free threshold. That means people whose income is so low that they don't pay any income tax at all, and yet Mr Shorten wants to take a franking credit away from them. It will impact about 40 per cent of self-managed super funds, which affects 370,000 member accounts and retirement savings for 3.5 million super fund accounts. You would have heard the contribution from the member for Hume earlier in which she identified one of the beneficiaries of this policy being the industry super movement, and she would know; she's been in the belly of the beast. This is not only a blatant tax grab; in my view, this shows that the Labor Party are guilty of lying to the Australian public. The ALP's own website still suggests that an earlier $15 billion tax hike on retirement savings is the final and only change that Labor will make to tax treatment of superannuation.


This is a really important point: there are people who have planned for their retirement carefully over many years who are now in retirement and there is not much that they can do to change the plans that they put in place years ago. We in this place, on both sides—on all angles of this chamber—have put the rules in place for their retirement and they've planned accordingly. Many of these people are too old to go back to work. They don't have options to restructure their finances, and some of them have very modest means. But the rug has been well and truly pulled out from underneath them with no way for them to respond. It will mean a very real loss of income and I suspect—going back to the motion today—it will have a severe impact on the cost of living for many of these people. I urge the Labor Party to reconsider what I think has already been proven to be a disastrous policy.

"Ketter, Sen Christopher",ALP,2018-03-19,"



Senator KETTER
 (Queensland—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (17:01):  I rise to speak on the MPI, which goes to cost-of-living issues. It's disappointing that, when given the opportunity to speak on the issues that impact ordinary Australians, Senator Paterson and Senator Hume chose to take that opportunity to talk about the Labor Party—to obfuscate and engage in political hyperbole and talk about Labor's principled position in respect of tax reform, a proposal which 92 per cent of taxpayers are unaffected by.


I want to talk about cost-of-living issues and I particularly want to talk about the issue which even the Treasurer identified as being the greatest single threat to the Australian economy, and that is wages growth. Wages growth is at historically low levels despite the fact that we have enjoyed 26 years of continuous economic growth, and cost-of-living pressures are therefore weighing heavily on low- and middle-income households. So, having put it out there that this is the greatest single threat to the Australian economy, what has the government done about this issue? The government put out the company tax cut proposal, which is their centrepiece—from which all good things will come and, according to them, will lead to wages growth. That is trickle-down economics and patently absurd. The Australian people don't buy that story anymore, but that remains the government's centrepiece. The Treasurer also talked about productivity growth. But, at a time when productivity is continuing to grow, wages are flatlining. So the Treasurer is completely out of touch on that issue.


It is quite clear that average workers are not getting the benefit of that economic growth. Last week, I had the opportunity to visit the Australian Workers' Union and ETU protest outside the ExxonMobil facility at Longford. At that time, those workers had been protesting for 265 days and taking a principled stand against a 30 per cent wage cut being imposed on them by one of the subcontracting firms within the ExxonMobil facility. They were taking that principled stand not only for themselves but also for other workers and their children. They saw it as very important to take that position. So we know that the rules are broken when it comes to enterprise bargaining. The government could take the opportunity to talk about that issue, but they are silent on that.


The national wage case decision is coming up, which presents a very important opportunity to address the issue of wages. We know that the outcomes of the national wage case have flow-on effects throughout the economy. What particularly disappointed me was the submission to the wage case by the National Retail Association, where they have come out and said that they are proposing a zero per cent wage increase for workers across the economy. What are the government doing about that? How can they stand by silently whilst that sort of nonsense is being put out there? I say: shame on the National Retail Association for putting it out there. They had the gall to indicate that the explanation for that policy was in part the fact that retailers did not enjoy spending growth in the pre-Christmas period, which is when they traditionally get a pick-up in retail sales. Of course, it's quite clear that, if you give workers a zero per cent wage increase, next Christmas we're going to see an even worse outcome in retail sales in the lead-up to Christmas. So that is a very short-sighted policy position from the National Retail Association and I call on them to change their position.


Labor believe in affordable healthcare and education options and affordable insurance. We believe in cracking down on corporate tax dodgers. We believe that a fair tax system should be in place and that those who can afford to pay more should pay more.


Going back to that Retail Association submission, what added insult to injury from my perspective was that not only are the retailers asking for a zero per cent wage increase; they're also continuing to enjoy the benefits of the penalty rate cuts which are flowing through the system. Again, the government are silent on that. In fact, they have done nothing about those penalty rate cuts, which are impacting on the cost-of-living pressures for ordinary workers. It's time for the government to get on with the job and do something about this issue.

Senator BARTLETT
 (Queensland) (17:07):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


This document is a performance audit by the Auditor-General into funding models for threatened species management. When you open up an Auditor-General's report, you do not usually expect to immediately be reminded of Australia's globally distinct ecosystems, our immensely diverse flora and fauna and the richness of biodiversity that means Australia is recognised as one of the world's mega-diverse countries. Something that we often forget in Australia, whilst we recognise our magnificent natural environment and our wildlife, is just how incredibly diverse and unique it is, and how crucial that fact is to the long-term health not just of our environment but of all of the social and economic services that depend on a healthy, diverse environment. Approximately 85 per cent of our flowering plants, 84 per cent of our mammals, 45 per cent of our birds and 89 per cent of our reptiles occur only in Australia. Unfortunately, in the last couple of hundred years, more than 130 of Australia's known species have become extinct, three of those just since 2009.


What this audit report does is look at the funding models for the management of threatened species, because at the core of maintaining biodiversity is ensuring the diversity and the survival of all of those species—all of those different types of life. We are doing more and more poorly. Whilst this Auditor-General's report goes to the funding models and the way that they are being managed, at its core is a recognition that we are failing to deliver our obligations under the federal environment law. This government is failing to deliver. There is no doubt that our federal environment laws need a significant overhaul. There are gaps that need to be plugged. But what this government is doing is failing its obligations under the existing law by failing to properly fund what is required.


This report goes to the fact that this government has basically tried to contract out its obligations to the private sector. We've just had a debate in this place about the failure of the neoliberal model, the failure of the economic model that both the established parties of the political establishment have taken on board as a matter of political faith for the last few decades—that somehow or other government is better done by contracting it out to the private sector. This report shows that you cannot do that in an effective way and expect governments to meet their legal and, clearly, ethical obligations to the Australian community to prevent further extinction and to properly manage and address endangered species. You cannot contract that out to the private sector. But that's what we've seen with this government adopting the approach of free-market fundamentalism gone wild.


This Auditor-General's report explicitly goes to the so-called Threatened species prospectus that this government put forward just over a year ago. The audit assesses the effectiveness of the design of that Threatened species prospectus. It's couched in the usual Auditor-General's language, but it clearly identifies that there is a lack of a fit-for-purpose performance framework. There's an inability to properly assess adequacy, even on its own merits—and, let me be clear: this proposal, this policy approach from the government, is grossly flawed. It is a piecemeal approach. It is contracting out the core, central role of the government, to ensure that the legal obligations are properly fulfilled in a systemic way. You don't just protect the threatened species that you can manage to find some funding for, the ones that are most easy to market. It's not a competitive arrangement amongst the threatened species of our country, to try to compete to see who can attract private sector funding to make sure that their habitat is not destroyed. There are no mechanisms in this approach to prevent the ongoing destruction of habitat, whether it's by logging, mining or all of those things that are destroying economic opportunities as well as destroying the biodiversity opportunities and the biodiversity heritage of this country.


I think this Auditor-General's report, couched, as it is, in its own dry economic language, is actually good reading for people who want to get a grip on the economic irresponsibility of trying to apply a market based approach, a neoliberal approach, to a fundamental aspect of environmental management and, let's be clear, the legal obligations of this federal government, under our federal environment law, to properly manage and address threatened species.

Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (17:13):  I will speak only briefly, to add to Senator Bartlett's remarks about this Audit Office report on funding models for threatened species management. I urge anyone who is concerned about the way that this government is not addressing our threatened species to read this report, because it shows that, even within the very limited framework that the government is applying, it is failing to do that adequately. This report shows, first of all, the lack of consistency, the totally ad hoc nature of this attempt to get private funding into the management of threatened species, the lack of a framework that was established at the beginning of the process and the lack of consultation with the threatened species advisory committee. Even in the limited framework that's been set up, this approach with the prospectus has failed. It just goes to the heart of the lack of attention and the lack of importance that this government places on threatened species. If we were serious about protecting threatened species, we would not be acting in such a random, ad hoc, ineffective, inconsistent and fundamentally underfunded way to protect our precious animals and plants, which are special, which are unique to Australia.


What this report doesn't go to is the fact that even the species that are being focused on in this prospectus are only a small portion of the threatened species that need programs to be put in place to address them. It talks about the fact that the species included in the prospectus were chosen in a pretty random, ad hoc way and chosen without adequate consultation. But what it doesn't show is that there are a whole range of other species that this government and the Threatened Species Commissioner have deliberately chosen not to include.


This is important because, if you hear this government talk about its approach to threatened species, it talks about the Threatened Species Commissioner role as being of fundamental importance. It talked about the prospectus as being a fundamental measure, a tool, to address threatened species. Yet that is not succeeding there, and it is leaving a whole raft of other species completely underresourced in terms of the measures that need to be taken to address them.


In particular, the threatened species that weren't included in the prospectus are those under threat from habitat destruction due to resource exploitation. I'm particularly talking about logging operations and mining operations. With logging operations, we know that the species that weren't included in this prospectus include ones like the Leadbeater's possums, which are affected by logging in Victoria's Central Highlands. They include species like greater gliders, which have now become vulnerable because of loss of habitat due to logging operations. These weren't even mentioned in the prospectus.


Even under the limited scope that has been outlined, they are doing it badly. It speaks volumes, and it shows that the approach of this government is completely inadequate to protect our precious plants and animals; that we need to have a serious, whole-of-government approach to address the protection of our species, the plants and animals that are threatened; and that we need to have serious resources put into it. You can't just hope that you're going to get private sector funding to help address threatened species. In fact, the lofty aims of this prospectus to gain millions of dollars of funding have so far resulted in only two projects having private sector funding, one to the tune of $200,000; the other, only $10,000. It is not the way forward. It is not how we are going to address threatened species.


We can put the money into it, and we need to if we're going to protect these animals. We can cut the tax breaks for the big end of town. We can raise revenue of billions of dollars by making sure that we get rid of fossil fuel subsidies for the mining industry, for example. We can invest serious money into our threatened species, and that's what we need to do if we are going to have animals like the Leadbeater's possum actually pulled back from extinction, if we are going to have the plants and animals that we appreciate today continuing to be available in our natural environments, and particularly in our forests, for our children and grandchildren to enjoy.

NATIONAL HOUSING FINANCE AND INVESTMENT CORPORATION BILL 2018


SECOND READING SPEECH


This Bill establishes the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation (the NHFIC), a new independent corporate Commonwealth entity which will improve housing outcomes for Australians, particularly vulnerable Australians who need social and affordable housing. 


The NHFIC, which is modelled on successful initiatives in the United Kingdom, will strengthen efforts to increase the supply of housing by encouraging investment in housing, particularly in social and affordable housing. It will contribute to developing the scale, efficiency and effectiveness of the community housing sector and will provide loans, grants and investments that complement, leverage and support Commonwealth, state and territory activities relating to housing.


Housing is critical to the social and economic wellbeing of Australians, and the economy as a whole. It can impact on employment, education and health outcomes, and is a significant driver of investment, productivity and economic growth. It is also the main savings vehicle for the majority of Australians.


While housing is primarily a state responsibility, the Commonwealth Government nonetheless has an important role to play when it comes to addressing housing affordability and securing better outcomes for Australians, particularly the most vulnerable.


Commonwealth expenditure for housing in 2016-17 totalled $7.6 billion, comprising $4.4 billion in Commonwealth Rent Assistance and $3.2 billion in housing and homelessness funding including through the National Affordable Housing Agreement (NAHA) and the National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness. 


As announced in last year's Budget, the Government is currently working on a new improved funding agreement with the states and territories, the National Housing and Homelessness Agreement. We are seeking to improve the outcomes of this significant funding, given that despite the Commonwealth providing states and territories more than $9 billion since 2009, three out of four of the benchmarks under the NAHA have not been, or are unlikely, to be met. Around 40,000 Australians are currently on waiting lists for community housing, and an additional 148,000 are on public housing waiting lists.


The new Agreement will ask for more transparency from the states and territories and will make homelessness funding indexed and permanent for the first time. The National Housing and Homelessness Agreement Bill, which establishes the framework for the new Agreement is currently before the Parliament.


The initiatives outlined in this Bill are one part of the comprehensive housing affordability plan announced in the 2017-18 Budget. This plan will improve outcomes across the housing spectrum.


The Government has already legislated a number of the elements announced as part of that plan. Last year, we passed legislation to create the First Home Super Saver Scheme, shamefully opposed by the Opposition, which will provide a tax cut for first home buyers and enable them to save 30 per cent faster through voluntary super contributions. We are also working to identify and dispose of surplus Commonwealth land that is suitable for housing, beginning with Defence land at Maribyrnong in Melbourne. We have established the Australian Government Property Register to make this process transparent and allow the public to propose better uses for Commonwealth land.


The NHFIC will deliver another important part of our housing affordability plan. The NHFIC will administer the $1 billion National Housing Infrastructure Facility and an Affordable Housing Bond Aggregator. These functions will allow the NHFIC to both provide community housing providers with finance and assistance in capacity building and to make loans, investments and grants to improve housing outcomes. 


All financing and investment decisions will be made by an independent, skills-based Board, with the Chair and members appointed by the Government for terms of up to five years, which will ensure decisions are sound and commercially based. 


Independence of the Board's decision making will cultivate credibility in financial markets and provide the Board with the flexibility to perform its functions effectively and efficiently, and to tailor finance to the needs of recipients, mindful of any risks involved. The experience of the Housing Affordability Fund established by the previous government underlies the importance of this independent decision making process. The Australian National Audit Office found that there were serious shortcomings in the administration of the Housing Affordability Fund and that some approved projects were not selected on a merit basis, or in accordance with established guidelines. 


In line with the practices of other Commonwealth corporate entities recently established, the Government will outline its expectations of the NHFIC in an Investment Mandate, [a draft of which was released for consultation yesterday]. However, the Government will not be able to direct the Corporation in relation to particular loans, investments or grants, or in relation to particular projects. 


Providing the particulars of the NHFIC's activities in the Investment Mandate rather than in this Bill allows the legislative framework to be flexible and nimble and to adjust, within the scope permitted by the Bill, to the needs of community housing providers and other recipients of financial support. The Bill specifies the matters that will be covered by the Investment Mandate, including: decision-making criteria; eligibility; limits on the making of loans, investments and grants; strategies and policies to be followed; and risk and return on investments. 


The National Housing Infrastructure Facility will help to finance the critical infrastructure that is needed to unlock and accelerate new housing supply, particularly affordable housing. The Government anticipates that the Infrastructure Facility could support the development of 'mixed tenure' projects that combine affordable and private housing and provide broader community benefits, including housing, that enable key workers such as police and nurses to live near their places of work. 


The Government has committed $1 billion to the Infrastructure Facility in the form of up to $175 million in grants and $825 million in concessional loans and equity investments. The financial assistance available will encourage and complement private sector and state and local government investment and facilitate the delivery of critical housing-related infrastructure. 


Eligible infrastructure projects will include transport links, power and water infrastructure and site remediation works. Eligible, recipients will include local governments; state, territory, and local government-owned corporations and utility providers; and registered community housing providers. 


The NHFIC will need to ensure that it funds projects that satisfy the appropriate regulatory and environmental standards. 


The NHFIC will be able to reinvest the capital and earnings gained through the Infrastructure Facility, allowing it to grow over time. It will be able to tailor its provision of finance to best suit the needs of individual projects, with any concessions calibrated to the particular circumstances of the project, and will provide the minimum amount of assistance required to enable a proposal to proceed. 


The NHFIC's other key function will be to operate a Bond Aggregator for the community housing sector. The Bond Aggregator will improve the efficiency of financing for registered community housing providers and build the capacity of the sector. It will offer finance tailored to the needs of providers, funded through the issue of bonds, backed by a legislative guarantee, which will provide the best price outcome for providers. 


Community housing providers supply subsidised housing for some of our most vulnerable people. The new Bond Aggregator will give providers greater financial certainty and enable them to improve housing outcomes for their existing clients and build scale to provide services to new clients. There is a clear appetite from institutional investors, such as superannuation funds, for a new asset class of social impact investments which provide longer term fixed cash flows and deliver better outcomes to the community, and we hope to see this reflected in engagement with the Bond Aggregator. 


The final design details of both the NHFIC and its functions of operating the Infrastructure Facility and Bond Aggregator are the result of extensive consultation and the valuable involvement of many stakeholders over, in some cases, a number of years. I would like to thank in particular the Affordable Housing Working Group, comprised of officials from the Commonwealth, New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia; and the Affordable Housing Implementation Taskforce; as well as the dedicated officials in my Department who have been working on this for some time. 


Another important feature of the Bill is that it provides a legislative guarantee for the NHFIC's liabilities. The Bill provides for the capacity for the guarantee to be withdrawn in the future if it is no longer needed for new contracts. This would be dependent on both the Corporation achieving sufficient maturity and scale and the community housing sector taking on a larger-scale and more prominent role in sub‑market rental housing, including through partnerships with the private sector and institutional investors. 


To provide certainty to investors it may only be withdrawn by the Government on a prospective basis after 1 July 2023 and with at least 60 days' notice. The availability of the guarantee will strengthen market confidence and thereby improve the NHFIC's ability to achieve its purposes.


The NHFIC is intended to be financially self-sustaining in the medium to long-term. The profits and funds returned from its investments will be available for reinvestment. In time, the NHFIC may accumulate surplus funds and be in a position to return a dividend to the Commonwealth. 


Finally, the Bill provides for a post implementation review to be carried out three years after the commencement of the Bill to ensure that the NHFIC is delivering its intended benefits. 


Passage of this Bill during the current sitting period will facilitate the necessary preparations to enable the Corporation to undertake its Infrastructure Facility and Bond Aggregator activities from 1 July 2018. 


Full details of the measure are contained in the Explanatory Memorandum.


NATIONAL HOUSING FINANCE AND INVESTMENT CORPORATION (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2018


SECOND READING SPEECH


This Bill deals with consequential and transitional matters arising from the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation Bill 2018. 


In particular, it amends the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 to exempt the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation (NHFIC) from the requirement to provide a statement setting out the findings and reasons for decisions relating to its activities where requested, for example by an unsuccessful applicant. This exemption will ensure the efficient administration of the NHFIC and is consistent with the exemption afforded to the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation.


The Bill also amends Schedule 2 to the Freedom of Information Act 1982 to exempt the NHFIC from the requirements of that Act in relation to documents pertaining to its commercial activities. This is similar to the exemption that applies on the commercial activities of the Export Finance Insurance Corporation, NBN Co and other entities, such as Indigenous Business Australia.


Finally, it provides for a transitional provision related to the operations of the NHFIC. While the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation Bill 2018 is intended to commence as soon as possible, the Government recognises that some time will be required for the NHFIC to be staffed—for example, for appointments to be made to the independent, skills based Board and a full time CEO to be engaged—as well as for the NHFIC's strategic policies and administrative processes and procedures to be developed. 


It has always been the Government's intention that the NHFIC will commence making decisions regarding the making of loans, investments or grants—that is, its core function—from 1 July 2018, and this is reflected in the transitional provision contained in this Bill.


Passage of the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation Bill 2018 and this Bill during the current sitting will enable the NHFIC to undertake its Infrastructure Facility and Bond Aggregator activities from 1 July 2018. 


Full details of the measure are contained in the Explanatory Memorandum. 


Debate adjourned.

Senator BUSHBY
 (Tasmania—Chief Government Whip in the Senate) (21:50):  Much has been made of the arrest of the Palestinian teenager Ahed Tamimi for slapping an Israeli soldier. Those promoting her cause would have us believe that Ms Tamimi is the poor victim of Israeli brutality, motivated by anger at the injuring of her cousin by Israeli troops into slapping a soldier trespassing on her land. 


The reality is very different. For the last five years Ahed Tamimi, and, to a lesser extent, her siblings, have become notorious for their constant efforts to provoke Israeli soldiers, to the extent that Ahed Tamimi, with her curly blonde hair, has become known as 'Shirley Temper'. The typical and often repeated modus operandi is for a Tamimi child to approach Israeli soldiers and slap, hit, kick, spit at and insult them, while the Tamimi family adults wait with camera in hand for the provoked soldiers to retaliate, so they can then show the world the so-called Israeli aggression against children. 


These exploits have earned Ahed and her family a significant social media following, especially among Palestinians. Ahed's mother, Nariman Tamimi, was filming the incident involving the soldiers and immediately following it asked Ahed what sort of message she wanted to convey to viewers. She was filmed saying: 


I hope that everyone will take part in the demonstrations as this is the only means to achieve the result. Our strength is in our stones, and I hope that the world will unite to liberate Palestine, because Trump made his declaration and—


the Americans— 


need to take responsibility for any response that comes from us. Whether it is stabbings or suicide bombings or throwing stones, everyone must do his part and we must unite in order for our message to be heard that we want to liberate Palestine.


I repeat, this poster girl for Palestinian innocence called for stabbing attacks, suicide bombings and the throwing of rocks. 


Sadly, it would appear likely that Ahed has been raised to seek and glorify violence. In fact, her parents, Bassem and Nariman, are also well-known for their anti-Semitic social media posts glorifying terror attacks and calling for the end of Israel. Other members of the family are convicted terrorists, including the mastermind of the Sbarro pizzeria bombing in 2001, which killed 15 people including Malki Roth, who was then the same age as Ahed is now and whose parents were Australian. 


Those professing such concern for Ahed's welfare should perhaps question whether her upbringing is akin to child abuse or to the use of child soldiers. At the very least, she is being exploited. In other circumstances, they would, rightly, be quick to condemn this. Instead, they are more likely to condemn Israel for supposed transgressions of Palestine rights, such as its arrest and detention of children, its system of military law in the West Bank and its check points and security barriers. 


Let's look at what's behind those. Yes, Israel arrests and detains Palestinian children. Most of those arrested are in their mid to late teens and are arrested for acts such as throwing rocks at cars or security forces, which can be lethal, and even more serious attacks such as stabbings and bombings. If children in Australia were throwing rocks at passing cars or at police, we would want them arrested and detained, too. Ahed herself was arrested not just for slapping a soldier but also for throwing rocks and for the incitement mentioned earlier. 


Yes, Israel has a separate system of military law for the West Bank. This is not out of a desire to discriminate against Palestinians but out of legal necessity. If Israel were to apply its own civil legal system to the West Bank, that would amount to annexation and would no doubt be roundly condemned. 


Yes, Israel carries out arrests, including of minors, in night-time raids. It does so because experience has shown this is far safer for both the Israeli forces and the local Palestinians than going in during the day, when Palestinians riot and attack the Israelis, and the Israelis are forced to defend themselves, leading to casualties on both sides. 


Yes, Israel has a security barrier to separate Palestinians from Israelis and has checkpoints, but these were built out of necessity. In the intifada launched in 2000 in the wake of Yasser Arafat's refusal to accept the Camp David peace offer, more than 1,000 Israelis were killed, and thousands more were seriously injured by Palestinian terrorism, including many notorious suicide bombings. The intifada was finally defeated by those measures. The checkpoints, other than those at the security barrier, are often unguarded, depending on the security situation at the time, and the security barrier can ultimately be relocated or removed, depending on the nature of any peace settlement.


One aspect of Palestinian violence that is not widely understood is the role of Palestinian incitement. Palestinian children like Ahed Tamimi are subjected to nonstop incitement and glorification of terror from the Palestinian National Authority, Israel's supposed peace partner. They get it in their schools, on TV, on the radio and in the mosques—constant messages that Israel is illegitimate and that the Jews stole their land. Israelis do commit crimes against Palestinians, including occasional terror attacks. But, when this happens, the perpetrators are pursued and arrested, and the attacks are condemned from the Prime Minister down. By contrast, the Palestinian authority name streets, public squares, community facilities and even children's soccer tournaments after Palestinian terrorists who have killed Israelis. Perhaps even more invidiously, Palestinian terrorists who are captured by Israel are paid generous lifetime pensions, far higher than the average wage, by the Palestinian authority—and, if they are killed in the attack, the pension goes to their family. The more serious the attack is, the higher the pension. The Palestinians apparently need billions of dollars of international aid each year, yet the Palestinian authority made US$347 million worth of such payments for terror in 2017 and has budgeted US$403 million for 2018. 


There are those who would say that all of this results from Israel's occupation of the West Bank, so let's consider why Israel is there. Israel took control of the West Bank from Jordan in 1967 in the course of a defensive war, the Six-Day War. It took the West Bank and, also, East Jerusalem from Jordan, following Jordanian attacks on Israeli positions. When Jordan occupied East Jerusalem, Jews were expelled, were barred from visiting the holy sites, and all synagogues were destroyed. By contrast, Israel allows all faiths control of and access to their holy sites in Jerusalem.


Immediately after the war, Israel offered to return land captured, in exchange for peace, but the meeting of the Arab League in Khartoum in August and September 1967 responded with the infamous three noes: no negotiation, no recognition and no peace. Despite this, in 1979, Israel agreed to return Sinai—also captured in 1967, but from Egypt—to Egypt, uprooting all Israeli settlements there, and has had a peace, albeit often cool, with Egypt ever since. In 2000, at Camp David, under the auspices of the Oslo accords, Israel offered Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat a state consisting of all of Gaza, most of the West Bank, a shared capital in Jerusalem and a settlement package for the Palestinian refugees. Arafat refused—despite being urged by many, including Saudi Arabia, to take the deal—and instead launched the intifada. An improved offer in early 2001 at Taba met the same response.


In 2005, Israel's Sharon government, searching for another way to achieve peace, withdrew completely from Gaza, leaving behind greenhouses and other agricultural infrastructure. The hope was that the Palestinians there would establish a peaceful, prosperous society living in harmony with Israel, and this would provide the impetus for further peace moves. The reality was, sadly, very different. The greenhouses were immediately destroyed, and rockets soon began flying over the border, aimed at Israeli communities. In 2007, Hamas staged a coup and took over control of Gaza. Since then, there have been in excess of 10,000 rockets and mortars fired at Israel from Gaza; terror tunnels have been constructed under the Israeli border, using vast amounts of international aid intended for Gaza civilians; and the result has been three wars.


In 2008, then Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert made an even more generous offer than those previously tendered. Under that peace plan offer, the Palestinian state would have all of Gaza and almost all of the West Bank, with land from inside Israel in compensation for the rest. There was to be a land bridge between the West Bank and Gaza; a shared capital in Jerusalem, with Palestinian control over Muslim holy sites; a limited return of Palestinian refugees to Israel; and compensation for all other Palestinian refugees and their millions of descendants. As Palestinian authority president Mahmoud Abbas recently admitted, he rejected the offer out of hand—again, without so much as a counteroffer.


It appears that the sticking point is that any agreement would require the Palestinians to genuinely accept Israel's right to exist in peace and that there could be no further claims, including the so-called return of the refugees and their millions of descendants. This influx of in excess of five million Palestinians would mean the end of Israel as a Jewish state and is therefore completely incompatible with the two-state peace the Palestinians profess to be seeking.


It is also worth noting that this demand for the return of not only the original refugees but their descendants—treating the descendants as refugees too—is a demand made only for Palestinians and is not repeated for any of the world's many refugee populations. Since the election of the Netanyahu government in 2008, Israeli measures to encourage peace talks have included an unprecedented 10-month moratorium on building in settlements, and the release of Palestinian prisoners. As you can see, the matter is not as simple as it appears. (Time expired)
