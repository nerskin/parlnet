"SPEAKER, The",N/A,2003-05-27,"—I was asked a number of questions on 15 May 2003 concerning the flexibility under the standing orders for a question asked of a member in their capacity as chair of a House of Representatives standing committee to be transferred to a minister. The member for Werriwa stated that standing order 143, which provides for questions to be addressed to private members, does not provide a flexibility of the kind that occasionally occurs under standing order 144, Questions to ministers. House of Representatives Practice states at page 521 that a minister:
may also transfer a question to another Minister and it is not in order to question the reason for doing so.
It also states that the Prime Minister may transfer a question to a minister directly responsible for a matter without any direct statement, request or overt action. However, the authority for transfer of this kind is—and I emphasise—the practice of the House. There is nothing explicit in standing order 144 to authorise it, nor is there a standing order or practice to discourage it. On this ground, there is no difference between standing order 143 and standing order 144.
On the last sitting day, the member for Macquarie transferred a question asked of him in his capacity as Chair of the Standing Committee on Education and Training to the Minister for Education, Science and Training. The question asked the committee chair for information relating to the committee that was on the public record, such as whether the committee was undertaking an inquiry into a certain matter and whether the committee had received certain evidence, which I understood to be evidence that the committee had authorised for publication. The question went on to ask for confirmation of certain expenditure reductions in the budget which, substantiated or not, quite clearly did not fall within the responsibility of the committee chair. The question then asked for information about the future of the committee inquiry and about meeting schedules. The last two matters in the question seemed to me to relate to committee matters not authorised for publication and not yet reported to the House. It would have been out of order for any member to provide information on the last two matters, and this was partly my reason for indicating to the House that there were constrained areas in which a question of that kind could be asked.
As the question was based on an allegation of expenditure reduction and the committee chair was not accountable to the House for the portfolio budget details, the question was transferred and the minister answered that part of the question that related to the minister's portfolio responsibilities. I would not have considered it to be in order if the minister's reply purported to accept responsibility for published committee matters or to attempt to canvass unauthorised committee matters. However, the minister's reply did not contain any such elements. Consequently, I do not agree with the assertion made by the member for Werriwa that the transfer of the question constituted a blurring of the separation of powers or with the member for Brand's contention that for the minister to answer the question would be evidence of a breach of privilege in revealing the internal workings of the committee not authorised for publication. The minister's answer concerned matters the subject of ministerial responsibility and I would have ruled out of order a response from any member that revealed private committee matters. I might add that the last part of the question by the member for Grayndler came perilously close to revealing private committee matters in interrogative form, and it was for that reason that I indicated to the House after he had asked the question that the latter part of the question went beyond constrained permitted areas.
In summary, there is nothing in the standing orders or House of Representatives Practice to prevent a committee chair seeking to transfer a question or part of a question involving ministerial responsibility to the minister concerned. The minister may answer in regard to a matter within his or her ministerial responsibilities, and this may include a question coinciding in subject matter with a current committee inquiry. It is open to a committee chair to respond to those parts of a question pertaining to committee chairs' committee responsibilities. However, as I indicated to the House, there are restraints on what the committee chair could answer. Page 524 of House of Representatives Practice was quoted on 15 May. That publication also states at page 528:
It has been held to be out of order to ask a question ... which refers to proceedings in committee ... not reported to the House.
Page 524 also states:
In any question to a chair of a committee it should be borne in mind that a chair should not make public pronouncements on behalf of the committee unless the committee has been consulted and given its permission beforehand.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER</title>,<title>Standing Orders 143 and 144</title>,Questions to the Speaker,6,1
"McMullan, Bob, MP",ALP,2003-05-27,"—Thank you very much, Mr Speaker; it will be worth waiting for. On page 5 of today's Financial Review we see on one page the government's double standard personified. In the left-hand column we have a report saying:
The chief executive of Telstra, Ziggy Switkowski, would receive a payout equivalent to 52 weeks' salary if he was told to go before his contract expired.
And in the right-hand column we have:
The Minister for Industrial Relations—
and it says here his name is Tony Abbott—
said the minimum standard, set in 1984—
eight weeks—
was fair and reasonable, and should be maintained.
Same page, same newspaper, same day, same government—but two standards. How is it possible to simultaneously believe both things: that 52 weeks is fine for somebody on $2.4 million a year—that is, somewhere between $1½ million and $2½ million dollars—but eight weeks is fine for the average worker? For an average worker on average weekly earnings, that is about $5,000. This is a government that supports redundancy payments of $2 million for the well-paid and $5,000 for the low-paid. It is an extraordinarily stark illustration of the government's proliferating double standards and wrong priorities.
Let me take you to the example raised by the member for Prospect at question time concerning the hotel valet from Sydney who appeared before the Senate poverty inquiry yesterday. This is not one of the government's job snobs; she is not a dole bludger or whatever other invective you want to pour over her. This is a woman who is working very hard to raise five children on the princely sum of $18,000 a year. As the member for Prospect's question made clear today, this woman would have to work for 100 years to earn as much as the government-appointed directors to Telstra believe that the chief executive should be paid. With the chief executive's agreement, they are saying, `We'll pay him this million if he fails; if we feel the need to get rid of him early, we'll pay him $1 million,' whereas this woman is being told, `If you do a fantastic job every year for 100 years, you might just get as much as the chief executive will get for failing.' That is a statement of alternative priorities.
I know that the government will wash its hands of this decision by the directors of Telstra. It will say, `That's an independent decision.' But with any other company when there is a big payout, it says, `We urge the shareholders to have a say.'
—I hear the minister say, `And the directors'. But, when the government is talking about other companies, the Treasurer comes in here and says, `Of course the shareholders can direct the directors as to what they should do.' On 5 March in this place, he explicitly said that: `The shareholders can direct the directors as to what they should do.' 
—They won't give you a legislative right to have a vote on it.
—We will come to that point; thank you very much. When the government is the majority shareholder, it suddenly loses interest in shareholder activism—`That's for other people; that's the standard we apply to everybody else—not to us.'
There is another double standard which has been so generously referred to by the member for Kingston. On Sunday the Minister for Revenue was on television—the government really should not let her out on television; every time she appears on television she causes the government problems—and she said, `It's a terrific thing; the shareholders in the UK in Glaxo Smith Kline have sent a clear message.' Those shareholders voted in a shareholders meeting against excessive salary package proposals that the directors were putting forward to that meeting; they voted them down. The Minister for Revenue said, `This is a very good sign.'
The problem is that she and her Senate colleagues, on the instructions of this government, voted down our proposal to give Australian shareholders the same power. We proposed an amendment exactly the same as the British law, and they voted it down. I do not think in this instance it is fair to say it is hypocrisy; I think in the case of this minister it is absolute ignorance. She did not know that she had voted it down. She did not know what her government's policy was. But it cannot be ignorance to advocate at the same time that low-paid workers should get $5,000 and high-paid workers should get $1 million or $2 million or $50 million, as was the case with BHP.
It actually gets worse. Like the woman who gave evidence to the Senate poverty inquiry, many people work in the hotel industry. We all know that the hotel industry employs long-term casuals, people who have been working as casuals for years. We know what their redundancy entitlements are: jack zip; they get nothing. Do you know what the government's policy is? `That is how it should remain.' The government will intervene in this decision against them getting a cracker. If they work 10 times as long as Ziggy Switkowski has worked, the government's view is that they should get nothing. If they work their whole career as casuals—and these days you can, and in the hotel industry lots of people do—they will get nothing. We find this pattern occurring. The government's policy is that they should get nothing—`No redundancies for casuals.' But the government is very casual about giving millions to the well-paid, the people who run the companies that employ the casuals.
The clearest and most unfair element of the government's double standards in this matter is this: `Those who have the most should get the most.' It is nothing unusual. It is exactly what happens, for example, with the baby bonus. The more income you have, the more assistance you get. It is exactly the same. It is not a mistake; it is a conscious, deliberate policy decision of the government to structure the payment so that people with the highest income get the most. It is not surprising.
It also applies to access to universities. If you have more income, you have more avenues of access; you can buy your way in. But if you have a low income you have to work your way in. We have not got a two-tier system in Australia; we have a three-tier system. You have the wealthiest, who can buy their way in; the poorest, who hope they will get the chance to get some sort of scholarship; and everybody in the middle, who gets squeezed. That is happening in more and more areas. It is happening in education and it is happening in health. We are getting double and triple standards here. We are getting triple the benefit up the top end and nothing down the bottom.
Not long ago a very stark table about golden handshakes was produced by the AAP and printed in a number of newspapers. It was not a comprehensive study. To do a comprehensive study, you would have to go through every annual report of every company, and you would have to read behind those reports to find out how much of the remuneration of various executives was that of chief executives. The AAP only went on reported statements to the Stock Exchange and the publicly reported major payouts. It came to an amount of $168 million in golden handshakes. That is a lot of money.
But let us think about the second part of it, where the government has another double standard. At the moment, 30 per cent of that $168 million, or the $50 million last week from BHP, or the $33 million from the Commonwealth Bank, is a tax deduction for the company. They get that off their tax bill and we all subsidise it. That woman who is working in the hotel is subsidising it too. She is subsidising Brian Gilbertson's money. How can that be right? How can that be fair? We have an extraordinary set of circumstances with that $168 million, but the government is determined not to do anything about it. They continue to say, `It is not us.' Let me give you some other examples of double standards. The Minister for Revenue—I said they should not let her out in public—said that we would be going down a very dangerous path if we started to use denying tax deductibility to influence the remuneration policies of governance. Once again, this is probably ignorance, not deliberate misleading.
—It is just stupidity.
—That is a possibility.
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—The member for Brisbane has been warned already today.
—I have.
—His next move will be out.
—He is being very helpful, Mr Deputy Speaker. It is the case that the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer probably does not know anything about the tax act. But in the tax act there is a provision, and it has been there for the whole time of her administration and for the whole time of the Treasurer's administration—ever since 1996—and, of course, before, because it is an initiative of the last Labor government. That provision says that, if there are excessive contributions to an executive's superannuation, they are not tax deductible. We already have that law. It has been the law for 10 years, thus for the whole period of the Treasurer's administration. So it is not a question of them saying, `This is a terrible principle. We cannot allow such excessive payments to be tax deductible. It is a heinous principle with which we cannot live,' because they do live with it. They have adopted it, and they have carried it out consistently for seven years. It is that they do not want to do it. It is not that they cannot do it. We have proved we can do it, because we have done it before. It is not that they are opposed to it in principle, because the principle applies. It is that they do not want to act on these golden handshakes.
Any time you ask the Treasurer a question, he will give you a song and dance act in reply. He is quite a good actor but he has no substance. If you ask him two questions, you always get two different answers. When he comes in and you ask him about golden handshakes, he tries to give you a lecture about tax policy—except he is wrong. He consistently says, `Look, the way the tax act works is that companies declare their profit, they get their revenue, they get their expenses, they take one away from the other and they pay tax on the difference, so all their expenses are tax deductible.' Then you say, `But that is not the law, actually. There are already exceptions. We do not allow them to have tax deductions for entertainment. We do not allow them to have tax deductions for corporate yachts. We do not allow those, because we passed a law to stop it.' Then he comes up with a different answer. Then we say, `What about the fact that you do not allow excessive superannuation contributions?' He says, `Every expense is tax deductible, except those carved out for some other reason of public policy.'
Exactly. We want you to carve it out for a reason of public policy, which is, every time someone wants you to take an attitude about excessive golden handshakes, the government will be there in 30 seconds and will express an opinion. They will say, `We understand why the public is very concerned about this, and we will put on a serious face, but don't you dare ask us to do anything about it. We'll run for cover.' We get a different excuse every day, and we will hear another one today. I do not know what it will be. I bet it is not any of those, because none of them make sense. There will be some other excuse. I would love to hear what Senator Coonan's answer would be, but they will not let her out in public again.
If it is good enough to deny tax deductibility for excessive superannuation contributions—and it is—why is it not good enough to take the same action over excessive golden handshakes? Why should these massive payments continue to receive taxpayer subsidy? Ordinary working Australians are subsidising this every day when they work, and they have this outrageous aspiration. They say, `If it is all right for Brian Gilbertson to get $50 million and me to subsidise it, and Chris Cuffe to get $33 million and me to subsidise it, and a lot of other people to get a lot more, why can't I have 16 weeks redundancy pay?' I know that is a pretty terrible attitude for them to have. They ought to be grateful that this kind government has not taken the eight weeks away. They ought to be grateful. They are terrible people. They are saying, `Maybe if these people are worth $15 million, I am worth $10,000.' That is about 16 weeks of average weekly earnings. Actually, I am being a bit generous in saying $10,000. It is a bit less. But we will say $10,000. They reckon that is not a bad deal. I do not think it is a bad deal either.
The head of the Commonwealth Bank said to the government, `Let's sit around and talk about how we can restrain these excessive golden handshakes, including looking at tax deductibility.' He thought it was a reasonable proposition. We think it is a reasonable proposition. The Australian people think it is a reasonable proposition. The only people who do not think that are the government. They think that there are excessive payouts being made and that they are all being paid to workers. The government will not meet the redundancy entitlement of workers beyond eight weeks, but they will let the chief executives have 52 weeks and more and they will not do more than talk. They are all talk and no action on this matter. This affects every working Australian whose superannuation contributions are invested in these companies—whose retirement income is dependent on the success and good governance of these companies. The government's performance on golden handshakes is a litany of double standards, wrong priorities and failure to act. It is a monstrous betrayal of the battlers.

"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2003-05-27,"—On this question, our talk and action are precisely the same as the talk and action of our predecessors. On the question of worker redundancy entitlements and on the question of executive redundancy entitlements, the government are pursuing precisely the same policies that were pursued by the Hawke government and the Keating government. The interesting thing about this matter of public importance debate today has not been what the shadow Treasurer did say but what he did not say. He did say that the opposition supports the ACTU's claim for a doubling of redundancy entitlements. He did say that he supports the ACTU's claim for an extension, for the first time, of redundancy entitlements to casuals. But he did not say that he supports the ACTU's claim for an extension, for the first time, of redundancy entitlements to the employees of small business.
This is an important question that the opposition should answer, but it has not done so. Does the opposition support the ACTU's claim to extend for the first time to the employees of small business standard redundancy entitlements? If the opposition does support it, it is supporting an additional contingent liability of more than $6,000 for every long-serving employee of every small business. That is what it is supporting: an additional contingency liability of that amount at least, which would be a very serious burden on small business. If it does not support it, yes, it is failing to support its colleagues, but it is supporting the responsible position of governments that have to take responsibility for their actions—unlike this opposition and the state Labor governments of Queensland and Western Australia.
There are no double standards here from our government; there are no double standards whatsoever. There are established procedures which the government are following. We support the worker redundancy entitlements supported by the Hawke government and approved by the Industrial Relations Commission in the redundancy test case of 1984. We support the approach to executive payments taken by the Hawke and Keating governments. We are doing precisely what was good enough for Labor governments in the past. It is good enough for our government in this respect now and it ought to be good enough for the opposition at this time. There are no double standards. There were no double standards then; there are no double standards now.
We in the government are against golden handshakes. We are against excessive golden handshakes wheresoever they take place. The shadow Treasurer made a great play of the 52-week entitlement of Ziggy Switkowski, should he be made redundant prior to the conclusion of his current contract. I happen to think that that is too much; I happen to think that that is far too much. But I should also point out to the House that by contemporary standards it is not actually excessive. Public servants—most of them—are entitled to up to 48 weeks redundancy and Ansett workers were entitled to even more redundancy. In fact, the high cost of redundancies was one of the reasons why Ansett collapsed. If you cannot afford to restructure, you cannot afford to keep your business going and you cannot afford to keep jobs. The government are being perfectly consistent. We are against excessive redundancy entitlements for executives and we are against excessive redundancy entitlements for workers. We do not like the golden handshake mindset, we do not like the golden handshake culture and we do not like it wherever we see it.
This is a government which is about rewarding success. It does not want to reward failure. This is a government which wants to encourage employing people, not entrenching people. This is a government which believes people should earn more to keep their job than to lose it. One thing this government will never do is play the class war card the way members opposite have, and it will never try to pretend that you can lift some people up by dragging other people down. This government will never stoop so low. This used to be the view of the Australian Labor Party prior to 1996 when it was in government—when it had to, at least sometimes, take the national interest into account and before it adopted the dictum of the member for Werriwa that oppositions can afford to be irresponsible.
We heard the shadow Treasurer mocking the Treasurer. Let me read to the shadow Treasurer what another Treasurer said back in November 1990 when asked by Kerry O'Brien about what were then regarded as excessive pay rises to executives. Paul Keating said:
... there's not been as much restraint as there should have been in executive remuneration ...
Well, that is true. It was true then; it is true now. He continued:
... but I'm about as responsible for Andre Maroney's salary as I am for yours, Kerry—which would be well into six figures, like his.
He went on to say:
... and I am not responsible ministerially in any way for your salary—
No, he was not, because it was set by the ABC management, just as Ziggy Switkowski's salary is set by the Telstra board—
or executive salaries in the executive area, which is a relatively thin slice of salaries in this country. But we've tried to manage aggregate wages. Now the person at the Coca Cola bottle line you showed us—
You see, Kerry O'Brien back then was doing the same trick that members opposite are doing now—that is, comparing a worker on low pay with an alleged fat cat on high pay. So they are just recycling Kerry O'Brien of 1990 here in 2003. The then Treasurer Paul Keating said:
... the person at the Cola Cola bottle line you showed us, if we hadn't had wage restraint ...  that person might not have that job.
There we are. The position that this government has taken is entirely vindicated by former Treasurer and former Prime Minister Paul Keating, who said that it was not the government's role to regulate executive salaries. It is the government's role to try to ensure pay restraint so that workers can maximise their jobs, their employment, and it is perfectly reasonable to have the same kind of redundancy test case standard now as the one it was reasonable to have all those years ago in the life of the Labor government. I have to say that higher office did not change Paul Keating's view. Back in 1995—by which time he was Prime Minister—he said at a doorstop:
But executive salaries are not set in any industrial tribunal, and therefore the Government has no option to appeal them when these remunerative packages are set.
What is good for Paul Keating—in this case at least—is right for this government, and it certainly ought to be good and right for members opposite.
I entirely accept that someone earning, in the case of the lady cited by the member for Prospect, $306 a week is doing it tough. I entirely accept that. What the member for Prospect failed to point out was that, according to the same newspaper article, the lady in question was receiving some $300 through the welfare system. I accept that, even on $606 a week, she is still doing it tough. But the fact is the government have increased her pay, because wages have gone up substantially under our government. We have also increased the benefits that she is receiving through the welfare system. On top of that, in the last budget we reduced tax.
The shadow Treasurer made great play of the fact that this lady is paying tax and that, because she is paying tax, she is in some way supporting Brian Gilbertson. That is fair enough, if you want to make that kind of cheap, class war ridden debating point, but let me also point out that Mr Gilbertson is paying tax to support her. That is the way the system works. It is just as well that we have a system which encourages people to work, to invest and to better themselves, a system that encourages companies to go out, devise new products, create new markets and build wealth, because only through that system is it possible to have the kind of taxation and welfare system that helps women like the one in question.
As I said, this is a government which has delivered higher pay, lower taxes and more jobs to the working people of Australia. This is a government which has reformed the structures of our economy so that working people get a better deal. The greatest indictment of the former government is that, after 13 years in office, the structural rate of unemployment that they left in the mid-1990s was no less than 8½ per cent. That is what the OECD said. After seven years of the Howard government, thanks to sustained reforms—most of them achieved despite the opposition of the Australian Labor Party—structural unemployment has fallen to about 5½ per cent.
—We have to do more; we have to keep doing it.
—The member for Moreton is right: it is not good enough, but it is better than what we had before. It is a sign of what can be achieved by the kinds of policies which this government has pursued. The best thing you can do for the battlers of Australia is to provide more jobs and give them the chance to get ahead. That is precisely what this government has done, through better economic management and particularly through its sustained low interest rate policies, which of course would be threatened by the socialism-revisited policies that the shadow Treasurer is now advocating. This government has delivered more jobs through better education and training policies, promoted first by the member for Goldstein and, more recently, by the member for Bradfield. Again, these policies would be threatened by the `socialism in one country' approach now adopted by the shadow Treasurer. This government has delivered better practical outcomes to the battlers of this country through its improved welfare system—again, a system that would be threatened by the kind of reversion to socialism that the shadow Treasurer now seems to be advocating.
On the topic of who has and who has not done more to empower shareholders to restrain excessive executive packages, let me point out that this government has already changed the law to crack down on executives who rip off their companies. The government has particularly changed the law to ensure that executives who arrange the affairs of their companies so as to stop workers' entitlements being paid can be subject to very heavy penalties indeed. Under the CLERP 9 package, further changes will be effected to further enhance the accountability and transparency of company procedures and to further enhance the ability of shareholders to control executive excess.
I should also point out that, according to the Mercer quarterly salary review, growth in both base salaries and total remuneration for senior managers has been trending down over the last six years. So, at the same time that the government has boosted the take-home pay and the after-tax pay of the average worker, pay increases at the executive level have been trending down. This is a government which has done the right thing by the workers of Australia without in any way unleashing a `greed is good' boom for the executives of Australia. Intelligent Labor members understand this.
—Name them!
—I once thought that the member for Werriwa was an intelligent Labor member, but that was before he had the brain explosion of May last year, when he suddenly committed himself to the doctrine of everlasting hatred. The great achievement of the Hawke-Keating government was that Labor members at last realised that the market was respectable. They at last learnt that Adam Smith was right and Karl Marx was wrong. Now they have forgotten that lesson, a lesson painfully learnt over 13 years. They have gone back to the class war; they have reinvented socialism. But the real problem is that they do not know what they believe. The leadership crisis between two proven failures that is currently engulfing them is a symptom of a deeper crisis—a crisis of identity and a crisis of belief. They will never solve their leadership crisis until they work out who they represent and what they stand for.

"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2003-05-27,"—I remember the then minister for workplace relations saying in 1998, `Never forget the history of politics and never forget which side we're on. We're on the side of making profit; we're on the side of people owning private capital.' It is as true today as it ever was, and every single day we see a million different examples of this government being on the side of the wealthy and against working Australians in this country.
No clearer illustration can we find than the government's refusal to do anything about obscene executive payouts at the same time as preventing ordinary Australians getting even their basic entitlements if they lose their jobs. There is an absolute unwillingness to protect the rights of ordinary workers.
Tales of excessive executive remuneration and obscene golden handshakes have been rife in recent years. Some of the most notable have included the $33 million paid by the Commonwealth to Chris Cuffe; the $23 million that AMP paid to departing executives; and the BHP Billiton payment to Brian Gilbertson, who walked away with a lump sum of $12 million. Estimates vary about what he is going to get over his lifetime, but $1.5 million a year for life is not too bad. That of course comes after John Prescott getting $11 million out of BHP in 1998 and Paul Anderson getting a further $18 million from BHP. If you are a BHP shareholder, you would be thinking very hard about their executive remuneration schemes. 
The Prime Minister has grudgingly admitted that perhaps executive remuneration packages should be linked to performance. He said on Brisbane radio:
The one thing you've got to do is stop entering into absurdly generous payout arrangements in the first place, and very definitely it's got to be geared to performance.
He further said:
What they really resent is people walking away with a pile of money when the company has been unsuccessful.
It does not take a genius to work that out. The Prime Minister has done nothing, however, to end these practices—not a thing. He says it is a `big step' for government to intervene in the executive salary issue. He says:
... once the Government intervenes ... you're effectively saying that you can determine who gets paid what by a private company, that's a very big step that.
It is only a very big step when you are talking about executive pay; it is not a big step for the government to intervene in national wage cases and argue against the moderate increases that the ACTU proposes for low-paid workers in this country. It is not a big step to argue that low-paid workers do not deserve a single extra cent, but it is a big step to prevent executives walking away with $30 million or $50 million payouts.
What is interesting is that the government think that the market can sort out all these problems. Unfortunately, a recent Sydney University report into executive remuneration suggests this is not the case. The report, which was commissioned by the New South Wales Labour Council, in fact found the opposite: the more you pay executives, the worse their performance seems to be. It found that in the 20 best-performing corporations executives were paid an average of about 20 times average full-time weekly earnings, or about $1 million per annum. The 20 worst performers paid their CEOs three times that amount, or $3 million per annum.
The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations kept referring to the Keating government in relation to this issue of executive remuneration. At the time of the Keating government, the pay of the top 50 executives was about 22 times average full-time weekly earnings. That has jumped to 74 times average full-time weekly earnings. We are not talking about the same problem; we are talking about a problem that is out of control.
Remember the chairman of Newcrest awarding his board of directors a $300,000 pay rise in a year when Newcrest made a $53 million loss; or a director of Macquarie Bank taking home a $4.2 million bonus on top of his pay in a year when company profits slumped 35 per cent? Certainly these pays are not performance related.
When the minister for workplace relations did introduce some legislation in 2002 after the appalling events at One.Tel and the $14 million bonuses paid to Jodee Rich and Brad Keeling, the legislation was totally inadequate. It certainly did not go anywhere near the legislation brought in in the United States, and the very sensible suggestions that we made were rejected by the government. We had to come up with our own suggestions in this area because the government has failed to act so consistently.
We have said that shareholders should have a right to veto executive packages when they are excessive, in the same way that this right exists in Britain, a right that was exercised recently at a GlaxoSmithKline meeting of shareholders at which the chief executive, Jean-Pierre Garnier—who would have been paid 22 million if he were fired—was told by shareholders that that was just not appropriate. The government wants us to be a nation of shareholders but it does not want us to be active shareholders. It does not want involved shareholders who hold executives to account.
The second proposal that we have put forward is that we should stop making these payouts tax deductible. Figures from March this year show that executive payouts have cost taxpayers—taxpayers, not companies—$49.9 million. That is $50 million worth of subsidy for these executive payouts. If companies want to pay executives $30 million or $50 million or whatever and the shareholders agree then let the companies bear the cost of those incredible payments. We say that payments over $1 million should not be tax deductible.
The government's glaring inability or unwillingness to take on their big business mates is in sharp contrast to their willingness to stomp on ordinary workers. The government have consistently resisted every effort to give ordinary workers decent redundancy payments. The ACTU test case that the government are opposing would establish a fair minimum standard for all long-serving employees regardless of where they live or work—including casuals, who currently receive no redundancy entitlements at all, no matter how long they have been in a job.
The minister for workplace relations naturally is treating this proposal like a disaster: the sky is going to fall in; it is the end of capitalism as we know it. We have heard this afternoon that it is a return to socialism! Every time a protection is proposed for ordinary workers in this country it means massive redundancies, according to this minister for workplace relations. You wonder whether we would ever have got a 40-hour week under this minister. Sixteen weeks of redundancy pay for ordinary workers is the end of the world but a year for Ziggy Switkowski is just fine according to this minister.
The government's own efforts to protect employee entitlements have been absolutely dismal—unless you happen to be Stan Howard, in which case they have been perfectly good. A recent Auditor-General's report into the Employee Entitlements Support Scheme, which was replaced with the General Employee Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme—or GEERS as it is affectionately known—said that this `was not a well-managed program'. That is what the Auditor-General said. A significant number of claims were not cleared within a year and some took longer than two years. This is for a scheme that does not pay 100 per cent of employee entitlements, a scheme that is capped; so if your boss goes broke so do you. Workers who have worked for many years, many decades, do not get the money for which they have worked and to which they are entitled.
The member for Prospect has introduced a private member's bill into this place six times now, seeking to remedy this situation. Labor has a scheme that would pay 100 per cent of employee entitlements in the event of company insolvency, with the very moderate impost of a 0.1 per cent payroll levy. Reports into insolvency suggest that workers from insolvent companies around Australia could be losing over $140 million annually, and this government absolutely refuses to act. What happens on retirement? If you are the Governor-General, you get $150 a year for the rest of your life—
Opposition members—That's $150,000!
—$150,000 a year for the rest of your life. This is for a Governor-General who has let down the children that were under his care when he was Archbishop of Brisbane and a Governor-General who has let down this country—yet an ordinary worker could not dream of riches like that, certainly not as an annual salary or wage. That is more than most workers can expect to see in their superannuation payout, particularly if this government has its way in watering down and weakening superannuation in this country. This government has become absolutely legend for its double standards, but nowhere is its hypocrisy more apparent than in the area of redundancy pay, where there is one rule for wealthy executives and another for ordinary workers.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Howard Government: Workplace Relations</title>,Matters of Public Importance,11,1
"Cadman, Alan, MP",LP,2003-05-27,"—I do not think anybody in this House really endorses golden handshakes for poor performances. I do not think anybody wants to think that company executives should be rewarded for failure, disappointment and loss of investment. But it is interesting today that the Australian Labor Party appears to have chosen to attack the golden handshake rather than to get behind the ACTU and back their redundancy claims, currently before the commission. It appears that the Australian Labor Party wants to support the ACTU in this process, but is not prepared to nominate increased redundancy payments as a new policy.
I would just like to remind the House that these well-intentioned policies, or coat-trailing by the Australian Labor Party, led to a situation where the very people that they claim to represent were, over a period of 13 years, ground down to poor and uncertain circumstances where unemployment rose to over one million people, despite record opportunities in the economy. Australian workers actually suffered a salary reduction—a wage loss—of five per cent in real terms over the period of 13 years of Australian Labor Party government. In contrast to that, we now have stable interest rates where the workers that the Australian Labor Party claim to represent can actually buy their own homes, where there are job opportunities and where we have record employment. Over a million jobs have been created—not lost—during the period of this government. Not only are interest rates low and employment opportunities high; we have had an increase in salaries and wages of 10 per cent over the period that this government has been in office.
Compare the two ways of doing things. Under the Labor government, workers, who the ALP claim to represent, were punished and screwed down with a loss of salary and an inability to purchase their own home and their jobs were threatened, whereas the party the ALP claims does not represent the Australian worker has provided a 10 per cent real increase in salaries and wages, has provided a stable opportunity for people to buy their own home and has increased employment opportunities. It is unbelievable that the party that has so lost its way is going back to the same policies that destroyed it previously—the same policies that will keep it in opposition. The Australian people remember what it did. Small business, which the honourable member opposite is familiar with, certainly remembers the impost of unfair dismissal and the attempts of this government to get rid of unfair dismissal provisions on small business.
It has been said that the proposals for changes to the redundancy provisions have the potential to destroy thousands of jobs. It is claimed by representatives of small business that Australian business at large could have its costs increased by 30 per cent by these redundancy claims by the ACTU but that they would increase the amount of small businesses' redundancy payments by 300 per cent. Not only are they refusing in the Australian Labor Party to acknowledge that the unfair dismissal impost needs to be removed from small business; they want to pile another impost on top of it by supporting the ACTU redundancy claims. Representatives of Australian business have said that you have to bear in mind that, if you are made redundant, you are facing at least 22 weeks of unemployment, yet in our federal system the maximum entitlement of redundancy is eight weeks. That is what the union representatives claim. It sounds good but, when it went into practice, with all the accords and all the things that were written down with the cooperation of the ACTU and the Australian Labor Party, it produced disaster.
This proposal, which sounds good, leads to the very opposite of what it is designed to do. You have only got to go through some of the statements made here in the House by my colleagues in the Australian Labor Party. I will just quote one, where it was said:
On the other side of the fence, the Labor opposition and our industrial partners in the trade union movement are remorseless in the protection of workers' rights in all aspects of industrial relations.
That was the very attitude—from Frank Mossfield, a good bloke, the member for Greenway—that produced the very things that went wrong with the previous Labor government: the record interest rates, the record unemployment. The alternatives are now in place.
The member goes on in speeches of this type to talk about the industrial relations laws in Australia being formulated on the master-servant relationship and the ultimate authority to hire and fire. He talks about the ultimate advantage of employers over employees and says this advantage is strengthened in the current period of soft employment opportunities when unemployment has been in second gear at between six and eight per cent for the last six years. He is absolutely wrong. At six per cent it is far below anything that the Australian Labor Party could achieve, and by anybody's standards—world standards, the OECD standards; any measurable standards—the Australian economy is not in second gear. The Australian Labor Party are kidding themselves with this line that they are trying to run today.
I am disappointed that they are so thin of ability and so short of ideas that they cannot do anything but pick up a union movement proposal and say, `We won't run the union line; what we'll do is we'll attack the high-flyers.' I would like to think that any union member would have the opportunity of becoming a high-flyer. If you are going to restrict the whole process and regulate it out of sight, you are going to hamper that opportunity for growth and for aspiration that we need to see and that drives the Australian workplace.
—Stalinist.
—I agree with my colleague. It is fascinating stuff when Wayne Swan, member for Lilley, talks about the bills in the Senate making it easier to sack workers and put up the prices of essential medicines. Wayne Swan talks about how the government will not do anything about paid maternity leave and will not fix the debt trap in the family payment system, and he goes on with a litany of whinges about what the government will not do for workers. But the government has produced greater salaries, more employment, lower interest rates—
—What about executive payouts?
—And I now come, as I am invited to do, to the golden handshake. I have said already in this speech that payment for bad performance is not on. Payments for poor performance allow executives to send a company down the mine and then claim a golden handshake. But it is a bit like Centenary House. It is a bit like the contract that the Australian Labor Party has with the Audit Office; it cannot be broken. Once a CEO has signed on with a company, he is there. That agreement, if badly thought through or badly entered into or designed to pay a person for bad performance, no matter what the circumstances, is like the jolly Centenary House down the road: you cannot break the contract but the money still has to be paid out. The analogy that I draw in this instance is that the money has to be paid out to the Australian Labor Party under a contract that is unbelievably bad.
I support the comments made by the Prime Minister and others on the golden handshake situation: poor performance should not be rewarded. Changes to CLERP 9 have been proposed by my colleague the member for North Sydney who has just entered the chamber. There are proposals for disclosure under CLERP 9. Today we are looking at the failure of the Australian Labor Party to really get behind the union movement. They have chosen instead to attack golden handshakes, something that this government, from the Prime Minister down, does not support. Golden handshakes are not supported by this government. It must be easier to have a shot at a CEO than it is to do anything constructive about more jobs, lower inflation and better opportunities for Australian workers—as this government has. The opposition have failed and they have indicated today in their comments that they will continue to fail.

"Dutton, Peter, MP",LP,2003-05-27,"—I want to continue my speech on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004 tonight in the same vein in which I started last night; that is, to comment on how this budget and how this government generally have been providing for families, not just in my electorate but right across the nation. It needs to be put in these terms. After our commitment to Iraq, which totalled some $750 million, after our commitment to strengthening our borders and to strengthening the Australian economy and after facing the worst drought in living memory, this government, despite all that expenditure, was still able to deliver two things: a surplus in excess of $2 billion and modest tax cuts for all Australians.
I think that people in my electorate most appreciate that, whilst those tax cuts are modest, the government had to face enormous expenditure in preparing the budget. The people in my electorate recognise that. The other thing they say to me is that this budget stands in stark contrast to the budgets that have been brought down around Australia by Labor governments in each of the eight states and territories. Indeed, we are waiting with great anticipation for the Queensland budget, which comes up very soon. People in Queensland are worried—as, rightly, people in Victoria are, where 300 taxes have increased, and as are people right around the nation. Once again, the Labor Party are in a situation of economic mismanagement in the same way that they were irresponsible with regard to the Australian economy over their 13 years of power right up until 1996 when this government came into being.
One of the most significant measures the Howard government has been able to deliver to young families and small business is low interest rates. We now have a period of sustainable low interest rates. We have not seen such a period for 30 years. Very proudly I am able to speak with young families in my electorate. They are in a better position not just because of the low interest rates we have been able to deliver but also because of the first home buyers grant and other economic measures this government has been able to deliver to young families right across Australia.
We have been able to repay $63 billion of the $96 billion in Labor debt we inherited when we came to power in 1996. In no small way should people think that is responsible for lowering of interest rates and being able to keep interest rates at these 30-year record lows. Interest rates are now at 6½ per cent. For families with a mortgage of $100,000, that represents a saving of almost $4,000 a year. I think that, because house prices have increased dramatically in recent years, we have a situation which provides much certainty for many young Australian families.
We have been able to deliver in the areas of employment and jobs growth. This government is very proud of the fact that, since we came to power, we have created 1.1 million jobs. Indeed, the unemployment rate has fallen from the 8.6 per cent it was under Labor and when we came to government, to 6.1 per cent now. We are very committed to driving that rate as low as possible. One of the other facts that the Australian Labor Party do not like to hear is that unemployment peaked at 10.9 per cent under Labor and, indeed, stayed at over 10 per cent for 28 consecutive months. The Labor Party do not want to tell you that, under this government, real wages have grown by 10.6 per cent, whereas they only grew by 2.3 per cent under Labor over the period of 13 years while they were in government.
As I said, this government was able to deliver a balanced budget with modest tax cuts. Most tax cuts are on the back of the most significant tax cuts ever introduced in this country, when the government took the responsible action of delivering a new and fairer taxation system in July 2000. For my electorate that has meant that funding has been able to be provided to bodies like MISA, which provides a tremendous service within my electorate and indeed right across north Brisbane. I have spoken about the work of MISA before. Tonight I want to thank the Treasurer for his ability to deliver a budget which has provided the circumstances to see funding for MISA continue.
We want to increase funding for those sorts of organisations and we want to continue to be in a position where, after having repaid that significant amount of Labor debt, we can now contribute about $5 billion towards those sorts of programs because we are saving money in interest. The other significant funding provided to my electorate is in the area of child care. I commend the minister responsible for that area, because there has been a record allocation under this government of around $8 billion for child care over the next four years. It is significant: a record $1.6 billion was spent on child care in 2001-02. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2003-2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,2003-05-27,"—After unveiling his higher education package in the budget, the Minister for Education, Science and Training should take on what I think many of us would see as a more appropriate title: the minister for revenue. What he presented to the nation was not, in fact, a plan for the future of our universities or the development of high-level teaching and research but a program to increasingly push the burden of higher education onto students and their families.
It contains nothing to help those young Australians who currently want to get into university but cannot get a place. It does not redress the acute financial crisis that this government has created in our higher education system. It is a vision for higher education that fails to go beyond what many see as the predictable and narrow limits of the government's own thinking on social and economic policy. It is now very clear that we have a mindless application of the user-pays principle in this university package, stapled to an anti-worker industrial agenda. On top of that, there is a pretty petty attack on student organisations.
What the government intends to do as part of its higher education package is increase university fees—HECS fees—by up to 30 per cent. They intend to reserve 50 per cent of university places for the wealthy, introducing loans of up to $50,000 at a six per cent interest rate. There is going to be the addition of just 2,116 university places for new students by 2007. These are the things that this government stands for in higher education. The most constructive measure that has been outlined by the government—the establishment of adequate funding for almost 25,000 university places that are currently underfunded—merely addresses a problem of the government's own making. Those university places were introduced by the Howard government in 1998 to allow universities to offer places which did not attract full government funding. They are currently funded at $2,700 per student, when the actual average cost of providing them is $11,700.
Up until now, universities have been forced to make up the funding shortfall. The government allowed universities to increase their student numbers, but it was at the cost of a blow-out in class sizes and a mounting drain on university finances. How many times have we heard stories from university students of overcrowding in tutorial rooms and in lecture theatres? The situation has become untenable for Australia's cash-strapped universities, so at last some attention is being given to this problem. But the government's decision to restore adequate funding for these places is not a measure of any vision but a tacit acceptance of the fact that our universities are in financial crisis. In fact, the government does nothing to address the needs of the 20,000 young Australians who, despite having the marks, are being locked out of university each year because there are just not enough places.
In other developed countries we see significant investment in higher education by governments, increasing the opportunities for their young people and mature aged to get into university, while this government has virtually strangled the growth in new university places. Between 1992 and 1996, the number of university places increased from 194,000 to 233,000; but, between 1996, when this government was elected, and 2001, we had only 4,000 new places added to the system. For the next seven years, we are going to get only another 2,116 new commencing places—so much for backing Australia's ability. It is certainly not going to back the ability of those students who want to get into university and improve their education.
The only future that the Prime Minister is backing in this university package is not Australia's but the future of those who can pay. Most Australian families are getting less and less help from the government for services that are essential for the development of our society and for the maintenance of a fair society. We know the changes that the government propose to Medicare and higher education, and in these changes they show themselves to be pursuing an ideological agenda of shifting costs and responsibilities from government onto individuals and their families, undermining that crucial Australian value of a fair society. Increasingly, the government's agenda is being rejected by the majority of Australians. Australians reject the user pays approach of the government because they know that it means better health care and better education just for those who can pay, just for the wealthy. The rest will increasingly get left behind.
The Prime Minister's unfair university changes announced in the budget certainly tear at the fabric of our egalitarian society. They seek to reserve half the places in the most sought after courses at the most prestigious universities for those who can afford them—the few students and families who might be able to pay $100,000 for a degree or who could find a spare $50,000 to help pay for a contribution to that degree.
The Prime Minister claimed on Perth radio—and I think we have really seen what he is on about here—that all his policy does is recognise:
... if it's okay for a young person from Britain or Indonesia or Japan to buy a place in an Australian university, why isn't it alright for a kid from Balcatta or from Bankstown or Broadmeadows to do the same thing?
We see an almighty difference. I have to say that the only person I know from Broadmeadows who could afford a $100,000 university degree is Eddie McGuire. The Prime Minister is certainly not going to be helping kids from Broadmeadows get a place. He will be helping young people from wealthy families buy a place through the back door. Our universities are public institutions which have been funded by Australian taxpayers over a very long period of time. Our most prestigious universities were established more than 100 years ago and, today, reap the benefits of years of public investment. The prestige that they offer must be open to all Australians, and they must be required to continue to treat every Australian on the basis of merit, not money.
The Minister for Education, Science and Training is fond of saying that it is not fair that factory workers are forced to help fund higher education when most of them will never see the inside of a university. It is obvious that he does not get to talk to factory workers very often. Just a few weeks ago I spent a morning with about 50 women who spend their days assembling cars. When I told them what the government had in mind for higher education, they were horrified. The minister says that these hardworking Australians should resent their taxes being spent on universities. Well, they do not. While they might not have ever seen the inside of a university, they certainly dream that their children will. What these women from these car manufacturing companies know is that their children will be able to afford to go to university only if we have a strong, equitable public university system. That is their only hope of getting a university education. These families will not be able to pay full fees. They will not be able to buy a place at university.
If the Prime Minister and the wealthy Australian families he truly represents think too many Australians are missing out on a university place, the answer is not to let the wealthy buy their way in but to allocate more publicly funded university places. I am for all the kids—whether they are from Toorak, Peppermint Grove or Woollahra—competing on their marks with the children from Balcatta, Bankstown and Broadmeadows. Access to universities should be on the competitive basis of marks. The Prime Minister clearly does not agree with this. He thinks that people should be able to buy a place at university depending on how much money they or their parents have in the bank.
It really is a serious matter of principle. Are our public universities there for the vast majority of Australians or are they just there for the few who can afford to buy a place? We know that, as a result of the policies in the last seven years, Australian students and their families are already paying some of the highest study costs in the world. Since this government came into office in 1996, the average HECS fee has increased 85 per cent, student debt has doubled to $9 billion, many students are being forced to work more than 15 hours a week on top of their full-time studies just to get by and, most alarmingly, there is evidence that many of the young people coming out of university are delaying some of the landmark decisions in their lives, such as buying a home or starting a family, because of the very large debts that they are carrying when they start their careers. Carrying a debt of $30,000 or more certainly makes for a very tough start to your working life.
We will be rejecting the Howard government's unfair changes to higher education that would see students and their families forced to take on even greater debt to obtain a university education. We also strongly reject making the funds that are so desperately needed by our universities contingent on another ideological agenda of this government—that is, their industrial relations agenda. This is an agenda which is not welcomed by anyone in our universities. They are happy to be held accountable for the quality of the education that they deliver, but they want to be able to get on with delivering that education with the funding that they desperately need. They do not want to be tied up in an industrial relations war of this government's making.
The government's pursuit of policies that extend inequality in Australia goes beyond the walls of our universities. The government's funding system for non-government schools has increased the gap between the few wealthy, elite institutions and the rest. This year, for the first time in Australia's history, more Commonwealth funds will go to non-government schools than will be spent on our universities. But this largesse is not going where it is most needed. The government's socioeconomic status funding scheme for schools has not been applied to the Catholic schools system, nor to a large number of independent schools. In fact, 70 per cent of all non-government schools fall outside the scheme while former category 1 schools—some of the wealthiest schools in the country—have had their funding increased by 100 per cent. The government's funding formula does not take into account the resources and wealth of schools when allocating funds.
The education minister talks about those who will never see the inside of a university, but what of the 98 per cent or more of Australians who have never and will never see the inside of a school like Kings in Sydney or Scotch in Melbourne? Clearly, there are many schools far more needy than these that deserve much greater public support. That is why Labor supports funding non-government schools on a needs basis, taking into account both the resources available to a school and the financial capacity of each school community. All children deserve a high standard of education, no matter where they live or what their background is. That means that government schools must be a national priority—something that this government refuses to recognise—and non-government schools should be funded on the basis of need.
The government has also shown through its budget measures that it has no strategy to address Australia's chronic shortage of skilled workers or to tackle an unemployment rate that remains stubbornly stuck above six per cent. There was nothing—let me repeat, nothing—in this budget to grapple with the mounting problems in vocational education and training. It is a sector marked by severe shortages of money and places. Thousands of young Australians are being denied the opportunity to gain the skills that they need because of chronic underinvestment in this critical area. It is a problem that has long been recognised and has been widely condemned. But in framing the budget, the Treasurer decided that there should not be one extra cent of new money for TAFE. This is not only a tragedy for those people denied training; it is also a mounting problem for Australian industry. Employers constantly tell me of the critical shortages of skills in the work force. Some have been forced to begin recruiting workers from overseas because there are just no workers in Australia with the skills that they need. Such a situation can only do long-term damage to our economy and cannot be allowed to continue.
At the same time, the government has failed to develop the high-wage, high-skill jobs that are central to Australia's future prosperity. Since 1996 three-quarters of all new jobs created have been part time or casual. Australia now has one of the highest rates of part-time and casual employment in the developed world. In the past two months alone more than 76,000 full-time jobs have been lost and there are now 8.8 per cent fewer skilled job vacancies than there were a year ago. This is a dismal record. No wonder the Treasurer has the dubious distinction of having the second worst jobs growth record of any long-serving treasurer since 1958. He has managed a jobs growth rate of just 1.9 per cent a year. In fact, only his boss, the Prime Minister, has plumbed greater depths. When he was Treasurer, the Prime Minister managed an employment growth rate of 0.6 per cent.
This government has inflicted extensive damage on our universities, our schools, our TAFEs and our employment market. It has wasted the opportunity in this budget to set the firm foundations that Australia needs for our future prosperity. In government, Labor will set about making sure that we are a fair nation where you can get an excellent education at school, TAFE or university and where the jobs created are of a high quality, enhanced by continuing lifelong learning. We will not agree to a university education system based on wealth rather than ability. We certainly will not allow this government to slug Australian families and students with fee rises of up to 30 per cent for their university education. We certainly will not allow the government to saddle Australian families and their children—and this is straight out of the budget papers—with an additional $800 million of new debt. That is how much additional debt this government wants to pass on to Australian families and their children as a result of higher fees and a massive expansion in the number of full fee paying university places.
These are places that already cost up to $140,000. That is the reality of what students are having to face; that is the reality of what this government wants to see become the norm in our universities. We will not agree to the wealthy being able to buy their way into universities—certainly not to buy their way into universities ahead of those students with better marks. Rather than forcing Australians into full fee places, Labor wants to see more publicly funded and more publicly supported university places for qualified Australians. We will make sure that government schools right around Australia are a national priority—not left to the states—that non-government schools are funded on need, and that our TAFE colleges and universities are funded to meet the needs of our growing economy, because we know that without investment in education we will be the poorer, not only as a nation but also as a result of the jobs that will be created. If we do not invest in education then the jobs created will be low-paid, unskilled jobs. That is not the way we want this country to go.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2003-2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Cameron, Ross, MP",LP,2003-05-27,"—I wish to begin my contribution to the debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004, the Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2003-2004 and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004 by enunciating four principles I regard as the standards for a good budget, and to indicate at the outset, perhaps predictably, that it is my very great pleasure to provide an analysis of the 2003 budget recently handed down by the Treasurer, Peter Costello. The four principles that I would regard as important to judge a budget by are as follows. Firstly, a good budget should have the capacity to maintain funding for core functions of government, being those matters essential to our community and security which the citizenry cannot adequately undertake for itself. Secondly, a good budget should place no greater demand on the scarce resources of taxpayers by higher taxes. Thirdly, a good budget should place no greater demand on the resources of future Australians by way of increased government debt. Finally, a good budget should avoid unintended adverse consequences—often of well-intentioned programs—such as placing upward pressure on interest rates and crowding out the creativity and goodwill of Australians to undertake those functions in their private capacity.
I will begin with the maintenance of the core functions of government. It is not possible in a budget of $160-odd billion to go through a line by line analysis of its individual provisions, but I just want to touch on the highlights, the key points. I would begin with the proposition that the first inescapable function of the state is the defence of the realm. It is something which we would prefer not to be on the front pages; we would prefer it to be lower in our spending priorities. We have to accept as a starting proposition that whatever is required for the defence of the Commonwealth of Australia a strong government must be able to deliver. In that regard, we have made provision for significant additional expenditure of $2.1 billion for improvements in our defence capability over the next five years—on ships, aircraft, land based military equipment and ammunition. There is $157 million for a special operations command, to increase our preparedness and capacity to respond to threats to our security at home and overseas, and over $100 million to boost Army and Air Force recruitment and to improve naval retention.
In addition to that defence spending, there is an additional $440-odd million to upgrade domestic security at our airports, ports and nuclear research facilities, and for improved tracking of persons of concern. This is part of the core function of the Commonwealth. Defence is one of the few areas of spending which have continually been given improved funding each budget since we were elected in March 1996. Frankly, I believe that it is incumbent on us to look beyond merely our defence capability, in terms of relationships around the region. I endorse the proposition of Pope John Paul I that the most secure border is a reconciled relationship. I nonetheless accept that we live in uncertain times, with a whole range of threats, particularly from non-state actors and terrorist organisations, and to some extent from organised crime. Particularly in this environment of religious fundamentalism, extremism and an apparent hatred towards Western civilisation in some quarters of the world, we have to make appropriate provision. Certainly this budget tackles those problems head-on.
I move, secondly, to the human side, and to how we care for the most vulnerable in our community. That might rightly be regarded as a test of our humanity. I will touch on the issue of provision for people with disabilities. I note that this budget provides $135 million over four years for community organisations that provide employment services to people with disabilities. I just want to illustrate—to drill down to, if you like—how that money is actually delivered, and cite the example of Cumberland Industries. It is not actually in my electorate but just outside my electorate at Auburn, in the electorate of Reid. Cumberland Industries is a world leader in competitive employment services provision for people with disabilities. It employs 430 Australians in six different divisions. Its work, led by Stephen Treloar, led to him winning a Churchill Fellowship to study vocational employment for people with disabilities, in Sweden, the Netherlands, the UK and the US.
I simply recognise that with our medical and scientific capacity to keep alive Australians who are suffering various illnesses—whether they are congenital or injury acquired disabilities—we also have an obligation to look at the quality of life of those individuals and of their carers and families. In that regard, it is pleasing to see an additional $110 million in this budget to provide additional funding for carers and for respite care over the next four years. Frankly, if you said to me, `Where would you like to see increased spending?' as a confessed arid economic rationalist I would accept without question the proposition that we need to make better provision for Australians with disabilities and their carers. I am pleased to see that this budget takes a generous approach in that regard.
I will touch briefly now on health and education. The member for Jagajaga has made a series of assertions and allegations, some of which I will take up. In the area of health I merely note that, under the leadership of Senator Kay Patterson, we are witnessing a $917 million package specifically directed towards adequately funding doctor visits under the Medicare package. Australians may be surprised to know about the levels of generosity currently in our Medicare funding arrangements. For example, it may surprise some to know that in the electorate of Fowler, almost adjoining mine in western Sydney, there are over 1.1 million doctor visits per year. There are about 90,000 voters in each electorate and 1.1 million doctor visits. There are more than 90,000 citizens—probably 150,000 or 160,000—but that means that every man, woman and child in the electorate is visiting the doctor about seven or eight times a year. That is just the doctor visits; that is not the other Medicare funded services, which in that electorate would, I think, double the total to two million individual Medicare funded services.
In my own electorate I am tremendously fortunate in having a high concentration of excellent medical clinics and health services. Ninety-two per cent of my constituents receive bulk-billed medical services. By contrast, my colleague the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage has only two medical clinics that bulk-bill in her entire electorate—that is a bulk-billing rate of under 30 per cent. If you look at the electorate of Eden-Monaro, it has a bulk-billing rate of 38 per cent. Even at 38 per cent, there are still 480,000 doctor visits. I am saying to the House that we already have a very generous public health program in this country. It is regrettable that many of the state governments are not translating the generosity of the federally funded Medicare system to the efficiency and generosity of the state funded public hospital system. In my own electorate I know there has been a lot of frustration about the closing of beds in public hospitals, particularly in the maternity wards but also elsewhere.
There is almost $1 billion to encourage doctors to bulk-bill—seven million Australians are Commonwealth health card holders—and there are also significant extra incentives to coax the heavy concentration of doctors and nurses out of the urban, metropolitan, capital city areas and into the outer metropolitan fringes of our cities and the regional and remote areas, where there are virtually no doctors at all. That is already proving quite successful. Since the announcement of the package, I understand that over 70 doctors in urban areas have indicated a desire to sign up and move their practices to outer metropolitan, regional or rural areas. That will be welcome news for those areas suffering the greatest doctor shortages.
The investment of $1 billion in Medicare is absolutely dwarfed by the offer of an additional $10 billion to the states and territories to fund the coming four-year agreement for public hospitals. That money is on the table from the Commonwealth. We have asked the states for a higher level of accountability for performance, which some of them are resisting. We saw the extraordinary duplicity that took place with the manipulation of public hospital figures before the last election—which resulted in a group of specialists in the Port Macquarie area resigning in disgust at the pressure that was brought to bear on them to inflate the number of patients they were seeing and the number of beds available—only to have these services shut down immediately after the Labor victory. The specialists resigned in absolute disgust at the deliberate deception practised by the New South Wales Minister for Health. I think the Australian people rightly expect a higher level of transparency and accountability in how Commonwealth funds for public health in public hospitals are being spent.
I will turn to the education area. The member for Jagajaga has just criticised the budget and the Commonwealth for expecting some degree of reform in the area of the industrial relations governing tertiary institutions in this country. I simply say that there are few areas of our community—perhaps one is the building industry—that require more urgent industrial reform than the tertiary education sector, which is crying out for greater flexibility in the workplace. How well I remember my own dismal experience as a student at one of Australia's universities. The work practices were such that, once you were employed in an academic faculty, you had lifetime tenure regardless of your performance, and lecturers and tutors were employed very largely on the basis of whether their ideological orientation was consistent with that of the prevailing clique. Lecturers were a laughing-stock: they could turn up and give the same lectures for five years in a row. Students would not even attend the lectures; they would just go to their mates who had taken the class the year before or the year before that and say, `Give us the notes.' 
I see the minister for tourism putting his hand up. I am pleased to say that when the Minister for Small Business and Tourism was the president of the SRC at Sydney University he began agitating for workplace reform and encouraging students to hold lecturers accountable for their performance. We saw, for example, in the student newspaper the beginnings of student assessments of lecturer performance, because that was the only assessment that was available. There was no independent, objective assessment of lecturer performance in the industrial relations climate. It was a closed shop and, in an institution that was meant to be the centre of the open, liberal, flexible, creative culture of the nation, we found the most regressive, conservative, reactionary industrial backwater in the whole country.
Brendan Nelson has painstakingly worked in a consultative way with the key elements. He has worked with the student unions, he has worked with teacher unions, he has worked with the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, he has worked with the key research organisations, he has worked with the sandstone universities and with the newer regional and country universities, and he has been congratulated for the exhaustive process of consultation which is behind this package. It is a great achievement that, in spite of the great restraint of this budget, we see $1,500 million more for tertiary education than was in the previous funding agreement—a massive increase which reflects the commitment of this government to seeing greater resources go into the sector.
The member for Jagajaga said that students ought not to have to contribute any more to the costs of their own education. Let me put this very simply. Seventy per cent of my constituents who finish high school will never go to university. The value of one year of tertiary education over a person's lifetime is about $9,000 of annual income. It will vary between a social worker, on the one hand, and a lawyer or a veterinarian, on the other hand, but, on average, each year is worth about $9,000 or $10,000 of annual income. Let us say $10,000 for argument's sake. So $30,000 of annual income, over a person's working life, is the value of the economic asset they acquire from a three-year undergraduate qualification. If a person works for 40 years, they will get 40 times $30,000 as an economic asset. That is a private benefit they accrue as a result of the privilege of a tertiary education.
After these reforms pass through the Senate—as I hope they will—we will be asking the average student to pay 27 per cent of the costs, on average, of an asset which will be worth roughly $1 million to them over their working life. We will ask them to pay 27 per cent of the cost of acquiring that asset. I do not regard that as a great affront to social justice; I regard it as a commonsense contribution by students to the best investment they will ever make. They would not have made a better investment if they had put their money in George Soros's investment fund 10 years ago or put it with Frank Lowy at Westfield, whose equity has performed even better than George Soros's. Even that would not beat that sort of return on investment.
I am entirely supportive of the path-breaking reforms introduced by the minister for education. At the moment, we do not have one tertiary institution in the top 100 in the world. Brendan Nelson said, `That is not good enough,' and we are going to create a much more flexible, differentiated system which allows each institution to define its own future and set its own prices. Some institutions will lower the costs of their courses to attract more students into them. We are providing more resources for teachers and nurses where we know that they are most needed.
I will move quickly to the other principles. I do not want to see us placing greater demands on the scarce resources of taxpayers by raising taxes. I note simply that the unexpected part of this budget was a $2.2 billion tax cut. That is a lot of money. For the average family or the average taxpayer, depending on their income, we are looking at between $220 and $600-odd. I am not going to talk about the amount itself; the principle is the critical thing. We on the coalition side of government do not assume that any surplus in the budget must be spent on new programs. We believe that taxpayer money is precious and that the principle to be observed ought to be that, if there is a surplus, it should be returned to those who created it.
We have returned six surpluses out of eight. There was one extraordinary budget in 2001-02 when the war on terror in Afghanistan pushed us marginally into deficit, and, of course, we inherited a massive debt from Labor in 1996 of $90 billion. That had to be repaid, and it took us two years to get back into surplus. I point out that we have repaid $60 billion of the $90 billion debt we inherited from Labor, so we start each year over $4 billion in front in terms of interest payments we do not have to make. I regard that as a great achievement.
Australia's net debt is at 4.3 per cent of GDP, as against an OECD average of 47.3 per cent of GDP. We are at one-tenth of the OECD average of government net debt. At the same time, we have created a million new jobs. Unemployment in Parramatta has gone from 14 per cent to four per cent since this government was elected. That is my idea of job creation. We have resilient economic growth in a time of global uncertainty, and it is all growing out of a core philosophy of restraint, discipline and vision.

"Swan, Wayne, MP",ALP,2003-05-27,"—The Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004 is the first in a series that gives effect to the Howard government's 2003-04 budget. It provides for administered expenses in the order of $40.5 billion for the financial year 2003-04. Of this total, some $3.5 billion is being appropriated for family and community services, mainly for department outputs rather than for expenses on income support that make up the bulk of the $60 billion social security and welfare budget. These items will be contained in subsequent appropriation.
Much of the detail is yet to be seen, although it is clear how the budget should be characterised. Put simply, it is a budget that is tough on battling and sinking middle families. It is a budget that does nothing to provide opportunity and incentive to mainstream Australia. This budget exposes the Howard government's real third-term agenda: to put the squeeze on Australian families through higher taxes, higher medical costs and higher education costs—something that the member for Parramatta just pleaded guilty to.
The budget's centrepiece is a tax cut that will deliver just $4 a week to an average income earner—not enough to buy a sandwich and a milkshake, according to my opponent in the Senate, let alone to meet the higher costs in this budget for visiting a doctor or educating your kids. This budget seeks to entrench a three-tier health, education and welfare system. What do I mean by a three-tier system? I will explain it to the minister opposite. At the bottom is a safety net for people, many of whom are being left way behind. It is a safety net which is full of holes. In the middle there are those who are struggling—those people being squeezed, paying more tax than ever before and getting fewer services in return. At the top are those who have done very well indeed and can afford to buy the best.
This is not the Australian way; bit by bit we are losing the fair go. Under this government there is one rule for the top end of town and another for everybody else. How else can you explain the plans to expand upfront fee paying places in our universities so the privileged can get in through the back door while the talented jostle for HECS funded places that will leave them with debts running into the tens of thousands of dollars? More debt is hardly what young Australians need—they are drowning in debt, and this government is not averse to burying them even further in that debt. The government ought to consider the long-term consequences of this policy and others that saddle young Australians with debt. It is no wonder that home ownership rates and our birth rate are falling as young couples struggle under the dead weight of debt.
You can see that particularly when you look at the construction of the government's fiscally irresponsible family payment system. It is a very sad fact that the family payment system is burdening too many Australian families in debt. Here is a system that is designed to intimidate struggling families from claiming their proper entitlement to support their kids. If they do try and access their entitlement, they are being whacked with massive debts—600,000 families, or one in three, are having their family tax benefits clawed back. The budget papers reveal the price families are paying as a result of this family tax benefit clawback.
Families will receive less help from family tax benefit payments this year compared to last year. Family tax benefit payments to families in 2002-03 will decline, even in nominal terms, compared to 2001-02. This is the first such decline in mainstream family benefits in at least the last decade. Compared to the projected estimates in last year's budget, families will receive $723 million less in family tax benefits in 2002-03. That adds up to a whopping $400 per family less in family tax benefits during 2002-03 than the government had anticipated in the last budget.
This leads me to the appalling policy that this government is pursuing to claw back family tax benefits. What the government is now saying is that it wants people who are saddled with a family tax benefit debt, which they have been given through no fault of their own, to pay it off on their credit card. This comes on top of other unique approaches that the government has adopted of stripping the tax returns of those with a family payment debt, and on top of what is supposed to be the official policy where the debts are taken from future family payments. We all know the history of the minister going out there and intimidating families by saying, `Don't claim what you think you are entitled to; in fact, don't claim at all—take it at the end of the year.' But, as we know, families who are struggling to feed, educate and clothe their children cannot afford not to take their family payments on a fortnightly basis. When they do, one third of them are saddled with these horrendous debts.
Now we find, when we go to Centrelink's web site, that they are now saying to people who have a family payment debt that their very first option is to pay it off on their credit card. That is the first option this government advertises. It does not say the first option is that you can take fewer payments in the future to pay off your debt. It is encouraging families to pay off their family payment debt, which the government has given them, on their credit cards. For a family with an average $800 debt who chooses to pay that debt by credit card with an interest rate of 17 per cent, that would cost them an additional $136 per annum. All of a sudden the $800 debt becomes $930 if they pay it off within 12 months.
Then the trouble starts for a family with a higher debt. A debt of $2,800 will attract almost $500 in interest, at a rate of 17 per cent interest on their credit card. So the $2,800 debt becomes $3,300. If it is not paid off within 12 months, the family will be liable for another $560 in interest. This is incredible. These are families that have not chosen to receive a family debt; they have got it through the grand incompetence of the government and its shambolic family payment system which is financially irresponsible. Then Amanda Vanstone has the hide to go and say to them that they can pay off this debt, which they did not ask for, with their credit card.
That is the approach of this government. It shows you how out of touch this government is with the financial pressures on Australian families, who are being squeezed all the time by the policies of the Howard government. As I said before, one in three families have fallen into this debt trap. Every one of them is at risk of going deeper into debt with this credit card repayment policy. Families are now expected not only to bear the risk of a system that cannot get their payments right but also to bear the interest on the debts that result.
The policy contradicts claims made by Amanda Vanstone last week in the Senate that debts would be treated as a prepayment of future benefits. It simply puts a lie to that statement made by Amanda Vanstone in the Senate last week. The Howard government's policies are placing families deeper and deeper into debt. Not only do they need a credit card when they visit the doctor, now they need it when they have a family payment debt. No government that understood the financial pressures that families are under would push this credit card repayment policy.
That brings us to the other pressure on families. Apart from the financial pressure, there is also the pressure of time. The government's indifference to average families can be seen in what is absent from this budget. Despite John Howard's constant claims of being family friendly, it is clear that Australian families will not get any relief from the pressures they are under while this government is in office. All those Australian families that have worked so hard to make our economy strong are simply not receiving the dividend from it—take the government's refusal to introduce paid maternity leave, for example, and take its public opposition to reasonable working hours cases. How can a government that claims to be family friendly, and says that parents should spend more time with their children, oppose paid maternity leave or reasonable working hour cases? This government talks the talk of being family friendly, but they never, ever walk the walk.
That brings us to the government's baby bonus flop. At every step this government has proven that it is incapable of delivering meaningful assistance to families. Its last attempt—the baby bonus—was revealed in this budget to be a complete flop. We knew when it was introduced that this bonus would deliver something like only $10 per week to an average family for a parent to stay at home. But what the budget papers now reveal is a somewhat grimmer position, with expenditure on the baby bonus falling way behind the initial projections. The baby bonus was, of course, the centrepiece of John Howard's family policy in the 2001 election. When it was introduced last year, the baby bonus was expected to provide $335 million in assistance to families in the first two years, but the budget papers show that the estimated benefit from the baby bonus in its first two years has slumped to $230 million—one-third less than anticipated. This should not be surprising to those who know how the bonus works, because the entitlement is complex for a family to work out and is designed in such a way as to give least assistance to those who need it, particularly when they need it the most.
On top of these financial pressures which are placed directly on families, particularly those with young children, we then have the government jacking up the price families are paying for essential goods, health and education. Increasingly, opportunity will be determined by the quality of a child's experiences during their first five years—family life, child care and health—and the quality of their education. But in each of these areas Australia is now badly placed. It is time we stopped putting bandaids over our ballooning welfare programs and it is time that we started to develop comprehensive early assistance programs for families with children, because the foundation of fairness is in doing better in the care of our children. Out of a Commonwealth welfare budget of $60 billion and state child protection spending of something like $796 million, there is very little directed to preventing abuse and neglect of our children.
When the Prime Minister comes in here and says, `We don't have to have any inquiry into child abuse,' and that he would rather spend the $60 million to $70 million on prevention programs, you would assume that he was spending something on prevention now. The truth is that he is not. In fact, in the budget before this one he cut $10 million from the stronger families program. When you look at the expenditure on the prevention of child abuse, you see that it is virtually negligible. In fact, this government spends something like 0.006 per cent of the family and community services budget on preventative programs. That shows that this government might want to talk the talk of being family friendly but that it never, ever walks the walk. All of this has happened in spite of the evidence that clearly shows that, for every dollar spent early, you save seven down the track in lower child protection, crime, social security and other costs. Instead of this approach, we have a government that has wound programs back. It simply continues to cut in this area. That exposes the double standards of this government.
Also in this budget the government has indicated it will cut back assistance to pensioners who are trying to improve their education and skills. The pensioner education supplement will leave sole parents, disability pensioners and carers who study up to $350 per year worse off by denying the benefit in the break between academic years. For many pensioners, particularly those with disabilities, study costs already outweigh the $31 per week PES benefit. The savings, which amount to $36.2 million over four years, are simply mean-spirited and will almost certainly lead to many pensioners abandoning study completely. So much for welfare reform. Having only just managed to get the modest Australians Working Together reforms through the parliament, the government is now turning its back and walking backwards even on those.
As we know, the Howard government is now the highest taxing government in our history. We all know where the burden has been shifted. Hardworking Australians know all too well the diminishing financial returns that come from working a few extra hours of overtime or from getting a long overdue pay rise. The combined effect of tax and the clawback of social security or family benefits mean there is little or no incentive to work harder or earn extra. Rather than addressing this problem, the budget adds to the problem.
The Medicare package will effectively limit bulk-billing to health care card holders. That means the end of bulk-billing for families on incomes of over $33,000 a year and for single people on incomes of just $27,000 a year. They will have to wear the immediate out-of-pocket costs of up to $50 and gap payments of around $15. The truth is that this is just another poverty trap to go on top of all of the poverty traps that were built into the family payments system in the package over 2½ years ago. The latest research shows there are something like 860,000 Australians who are in this boat and losing more than 60c in each additional dollar earned in tax and through the clawback of other benefits—that is, an effective marginal tax rate of 60c in the dollar is applying to many families in this community who are earning between $30,000 and $60,000 a year.
We constantly hear calls for the lowering of the top marginal rate, when in fact struggling Australians—Australians in the sinking middle—are paying well in excess of that at the moment. That is a result of the traps that this government has built into the system, has put in place, which are designed to claw back the supposed benefits that were supposed to be in the original package. What does it do? It reduces incentives for hardworking, low-income earning Australians and their families to get ahead. That is what it does.
That has been demonstrated by, of all people, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Mr Abbott, who, at a Young Liberals conference in January told the truth about the government's tax package—that it was punishing low-income, working Australians, and others who were on benefits trying to move from welfare to work, to the extent of effective marginal tax rates rising from 60c to 110c in every additional dollar they earned. This was put on the record by us in this parliament over six months ago and has now been confirmed by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, and the government has the hide to talk about believing in reward for effort. It does not believe in reward for effort. It believes in punishment for anyone on a low income. It believes in incentive for anyone on a high income—but that does not extend right down the scale.
The worst-affected are families with older dependent children receiving the Howard government's youth allowance. An estimated 40,000 people lose up to $1.10 for each additional dollar earned. In other words, they go backwards when they work harder. The group I spoke about before—the 860,000 who lose between 60c and $1.10 of each dollar earned—numbers as many as those who face the top marginal rate and lose 40c of each additional dollar earned. That is, there are as many people on low incomes paying higher than the top marginal rate as there are on high incomes paying the top marginal rate. That is a stunning figure.
Is it any wonder that in this community the rich are getting richer, the middle is getting squeezed and the poor are falling further behind. Through the policies of this government, there is a redistribution of wealth occurring that is turning into an American style chasm. Few people are aware of just how much the gap between the very rich and the rest of the community has widened over a relatively short period of time. In some circles, even making this point exposes you to charges of inciting class warfare or the politics of envy. But listen to the following figures. The top five per cent of income earners—some 430,000 of nine million earners nationally—are doing very well. In the last five years, the combined annual income of the top five per cent has grown dramatically. The total earnings of this group—that is, $62 billion—now outstrips what the entire nation spends on all social security benefits and family payments. That is more than a third of our national budget of over $160 billion.
But what has happened at the very top is even more startling. In the last five years, the combined annual taxable income of our nation's millionaires has grown by more than 300 per cent, from $1.1 billion to $4.6 billion. These people in a week make roughly $43,000, which is what the average income earner makes in a year. So there is an explosion of wealth at the top end. We have had strong economic growth, but it has not been shared fairly. The great bulk of the benefits are going to those at the very top, and those in the middle and at the bottom are being squeezed. So the annual income of the top five per cent is now roughly equivalent to that of the entire bottom 40 per cent in the community. Think about that: the annual income of the top five per cent in the community is now equal to that of the bottom 40 per cent. The wealthiest five per cent of Australians enjoyed a 28 per cent jump in their earnings in the five years since 1994-95, an increase of over $31,000 to $143,843 a year. One should compare that situation to what has happened to those on modest incomes, where the increase has been much smaller.
Clearly, many average Australians who have worked hard to make our economy strong are not sharing fairly in the wealth that has been created, and the gap is continuing to grow. On top of that, we have about 2.5 million Australians living below the poverty line—and a very modest poverty line it is. The poverty line is $415 a week for a family of four. In recent years, there has been a massive increase in those living below the poverty line, which is one of the reasons why the poverty inquiry that is being conducted by the Senate Community Affairs References Committee as it moves around this country is so very important. It is important because this increase in inequality is rapidly accelerating. It is rapidly accelerating because of the features that are contained in the budget: a shift in the tax burden to those on low and middle incomes and a substantial increase in the cost of access to health and education. 
Education is the first rung on the ladder to opportunity, and this government is going to make it increasingly harder for people from modest backgrounds to access it. In 15 or 20 years, if these trends are not changed substantially in national policy, there will be a further widening in the gap that I talked about before. The latest budget should be more than enough to convince battling Australians that their aspirations are not being met by this government. This government is throwing out the tradition of a fair go. Australians do believe in equality of opportunity. People are angry that in this very wealthy country they are being denied access to opportunities: quality health, education and a good start for their kids. We have been growing apart. The task in this country is to give people hope—hope that as a nation we can start growing together again. We need to remember that we are all in this together. We need a safe, secure society and a fair go for all, not just for the fortunate few.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2003-2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Causley, Ian, MP",NP,2003-05-27,"—I rise tonight to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004. It is always interesting to rise in this House after the member for Lilley. He obviously has a selective memory in many of these areas. Having been around politics for some time, I recall that in my earlier days in the state parliament I was dealing with constituents who were struggling with the 16 and 18 per cent Labor Party interest rates and with business interest rates of up to 25 per cent. We had families in trouble. I recall vividly some of the families that did not make that transition; they separated because of the problems with the monetary policy of the day. Of course, that is endemic in the Labor Party, just as amnesia is endemic in the Labor Party.
I am very proud to associate myself with the budget, being the sixth surplus budget that Treasurer Costello has delivered to this House. I am very pleased to be associated with it because it shows yet again just what a strong position Australia is in when we look at the economies of different countries around the world. I have heard commentators in recent days making the rare comment that Australia is in a very sound economic position. That can be attributed to this government—to the Prime Minister and the Treasurer in particular and of course to the cabinet—which has delivered these policies to this country. We have heard quite a lot about the budget recently. I certainly heard the derision from the Labor opposition in question time when they raised the tax cuts for Australia. But when you look at the position of the ordinary people in Australia at the present time and remember, as I indicated earlier, the interest rates that operated prior to this government being elected, you see that families in Australia who are buying $100,000 homes are $330 a month better off under this government. 
We also remember the famous accords that the Labor Party had in the past where, in fact, average wages fell, but under this government wages have risen. So in many ways the Labor Party are crying crocodile tears when they talk about the position of the ordinary family. When we look at the fact that this government has got the economic structure right, we can see that people are better off in real terms under this government.
Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, coming from a country area, you would understand as well as I do that unemployment has always been a real problem in rural Australia. Of course, with the present drought situation, that has been exacerbated. I recall that, when I first took over as the federal member for my electorate of Page, the unemployment rate was 16 per cent. Unemployment has always been a problem in that particular area; there are no great industries. It is a nice area in which to live, and people tend to come to that area. At the present time, our unemployment rate is down to 6.2 per cent. I think we have to take some credit for that, because obviously government policies have worked to reduce that unemployment rate.
It is the underlying structures that are important. Governments cannot create jobs but they can certainly put the structures in place such that industry can create jobs. I am sure that this government, being a National-Liberal coalition, understands exactly what is needed to put those structures in place: low interest rates, low inflation and encouragement of industry to invest. They are the issues that create employment.
On the North Coast of New South Wales, other government policies have helped. The Permadrive braking system is an invention that is based in the city of Lismore. Usually inventors have the backside out of their pants, and this fellow was no different when he came through my office some five years ago. He knew he had a great invention, but the issue was how to get it off the ground—how to get it running. I came down here to the government ministers, and I got support from this government. Obviously the company had to raise funds of their own. They floated a company, they raised money locally—the local people had confidence in it—and they managed to get it up and running. Last week, the company signed a contract to supply 750,000 units to the American army. I think it is a good news story, and it is something Australia should be proud of. A little inventor came up with a tremendous invention; in fact, university results have shown that this invention can save between 30 per cent and 50 per cent in fuel usage. The company have just signed a huge contract with the American army. What does that do for local employment? It is fairly obvious that, with the help of this government, the industry will be able to employ 300 or 400 people in the Lismore-Ballina area. That is a huge boost to the employment opportunities in the electorate of Page.
It does not end there, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott. As you would realise, the government does have schemes in place—and this budget certainly enhances those—to encourage opportunities that might arise. Aspect North is a company comprising a group of local people in Lismore. They put their expertise together and, with the help of the honourable member for Mackellar, who was a minister at the time, they managed to get a contract for digital mapping with the Australian Army. That company, which started off with a work force of something like six to eight, now has over 100 employees in the city of Lismore, many of them high-salaried employees. That again shows that the opportunities are there. We can encourage those opportunities through the systems and the programs that we have put in place.
Since this government came to power, it has been said on many occasions that a million jobs have been created in Australia. I have heard very little criticism—aside from the opposition here in this House—of the policies and achievements of this government, given the fact that we inherited an economy that was in crisis. The Treasurer has often said that, after this budget, we will have paid off some $63 billion of Labor debt. What that means to Australians is that they are now paying $4.3 billion less in interest—$4.3 billion has been freed up for other programs, such as education and health. Of course, in my area there are quite large overall payments with regard to welfare and retirement. Money has been freed up so that it can be spent in those essential areas. I am sure the opposition does not like to give credit to the fact that that has been achieved. What it does mean, though, is that in the future Australians can be very confident in the fact that they have no overburdening debt and that the money that is raised can be used to service programs within the community and to ensure that services are provided. In this budget, those services are being increased. Payments to the welfare and retirement areas have been increased. We can provide better services, yet we still have the strongest economic growth in the developed world.
I was interested in a comment by the Treasurer the other day. He said that, if you look at the overall debt in Australia compared with debt in other countries—compared with the performance of other countries, particularly in the developed world—Australia stands out. In my lifetime—and I have been around for a couple of years!—I can never remember that happening. I recall that in the past if America had a recession Australia was in grave trouble. We also considered that if Asia got into economic problems Australia would be in grave trouble. That has not happened, because of this government's management of the economy. I am sure the opposition will nitpick at the edges, but the underlying factor is that the economy of this country is strong and is growing at a rate of 3.25 per cent. I do not think you will find that in any other developed country at the present time. Inflation has been kept under control, and that is very important. Those terrible days of high interest rates with inflation running at about eight per cent or nine per cent were always a problem as far as business was concerned. It is now under control, and I am sure that the business community is extremely grateful for that.
If you look at this budget and you consider that, during the last year, Australia was faced with some of the greatest crises that we have faced in many, many years—the September 11 attack in New York; the bombing of Bali; our involvement in East Timor; our involvement in the Iraq war; and the severe drought, the worst drought that I can remember in rural Australia—it is quite incredible that the Treasurer can bring down a surplus budget, because obviously the expenditure that was forced upon the government in those circumstances was not contemplated in last year's budget. Obviously the fact is that we have managed to cover those expenses and still end up with a surplus and, if we look at the forward estimates, we see surpluses right into the future. That surely gives a lot of confidence to Australia that we can carry on that way.
I would like to cover a few more points that are important. We heard the previous speaker talk about this government being the highest taxing government in the history of Australia, but of course members opposite ignore the fact that the GST goes directly to the states. I can recall the last budget I was involved in in New South Wales when I was in the cabinet there, only seven years ago. The total budget was $24 billion. I note that this year the budget in New South Wales is $36 billion. That is a huge increase in seven years. That is the tax take that the state government have, yet they are managing to spend it and they are saying to the federal government, `We should get more funds.'
We have a classic example with the Pacific Highway. Everyone understands the classification of roads, I hope. There are national highways, there are state highways, there are state main roads and there are local roads. The national highway in New South Wales is the New England Highway. This federal government injected some $600 million into the Pacific Highway to try and upgrade that road because it is the most used road in Australia between Brisbane and Sydney. The Hume Highway goes between Sydney and Melbourne. Now, even though the program has been completed and the federal government has honoured its commitment of $600 million, the New South Wales government is trying to cost-shift. It is saying, `Oh, any more improvement of the Pacific Highway has to come from the federal government.' It is not a Commonwealth or federal road; it is a state highway. But we continually hear this.
Members of this House would, for instance, have seen the increase in the funding for TAFE for apprenticeships. I went to a presentation night recently in northern New South Wales where there were presentations to the people who had received awards for their effort at TAFE. There were signs along the back of the wall which intrigued me. We know the commitment that the federal government has to this particular area, but all the signs said was: TAFE New South Wales. These state governments are the most dishonest governments you will ever come across, because they take the money from the federal budget but they just claim it all for themselves and say, `It's state government funding.' That is absolutely incorrect—and we see it time and time again.
Obviously this dishonesty has to be exposed, because there is no doubt in my mind that the states cry poor. I have just indicated to you that, through the tax system, they are getting plenty of taxes. It is a little bit like the Teachers Federation we have at the present time that is out there crying about the fact that the federal government is not doing enough for public schools. Public schools are state schools. The federal government does make a contribution, and that contribution has increased in this budget, if you would take note. But the federal government has not got the responsibility for state schools—they are state schools. Yet we have the dishonesty of the Teachers Federation out there saying that the federal government is abrogating its responsibility. That does not surprise me, because it funds the Labor Party in big ways. There are huge amounts of money that it puts into the Labor Party coffers, so it does not surprise me in any way. The dishonesty about this and the hypocrisy that we see is quite extraordinary.
We heard a debate about forestry yesterday in private members business. It was the Keating government that introduced the RFA process. I did not actually agree with that, because I thought we had gone too far at that particular stage—I used to be the minister for forests in New South Wales—but I accept the fact that you have to try and get an agreement. You have to get a peace deal, if you like, between the extreme green movement who want to lock the world up and the industry that is necessary in rural New South Wales. The regional forest agreements took some three or four years to create. Both governments signed off—you had the federal government signing off; you had Bob Carr signing off—on a regional forest agreement, but, when it came to the election campaign in New South Wales, because he desperately needed some green preferences, Bob Carr simply tore up the regional forest agreement.
Mr Deputy Speaker, I simply have to say to you that one of the problems that we have in this country is the city-country divide. The problem with the city-country divide is that the city does not understand the truth about some of these issues. There is absolutely no risk involved in the proper management of forests. The arguments that are put forward are spurious, they are not based on fact, yet we get the politics involved in this. The federal government has spent millions and millions—and again, in this budget, if you take note, there is money provided by this government for the regional forest agreements—and, at the end of the day, the dishonesty that we hear coming from the Labor Party is quite unbelievable. I have been listening to this argument since 1984, and I have heard the same arguments year after year. Each year, we lock up thousands and thousands of hectares more. You might note that, in this budget, $7 million or $8 million has been provided by the federal government for firefighting. Why is the federal government providing $7 million or $8 million for firefighting? Because the states have got their management out of whack.
The New South Wales state government, which I know more about than other state governments, has locked up huge areas of national parks with absolutely no resources to manage them. During the great fires, the New South Wales Rural Fire Service Commissioner, Phil Koperberg, said, `We can't reduce fuel because there are only a couple windows of opportunity during the spring and autumn to reduce fuel.' That is true. But how did it happen in the past? When I was minister for forests in New South Wales, there was a whole section of the forestry department responsible for reducing fuel every year. We also had grazing leases right along the ranges where the graziers—the lessees—reduced the fuel in those windows of opportunity. Now we have the situation where the state governments cannot manage their resources and are calling on the federal government to pay for these huge helicopters to come in. Of course, when you have a fire out of control, even they cannot control it. The state governments have to take some responsibility here and get back to managing their resources.
Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, before I finish I briefly want to mention the Summerland Way, which heads up to your electorate, the electorate of Maranoa. I have to say that the federal government's spending of some $20 million over the last few years has undoubtedly helped the Summerland Way, which is a heavy access road into Brisbane. The state government, again, keep saying, `We've spent a lot of money on this road.' But every time I check the facts, the facts do not add up.

"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,2003-05-27,"—I rise tonight to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004. This is a very Liberal budget. It is a budget that, more than any other before it, gives true expression to the Liberal way, to the Liberal philosophy; that is, that everyone should take full responsibility for their own health care and their own education. I happen to believe that those with the financial capacity—higher income earners and those from more privileged backgrounds—should take greater responsibility for their health care and their education. But I am a vehement opponent of applying the principles of social Darwinism, such that those without the capacity to pay nevertheless are required by the national government of this country to fend for themselves, to use whatever meagre financial resources they might have to secure for themselves a second-class health system or an education which is not on a par with the education available to the sons and daughters of the privileged few. Yet this is at the heart, it is the essence, of this budget.
The centrepiece of the budget is the destruction of Medicare. The centrepiece of the budget is a package of measures that will continue the destruction of Medicare by stealth, a strategy upon which this Prime Minister embarked from 1996. The best way to go about destroying Medicare by stealth is to preside over bringing bulk-billing rates down to alarmingly low levels. We know that with bulk-billing collapsing there will not be the community support for Medicare that we of the Labor Party want always to exist. The Prime Minister of Australia, when he was much more forthright about his plans in relation to Medicare in 1987, leading up to the 1987 election, said it clear, said it loud and said it often. He said, `Without punning too much I will take a scalpel to Medicare.' He said, `I will pull Medicare right apart.' He said, `Bulk-billing is a rort.' He said, `Medicare is a disaster.'
Of course, he lost that election because the Australian people did not agree with the now Prime Minister, they did not agree with John Howard, the opposition leader, and he learned from his error. He learned not to publicly say that he would pull Medicare right apart, that he would take a scalpel to Medicare and that he would finish bulk-billing. Instead, when he did become Prime Minister, he hatched a plan to destroy Medicare by stealth. Year by year, each and every year, under the Howard government the rate of bulk-billing has fallen. So to hammer the final nail into the coffin of Medicare, the Prime Minister has come out again more publicly and released his plan that would destroy Medicare. Labor do not want to see a two-tiered health system. We do not want to see a second-class health system, an Americanised health system, for those on very low incomes. All Australians should be able to receive good, decent health care irrespective of their capacity to pay for it.
The Liberal way, the Liberal philosophy, is also given expression in the package of measures developed by the Minister for Education, Science and Training and outlined in this budget, because those measures would take a university education out of the reach of most Australian families, purely and simply. Those measures would take Australia back to the pre-Whitlam era, back to the days when only the sons and daughters of the privileged could get a top-class education in this country and when those from less privileged backgrounds were shut out of a university education. Labor says that an education should be available to open up to the talents of all young people, regardless of the incomes of their parents, but the government says we should return to the days when education was the domain of the privileged and the underprivileged did not get a fair go, a flying start in life.
The conundrum in all this is that, while it is withdrawing services in vital areas such as health and education, this government nevertheless is the highest taxing government in Australia's history. We have to ask the question: where is the money going? We have done some analysis of where the money is going and the answer is, in part, that the money is going to fund the Prime Minister's secret corporate welfare.
Take the strategic investment coordinator scheme, for example, where $650 million of taxpayers' money has been doled out to companies in deals done behind closed doors and the basis of the decisions—the so-called benefit-cost analyses that have been done—is not released to the public. Who knows what favours are returned? We will never know, because we are not meant to know. The strategic investment scheme is secret corporate welfare. On behalf of Labor I have announced that we would scrap that scheme. The Treasurer of this country says, `You've got all these plans. Where's the money coming from?' Clearly, that is one area in which savings can be made, and funds redirected towards Labor priorities and away from John Howard's secret corporate welfare.
Where else is the money going in the budget? I will not spend the entirety of my time tonight listing all of the areas. I will take a few examples. Income tax exemptions for foreign company executives are provided in this budget. When will this government start behaving in Australia's national interest? When it is cutting support for health and education for children from disadvantaged backgrounds, what is the reason for giving priority to providing income tax exemptions on the overseas earnings of foreign company executives? That is why I say that this is a true Liberal budget. Labor built Medicare and only Labor will save Medicare. Simon Crean announced in his budget reply our plan to save Medicare. The battle lines are drawn as to the sort of Australia we want to see and the sort of Australia the Howard government is determined to create.
This budget allocates $2½ billion extra for defence and national security. Essentially, I consider that to be necessary because Australia does need to defend itself and provide for the security of its citizens. But this government has increased the risk of terrorism in Australia and against Australians overseas. In large measure it has done that through its involvement in the coalition in the attack on Iraq. It has become quite evident that the rationale all along for the Australian government's involvement in Iraq was regime change. That was the real reason all along—not dealing with a clear and present danger created by an Iraq that possessed weapons of mass destruction. Yet the government needed to pursue the argument that Iraq possessed such weapons because that was the only way to have any hope of securing United Nations support for the attack on Iraq. In the event the case was not made, and the United Nations indicated that it would not support such an attack. Nevertheless, the government said, `We are sure that weapons of mass destruction do exist in Iraq.' It has now been quite some time since the end of hostilities in Iraq, and the search for weapons of mass destruction has finished. Either there was a massive failure of the intelligence that was provided to and relied upon by the Howard government and the governments of the other nations forming the coalition of the willing or this government so wanted to believe in the existence of weapons of mass destruction that it was keen to rely on that intelligence when its true objective was regime change.
Notwithstanding the fact that Saddam Hussein was a brutal killer and dictator, the tragedy of that war is that the coalition of the willing now considers it valid and acceptable to attack a country to achieve regime change. I emphasise that the regime in Iraq was murderous and brutal. But we do need to appreciate this: dangerously, it has been validated for countries to attack each other if they do not like each other's regimes. That is the world in which we now live—a world in which it is all right to attack another country if you do not like its regime. Australia has been part of setting that example. I know that it is not popular to make these observations after the war in Iraq, because there is a general sentiment that the war was successful and that it was somehow completely justified by its outcome. But we have moved into very dangerous territory, where it has now been validated that one country or group of countries can attack another country to achieve regime change.
This budget furthers the government's philosophy of taking Australia down the low road of low skills and low wages. It provides for cuts to the New Apprenticeships scheme and it cuts the Jobs Pathway Program. It has no commitment to lifting the skills base of this country. The government's philosophy—again, given full expression in this budget—is to take most Australians down the low road of low skills and low wages, competing against other countries on wage costs. There are countries in our region that will always beat Australia on wage costs. The journey down the low road of low skills and low wages not only would be futile, because we will never be able to compete on low wages with a number of countries in East Asia; it would guarantee that, for most Australians, wage rates would be depressed. Therefore, Labor considers that it is complete folly to take the low road. But that is what this government has been doing. In doing so it has been returning Australia to a farm and a quarry. The budget reveals that, in this current year, net exports will have stripped 2¾ percentage points from Australia's economic growth rate. That is an appalling trade performance. It is so bad that it is the worst trade performance since Melbourne hosted the Olympics in 1956. It is also forecast in the budget that, in the coming financial year, net exports will further detract from economic growth.
In taking Australia back to a farm and a quarry, the Minister for Trade's strategy is to pray for rain, because he blames the drought for this appalling trade performance. But any analysis of our performance in relation to sophisticated manufactured exports tells a very sorry story, because the growth in sophisticated manufactured exports under this government has slumped 60 per cent, compared with the growth in the comparable period of the previous Labor government. This government has said, `We will take Australia back to relying on the sheep's back, back to relying on Australia producing mineral output; that's good enough for us.' Well, it is not good enough for the people of Australia; because, for most Australians, going the low road means low wages, low skills and a reliance on good seasonal conditions. We have heard, of course, that seasonal conditions have not been good. It has been a severe drought, but that does not explain why our performance in relation to sophisticated manufactured exports has been so abysmal. Notwithstanding the fact that we have been, according to the Treasurer, in the worst drought in 100 years, primary commodity exports account for 63 per cent of Australia's merchandise exports—up from the 59 per cent of Australia's merchandise exports in the last year of the previous Labor government. So this government have failed to continue the diversification of Australia's export base that was begun by the previous Labor government and that was going so well.
I will list just a few hostilities towards the goal of a high-skill, high-wage country that have been committed by this government. The Export Market Development Grants scheme, a very successful scheme enjoying wide support amongst exporters, was capped by this government in its first budget at $150 million. Through the passage of inflation since then, the real value of the EMDG scheme has fallen by more than 11 per cent, and in this latest budget it remains capped at that 1997 level.
One of the first decisions of the incoming Howard government was to cut the R&D tax concession from 150 per cent to 125 per cent. The consequence of that became almost immediately clear. When that R&D tax concession was introduced by the previous Labor government, in each and every year subsequently business spending on research and development rose as a share of GDP. But, once this government said to the business community of this country that it was not committed to research and development, that it was not committed to the high road of high skills and innovation and that it was cutting the R&D tax concession from 150 per cent to 125 per cent, in each and every year of this government business spending on research and development has fallen. What has the government done about it? It has done worse than nothing.
For smaller businesses, there is a separate scheme, and that is the R&D Start Program. Last year, the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources belatedly confirmed that the R&D Start Program had been frozen. The reason given was that spending on the R&D Start Program had exceeded the budgeted amount. But, in this budget, it is clear that that was never the case, because this budget shows that actual spending on the R&D Start Program was $16 million less than the amount that was allocated in that year. So, far from simply being frozen, the R&D Start Program was cut. 
The government now has legislation in this parliament that will tear away the safety net for low-paid workers in this country so that the journey to a low-skilled, low-wage country can be completed.
The consequence of all of this is that Australian families are struggling to make ends meet; and, as Australian families struggle to make ends meet, so does Australia as a nation struggle to make ends meet. That explains why foreign debt has crashed through the $350 billion barrier. When Peter Costello drove around in his debt truck, foreign debt was $180 billion. He and the Prime Minister said, `We will fix foreign debt.' Fix it? They have almost doubled it to $354 billion. By the Treasurer's own favoured measure at the time he was making these promises, foreign debt for every man and woman in Australia was $10,000, but now it is $18,000. Fix it? They have almost doubled it. This government have addicted Australia to debt, because Australians struggle to make ends meet under the draconian policies, the Liberal philosophy, the Liberal way, the low road. 
Labor will take Australia along the high road to high skills and high wages. Labor will support an innovative Australia, the lifting of the skills base of Australians and a decent and affordable education for all young people. Labor will support fundamentally the restoration and the strengthening of Medicare so that we can make sure this country is returned to a fair society instead of a divided society where the privileged few get on very well under the Liberals but where those who cannot afford to are expected to fend for themselves.

"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2003-05-27,"—The parliament has before it Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004, Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2003-2004 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004. Because I introduced the second two bills I am going to concentrate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004; I will not technically be speaking on the second two bills. Like most other members and most people around the country, I was immensely proud when the Treasurer rose in the chamber to deliver the budget this year. This country has faced a difficult international time. We had September 11 and October 12, we have had perhaps the worst drought in Australia's history and we have had all the challenges created by SARS and the war against terror. The world will never be the same again and this country has not hesitated to take a very strong stand in pursuit of freedom.
The previous speaker referred to the war on Iraq. The government was prepared to stand up and be counted and to take a very strong position, which made sure that the UN Security Council resolutions carried by that body over a very long period were able to be enforced. If Australia was not prepared to join the coalition of the willing, we simply would not have been able to take the position of pride that we take in the world today. As part of the coalition of the willing we have seen the fall of Saddam Hussein, and we have seen now that the people of Iraq have an opportunity for a democratic future. Everyone talks about how appalling the regime of Saddam Hussein was and yet I find it bizarre that some members opposite still oppose the very strong stand taken by the government, by President George W. Bush and by British Labour Prime Minister, Tony Blair. We find that they do not talk much about Tony Blair these days, but he had the courage of his convictions. He was prepared, in the face of strong opposition in his own party, to take Britain in as part of the coalition of the willing. The countries of the world can be particularly pleased that Saddam Hussein has gone and particularly pleased that the threat to international peace which was posed by his regime has now been removed. The chance of weapons of mass destruction falling into the hands of terrorists is now substantially reduced. That, of course, is a particularly positive outcome.
I am privileged to represent the central and southern Sunshine Coast in the federal parliament. The electorate of Fisher is singularly blessed. It is one of the most beautiful areas in the country, one of the fastest growing areas in the country and an electorate in which many people aspire to live. Like other electorates around the country, the electorate of Fisher will benefit substantially from the very many initiatives contained in the budget which was delivered by the Treasurer a short time ago. It will benefit from reduced income taxes, stronger defence, support for the disabled and more funding for higher education and health. Additionally, it will benefit from the initiatives relating to the war against terror, which will make Australia a safer place for all Australians.
In last year's budget, there was a major upgrade of Australia's defence and security—a move that most Australians were pleased about. We did not know how close to home the terrorist threats would become. All of us would recall exactly what we were doing when we heard about the unfolding tragedy of the Bali massacre on October 12. Eighty-eight innocent Australians, many of them young, were killed in Bali at the hands of criminal terrorists. I want to say that I am pleased with the way the Indonesian authorities have worked to find and charge the perpetrators of these outrageous crimes. Currently in Indonesia the trials of some of those people are underway. October 12 and September 11 showed us as that, as a nation, we cannot take our security for granted. Historically, Australia has been a safe country and we are very fortunate that we have been safe. We have tended to say that we are a long way from hot spots of trouble, but we saw with the events of October 12 just how close to home tragedy can be. We see that terror can strike anywhere; therefore, it is important that the government take a very strong stand to upgrade Australia's security and border protection in this year's budget. That is an initiative that will be welcomed by all Australians.
As a nation we have had a tough year. We have been tested by terror and war overseas, we have had the most extensive drought ever recorded in our history and bushfires have ravaged life and property. We were also tested again as the international economy turned down. But the proof that our economy is one of the most resilient is in the presentation of a budget that, against all odds, is in surplus and also provides $2.4 billion in personal income tax cuts for all Australians. Those opposite and some others in the community suggest that the tax cut should have been higher. Any tax cut would ideally be as high as any government could possibly make it. But this government has brought about sound economic management. We brought in a surplus budget, we paid for all the expenses that Australia needed during this financial year and, because there was an amount left over, we were able to return that, by way of a dividend for sound economic management, to the Australian people. It is appropriate that this government should return the proceeds of responsible economic management to the Australian people. The ALP, of course, always likes to spend money—
—Hear, hear!
—The member for Banks says that he likes to spend money. He was part of the government that built up the massive debt levels we inherited upon coming to government. He was part of the government that also saw a $10,300 million budget deficit at the time this government was elected. We all recall that, during the election campaign in 1996, the Keating government said that their budget was in surplus and yet, on the Monday after the election, the bad news came to the incoming government that the previous government had lied, had not told the truth, and had misled the Australian people. We now have a situation where this government has been responsible. It did not create the problem but it has certainly accepted the responsibility for fixing it.
It is interesting that the member for Banks claimed that when he was in office people could get into a hospital. People ought to appreciate that this government is spending close to $1 billion extra—and this was mentioned in the budget—to boost and enhance Medicare. We are preserving the two key elements of Medicare: firstly, the universal access by anyone who wants to use the public hospital system in a free way, so there are no hospital charges; and, secondly, universal access to the Medicare rebate for anyone who goes to a doctor. The government has also brought in some initiatives to encourage doctors to bulk-bill pensioners and those who are holders of concession cards. There are rewards for doctors who do that—they are given access to direct billing for the Medicare rebate proportion of their bill. We have been accused of trying to destroy Medicare—that is a sick joke. When you spend close to an extra $1 billion on maintaining Medicare, how on earth can you be accused of trying to destroy it?
Also under the ALP, private health insurance was collapsing and people were not able to afford to go to private hospitals. That placed an intolerable strain on Australia's public hospitals. We are very pleased about our private health insurance rebate, because that has meant that many more people are now able to access the private hospital system, meaning that others who are not able to afford private health insurance have access to the public hospital system. With every last cent of the GST going to the state governments, the states will have an unprecedented opportunity to fund their constitutional responsibilities. If they are prepared to accept those responsibilities, we will see the states pouring money into health, pouring money into education and pouring money into roads. Instead of the states taking those chances to spend money where they ought, they simply whinge, whine, complain and say that the federal government is not giving them enough money. We are giving them the wherewithal, the financial ability, to meet their constitutional responsibilities—that is a positive thing.
On the Sunshine Coast we have the Sunshine Coast hospital at Nambour and we have the Caloundra Hospital. Those hospitals are chronically underfunded by the Beattie Labor government. State Labor members claim that the reason we have long waiting lists at Nambour hospital is inadequate federal funding. The reason that people have to wait so long for services at Nambour and Caloundra is that the Beattie government simply is not funding Sunshine Coast hospitals to the extent that it should. In my view, it is dishonest for the Labor government in Queensland to try and shift the blame to the federal government; it is also inappropriate. I am calling on Premier Beattie and all of the state members on the Sunshine Coast who represent the Australian Labor Party to go in there and fight for the Sunshine Coast, to make sure that we get our fair share of hospital funding and, equally importantly, to make sure that get our fair share of road funding.
It is incontestable that the Beattie government has a love affair with the Gold Coast. The Beattie government does not hesitate to spend money on access roads for the Gold Coast; yet the Sunshine Coast is very much the poor relation. It does indicate what a very poor brace of Labor representatives we have at state level on the Sunshine Coast. Chris Cummins, the member for Kawana, is particularly ineffectual, as are the members for both Noosa and Glass House, Ms Molloy and Ms Carolyn Male. On the one hand, we find that this government is bringing in a responsible budget which will benefit all people, including those on the Sunshine Coast; on the other hand, we find that the Labor government in Queensland is chronically underfunding infrastructure and services on the Sunshine Coast, to the extent that one of the fastest growing areas in Australia is being severely taxed by the failure of the Beattie government to meet its funding responsibilities. All taxpayers will receive a tax cut, and this is a very positive initiative of the government. The feedback that I have had from people right across the Sunshine Coast is that this tax cut is very much welcomed.
The University of the Sunshine Coast is also a major winner, as a result of the education initiatives announced by the Treasurer in the budget. The University of the Sunshine Coast is a wonderful institution. It is only a few years old, it is a greenfields university, and it was not previously an institution of higher education or a technical college. It started off as the Sunshine Coast University College and for a time was affiliated with the Queensland University of Technology. The member for Fairfax and I, along with state coalition members on the Sunshine Coast, took the fight to the former coalition government in Queensland and sought to have the University of the Sunshine Coast become an independent institution. It always had its own act in the Queensland parliament, so it was technically independent. But the fact that it was called a college meant that it did not have the same opportunity to compete as it would if it had the standing that the name of the University of the Sunshine Coast would be able to enjoy. Because Minister David Kemp and the state government were able to work together, the University of the Sunshine Coast became a completely independent institution, not only at law but also by way of perception.
This has meant that the University of the Sunshine Coast has been able to attract students from right around the world. I enjoy a particularly good relationship with the University of the Sunshine Coast. The current education minister, Dr Nelson, has been to the University of the Sunshine Coast, and he has been particularly impressed with what is being achieved. This government recognised the important role of regional universities when the Treasurer handed down the budget. The government has secured funding to recognise the unique contribution made to local communities and students by regional higher education institutions. From the beginning of next year, the Howard government will provide an additional $122.6 million over four years to support students at regional campuses, and this will be of great benefit to the University of the Sunshine Coast.
This is part of the commitment of the Howard government to invest an additional $1.5 billion in higher education funding over the next four years. By providing extra money to regional campuses like the University of the Sunshine Coast, the Howard government is recognising the higher cost of delivering education outside capital cities. Under these new arrangements, the University of the Sunshine Coast will be eligible for a five per cent loading, which will be incorporated into the new Commonwealth grants scheme. This loading has been determined on the basis of regionality, size and distance from the capital city of Brisbane.
Financially disadvantaged students from regional and rural areas will also benefit from the introduction of Commonwealth accommodation scholarships and Commonwealth education costs scholarships. From the start of 2004 the Howard government will provide 1,500 students with $4,000 per year for up to four years to assist with accommodation expenses. A further 2,500 students will be eligible for $2,000 for up to four years to assist with educational costs. Job network providers and other community organisations on the Sunshine Coast will also benefit from the budget with an allocated $135 million over four years to community organisations which provide disability employment services. This will provide job opportunities for people with a disability. It will give them the chance to get a foot on the employment ladder and a start in life. It will also boost local employment on the Sunshine Coast.
As I have previously indicated, residents of the Sunshine Coast are pleased that the federal government has invested more funds to secure the safety of Australia and the safety of our borders. The security of our people and our nation is our government's highest priority. I have mentioned before the threats of international terrorism, and the fact that Saddam Hussein has gone will reduce the chance of weapons of mass destruction falling into the hands of terrorists. The government has been prepared to take some tough decisions. They are not cheap decisions. It is very easy to walk away from one's responsibilities, but this government has been prepared to take the tough decisions and it is not going to apologise for that.
The government will invest an extra $2.1 billion over five years in defence spending. A new special operations command will also be established to provide 334 more combat and support personnel to supplement Australia's existing special forces, including an additional commando company and a maritime terrorist capability. Defence logistics will receive a boost to improve the combat readiness of our FA fighter jets and Hercules aircraft, as well as our range of transport vehicles.
Protection of our borders has always been a major concern to my constituents. I regularly poll my constituents on the issues of concern to them, and border protection and national security are always ranked very highly amongst matters of concern. The government will further upgrade security at our shipping ports, airports and other facilities. More shipping containers will be X-rayed, while improved border processing systems will identify and track persons of concern. Australia's quarantine and customs services will continue to play a crucial role in enforcing the integrity of our borders.
I mentioned before the initiatives with respect to Medicare. I have received very positive feedback from my local community about the Medicare initiatives. Under the ALP, Medicare was really going nowhere. Under the ALP, Medicare was in fact in need of being fixed. This government has been prepared to look at the needs of Medicare and take some difficult decisions. I think there is a broad consensus in Australia that Medicare has done a good job. This government has been prepared to look at the Medicare system and has been prepared to fix it where it is required. I think that people are very disappointed when the government is criticised for its attempts to refurbish Medicare and is accused of being the wrecker of Medicare. Nothing could be further from the truth.
The budget delivered in 2003 by the current government is a budget of which we are all singularly proud. It is a budget that delivers economic growth, a budget surplus, responsible tax cuts, a defence boost and enhanced security. There is also a tremendous investment in education. This is the sort of budget that we never saw from the ALP. They were prepared to do anything and say anything to crawl into office. They breached their election promises, whereas this government has placed a very high store on meeting its commitments to the Australian people. I commend this bill to the House.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2003-2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Smith, Stephen, MP",ALP,2003-05-27,"—I speak tonight on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004 and to support the second reading amendment moved by the member for Fraser and shadow Treasurer, Mr McMullan. In particular I want to focus on the first two paragraphs of that amendment, which read: 
... “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the government for:
(1)	Its obsession with shifting the cost of health and education from the budget to Australian families;
(2)	Imposing higher costs of doctors visits on families without concession cards and a 30 per cent hike in essential medicine prices ... ”
In my capacity as shadow minister for health, I want to focus on the shifting of the cost of health from the budget to Australian families, the imposition of higher costs on doctors' visits and the 30 per cent hike in the cost of essential medicines.
The government's so-called Fairer Medicare package is, of course, a package to make Medicare unfair. I recall that, when the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, was elected in 1996, his slogan was `For all of us'. We now know the truth is that, under John Howard, Medicare is for just some of us. When we look at the so-called Fairer Medicare package, the budget papers confirm the government's earlier announcement of its changes to Medicare. This is a budget that John Howard would have been proud to deliver as Malcolm Fraser's Treasurer. We know that when John Howard was Treasurer in the Fraser government, the last changes that the Fraser government made to Medibank gave the Prime Minister the public policy model for what the government is now seeking to achieve. The last of the Fraser Medibank models essentially restricted bulk-billing to pensioners, concession card holders, and what John Howard then described as `disadvantaged people'. That is the central basis of the government's changes to Medicare: to essentially end bulk-billing for Australian families and to restrict bulk-billing to pensioners, concession card holders and the poor.
It is no surprise that this is where John Howard, as Prime Minister, now returns to. It was not just when he was the Treasurer in the Fraser government but when he was opposition leader in the 1980s that his references to Medicare and bulk-billing abound. His comments were that he wanted to destroy Medicare, he wanted to destroy bulk-billing, it was a rort and he wanted to rip it up and tear it apart. But in 1987 his formal election commitment as Leader of the Opposition was a public policy commitment to the Australian people which said that bulk-billing would be restricted to pensioners, concession card holders and poor people, and doctors would be free to charge everyone else whatever they wanted to charge.
That goes to the heart of the second part of the government's Medicare changes: the capacity—which is currently unlawful—for doctors to split the patient rebate from the copayment or the out-of-pocket charge to the patient. That is the device which provides the financial incentives for doctors to bulk-bill pensioners and concession card holders only. That device, which the Prime Minister describes as a convenience for the patients, is simply a convenience for the doctors to increase the costs, bit by bit and visit by visit, so far as Australian families are concerned. That is the device that John Howard uses. We know that it is much easier for a doctor to increase a charge from $10 to $20 than it is to increase a charge from $35 to $45. We also know that it is easier for a doctor to introduce a charge of $5 than a charge of $30. So that device makes it easier for doctors to walk away from bulk-billing, if they are currently bulk-billing, and easier for doctors to increase the cost of their charges, bit by bit and visit by visit, for families. We know that Australian families who earn more than $32,300 are not eligible for a concession card or a health care card. So Australian families on $32,000, on $40,000 or on $50,000 will be whacked, visit by visit and bit by bit, every time they go to the doctor.
It is no surprise that this is where John Howard has ended up. This was the policy approach that he adopted as Malcolm Fraser's Treasurer. This was the policy approach that he adopted as Leader of the Opposition in the 1980s. He made a formal commitment in the 1987 election that bulk-billing should be restricted to pensioners. In that context, he also said that he believed free visits to public hospitals should be restricted to pensioners and concession card holders. We found precisely the same public policy approach in the 1993 commitment by the then opposition, the Liberal and National parties, in their Fightback proposal to restrict bulk-billing—an effective or de facto means testing and an effective destruction of the universality of our Medicare arrangements.
We also know that John Howard recanted all of that. He made two great promises in the 1996 election, when, as I said, his slogan was `For all of us'. His two great promises were that he would never ever introduce a GST—which he subsequently did—and that Medicare and bulk-billing would stay. He gave a litany of guarantees, including an absolute guarantee that Medicare and bulk-billing would stay. When, famously, it was put to him during an interview with Laurie Oakes on the Sunday program that that was what Malcolm Fraser had said about Medibank, he said, `Well, you're not talking to Malcolm Fraser; you are talking to John Howard, and what I say goes.' That commitment to the Australian public—which was repeated formally as part of the 1996 election commitment of the Liberal Party, the 1998 election commitment of the Liberal Party and the 2001 election commitment of the Liberal Party—has now been torn up in the face of the Australian people. This is not John Howard fixing Medicare or bulk-billing; this is a John Howard fix. He is returning to the scene of his public policy crimes of the 1970s and 1980s to destroy the universality of Medicare and bulk-billing, to effectively de facto means test it and to put bulk-billing out of reach as a practical means so far as Australian families are concerned. It is not John Howard fixing the problem; it is a John Howard fix.
How did we get to where we are? In 1996, when the Labor Party left office, bulk-billing rates were at 80 per cent. We know that under Labor, from when Medicare was introduced in February 1984 through to when Labor was defeated and left office in March 1996, bulk-billing rates increased every year. They got to a peak in May 1996, shortly after Labor left office, of 80.5 per cent. Every year that the Howard government has been in office, bulk-billing rates have fallen. We saw on Friday, a week ago, the release of the last set of official statistics, which show that the national bulk-billing rate has fallen to 68.5 per cent—a 12 per cent slide. Dramatically, more than half of that slide has happened over the last 12 to 18 months. We also know that, after the government was re-elected in November 2001, the health department advised the new Minister for Health and Ageing, Senator Patterson, in December 2001 that, unless the government took dramatic steps, bulk-billing would continue to decline dramatically and that the department could not advise the government where the next stable level of bulk-billing would be. That is precisely what has occurred.
As late as December last year, we saw the Prime Minister stand up in this House and say that it was not factually correct to say that there was a problem, a crisis, with bulk-billing. Every time we saw the dramatic decline in the statistics, the new health minister said that this was not a catastrophe or a crisis; it was merely a disappointment. It has only been as a result of an outcry in the community about the adverse consequences for Australian families of the collapse of bulk-billing that we have now seen the government move. It is responding to what it sees as a political need, not responding with a sensible public policy approach. In a classic John Howard fix, it is responding in a way which it pretends is a solution to the problem—but it is a solution which actually destroys Medicare and its universality and will essentially end bulk-billing for Australian families.
After seven years of stealth and attrition—seven years of John Howard mouthing support for Medicare but not putting any resources into it, of effectively keeping the screws on the doctors' rebate and of not responding to the changing nature of doctors' practices and growing work force shortage issues and problems—finally, when it comes to the crunch, what do we see? We do not see a government committed to Medicare; we do not see a government committed to the universality of Medicare; we do not see a government committed to bulk-billing. We see John Howard wanting to return Australia's health care system to a model that he fashioned as Malcolm Fraser's Treasurer, as opposition leader in the 1980s and as part of the Fightback program of the Liberal Party in 1993.
When we look at the government's package in the budget papers, what do we find? We find $917 million over four years in this package. It is no coincidence that when you turn to another part of the budget papers you discover that the draw-down in the forward estimates from the last budget for the funding for the Australian health care agreements is $918 million over four years. So the government funds its package to destroy Medicare by ripping $918 million out of the funding for public hospitals for the states. Over the five-year period of those health care agreements, that is essentially $1 billion to $1.5 billion hand-passed to the states. The government's package is $917 million over four years. Part of that does respond to the work force shortage measures, with commitments for additional training places, additional nurse practitioners and additional university places for doctors. The Leader of the Opposition and I, as shadow minister, have made it clear that we support these measures.
When it goes to those measures that seek to respond—in a pretence of a response—to legitimate claims by doctors that the rebate no longer reflects adequately the capacity on their part to practice quality medicine, to run a small business and to make a reasonable income, what device does the government use? It spends $350 million over four years on increased rebates. That compares with Labor's package, as announced by the Leader of the Opposition in his budget reply, to spend $2 billion over four years—$1.5 billion of which goes to doctor's rebates and incentives for bulk-billing. That is the relative measure of the packages: $350 million by the government over a four-year period to encourage doctors to bulk-bill pensioners only, with nothing for families; and Labor's measures of $1.5 billion to encourage practising doctors to bulk-bill all Australian families, not restrict it to those Australians with an income of $32,300 or less.
There are three insidious measures in the government's package that are wrapped up in part of that funding. The first is to provide doctors with incentives to bulk-bill pensioners and concession card holders only. That effectively destroys the universality of Medicare and will see a second-class safety net for pensioners and poor people in the long term. The second measure will enable a practice which is currently unlawful—doctors splitting the patient rebate from any copayment. That effectively gives the green light to increases in doctor's charges for Australian families. The AMA said on the release of the package that it was inevitable that the costs of visiting a doctor would go up. Thirdly, in an acknowledgement that that proposal could only lead to increased costs for Australian families, the government proposes to introduce a capacity on the part of Australians to, for the first time, take out private health insurance to cover the cost of gap payments of $1,000 or more. That is an acknowledgement that costs will go up—an acknowledgement that that proposal can only be inflationary and, for the first time, introduces private health insurance so far as GP costs are concerned. That is the thin edge of the wedge so far as an American style health system is concerned.
It is not just Labor saying it is inevitable that costs will go up for Australian families. The AMA has said it and, more importantly in some respects, the government's Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Family and Community Services, the member for Parramatta, essentially acknowledged that. The member for Parramatta last week acknowledged two very important things. Firstly, he gave the lie to the Prime Minister's pretence that there is no difference between Labor's policy approach and the government's policy approach. Having failed to strike a blow in any way on Labor's budget response in this area, the Prime Minister quickly changed tack and said there was no difference between the two. He was blown out of the water by Rosco, the member for Parramatta, in that respect. Secondly, the member for Parramatta confirmed, in his capacity as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Family and Community Services, that costs would go up for Australian families.
As I said earlier, commonsense tells you that the capacity to split the copayment from the patient rebate will lead to increased charges. It is much easier for a doctor to introduce a charge at $5 than it is for them to introduce a charge at $30, and it is much easier for a doctor to increase a charge from $10 to $20 than it is for them to increase a charge from $35 to $45. Bit by bit, visit by visit, families will end up paying for their visits to the doctor with a credit card, not with their Medicare card—their Medicare card will essentially be irrelevant.
Labor's proposal, on the other hand, seeks to provide a first instalment to get bulk-billing back to respectable rates. It was at 80 per cent nationally when we left office in 1996, and we can get back to that rate again. Under our proposal, Labor will do two things: firstly, increase the patient rebate for bulk-billed transactions to 95 per cent of the rebate, an effective increase per bulk-billed patient of $3.35; and, in the fourth year of the budget cycle, increase the patient rebate to 100 per cent, an effective increase of $5 per bulk-billed patient.
At the same time we will provide incentives for doctors to meet bulk-billing targets. A doctor practising in the metropolitan area would have a bulk-billing target of 80 per cent. A doctor who made that target would get a cheque in the post of $7,500 on an annual basis. A doctor practising in outer metropolitan Australia—as configured by the lines on the government's outer metropolitan work force shortages maps—who reached a bulk-billing target of 75 per cent would receive an incentive payment, a cheque in the post for $15,000 per year. A doctor practising in rural, regional or remote Australia who made a bulk-billing target of 70 per cent would get an incentive payment of $22,500.
These are substantial incentives on the part of Labor—firstly, to stem the dramatic decline in bulk-billing and, secondly, to get bulk-billing back up to respectable rates. That is a $1.5 billion program over four years as far as increases in the rebate and in the incentive payments are concerned. Overall, Labor's package is $2 billion, because we pick up the work force shortage measures of the government that I referred to earlier. Of that $2 billion package, $1 billion is essentially new money funded half by way of savings in other areas and half out of the surplus. It is an affordable, deliverable, responsible package.
I made the point earlier that, when you look at the government's package of $917 million over four years, you find that that funding is ripped out of the health care agreement forward estimates. That is a very important linkage, because we know from state and territory health ministers around the countryside that one of the great problems we now have so far as public hospitals are concerned is that the dramatic collapse and decline of bulk-billing has seen great additional pressure on the emergency departments of our public hospitals.
We know that, if people cannot afford to make a payment to go and see a general practitioner to get the primary preventative care that they need, sooner or later—and it might take two days, it might take two weeks, it might take two months, it might take two years—they will end up in the emergency department of a public hospital. That will be at a far greater personal cost to themselves, because the medical intervention required will be much more substantial, and at a much greater cost to the state and Commonwealth taxpayer, because the medical intervention will be much more costly. It will not be medical intervention given by a GP who can give the primary preventative health care that people need. It is also invariably the case in this area that those people who are most at risk of serious illness or chronic diseases are also those who are least able to make the extra payment.
The second reading amendment moved by the member for Fraser, the shadow Treasurer, picks up these points. There are great adverse consequences for Australian families in shifting the cost of GP visits, and those are compounded by the government's ongoing proposal to increase by 30 per cent the cost of essential medicines so far as Australian families are concerned. On the other hand, Labor has a program to rescue bulk-billing, to restore bulk-billing to respectable rates and to restore Medicare, and that will be of great advantage to Australian families.

"Secker, Patrick, MP",LP,2003-05-27,"—I rise with great pleasure to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004. I note that many speakers before me, especially from the other side, have tried to make some case that Medicare is somehow not working and that somehow the changes that we are bringing in to encourage bulk-billing will have the reverse effect. I have just listened quite carefully to the member for Perth, who spent considerable time on this issue, and I have no doubt that he would have quite a high percentage of bulk-billing in his electorate. I have no doubt it would be much higher than in my electorate. In most cases in my electorate, you really have three choices. There is a small amount of bulk-billing, but in most cases a visit to the doctor means an up-front payment of perhaps $35 or more—which would certainly be harder for people than what we are proposing. You would later claim back the schedule fee, if you had the time to put in a Medicare claim. In some cases, you go to the doctor and you pay the difference—you might pay a $10 or $15 difference—and then through the bureaucracy you get sent back the schedule fee, which you then have to take to the doctor. So you have this circle of bureaucracy working.
What we are proposing is a far simpler set-up where, when you go to the doctor, you would pay the difference. In many cases the doctors will be encouraged through our means to increase their bulk-billing, especially to those most in need, which I think is a pretty fair sort of philosophy to have. You would swipe your Medicare card and the doctor would be paid within a couple of days. That is a far more sensible approach to the whole idea of bulk-billing than what we have now. We have an extraordinarily bureaucratic set-up to make payments for the schedule fee, and this would certainly make it much simpler.
It makes me quite proud to be part of a government that has delivered six surplus budgets, considering what it was left with by the previous Labor government, but it makes me even more proud that with this sixth surplus budget the government has been able to deliver further tax cuts to the Australian worker. This government has always been conscious of being a responsible financial manager. Anyone who tries to compare Labor governments and coalition governments from all around Australia—whether they be state or federal—sees the coalition as far better financial managers. That is how this government was seen when two years ago it delivered the largest tax cuts ever to the Australian people, and the government believes in giving as much back as possible wherever possible.
Frankly, with this budget all the Labor Party could complain about was the size of the tax cuts. But I remind the Labor Party that tax cuts are a bit like conjugal delights—even a little bit is a lot better than none at all! From 1 July 2003, Australian taxpayers will benefit from further income tax cuts to the value of $10.7 billion over four years. The increase in the low-income tax offset to $235 means that taxpayers earning between $20,000 and $27,475 per year will benefit from not only the increased tax offset but also the increase in the tax threshold for the 17 per cent rate, which combined will result in tax cuts of up to $329 per annum. A couple of people have said to me: `Well, that's great. I've now got my gas bill for the year paid for.' That is because we have been a responsible government and we have returned those tax cuts to the worker. Benefits of up to $208 through these tax cuts are on the cards for someone earning $45,000 per year, while a taxpayer on $65,000 per year will benefit from $573 in tax cuts per year.
Through sound financial management, this government has ensured that Australian taxpayers will get to keep a higher proportion of their earnings, which in turn provides greater incentives for people to find jobs, take promotion or improve their skills in return for remuneration. Of course, if you have more money to spend instead of the government spending it on your behalf, it gives you a little more freedom in the choice of how your wages are spent. Australia has survived a very difficult period in the international economic environment. Our economy has continued to grow to one of the best in the Western world, probably the best of all the OECD countries. I maintain that, without the strong economic management of this government, we would not be so well placed. 
These tax cuts that we are delivering will also benefit senior Australians. The increase in the senior Australians tax offset thresholds means that senior Australians eligible for this offset will now not pay tax on annual income of up to $20,500 for singles and up to $33,612 for couples. I think one of the great things this government has done is to make it easier for self-funded retirees to survive and live in comfort. Additionally, senior Australians will also benefit from the increased Medicare levy threshold because they will not pay the levy unless they incur an income tax liability. That is very important for the seniors who rely on aged care—more so than for younger people, who tend to be more healthy.
I think it is great to see our sound economic policies delivering not only for our nation but for the taxpayers as well, and I am extremely proud to be a part of that. Our nation will continue to benefit from our sound economic management, as we continue to keep our net debt low. We have always put a great emphasis on reducing the huge debt left to us by the previous Labor government. I am indebted to the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, who is at the dispatch box, for providing the following figures. In 1991, after 90 years of federation and after two world wars, the Depression and several droughts, floods and bushfires, the net federal debt was $16 billion. Five years later, under the Keating-Beazley Labor government, the debt level was out of control and had ballooned to $96 billion. It had increased sixfold in that time. We all know that, historically, the ALP are big spenders, but to get the debt level to $96 billion is, frankly, unfathomable.
The coalition took over the reins in 1996 and vowed to reduce the enormous debt left to us by the former Keating government. We have, I am pleased to say, now reduced that debt by two-thirds to $33 billion. It is still falling and projected to be $29 million by the end of the next financial year. The importance of this is that the federal government can now spend $4.6 billion extra per year on services with funds that were formerly paid out in interest. This means less pressure on interest rates, and the lowest interest rates and inflation rates in 30 years. 
So, to recap, the Howard coalition government has delivered six surplus budgets and the biggest tax cuts that the Australian people have ever received, and it has reduced Labor's debt by two-thirds. We now have the lowest interest rates and inflation rates in 30 years. It has also managed to deliver further tax cuts to the Australian people in this budget. Not even those opposite could deny that this is a pretty impressive record, one that I am sure they are extremely jealous of. 
Also in this budget is a provision to safeguard our community. In this increased climate of international uncertainty, where terrorist attacks have, unfortunately, not become uncommon, it is important that we provide to enhance Australia's security. This government is committed to doing just that, and that is why it has allocated significant new funding to domestic security initiatives to protect critical infrastructure and to provide for enhanced intelligence and security services. Following announcements made in the 2001-02 budget which allowed for an additional $1.4 billion over the following five years to upgrade Australia's security, this year's budget has provided $411 million over the five years from 2002-03 to further improve these security measures. Upgraded security infrastructure at our ports, airports and nuclear research facilities will be provided at a cost of $148 million, while state-of-the-art X-ray machinery will be used to examine shipping containers, whose movement will be monitored to allow easier location of suspect containers. An amount of $152 million has been allocated to improve Australia's intelligence agencies, and a national security hotline has been established to enable suspicious activity to be reported. A further $111 million will upgrade the country's protective security services.
One reason why I am so proud to be a part of this government is that we have such a broad based focus on the Australian community. Not only do we show such strong economic leadership but we also pay attention to all sectors of the community and make every effort to ensure that all sectors of it benefit wherever possible from our decisions. Representing a rural electorate and coming from a rural area, I have a particular interest in what our government offers rural Australians. Unlike our state counterparts—who, I might add, are all Labor governments and who historically do not acknowledge that rural Australia even exists—we are very conscious not only of the contribution that rural Australian businesses make to our nation's economy but also of the contribution that rural Australians make as a whole. In keeping with this, the government have been very careful to provide rural and regional Australia with the support that it needs to continue this success.
This year's budget has provided much support to regional Australia as a whole and, in fact, has provided much support to regions in my electorate of Barker as well. Much of regional Australia has suffered as a result of one of the most extensive droughts on record, and my electorate of Barker is no different. Much of the Mallee suffered under this big dry and many farmers have had much to deal with simply to survive. As a result, this government, through this budget, intends to provide $750 million over four years to help farmers, small businesses and regional communities with direct financial assistance, personal counselling, employment services and tax relief. In recognition of the contribution that Australia's agricultural base and environmental resources make to our nation, the government is providing assistance to protect them. Through this funding the government wants to encourage farmers and rural communities to adopt practices that mean that farming is sustainable and more resistant to future droughts so that the impact is more manageable.
The government is aware of the damage that natural disasters cause. It has provided around $100 million in 2003-04 to help communities recover when natural disasters strike. Just like the fires that ravaged eastern Australia earlier this year, natural disasters cause much devastation and suffering when they hit. This government is working with state and territory governments to establish a natural approach to natural disaster mitigation and to reduce the loss of life and property in the event of such a disaster. The government will provide $69 million over five years, conditional on state or territory matched funding and the implementation of more effective land use and building controls. It is hoped that, through this combined effort, regions will be much better prepared to deal with natural disasters and, as a result, the impact of these disasters will not be as great.
Just as we provide funding for unpleasant things such as natural disasters, this budget provides funding to a range of regional programs to support strengthened growth and opportunities in regional Australia, to improve access to services, to support planning and to assist structural adjustment for communities. This budget has provided for Regional Partnerships—an integrated program that combines all regional funding programs with the exception of Sustainable Solutions. The new program, with additional funding of $62 million over three years, will strengthen the role of the government's network of area consultative committees. The program is based on our partnership approach, which enables communities to develop their own priorities and then access government support to help make their priorities become reality.
Already my electorate of Barker—in particular, the south-east—has benefited from Regional Partnerships. Regional Solutions funding, which now comes under Regional Partnerships, has provided $288,000 worth of grants that have seen two important community projects come to fruition. The Kingston District Council has secured a $200,000 grant to construct a solar heated, half Olympic size pool at the Kingston Community School, the construction of which will mean that not only will the students have a great facility to learn to swim in but the community will also benefit, with the school's sporting facilities being open to the community outside school hours. This will be a valuable addition to what is already available in the district. I was speaking with the chairman, Evan Flint, on Sunday and he was very pleased with that result. The project came to fruition after much planning by the local community. I would like to take this opportunity to officially recognise the efforts of all involved but particularly those of Mr Grant Murray, the former principal of Kingston Community School, and Mr Stephen Rufus, CEO of the Kingston District Council, who worked very hard to see this project through.
Like the efforts of those two people, the efforts of the CEO of the Naracoorte-Lucindale Council, Mr Dennis Hovenden, and Karen Proud were instrumental in securing Regional Solutions funding of $88,000 to assist with the development of Market Square in Naracoorte into a recreational facility for all age groups. It is an exciting project for Naracoorte. Through the federal government-local community partnership, the facility will provide for the sporting and passive recreation needs of community groups in Naracoorte as well as of visitors from other parts of the south-east and elsewhere. Naracoorte is the gateway to the Naracoorte Caves, one of the few World Heritage listed areas in Australia.
This budget announcement of an extra $62 million over three years is very important to regional Australians. Through Regional Partnerships we can see very real results being achieved across rural Australia, and the government are working hard to ensure that these positive changes continue. Regional Australians also benefit from the extension of Farm Help, announced in this budget. Prior to this budget the closing date for applications was 30 November 2003; however, following the success of this program in helping farmers, the government have extended the application date to benefit the farming community. This is yet another reason why I am proud to be a part of this government. We continue to listen to the regions, which fell into such a rapid decline under the Keating Labor government, and we work with the regions to get things done. We acknowledge the seriousness of the problems that the regions face, and we work towards helping these regions to improve the situations that they face.
A good example of this is the announcement of the allocation of $16.6 million to the Murray-Darling Basin initiative. The Commonwealth government and appropriate state governments in the basin have agreed to coordinate their approach to dealing with resource management for sustainable use. We are all aware of the importance of the basin to our national economy. This underlines the need to ensure that the condition of the basin's natural resources is maintained for profitable use and for the benefit of all Australians. The challenge for government, industries and communities is to agree on how to continue operating this environment for everyone's benefit whilst ensuring that we are not further depleting an already dwindling resource. We intend to provide this $16.6 million to assist the Murray-Darling Basin Commission and all relevant jurisdictions to look seriously at the problems faced by the Murray-Darling Basin and to work out the best possible method to fix them. Jurisdictions will have to act together under the COAG water processes to ensure regulatory regimes in states and territories can deliver these outcomes, not just in the Murray-Darling Basin but throughout the rest of Australia as well.
Once again the federal government, through this budget, are providing assistance to work with interested parties—just like we do with the regions—to fix the problems that are faced by this country. We are conscious of providing funding to areas that need it most. In fact, through this budget, the federal government have reaffirmed our commitment to the health and wellbeing of rural Australians. With some rural and regional communities still facing difficulty, we are doing our best.

"Katter, Bob, MP",IND,2003-05-27,"—I rise to speak in this debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004. The Treasurer in this budget has balanced the books and has received accolades for so doing. It is a measure of just how intellectually super featherweight the media of Australia and the commentators are that they have praised him for balancing the books. I am most certainly a conservative when it comes to economics, and I like treasurers that balance the books, but I do not like treasurers that cannot balance the books of our nation. Because, whilst the books of the government are balanced—and this makes the Treasurer look wonderful—the books of the nation, if he has not noticed, are slightly out of balance. They are out of balance to the tune of $40,000 million a year! On the basis of the figures available for the first half-year of the current financial year, with each year that is going by the country is rolling up a debt. Let me be very specific: it was $20.9 thousand million for the half-year. So, on an annual basis, we are talking about $42,000 million a year.
To put that in perspective, let me go to another who is my authority for making such a comment: the current Prime Minister of Australia, who is a man I have very great respect for. Let me quote him from 11 July 1995, at a business community breakfast in Perth which was recorded by the media. John Howard said:
Of course the overwhelming economic problem, the economic challenge above all else ... is our continuingly, damagingly high current account deficit. ... just over nine years ago, the Prime Minister—
he is referring to Mr Keating—
declared that unless something was done about our current account deficit, this country was in danger of becoming a banana republic.
For the people on my right here, the ALP, let me quote Paul Keating, because Paul Keating said in 1986 that we were in danger of becoming a banana republic. We were running a current account deficit then of $11,000 million a year. So, if we were a banana republic when we were running a deficit of $11,000 million, I leave to your imagination what we are doing when we are running a current account deficit of $40,000 million a year.
—You know you don't understand economics, Bob.
—You interject, and I absolutely love you to interject, because I say without any equivocation or apology to you, my friend, that I most certainly do. If you stay here for long enough, you might learn a tiny bit about economics.
 (Ms Corcoran)—Order! I would ask you to address your remarks through the chair.
—Madam Deputy Speaker, the figure is $42,000 million. When Mr Howard said that in 1995, the current account deficit for that year was $16,000 million. Maybe the member from South Australia interjecting should have a quiet yarn with his leader, because his leader was saying that, when the current account deficit was $16,000 million a year, it was a `continuingly, damagingly high current account deficit' which `of course' was `the overwhelming economic problem' and the most challenging economic problem `above all else'. So, my friend, if you are questioning my soundness in these observations, all I am doing is quoting your leader to you. You had better go and have a quiet yarn with him. Anyway, stay on; you might pick up a few pieces of wisdom about economics, because we are going to talk about economics here.
In the whole of Australian history up to 1983, Australia had rolled up a collective debt of $25,000 million. We are now rolling up a debt every half-year of $21,000 million. Clearly, I do not have a great deal of respect for Mr Keating—and I do not say that lightly, because I think some of the Labor leaders of the past, such as Chifley and, particularly, Theodore, are some of the most outstanding men in our history. The debt is now $354,000 million and rising. The Liberals came to power with a debt truck that wandered around Australia—quite rightly so, in my opinion—having upon it the figure of $191.9 thousand million dollars. It was horrific, and they should have been voted into office. Yes, they were right in that contention. And they have taken that debt from $192,000 million to $354,000 million!
I think one of the problems in this place is that many of the Liberals on the left-hand side—the government—represent very wealthy electorates where they do not come across people who are in pain or who are ordinary people, and that pain is not communicated to them and they are inured to it. On the other side of the House, we have people that, in the main—and there are some notable exceptions, as there are on the other side—think it is very simple: you just take this money off the rich and give it to the poor. We will see the result of their handiwork as my speech continues.
I see in my own hometown of Cloncurry that we have had some new businesses open up. We have had three second-hand shops open up, we have had a motorbike shop open up and we have had two bicycle shops open up. Madam Deputy Speaker, you can see where we are going here: it is moving downmarket. We have had two of our motor dealerships close down. In a two-week period last month, we had three suicides in the sugar industry in North Queensland. I remember asking six people in the bar one afternoon whether they were better off than they were back in the eighties, and five of them said no. We were recently re-forming rugby league. We cannot get—and nor can any of the towns in the area afford any longer—paid players.
This is all interesting anecdotal information. We heard constantly trotted out in the years of Mr Keating, and now hear again in the years of Mr Costello, how wonderful the unemployment figures are. I have a problem with this. The unemployment figures went down in 1982 from a high of 715,000—which was about 11 per cent, if my memory serves me correctly—to 634,000 by the year 1999 and we could say, `There's a wonderful reduction in the unemployment figures; we have brought them down by 81,000.' That is all very well if you make a superficial analysis, but if you, in fact, check up on some ancillary figures such as the increase in the number of people who are totally permanently incapacitated in Australia you suddenly realise that we have a great outbreak of bad backs and migraine headaches and 361,000 people have suddenly gone on to the TPI pension. All that has happened is that we have just shuffled people from one column to another column.
To demonstrate the nature of the unemployment figures it is important to bring the attention of the House to the Sydney Morning Herald of 7 March 1998, in which the then community services minister, Larry Anthony, said:
There are 1.3 million on unemployment benefits. To this figure, we add 300,000 unemployed partners who obtain the dole via their partner, usually male, and the 400,000 unemployed who cannot claim the dole because of the assets and means test.
So what the minister was saying, and he is a very honest and very decent person, is that the number of people who really are unemployed in this country is around two million. On 25 February 1999, the Sydney Morning Herald journalist Tom Allard said:
A million more jobless reveal the true state of Australia's jobs market, which was exposed yesterday with the release of figures showing 1.7 million people want work that can't find it. This is almost a million more than the numbers officially recognised as unemployed.
On 9 April 1998 Ian Henderson, political correspondent of the Australian, said:
The jobs crisis is now so acute that 2.5 million people are unable to find work. Yes, that figure is three times the usually cited number.
Let me continue, because I think this is important. On 6 July 1996, Terry McCrann, the leading economics journalist of the Australian, said:
So that for want of a better term the jobless problem actually directly hits a staggering 2.5 million Australians. Official jobless—800,000, hidden unemployment—1.2 million, 500,000 under employed, leading on to claims that the official jobless figures are some sort of gigantic cover-up.
Is every economics commentator in the country incorrect? Are the figures that are trotted out in this House correct? Not all of them can be correct, that is for certain. We praise Minister Anthony for being as honest as he has been in divulging those figures.
The current Treasurer has the ignominious honour of being the highest taxing Treasurer in Australian history. I must say, in fairness to him, he has little alternative. The social security and welfare component in the budget has leapt from $14,000 million in 1982 to $69,000 million in 2002. It is a huge item in the budget. In the term of the current Treasurer, we are talking about a $20,000 million increase in social security and welfare. I praise the Treasurer insofar as he has not made attempts to cut back on these payments to the poor. But why is this huge explosion occurring? Why suddenly do we have to pay twice as much and allocate to the taxpayers of Australia twice as much for social security and welfare bills, which at $70,000 million are a pretty fair proportion of a budget of 198,000 million? I am including the GST of course and I will come to that in a moment.
We have the unemployment figures, we have this massive increase in social security and welfare payments and, finally, we have the household savings ratio. In 1984, it was 12.9 per cent; it is now minus 0.5 per cent. This is arguably one of the lowest in the OECD, if not in the whole world. Australians are not saving; they are actually going increasingly further into debt every day. These three economic indicators indicate to me what I already know. If you walk the streets of any town in my electorate—and, quite frankly, if you walk streets of Melbourne, Sydney or Brisbane—you would get the same results amongst ordinary people as opposed to the rich people.
Having said those things, I need to be a little bit specific when I make the claim that the Treasurer is the highest taxing Treasurer. If you add the GST of $31.7 thousand million to the figures that are levied in the budget of $166.38 thousand million, you will get $198.1 thousand million, which is about 27.9 per cent—if my memory serves me correctly—of GDP, which is easily the highest percentage of GDP in our history. The Treasurer tries to argue that that is a state government tax. I am sorry, Mr Treasurer; you are imposing that tax, not the state government. The fact is that you gave it to the states on the condition that they reduced their taxes. I am sorry, but you have made a big mistake. If you thought the states were going to decrease their taxation, you believe in the tooth fairy, as I said in this place at the time.
Now we know that they have reduced their budgets. They have reduced them by a minuscule $5,000 million dollars; that is, up to last year. Almost certainly, the budgets for all the state governments throughout Australia will increase by over $5,000 million this year, so in actual fact they never reduced their budgets at all. In real terms, there may be some reduction because of allowing for CPI, but we are talking about an infinitesimally small amount of money. What happened was that the GST was a straight cost add-on to the taxpayers of Australia. Where has this all come from? How did we end up in this dreadful situation? In the final year of the great John McEwen, we had a current account surplus. There was a 49 per cent increase in GDP over a 10-year period. Why are we suddenly in this situation?
I must just add one thing here. The Treasury can argue that average weekly earnings have increased over the last 10 years, which is mostly the period of this government in office, and they have—they have improved by seven per cent. That is minuscule compared with the last 10 years of the McEwen era, when they increased in real terms by 49 per cent, and it is a hell of a lot better than the Keating era, when they went down by 1.2 per cent. But this seven per cent amazed me, because I really do not believe that anyone is better off—most certainly the average Australian has not been better off over the last 10 years. I got to thinking about this, because average weekly earnings have definitely in real terms gone up. But, of course, there are two issues that are not factored in. One is the massive increase in taxation, which takes $16,500 off the average Australian's income. Because most of it is taken indirectly, of course, they do not notice it quite so much and it is not so obvious. There is a further $3,000—$2,989 to be exact—to pay off that extra net foreign debt. If you keep rolling up extra debt each year, it costs you extra money to service it. So the average Australian is $19,528 worse off because of these two factors: this massive increase in taxation over the period from 1984 to 2003, and the increase in the servicing of this huge extra debt burden.
Average weekly earnings in 1984 were $19,000 and by 2002 the figure had risen to $45,136. The CPI increase over that period was 79.8 per cent—which accounts for $15,225 from the increase in average weekly earnings of $26,000. If you take the $19,000 in extra tax and extra debt servicing from the increase in average weekly earnings, you are already down to $6,576, but you have lost another $15,000 because of your CPI. So the average Australian is a whacking great $8,500 worse off than they were before.
That is the reason why, overall, we are not the happy nation that we were many years ago. Where did this come from? It started with Mr Whitlam. He made a 25 per cent, across-the-board cut in tariffs that absolutely devastated manufacturing in this country. You might want to argue about the long-term benefits, but to quote the great John Maynard Keynes, `In the long term, we are all dead.' There is no doubt in my mind that Whitlam's was the first, mortal blow that was struck. Malcolm Fraser then went on the very straitjacketed, monetarist approach of Milton Friedman—that you have got to match money supply growth to the growth in goods and services. That is a reasonable proposition for an academic, but we here would like to think that by manipulating money supply—injecting borrowings, if you like—into certain parts of the economy you can show extraordinary growth in goods and services. In fact, your effect can be deflationary. Even a cursory glance at the works of John Maynard Keynes in the Great Depression, John Kenneth Galbraith, the leader of the New Deal economists in the United States, the German economist Dr Schacht or, right here in Australia, someone I consider easily the greatest man in Australian politics, Theodore—if he had been listened to, but he wasn't; we listened to Dr Niemeyer from the Bank of England—would show you. If you research what those men did in each of their countries in the era of the Great Depression, you would realise that there is enormous opportunity for using that borrowing power to do really wonderful things. 
I saw that so vividly in my home state of Queensland with people like Bjelke-Petersen borrowing the money to build infrastructure to make our coalmines easily the cheapest producers of coal in the entire world, and, similarly, in the sugar industry, with the delivery systems and movement systems that we created by investing that money.

"Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP",LP,2003-05-27,"—In speaking in this debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004 I would like to touch on the improvements toMedicare within it and reflect on the fact that the fundamental parts of the Liberal Party's health policy in 1996 were a commitment to retain Medicare, bulk-billing and community rating for private health insurance. That remains. The three pillars of Medicare have always been the Medicare rebate, free treatment at public hospitals and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. It is worth going back into a bit of the history of Medicare to actually see how bulk-billing was seen and what the rates were over the period that Labor were in office. Dr Neal Blewett, the Labor Party spokesman for health prior to the 1983 election, referring to the New Health Plan said this:
Doctors will be free to choose their method of bulk-billing the patient. They can charge the patient nothing and recover 85 per cent of the schedule fee directly from the public fund. It is expected that doctors will use this bulk-billing procedure for pensioners, low-income patients, the chronically ill and those in need.
That has not changed in the 20 intervening years—13 years of Labor and seven years of the Liberal Party. In response to a question without notice in 1984, again on bulk-billing, Dr Blewett said this:
It is clearly the Government's preference that doctors should bulk bill.
Then he goes on to say:
For doctors it removes the problem of bad debts. For patients it means that they do not have the worry of going and collecting a refund from the Medicare office. However, we have always accepted that some doctors have reasons, their own preferences, for not bulk billing all patients. The Government has always said that it would respect that right. But what we do regard as quite unacceptable is that doctors in their ideological opposition to Medicare should now refuse to bulk bill pensioners and the disadvantaged, whom for years they have bulk billed. That is the traditional practice, but for ideological reasons they are now punishing the old and the disadvantaged.
He goes on to say:
They recognise that this Government does not, and its predecessor did not, have the power to compel doctors to bulk bill the disadvantaged and the pensioners.
There are a couple of things I would like to say about that. Firstly, it reaffirms what we have said—that is, the billing practices of doctors are a matter for doctors. Dr Neal Blewett said that, Mr Brian Howe said and we say that. Secondly, in these changes we are proposing to do something that Labor never did—that is, to guarantee access to bulk-billing for cardholders. That is something that Neal Blewett never tried. In fact, his idea of encouraging that practice was to use the stick to demonise and defame any doctors who did not bulk-bill cardholders. Our approach is to use the carrot to say, `If doctors participate in our better access scheme, they'll get an extra $1 for metropolitan GPs and up to $6.30 for rural and regional GPs.' As I am sure you would agree, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, the carrot is always much better than the stick.
In 1991 when the bulk-billing rate was about 70 per cent—about what it is now—Brian Howe was asked a question by the member for Banks, who is still the member for Banks. There was a concern about the impact on bulk-billing and Mr Howe said:
I must stress that the Government does not control or determine doctors' charges or whether they bulk bill or raise an account to the patient. These things are determined by the competitive forces of the marketplace.
I could not agree more. He went on:
So while bulkbilling decisions are for individual doctors, I am confident that Medicare will continue to operate to ensure very high rates of bulkbilling.
When he said that, the bulk-billing rate was 70 per cent. That is what it was until December 2002, and that is what it has been for six of the seven years of the Howard government. In question time we often see a graph from the Member for Perth. What he has done is to truncate 18 months. Basically it is an expanded graph that looks at the difference between 70 per cent and 68 per cent, and of course you see a dramatic decline. But what he never shows is the left-hand side of the graph, which is what happened during Labor's time. For much of Labor's period in office, the bulk-billing rate was below 60 per cent; for most of it, it was below 70 per cent. In actual fact, during the last six years of Labor's term in power, the Medicare rebate increased by only six per cent. They had many budgets in which they froze the Medicare rebate. Since the Howard government has been in, it has increased by 20 per cent. It increases by CPI each year.
What is there to say about the latest bulk-billing figures? We find that 67.8 per cent of GP services are bulk-billed. The average patient contribution per service is $12.61 and, within that, there is quite a bit of difference. Obstetrics have very low levels of bulk-billing, at 19.4 per cent; and anaesthetics have very low levels, at 9.7 per cent. Pathology has much higher levels at 84.6 per cent; optometry, 96.6 per cent; and enhanced primary care, which is a very important initiative that looks at the management of chronic conditions, 96.2 per cent. Sometimes people say, `The decline in bulk-billing will have an impact on health,' but one of the most important things is this enhanced primary care, and there you still see high levels of bulk-billing. Importantly, bulk-billing now is 25 per cent higher than it was in 1984-85. Back then, the Labor Party thought it was a pretty good rate—and I will go on to say why there is nothing special or magical about the bulk-billing rate.
If you look at the geographic pattern of bulk-billing in this country, it puts to rest the notion that bulk-billing is any sort of equity measure. What you see is that the bulk-billing rates are extremely high in most of Sydney. In Western Sydney and on the North Shore, bulk-billing rates are high. In inner Metropolitan Melbourne and in eastern Melbourne, bulk-billing rates are high. But in almost all of country Australia, we have much lower bulk-billing rates than in the cities. I am indebted to Senator McLucas for putting questions on notice for Senate estimates. They show the bulk-billing rates and the number of bulk-billing services per electorate. I looked at the electorates that have a very high proportion of families with a weekly income below $500, from the 2001 census, and compared the figures with the December 2002 bulk-billing figures. When you look at the electorates with the highest percentage of families on incomes below $500, you find Cowper, with 39.8 per cent; Wide Bay, with 39.7 per cent; and Page—your own electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley—with 36 per cent. You also find median incomes of $618, $622 and $656. In the electorates with a high percentage of people on incomes below $500, you would expect, I suppose, a high bulk-billing rate. Is that the idea—that the bulk-billing rate means it is fair? In actual fact, the bulk-billing rate in Cowper is 51.8 per cent; in Wide Bay it is 62.2 per cent; and in Page it is 47.3 per cent. Then you have an electorate like Fowler, which has fewer families on lower incomes than Cowper, Wide Bay and Page, yet the bulk-billing rate is 98.2 per cent. You have electorates like Braddon and Hinkler with very similar numbers of people on low incomes. Braddon has a bulk-billing rate of 61.8 per cent and Hinkler, 43.4 per cent. In Sydney, you even have some of the electorates with the highest median income and the highest percentage of families on high incomes, yet they have bulk-billing rates of over 80 per cent and 95 per cent. If you look at the number of bulk-billing services in Fowler, Blaxland, Chifley, Reid and Prospect, you will find that in these five electorates there are over a million bulk-billed services out of a total of 98 million.
The Intergenerational Report, which was released in last year's budget, highlighted the challenges and opportunities for Australia over the next 40 years. Looking specifically at health, it predicted that, with current trends continuing, Commonwealth expenditure on health would increase from four per cent to eight per cent of GDP if nothing was done. It predicted that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme would increase by five times that amount. Given that, the Labor Party proposal—which says that the bulk-billing rate is a problem, that the bulk-billing rate needs to be treated and that they are going to put $2 billion into that problem without any improvement in the health of our country and so on—is a mistake. All it will do is increase taxes, increase interest rates and increase government debt. 
There is nothing special about a bulk-billing rate of 80 per cent. There is nothing special about a bulk-billing rate of 70 or 67 per cent. I do not get many letters to my electorate office complaining about the bulk-billing rate in my electorate. I do not get many phone calls at all about the bulk-billing rate. In fact, people often complain instead about the trouble that they have to go to with Medicare forms and so on. The idea of a bulk-billing rate has no resonance in the community. We saw the height of comedy last year when the member for Reid came in here and said that there had been a community rally in his electorate about the decline in the bulk-billing rate. The bulk-billing rate in his electorate was actually 98 per cent, so people in Reid are so civic-minded that they come out and rally because they are concerned that the bulk-billing rate is falling in the rest of Australia! It must be a great place to live. 
The principal issue here is access. There is a shortage of GPs in rural and outer metropolitan areas. Residents of regional Australia have higher death rates from cardiovascular disease, cancer and injury. Trying to increase the bulk-billing rate and making that your objective will not improve health at all. It does nothing to improve the poorer health of regional Australia. 
The package in this budget—$916 million over the next four years—is an integrated package to make Medicare fairer and more accessible. As has always been the case, billing decisions remain a matter for the individual doctor. Neal Blewett said that, Brian Howe said that and we said that. But, for the first time, participating practices will be required to bulk-bill those with a concession card. However, non-cardholders will still have access to bulk-billing. If someone is being bulk-billed now, there is no reason for that to change, but cardholders have that guarantee. There are seven million Australians who are cardholders—they might have a pensioner concession card, a health care card or a Commonwealth seniors card—and they will be seen by participating GPs for free. There is no cost to the patient. Participating practices will receive a cash payment at the end of each month based on the numbers of concession card holders they see. It is a sliding scale: $1 in capital cities right up to $6.30 in rural and remote areas. It is estimated that it will be $3,500 for a GP in a capital city right up to $22,000 for GPs in rural and remote areas. Most practices will be better off. There is also a safety net for cardholders: after cardholders pay more than $500 in out-of-pocket, out-of-hospital costs, either per individual or per family, the Commonwealth will pay 80 per cent of any further out-of-pocket medical costs. That will apply to diagnostic services and also to specialists.
What happens to non-cardholders? If you accept that 67.8 per cent of services are bulk-billed, that means that 32.2 per cent of services are not. People who are currently not being bulk-billed have to either send off a form to Medicare or go to the Medicare office themselves. It is a lot of extra nuisance when they could pay directly at the doctor's surgery. Those who are currently paying an out-of-pocket expense no longer have to pay the full amount. Electronic claiming will be allowed through HIC online, which avoids red tape. They are able to lodge the claim through the Internet with no need to re-enter patient details. There is no paperwork, it will reduce the time it takes for doctors to be paid from eight days to two days and there are also online security arrangements to make sure that the information is secure.
Across Australia, the average out-of-pocket GP payment is $12.61. Whereas presently patients can pay $37.66 at the surgery—that is just an example—and then receive $25.05 back from Medicare, all that has to be done now is to pay the out-of-pocket payment—about $12.61—with no need to fill out a Medicare form, no need to mail anything to Medicare and no need to visit a Medicare office. The opposition's argument has been essentially, `If it is $40 it is much harder to raise the price than if it is $12.60.' I do not buy that. If you consider that 32.2 per cent of services are not bulk-billed right now and that bulk-billing is likely to be much more concentrated amongst segments of the population, such as cardholders, who are more likely to see their doctors regularly, then you can see that perhaps 40 per cent of the whole population are not presently being bulk-billed. In rural areas and outside the metropolitan areas it is probably as high as 50 per cent. For ideological reasons, the Labor Party are going to deny this 50 per cent access to a much more convenient way of paying what they already have to pay now. They will be denying up to half the population in regional areas the opportunity just to pay the out-of-pocket payment with nothing more to do and nothing more to pay.
If you look at the way Medicare was set up, essentially it is 1980s technology. There are a lot of forms and no trust of electronic funds transfer between the Health Insurance Commission and the doctor. It was set up to make the default bulk-billing. It was set up so that the most difficult thing to do is not to bulk-bill. But with the guarantee that cardholders will be bulk-billed it is time—and we now have the technology and so on to enable this—for the Health Insurance Commission to directly transfer funds. The Labor Party has always had this ideological problem with paying the doctor direct from the Health Insurance Commission, but it now makes a lot of sense. The private funds are doing it with dental, physio and so on. People now swipe their card and just pay the out-of-pocket expense. The reason they do it is that their customers want it. Sometimes in politics it is hard to find an area where it is win-win, but in this area you have a situation where it will increase—
—It is nine o'clock and I do not think it would be appropriate to cut off the debate at this point. I invite the member for Boothby to conclude his remarks. I am not reducing his time, necessarily, but I am indicating to him that I do not think he should be called to continue his speech at this time tomorrow for the sake of 90 seconds.
—Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. There are a number of other things: private health insurance for out-of-hospital MBS services, financial incentives for participating practices to sign on with HIC Online, streamed direct billing and rapid payment of rebate claims. Also on the access side, there will be 234 medical school places which are not there now. They will be bonded to areas of work force shortage. One hundred and fifty GP registrars will be working in areas of work force shortage, and 457 full-time equivalent nurses will be available for 800 practices in areas of work force shortage. They will be able to do things like manage chronic disease, immunisation and so on.
In speaking on the appropriation bill, my conclusion is that Labor have come to the wrong diagnosis. They are not talking about the health of the population and they are not talking about the problems that at least half the population face in dealing with Medicare forms, Medicare offices and so on. They are just looking at the bulk-billing rate, and they are doing it for ideological reasons. They cannot accept a situation where there is convenience to the patient in just being able to pay the out-of-pocket expense. We have heard this before from the Labor Party: we heard it on GST and we heard it on Iraq, more recently. On both occasions, the doomsday scenarios never came to fruition. What I would say in regard to the Fairer Medicare package is: let it through and let the people decide. I think they will find that, for those people who are currently paying an out-of-pocket expense, it is much more convenient to pay $12 than to pay $37 or $40 and then race off to a Medicare office and get the rest back. For the other people, there is now going to be for the first time an incentive to bulk-bill cardholders, which was never there before. (Time expired)

"McFarlane, Jann, MP",ALP,2003-05-27,"—I rise tonight to discuss something that has been spoken of in this place many times. However, what I am about to say bears repeating, as this government does not seem to have caught on. I am talking about Telstra—in particular, the huge variation in the quality of services that Telstra's various departments are delivering to their customers. Firstly, I would like to discuss the hardship Telstra has inflicted upon one of my constituents, Robert Atherley. Mr Atherley is a hardworking accountant who runs a firm with approximately 2,000 clients. Being the information age, this firm has had the good sense to conduct a lot of its communications via the Internet. Firms of this size require Internet connections that are fast enough to allow them to conduct their work in a reasonable time frame. As such, Mr Atherley sought to upgrade his ADSL connection via his Internet service provider. The ISP, accordingly, passed on the line request to Telstra. Mr Atherley was informed that this transfer would be almost seamless and that it was a regular request performed with no problems whatsoever.
The first part of this changeover occurred, as planned, the same day. The current ADSL connection Mr Atherley had was disconnected. He expected, as Telstra had told him, that the reconnection would be quick and problem free. As Mr Atherley was soon to find out, this was not to be the case. When he approached my office around lunchtime on Thursday, 1 May, he had been without an Internet connection for nearly three business days—three days of not being able to access Internet based research and information, three days of not being able to contact people who were on the move and otherwise uncontactable, and three days paying a large portion of his staff to twiddle their thumbs.
Upon calling Telstra to inquire about the delay, he was informed that the paperwork had gone missing and that the order would have to be resubmitted, much to his disappointment. However, Mr Atherley assures me that his Telstra phones were working perfectly, so his staff members were able to hear the many angry clients that called up and abused them, with crystal clarity. Amazingly, this situation was not resolved until the end of trade on Friday, 2 May. Mr Atherley, naturally, will be charged the normal fee for changing over to another ADSL service, and Telstra's poor response will go unchecked. How can Australian business and industry be expected to compete globally when broadband roll-out is being handled as poorly as this? I think it is also worth mentioning that Australia's broadband roll-out is falling behind in regional economies quite dramatically and that we are at risk of being disadvantaged commercially because of global communications trends and Telstra's slow development of infrastructure.
I would also like to take this opportunity to raise Telstra's long-term handling of the Hamersley communications towers in my electorate. These towers have been causing interference to home and data telephony for decades. I have been told anecdotally that for just as long Telstra executives have been too petrified to confront the issue. And here we are in 2003 with nothing done. It is only now that Telstra is trying to liaise with Hamersley residents in a serious way, through meeting with the Hamersley reference group, a group of local residents working for solutions to their telephone, Internet, and security system problems. As one member of the group pondered, `I wonder how long it would take Telstra to fix the phones if it were the administration in Canberra who were having problems?' This sums up a point that I think Telstra needs to take on board: it provides a service as much to individual Australians as to corporations and governments. It is, regardless of who owns it, a provider of infrastructure to our nation.
I would like to see Telstra continue to show some commitment to resolving the issue for Hamersley residents and businesses by bettering services in more general terms. These people have been, in some cases, unable to use their phones due to radio interference for a number of decades. Despite going through the appropriate fault channels at Telstra, no official procedure, plan or strategy has ever been developed for attacking this problem affecting residents living around the communications towers. Let us hope for the people and businesses of Hamersley and the surrounding area, and for Telstra users all over Australia, that this recent cooperation is a sign of things to come from the organisation.
I do appreciate that I never hear from those constituents who do not have any problems with Telstra and enjoy an adequate level of service. While there are a great many satisfied customers out there, people who have had a negative experience with Telstra are often forced to pay the exact same rate as those who are receiving good service. Personally, I live in a part of the Stirling electorate that enjoys an acceptable standard of service. However, my line rental is exactly the same as those in the Hamersley area. I would dearly hope that the people at Telstra appreciate the injustice in such a situation. These people are paying the same price for a much lesser service, and for decades Telstra has not been able to come up with a solution.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Telstra: Services</title>,Adjournment,15,1
