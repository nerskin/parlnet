"Dastyari, Sen Sam",ALP,2015-12-03,"



Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (11:08):  I ask that the question be divided in respect of each of the amendments and foreshadow that I have an alternative amendment to move in relation to amendment (3) and wish to vote differently in relation to amendments (1) and (2).



The CHAIRMAN:  The question before the chair is that the amendments that have been passed by the Senate not be insisted upon. Senators may recall there were three amendments passed by the Senate when it last dealt with this matter. Senator Dastyari has asked that the question be applied individually to each of those three amendments, on the basis that he wishes to replace one of those amendments with his own amendment. That is in order, so I will separate those amendments and deal with them separately. The first question is that the committee does not insist on amendment (1) with which the House has disagreed.




Senator DASTYARI:
  I think it is a shame that there has been a rush to get this legislation through. I believe that there is an hours motion in place which now means that we will not be leaving this chamber until this bill has been dealt with. I think that is a disappointing development for the Greens political party, who have made it pretty clear to us in the past that they do not support these types of gags. But in effect there is a gag being placed here. They realise that the opportunity for proper, detailed discussion, for us to have a proper analysis of the details of the dirty deal that has been done here, has been removed. In the next 24 hours or so we will have to vote on this, and the opportunity to go away and actually talk to people and analyse these amendments is lacking.


It is amazing. We had Senator McKim the other night go on this big rant, in relation to a different piece of legislation, about a lack of information and how quickly and how soon all this had been sprung on him. That was a piece of legislation with amendments that had gone through an entire committee process, that had gone through public canvassing, that had been part of the public debate for weeks, if not months—months of public debate. And yet here we find out that late last night there was a dirty deal being done by Senator Di Natale. It is amazing what one night in in the Treasurer's office can get you—one night with the Treasurer. I have heard of deals done cheap. I just was not sure that things were done that cheap.




Senator Kim Carr:
  Macfarlane's joined the National Party!




Senator DASTYARI:
  Ian Macfarlane has joined the National Party? Jeez.




Senator Kim Carr:
  You'll take anybody!




Senator DASTYARI:
  They will take anyone.




Senator Kim Carr:
  You'll have Richard Di Natale next!




Senator DASTYARI:
  Well, they vote together now, the Greens and the Nationals. 


What is so amazing is that we are dealing with amendments now that, yes, were supported just weeks ago by the Australian Labor Party, the Australian Greens and the majority of crossbench senators. And yet it appears that those same amendments that were good enough just two or three weeks ago are now being dealt with as going too far. There is this premise that we somehow do not need to stay firm and that any deal is better than no deal. Frankly, Senator Di Natale, there were better deals that could have been done. What is so disappointing here is not just the type of deal you have done but that you did it so cheaply and so stupidly. That you were prepared to sell out for so little is unbelievable.


Let us be clear. The government tried to foist these kinds of cheap, dirty deals on everyone in this chamber. They tried to do it with the crossbenchers. They tried to do it with the Labor Party. They went to each Independent individually and made these types of offers. Everyone else who actually had advocated in the past for these tax transparency measures, thought to themselves: 'Let's not sell out. Let's stay true to some principles. Let's believe in something. Let's demand a better deal.' But there was one conversation from Scott Morrison with the leader of the Greens, where he said, 'It's this or nothing,' and, like the doormat that the Greens have become under Senator Di Natale, they just rolled over. They roll over every time. They just fold. They have clearly been learning from the Nats. The Nats are growing—you just got a new member. They just roll over every time.


This is the worst negotiation tactic imaginable. If you want to negotiate with Senator Di Natale, all you have to do is go in there, make some kind of outrageous claim, and he will fold. He folds every time. What is so shocking here is that he has folded on a matter that was something that, frankly, I wrongly believed was a point of principle for the Greens political party. I thought it was something that they actually had passion about and had fought for. I have said in this chamber many, many times, and I have paid respect to the incredible work of former Senator Christine Milne in this place on the issue of tax transparency. To see those measures, those bills, those matters watered down, rolled back under Senator Di Natale is just appalling. 


Senator, I want to make it clear to you just exactly who it is that you are actually going to be protecting today. Senator Di Natale made it very clear earlier this morning—he was up-front and frank about it—that he would not be supporting the amendments in the names of Senator Muir and Senator Lambie regarding grandfathering, which is a difficult issue that took a long period of time to build the necessary level of political will. Let us not kid ourselves. One in six of the 1,498 companies we are talking about here, the list of which was published in full by the Guardian—is a political donor or government contractor. Senator Di Natale, one in six of them. 


Today there was going to be an amendment before the Senate—there are two that are very similar—in the name of either Senator Lambie or Senator Muir, to actually shut down that loophole. This morning you announced that you would be voting against any such amendment. Yesterday we confirmed that the numbers were there in the Senate to pass that amendment. Of course, the big lobbyists and the big donors are beside themselves with glee. The threat of the government having to disclose and actually closing that loophole has now been removed for them. Why? Because Senator Di Natale did a dirty deal—a desperate, dirty deal. Senator Di Natale, I am not aware of whether you actually understood the enormity of what you have sold out or whether you just do not understand this issue well enough. And I really do not know which of those two is worse.


On tax transparency and the issue of disclosure, the argument will be, 'It's a $200 million disclosure instead of a $100 million disclosure. It was an arbitrary figure to begin with.' True. The $100 million figure was meant to capture in the vicinity of the 1,000 largest private companies. That is where the figure came from. The idea was built around: how do you get a figure around the 1,000 largest companies? Almost 75 per cent of them have now been exempted because of the deal that you have done. Why? Because of some threat from the government that they would not pass their own legislation if you tried to improve it on the front of transparency. That is the deal you did. That is the con you fell for. The government's own legislation, their own MAAL bill—it was Joe Hockey's legacy item. It was a bill that everybody supported, and they went to you and said, 'We're not going to pass our own bill that everybody supports unless you fold on everything else.' And Senator Di Natale says, 'Then I'd better fold on everything now.' That is what a negotiation with you must be like. It must be fantastic. I would love to buy a property off you. 




Senator Lines:
  You'd get it dirt cheap!




Senator DASTYARI:
  That's right. You would get it cheap. I am not sure what you would have to do in the office—



Senator Edwards interjecting—




Senator DASTYARI:
  I am outraged, Senator Edwards. I am disgusted. I am appalled. Look, I am fairly new to this place, so maybe I have been naive the whole time because, frankly, I expected better from Senator Di Natale. I expected better from a Greens political party, the rhetoric of which on this issue has been so strong for so many years, who have always said the right thing, and when the opportunity comes for them to actually stay tough and force a better bill, he folds. And he folds under some lie or premise that there is some kind of threat that the bill will not pass and the government is going to dump its own legislation. Senator Di Natale, through the chair: if you believe that, you will believe anything. The idea that you are going to fold on every matter, every issue and every point of principle just because the government is prepared to do this—




Senator Conroy:
  He'd better take his bat and ball and go home. Seriously. You fell for it.




Senator DASTYARI:
  No, no—I think it is important to understand what would have happened if Senator Di Natale had stood firm on this. The government would have had one of two options. One is that they would have had to bring back their own bill today and they would have accepted what the Senate was going to do and adopted it. He believes they would have gone all the way to $200 million, but they could not possibly have gone to $100 million because those 500 companies need to be protected. Why do those 500 companies need to be protected, Senator Di Natale? Why would you fold on that? Why would you fold on those 500 companies needing to be protected? The other option is that the government would have had to bring back the bill early in the new year because the MAAL bill involved measures they needed to get through for their G20 commitments.


That was the leverage to get a better bill. You have sold out the leverage to get better legislation. That is the con you fell for. They would have had to bring it back early in the new year, at the latest. The fact that they needed that legislation to pass before the budget would have been the opportunity for those of us who believe in transparency, who believe in a better bill and who believe in more accountability to get the best legislation. But at the first chance you got, you went soft.




Senator Edwards:
  It needed to start on 1 January.




Senator DASTYARI:
  No, this legislation could comfortably—




Senator Edwards:
  Tax reform needs to start on 1 January. This is the last sitting day.




Senator DASTYARI:
  There would have been amendments and then it would have been early February legislation. But you are ramming it through at the first chance, the first opportunity, the first sit-down—




Senator Edwards:
  This is nonsense.



The CHAIRMAN:  Senator Edwards, you will have an opportunity if you want to contribute to the debate. We are in committee.




Senator DASTYARI:
  Mate, we are going to have all day to do this, Sean.




Senator Canavan:
  Proper title, please.




Senator DASTYARI:
  Sorry; Senator Edwards—who, may I say, is looking remarkably handsome now that he has shaved off his moustache. Senator Di Natale is doing this at the first opportunity, the first sit down and, I hate to say it, the first date—faults and everything. So we have a situation where the entire leverage of this movement and what this campaign had been building towards, with all the work that had been done over two full years now not only by the Labor Party—and the Labor Party played a very big role—but also people like Christine Milne, community groups, activities and movements everywhere has been sold out.


I am going to have a lot to say today about how some of these groups feel about it all. He has gone to all of them and said, 'I'm going to fold on the first opportunity I get. I'm going to fold because it is easier to fold.' Yes, Senator Di Natale, it is always easier to cop out. It is always easier to give up on principle. It is always easier to say, 'You know what? They are a bunch of really powerful companies and the government here is playing a big role in protecting them, and the easiest thing for me to do is just to have the debate go away.' It is disappointing, it is disgusting and it is horrible that someone who professes to actually be passionate about these issues, who professes to care about these issues, who professes that these issues are a priority for them and their political party would come into this chamber and sell out on this point of principle.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2015-12-03,"



Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (11:24):  There was one point in particular that Senator Whish-Wilson made earlier that I took some offence at that, and that was when he claimed that Labor were just upset because the Greens had done the deal before Labor. Let me just put some facts on the record. Last night we rejected the final begging, grovelling approaches from the big end of town's representatives on the other side of the chamber and we said, 'No, we will not compromise on this. You have to fold and you have to deliver this bill with full tax transparency.' When offered the same 30 pieces of silver, we rejected it. Those who have now signed this deal—the political geniuses sitting down there preparing their notes to speak—took the 30 pieces of silver.


So I want to absolutely put on the record that, when Senator Whish-Wilson said that Labor were just upset because the Greens did the deal before we did, he could not have misled this chamber more seriously and, importantly, besmirched those on this side, who have been campaigning for full tax transparency for a vast number of years along with many, many members of the Greens. And they will be horrified that the geniuses in charge of the Greens decided that they could do a filthy deal and exempt all of these companies that are donors to the Liberal Party. That is on their head and their head alone.


If you had a spine or some political courage, there was no need to roll over and give the government this bill. They needed this bill. It was important legislation. It is flawed and it does not go far enough, but the government needed this bill—and all they had to do was agree to reveal the level of tax that these companies were paying. Let us not forget that Malcolm Turnbull's own company was in there. But you have chosen to give the government a leave pass. The Australian public is being kept in the dark because of the Australian Greens' lack of spine on this. And you will pay a price—and you deserve to pay a price.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2015-12-03,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (11:27):  I was a union official for 27 years, and my day-to-day job was negotiation. Some of the negotiations that you entered into were negotiations that you did not think that you had a lot of chance of winning. But you had to work out a strategy, you had to sit down and look at what you can achieve and you had to push a little bit further than what you thought the employer was going to give you. When the employer eye-balled you and said, 'That's all we've got. If you don't accept what we are offering, you can go on strike or you can leave. You can do what you like, but we are not going to give you anymore,' that is when the tough choices had to be made. That is when you had to dig in. That is when working people dug in and said, 'We will call the bluff.' If workers and unions had behaved like the Greens have behaved in this set of negotiations, workers would still be earning very little, their penalty rates would be gone and their annual leave loading would be gone.


From time to time you actually have to show some courage and be tough in negotiations—the exact opposite to what the Greens have done in relation to these negotiations on tax avoidance and tax transparency in this country. They have just given in. They were weak in their strategic approach to the negotiations. They were incapable of understanding that what we should have achieved here was much more transparency and a much better outcome for the public purse and the national interest. The Greens did not show any courage. They did not show any negotiating skills. They did not show any capacity to actually understand the importance of this issue to the public purse. It is tragic that they would keel over so quickly to the Liberal Party and the National Party on this issue.


When you see Senator Heffernan up defending the Greens you know there is a problem. You know something has gone wrong. What has gone wrong is that Senator Di Natale did not have the capacity, did not have the courage and did not have the commitment to actually deal with this issue effectively, and I am not sure whether he had the backing of his party to do so. By simply giving in at the first sign of a bullet flying past you, by simply conceding at the first sign of the coalition eyeballing you and staring you down, demonstrates a major weakness in the Greens and a major weakness in their strategy and a major weakness in their leader's capacity to understand what is important for the Australian public.


You see, this issue now means that the political donors—the multimillionaires that are running companies around this country—who donate to the National Party and the Liberal Party, who fund their election campaigns, will now not pay their fair share of tax. They will continue to hide exactly how much tax they pay, yet ordinary workers in this country and families in this country are being told by those opposite that everything is on the table in terms of tax, including a GST. We know that a GST would leave families thousands of dollars worse off. They are maintaining a GST on the table to take more tax from ordinary working families who are battling to keep their heads above water now, battling to ensure that they can put school shoes on their kids' feet, battling to buy books for their kids to go to school and probably have not had a holiday for some years. They are the ones who are being targeted by this mob over here, while their mates who donate to them, who donate millions of dollars to the Liberal Party election coffers, are being let off scot-free. That is the problem here: if you donate to the Liberal Party and if you are a mate of the Liberal Party, then they will cover for you in terms of how much tax you pay.


The perfect example of that is 7-Eleven. The head of 7-Eleven presided over a company that ripped off migrant workers, that ripped off 457 workers and that ripped off every franchisee it could. Do they have to indicate how much tax they have paid? No, they do not, and why don't they? Because the Greens capitulated. Because the Greens did not have the courage, the capacity or the will to take on the coalition for transparency.


If you go back to the former Greens leader, the Greens were not a party that was determined to be in the mainstream. What is the mainstream for the Greens? Obviously, the mainstream for the Greens is to sit side-by-side with the coalition and their big business backers to hide what is happening in relation to tax in this country. If that is the mainstream, it is not the mainstream where the Labor Party wants to be. We do not want to be there. We want to be in the spot that makes sure that everybody pays their fair share of tax, especially the multimillionaires and especially those companies that are ripping off workers and want to get rid of their penalty rates while not paying an appropriate amount of tax in this country. 


What did Christine Milne say back a few years ago? She said, 'Corporate tax avoidance in Australia is endemic.' Will this bill deal with the endemic tax avoidance? Of course it won't. The Greens have sold out their former leader in terms of the vision and the values that Christine Milne had. She said, 'Billions are being lost to Australians via so-called aggressive tax planning'. Will this bill resolve the aggressive tax planning for those that are ripping off the tax system in this country? Of course it won't. So Senator Di Natale and the Greens again have sold out on a value and a principle that former Greens leader Christine Milne aspired to achieve. Former Greens leader Senator Milne said:


Big corporates are exploiting loopholes in our tax laws and the global nature of their business to avoid tax. That means that it is Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey's job to act now.


Does this bill resolve that position? No, it does not, because it still leaves corporations in this country ripping off the taxpayer. She went onto say:


Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey are going to extreme lengths to defend the indefensible and protect the profits of the big end of town.


This was a press release from Senator Milne. I hope she puts a press release out today and says that Senator Di Natale and the Greens are going to extreme lengths to defend the indefensible and protect the profits of the big end of town, because that is exactly what is happening here. Everything that Senator Milne stood for is being trashed by this Greens party room today—absolutely trashed. What does this do about defending the indefensible? A Greens leader standing here defending what they are doing now is indefensible. Senator Milne's press release goes on to say that:


As well as increased transparency and reporting of subsidiaries, strengthening the tax act on profit shifting and properly resourcing the tax office, some further immediate steps we can take have been identified during the inquiry.


So Senator Milne kicked off the inquiry, Senator Dastyari took on that inquiry and took it to levels I do not think many other people would have taken it to in terms of exposing the rorts that were going on and exposing the unfairness of the tax system in this country. Senator Dastyari has done that and, after all that work, what do we have? We have the Greens doing a deal in return for what? In return for nothing. Did they get any deal on tax profit sharing and tax profit shifting, as their former leader wanted? No, they did not. Did they get more resources for the tax office as a result of negotiations on this bill? No, they did not. They sold out completely and utterly. Why did they sell out? Because they want to be so-called 'relevant'. They want to be in the mainstream .


My lesson for the Greens is that you do not become relevant and you do not judge the mainstream as supporting tax avoidance in this country and, if you continue to support tax avoidance in this country, what you will get is more pressure on ordinary families to give up more of their support systems from government. The coalition will continue to try to cut pensions. The coalition will continue to try to cut support from seniors. The coalition will continue to cut health in this country, to cut education funding in this country and will force the states to argue for a GST that will hit everybody and will hit the poorest hardest. That is the strategy that the coalition have set out to achieve. 


I never thought for a minute that the Greens would be the ones who would not have any idea about that strategy or would capitulate to that strategy so quickly, capitulate in a way that leaves ordinary people in this country open to further attacks on their standard of living while the big end of town walks away untouched. That is what has happened with the Greens and, if that is the mainstream, the Greens should not be in the mainstream on these issues because the mainstream, according to your mates across on the bench with whom you are voting today, is about protecting the tax avoiders, protecting those who have wealth, power and privilege, making sure that inequality in this country increases because the big end of town, those who are rich, will not be paying the proper tax and ordinary battlers out there who go to work every day, battling hard to make a quid, battling hard to get food on the table for their family, they pay their mortgage or they pay their rent, they are going to have to pay more because this bill allows the tax rorters, the tax scammers and the tax avoiders to get away with it. That is what the coalition have done—backed in the avoiders, the scammers and the rorters. That is what has happened here. 


There are people who are on standard of living that ordinary Australians could never dream of because they are not paying their fair share of tax. They are getting richer by the year as the poorer in this country battle every day to put food on the family table. That is what the Greens have done. How obnoxious is it that the Greens could have descended so low in a debate of such importance. They have descended to a position of simply backing in the rorters, the tax avoiders and the people who do not want to make a contribution to health, to education. That is what has happened with the Greens here. What former Senator Christine Milne said was that she wanted:


… the Abbott government to immediately make public the ATO's settlement register so that everyone knows to what extent we are missing out on revenue from the big end of town.


Does this meet the test that the former Leader of the Greens set? No, it absolutely does not. The Greens are an absolute disgrace on this issue. They have sold out the working class in this country. They have capitulated to the Liberals. They are simply supporting tax avoidance and tax rorting. They should be absolutely ashamed of themselves. (Time expired)

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:43):  I am going to be a bit boring and ask a number of questions about the technical aspects of these amendments because insofar as we are dealing with the first set of amendments and it was entirely appropriate that—




Senator Canavan:
  Relevant, I think you mean.




Senator XENOPHON:
  Don't taunt me, Senator Canavan. I just want to get on with it. We will never know whether we could have got a better deal. My preference was to have got a better deal, but I am not going to engage in who is to blame—I do not think that is helpful. I want to understand this. In the context of general purpose accounting, which is a real issue of concern, this is about companies with turnover of a billion dollars or more—the Googles, the Apples, the Microsofts—which for many years have been getting away with special purpose accounting where they give very little information about transfer pricing and about a whole range of measures, where they simply get away with blue murder by saying as little as possible about their finances. I moved the amendment; it was supported by the Australian Labor Party, the Australian Greens and a number of my crossbench colleagues. That passed and this is one of the amendments that is in contention.


From the brief discussion I have had this morning with government advisers in relation to this, the Australian Greens, through Senator Di Natale, will be moving an amendment relating to general purpose accounting, but it will be different in some respects. It will be different in respect of the reporting requirement. Instead of going to the ATO, it will go to ASIC. I do not have a problem with that but I do have a series of questions to ask about it.




Senator Cameron:
  ASIC have no money.




Senator XENOPHON:
  Senator Cameron says that ASIC have no money—well, they have money, but whether they can do the enforcement that they are meant to is another issue. So I would be grateful if the minister could advise: in what material respects is the amendment being proposed by Senator Di Natale any different to the amendment that the Senate agreed upon in terms of general-purpose accounting? That is the first question. I understand that the first difference may be in terms of reporting to ASIC or to the ATO. The other concern is: will this do what is intended in the amended form by the government? Will those companies that have been grandfathered out of the system, that have been exempted, be exempt from these provisions in respect of what the government is proposing?


That is for starters. I know I am being boring, but I want to deal with the substantive measures here. I want to see what we are getting as an alternative in respect of this and whether it will deal with that key issue. At the risk of damaging his journalistic career, I call this the Michael West amendment, because Fairfax business journalist Michael West has been writing about this articulately for some considerable time and it was his investigative work that influenced me to put this amendment up in the first place.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2015-12-03,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (11:47):  I want to draw the Senate's attention to the fact that moving responsibility from the ATO to ASIC is fraught with danger. The key regulator, ASIC, themselves warn that their ability to have an impact and to do their job properly and supervise markets and companies was substantially reduced by the $120 million cut in the first coalition budget, which brought so much devastation to families around this country. We all remember that first budget. We remember the former Treasurer and Senator Cormann sitting out there with their Havanas, puffing away with great satisfaction after they had ripped into pensioners, ripped into welfare recipients and forced more costs onto workers every time they went to see the doctor. They were very satisfied with that. But what the public did not understand was that some of the regulation that put checks and balances into the corporate system was also ripped away in that first budget, to the extent that the ASIC chairman, Greg Medcraft, had said that their capacity to fulfil their role would be substantially reduced.


I recently participated in the insolvency inquiry into the building and construction industry, and what ASIC were clearly demonstrating there was that they have limited capacity to handle corporate malfeasance because they do not have the money. They just do not have the resources. So to put a proposition here that takes responsibility away from the ATO, which has had its funding cut as well, and gives it to ASIC and to present that as an acceptable proposition—to put that responsibility to an organisation that does not have the money and the resources to fulfil its existing obligations and responsibilities—shows just what this bill is about. It is about making sure that there is no capacity for the regulators to actually track down the tax rorters and the tax avoiders.


How the Greens could possibly agree to that amendment beggars belief. Surely someone in the Greens understands that both the tax office and ASIC are being starved of funding as part of the austerity approach to 'balance the budget' from the coalition. It was one of these 'budget emergencies'. We do not hear about budget emergencies anymore, even though our position is deteriorating under the coalition. We do not hear about that anymore, but we still see the cuts going into the corporate regulators who are there to try and ensure that business pays its fair share of tax. This proposition that you take it away from the ATO and put it into ASIC and ASIC will be able to handle it is just not true, and it should not be agreed to. Mr Medcraft is saying they want to push the case for user-funded models, because they are desperate to get cash so that they can do their job.


In that committee I was in it was clear that people could 'phoenix' companies in the building and construction industry and generally across the economy. That means they could deliberately kill a company and leave it with all its debts and set up another company that would be a new company—it would be what is described as a phoenix company. The evidence we had was that they could do that with impunity because ASIC did not have the resources or the funding to deal properly with phoenixing in any industry in this country. But now we are being told that, as part of this bill, we will take more responsibility from the ATO and put it into ASIC, and ASIC will be able to handle it. Well, ASIC will not be able to handle it. 


The outcome of that will be exactly what the coalition want—that is, to ensure that there are no checks and balances on their mates that provide the funding for their election resources. That is what it is about. They just do not want their mates in the big end of town to pay their fair share of tax. Everyone else in the country can pay a higher GST—15 per cent GST. We know the secret plans there. That was reported yesterday. It is there—15 per cent GST on everything; on health, on education, on fresh food. That is where it is at. 


Yet, what we have from the other side now are all these manoeuvres to try to make sure that if there is any capacity for this bill to deal with tax evasion properly, it will be diminished because ASIC are the organisation that have to deal with it and ASIC will not have the resources. This is another demonstration that Senator Di Natale was comprehensively outmanoeuvred, comprehensively done over, comprehensively pushed aside by whoever negotiated on behalf of the coalition—a great victory for the coalition, a great defeat for the Australian public. The Australian public are the ones who are going to have to pay the price for this. To actually contemplate asking ASIC to do more oversight and overview work with reduced resources is just not an acceptable proposition.


We even had Nationals Senator John Williams calling for a user-pays system to be introduced for financial advisers so that ASIC could better police the industry. I have a lot of differences with Senator Williams, and certainly the National Party, but there is one thing you can say about Senator Williams: he is on to this issue; he is on to the issue about corporate rorting. He is a lone voice in the coalition on this. He has understood the need for extra resources. Why couldn't the Greens understand that? Why couldn't the Greens understand that by moving any responsibility out of the tax office in to ASIC, we end up moving the responsibility to an organisation that does not have the resources or the capacity to deal with this effectively?


It is bad enough being totally outmanoeuvred in your negotiating position, as the Greens have been, it is bad enough just capitulating, as the Greens have, and it is bad enough making workers in this country pay more because you are not prepared to make sure that the big end of town pays their fair share, but to come here and argue on technical points that ASIC can do the job is just a complete misunderstanding of how things work and what has happened under this Abbott Turnbull government. 


They look after the big end of town. They look after your mates. They do not care about those who are battling to look after their families, who are struggling to keep their heads above water, who know how difficult it is to buy the school uniforms and get the kids off to school, who know how expensive it is to go on public transport that could cost an extra 15 per cent in terms of GST. They do not care. I never thought I would see the day when the Greens would not care either. By passing this amendment, or supporting this bill, it shows that they really do not care, or they either do not care or do not understand the key issues affecting the Australian public in trying to simply get a fair go on taxation.


Capitulating to the negotiating strategy of the coalition is not about being on the side of the angels, as the Greens would have had us have it this morning. It is not about being on the side of the angels; it is about capitulating. It is about an absolutely amateurish approach to negotiation. It is about not having the courage to stand up for your convictions. It is about not having the values that your previous leader had in relation to making sure that everybody pays their fair share. What a capitulation from the Greens. What a disgrace. For a party who say they are progressive, for a party who say that they stand up for the battler, it is an absolute nonsense.


This is an area where this Senate had an opportunity to make sure that the rorters, the tax avoiders and the big businesses that are ripping off their workers paid their fair share of tax. This bill makes sure that that will not happen because there will be secrecy in place—we will not know what is in there. Joe Stiglitz, the Nobel winning economist, spoke about information asymmetry. That means you need to get all the information that you can for a properly operating market. Well, the market will not operate properly when you have certain companies that are not paying tax and nobody knows what is happening. There can be no public pressure on these companies because it is all kept quiet and secret. 


Why is it kept quiet and secret? It is kept quiet and secret because these are the people who fund the coalition's election campaigns. They are the ones who are out arguing to rip off workers, get rid of their penalty rates, rip off 457 workers, rip off migrant workers. The big end of town are the people who are being protected under this bill. They will not even be required to disclose how much tax they are paying. ASIC will not be able to enforce it because they do not have the resources. This is an absolute joke. This is an area where the Greens have been absolutely outmanoeuvred, treated like absolute mugs, and they have not done what their previous leader said they should do—that is, deal with a comprehensive problem, an endemic problem, that meant that ordinary working people paid more tax. We heard that we were starting a journey. You do not start a long journey without a suitcase or without anything in it. Let me tell you: this long journey that the Greens think that they are starting on—the suitcase is empty, because they get no extra resources for ASIC. They get no extra resources for the ATO. They get no protection for the ordinary families of this country. It is an absolute debacle what has happened here. 


I cannot understand the Greens for a minute who argue that they are the protectors of working people in this country. What an absolute joke! How can you protect ordinary working families when you simply give in to the big end of town—when you do not have the backbone, when you do not have the intellect and when you do not have the strength and courage of your convictions to stand up to the Havana-smoking frontbenchers over there who want to rip working people off? How can you have any credibility in this debate at all? 


This is a party that has completely lost its way. What for? They want to be relevant—you are not relevant to the Australian public, if you allow the rip-offs to go on. You are not relevant to the Australian public, if you do not stand up for them. You are simply trying to achieve relevance, and relevance at any cost. Relevance of numbers and year do not automatically mean relevance for the Australian public. I think the relevance that is important is to stand up against the rip-off merchants, the big end of town and the rorters that are out there.


Senator Milne had it right: the former leader of the Greens identified the problems and the issues that had to be dealt with. Senator Dastyari took that work on, and we have got a way forward. But the Greens capitulated. They let the Havana-smoking frontbenchers over there—the supporters of the big end of town—take them to the cleaners with absolutely no capacity to negotiate, no courage to eyeball the coalition and no attempt to support ordinary working people. It is a disgrace. (Time expired)

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:02):  Whilst we are dealing with the first lot of amendments—appropriately moved by Senator Dastyari so that it will be split—it is relevant to understand, before we vote on this, the context of the amendments that are being proposed as a result of the agreement between the Australian Greens and the coalition in relation to this. Senator Di Natale has an amendment that he will be moving that seeks to supplant the amendment that was accepted and voted on by the Senate—3D, reporting of information about significant global entities. My question to the Minister for Finance is: to what extent is what has been agreed between the government and the Australian Greens in terms of the significant global entities reporting requirements—this relates to general purpose accounts? It is very important to find out, as Senator Cameron alluded to, how the Googles, the Apples and these large multinational corporations and pharmaceutical companies, Big Pharma—and I acknowledge the work that Senator Dastyari has done on this and indeed former Senator Milne. 


I am just trying to understand for the purposes of this debate: what are the differences between the two? When you have international tax experts who do not work for the big end of town asking questions, will it be based on consolidated revenue—I am asking specific questions, for instance, whether it applies to consolidated revenues? Does it have to be a general purpose financial statement Tier 1 as set out in accounting standard AASB 1053, the same as for companies listed on the ASX—these are technical questions but they are important as to how this will work. I just want to make sure that it does what it is intended to, so I ask these questions genuinely of the finance minister. I just want to get to the core of the substance of what we are dealing with here.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:04):  I wish to put a number of questions to the finance minister. I do not have an issue, if the Minister for Finance gets back to the committee stages not immediately but within a few minutes or half an hour so we can just understand this, because they are technical in nature. 


I am very pleased that the finance minister has said on the record that they are better drafted—although I think that the Senate drafting office does a pretty damn good job, given their resources and the pressures they are put under. He says that this will give effect to what is intended. What was intended in the course of the debate on and the committee stages of this bill was to ensure that general purpose accounting requirements apply. So I am very pleased and I thank the finance minister for saying that.


My specific questions are: firstly, is the test for the application based on consolidated revenues as defined by accounting standards—that is, the same as in a large proprietary company test in the Corporations Act? For ease of reference to the advisers, I will provide a copy of these questions—that might be useful.


The second question I want to put on record is: does it apply to the Australian group defined as the ultimate Australian holding company and all of the entities it controls? Thirdly, does it relate to general purpose financial statements Tier 1 as set out in accounting standard AASB 1053—that is, the same as for companies listed on the ASX? Fourthly, is the same timely financial information being lodged with the ATO no later than four months after year end—the same deadline as in the Corporations Act? Fifthly, does it have to be audited and the lead audit partner has to rotate every five years—the same requirements applying for the Corporations Act?


I genuinely thank the finance minister for saying that this is about a better drafting for the intent of what the Senate wanted to do in terms of general-purpose accounts. I am grateful for that. I will go and see the advisers and give them a copy of these specific questions.

Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (12:07):  I guess my journey on tax advocacy really started in around 2006. I am just really disgusted that we are here today responding to a dirty deal done by the Greens in the middle of the night. It just shows how little they understand what they are actually doing. But I want to talk for a moment about my journey. It shows again the inexperience of the Greens. I come out of a trade union, and I have spent the majority of my working life working with low-paid workers.


In 2006 we thought we, along with members, had done a really good deal at a public hospital. We had got workers a four per cent wage increase. But, when we put it to the general membership, they rejected it overwhelmingly. We were really shocked because we did think this was a good deal. We had done it with members. The issue that they raised with us was that the cost of living for them had gotten to the stage where they needed a much bigger increase than the four per cent that was on offer by the state government. Their rent had gone up. Their utilities costs had gone up. Food costs had gone up. And four per cent really was not going to cut it.


So we sat down with union delegates and low-paid hospital workers—orderlies, cleaners, personal care workers, enrolled nurses, technicians and so on—and we worked out that there was no way we could ask the state government for the sort of money, the sort of wage increase, that those low-paid hospital workers needed to cover their costs. So we started to look at what the tax system offered us. What did it offer for low-paid workers? Obviously, to try to lobby the state government and agitate for the state government to give workers the sort of increase in wages they needed was not possible without additional revenue. That was really when my tax journey started. It was absolutely motivated by low-income workers in Western Australia saying to me, as their elected representative, 'A four per cent wage increase just doesn't cut it.'


It just shows how out of touch the Greens are that they do not appreciate, that they do not understand, because none of them have ever really been in front of low-paid workers, that the deal that they have done here today to lock away the transparency of private companies absolutely hurts low-income workers because it stops the government getting increased revenue. I have heard the Greens go on about how we have a revenue problem in this country. It just shows that their words speak a lot louder than their actions. Someone who really believes that we have a revenue problem in this country would not have done the dirty deal that they have done in the middle of the night. It hurts low-paid workers, like hospital workers in Western Australia, because the government continues to get a shrinking revenue. Let us see how they explain that.


But of course low-income workers do not support the Greens. Low-income workers do not look to the Greens for their salvation. Labor stand for low-income workers, and we stand for tax transparency.


It is amazing. I am not quite sure how the Greens who have sat on the Senate committee that has looked at the kinds of rorts of 7-Eleven—a company on the secret list, a company the Greens have just given an exemption to—think. How do they justify the stories we have heard from 7-Eleven workers who have been ripped off? Yet today they have sat with the government and said, 'It's okay for 7-Eleven to rip workers off, and we're going to continue to allow them to sit on a secret list so that ordinary Australians don't really get to see the sorts of profits that 7-Eleven have made.' I can tell you that 7-Eleven have given us the run-around on that Senate inquiry. We keep calling them back, and we keep calling them back, and we ask them more questions, and they can hide. They can hide, and the Greens on that committee are going to allow 7-Eleven to continue to hide.


I wonder what the Greens will say to the low-paid cleaners in this place, who need the government to increase its revenue so they can get a decent wage. They are on strike this week. Those cleaners are on strike this week. Maybe the Greens have not noticed. They certainly do not care, because if they cared they would not have done the dirty deal they have done this week. It shows how out of touch they are with low-paid workers, particularly cleaners cleaning their offices. What are they going to say to them? They say: 'Look, we've done a dirty deal. We're going to allow these companies—companies that ripped off workers—to continue to be on a secret list. We're going to allow these companies to avoid paying tax. That's what we're going to do as the Greens party.' What a disgrace.


Last night we had an event here at Parliament House which a couple of the Greens came to. When you came to meet with those sacked MV Portland workers last night, you did not have the decency to tell them you had done a dirty deal with the government. You proudly stood there and said, 'We're with workers.' Well, I tell you what: I have already told the MV Portland workers that came here last night that the Greens do not stand with them. How could they front that function last night and say to those MV Portland workers, 'We're with you'? Clearly, the Greens are not with them, because no-one who stands with sacked MV Portland workers would have done that deal that the Greens did in the middle of the night. Had they already done the deal when they were standing in front of the MV Portland workers? Who knows? But you do not stand there and say one thing, 'We're with you,' and then turn around and do this dirty deal with the government on the other hand. You do not do that. It is hypocrisy.


And we have heard them today—what wusses. I am glad none of them were union officials, because boy they have sold out really easily. You have to be tough in negotiations. You have to stand up to the government, and this is a just cause. The Australian tax network must be throwing its hands up saying, 'We've done all this work for a couple of years and the Greens, in the middle of the night, on the second last day of sitting for this year, struck a deal with the government.'


My union, United Voice, have advocated so hard for tax reform, because tax reform is a salvation for low-income workers. I do not know what they will be saying about the dirty deal the Greens have done this morning. Again, it just demonstrates that they have no understanding of what it is like to walk a day in the shoes of a low-paid cleaner, a low-paid hospital worker, a low-paid early childhood educator or a low-paid hospitality worker. They have no idea, because they so quickly sold them out.


They are allowing these companies to continue behind this veil of secrecy. This morning we heard Senator Dastyari say in this place that one in six of those companies on that secret list are either political donors or government contractors, and of course we know who they donate to: they donate to the Liberal Party and the National Party. That is the deal the Greens have done. Let them hold their heads up and stand like they did last night with the MV Portland workers and say that the Greens were proud to do a deal that continues to let one in six on that list donate to the Liberal Party and the National Party in order to get government contracts but to hide their tax obligations. That is the deal the Greens have done in the middle of the night.


As Senator Dastyari also told us this morning, the $100 million figure was not just plucked out of the air, and the Greens know that. It was there because it captures 1,000 of Australia's largest private companies. We all understand that the Turnbull government always wants to protect its mates at the big end of town, and we also know that Mr Turnbull and his wife have a company that was on the secret list. A couple of weeks ago in this place, when that list was first published, I stood up and informed the Senate of that—and guess what those opposite did? They tried to call a point of order on me. They did not want me, through the Senate, to tell the Australian public that Mr Turnbull and his wife were on that list. During my 10-minute speech, I think they got up at least twice to pull that point of order on me: 'We can't have a Labor senator from Western Australia saying that Mr Turnbull and his wife, Lucy, are on that list!' The Greens know that, and that is who are they are protecting. Who would have thought the Greens would line up behind the Prime Minister of this country and run a protection racket? That is what they have done today, and I am angry about it, because I stand for low-paid Australians.


I stand for paying my tax, and I have never, ever complained about paying my tax. It is my obligation as a citizen in this country to pay my tax, not to set up some shonky scheme to avoid it. I do not hold any shares, and you can look at my senators' interests. I have no interest in hiding my tax. I do not have private companies. I want to pay my tax, and I can tell you that members I work with at United Voice also want to pay their tax. Why is it that we pay our taxes but the Turnbull government and the Greens want to allow the Prime Minister and companies like 7-Eleven to be on this secret list to avoid that transparency? Why have the Greens done that? It is because they do not represent ordinary working Australians; that is why the Greens have done that. And how dare they stand with those MV Portland workers last night and somehow pretend they are with them? They are not with people when they do that—they are absolutely not.


This legislation is flawed because it does not go far enough, and for Labor it was worth hanging out for a better deal. Just two weeks ago the Greens were with us, but we heard Senator Di Natale stand in this place and say this bit of legislation was 'better than nothing'. It is not. We should have stared the government down, but again the Greens are trying to find some relevancy, just like the deal they did a couple of months back that affected part pensions in this country. And now most organisations believe the Greens sold out middle Australia with that deal, which they did. They are just not experienced at this stuff. It is not where they come from. Their hearts are not with ordinary working Australians. Their hearts are now with the Turnbull government, who just wants to continue to protect these big companies, and this is not good enough.


We know where the Liberals stand on tax transparency. They have always voted against Labor's move. They are predictable. We know they want to protect their mates at the big end of town. They voted against the moves that Labor put up when we were in government time and time again. It is what we expect from them. Their constituency is very clear. They do not support ordinary working Australians. They have been completely silent on what is happening to those Australian seafarers on the MV Portland. They apparently have little understanding of or compassion for cleaners on strike in this building this week. They took money out of the pockets of early childhood educators. They took money out of the pockets of aged-care workers, and now the Greens have joined them. That is now what the Greens stand for. Well, let's see where the Greens stand on the GST. We know where Labor stands. We oppose a big fat new tax. We oppose an increase in the GST to 15 per cent. We oppose it. We believe it, and it is who we are.


It is not who the Greens are. Maybe the next thing they will be trotting up to support the government on is a big, fat new increase in the GST to 15 per cent and putting it on everything. They do not represent low-paid workers; Labor does. That is who our constituency is. We know the damage a GST would do to low-income earners. But let's see where the Greens go next on the GST—striving for relevance, clinging to the tails of the Turnbull government. What a place to find yourself in at the end of the year. What a place to be. I am proud to be Labor. I am proud to stand for tax transparency. (Time expired)

Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales) (12:22):  We have been told quite a bit in the last week about the government's desire to have a mature, grown-up conversation about taxation. To that end the government has been keen to assure us that they have not ruled out GST. In fact, not a single member of the government has been willing to rule out the introduction of an increased GST in either its level or the breadth of its application.


But I will stay to government senators that it is a pretty funny way to start a mature conversation.




Senator Cormann:
  Mr Chairman, I rise on a point of order. I appreciate that this is a wide-ranging debate, but there is a question before the chair and the question before the chair does not relate in any way, shape or form to the GST or other matters that the senator has started to touch on. The issue that we are dealing with is a government bill to combat multinational tax avoidance and how the Senate proposes to deal with a position adopted in the House of Representatives. I ask you to draw the senator back to the question before the chair.




Senator McALLISTER:
  On the point of order: I am simply seeking to place the matters before this chamber in the context of the broader debate on taxation.



The CHAIRMAN:  While the minister is right—there is a question before the chair—Senator McAllister has only been speaking for less than a minute. We will see whether her comments become relevant in due course.




Senator McALLISTER:
  I simply wanted to observe that it is a funny way to have a conversation about taxation when all of the things that do seem on the table relate to penalties for low-income people in the tax-and-transfer system. Very few of the things that are on the table go to the question of corporate taxation and of the big end of town paying its fair share. That is, of course, the debate that we are having here this morning.


The Tax Laws Amendment (Combating Multinational Tax Avoidance) Bill 2015 was an opportunity for the government to demonstrate that they would be even-handed in this mature conversation that we are embarking upon about taxation. Sadly, that is not what has been presented to us this morning and is not what has been presented to us over recent months. This bill in general has been supported by Labor, but our sense is that it is utterly inadequate in addressing the very real challenges of corporate tax avoidance that are presented to us. The bill, of course, takes a completely untested approach to closing some of the loopholes present in our corporate tax system. There are no precedents for the approach around the world.


The extraordinary thing—and I remember looking at this on budget evening—is that in the budget papers the measures provided for in this bill could not be quantified. Instead of a number, the usual thing that one expects to see in budget papers, there was a series of asterisks which substituted for an actual quantified assessment of the impact of this bill on levels of revenue for the government. I think that tells you quite a lot about the seriousness with which the government has approached this task. I draw people's attention to the way that we might have been treated if we had put forward a set of propositions around corporate tax reform but just put a series of asterisks in place. That would have been laughed out of town. That would have been a case for serious mockery. But this government has had the effrontery to present their arguments with absolutely zero information about what the likely impacts of the bill will be in addressing serious problems.


The specific questions that the chamber is debating this morning go to transparency. It has been the subject of quite some examination in both the Senate Economics References Committee and here in the chamber over the last two years, as previous speakers have pointed out. Of course, when last in government, the senators on this side of the chamber and Labor ministers took this issue seriously. We passed legislation in government that required the Australian Taxation Office to publish information about the income and tax paid by companies earning more than $100 million. Ever since we put that legislation through, this has been the source of real anxiety for the government but, more particularly, real anxiety for the very wealthy individuals who fear that their own tax affairs may be the subject of additional scrutiny and, quite frankly, should they be scrutinised, might not really stand up to that scrutiny.


The truth is that there are quite a number of companies in this country that are in legally grey areas. The ATO has said that privately owned corporate groups, often controlled by a wealthy individual or a family, pose significant tax compliance risks. These are the very companies that our legislation sough to target and these are the very companies that the government today, with the agreement of the Australian Greens, is seeking to exempt from scrutiny.


The thing about these companies is that in many instances their arrangements may well be legal. It may be that they are in strict compliance with the tax laws in a black-letter sense. But if we do want to have a mature and serious debate about taxation then we need to understand that, in certain instances, people may well be in compliance with the law but nonetheless the practices that the law enables may not be fair. They may not see very large, very wealthy organisations paying a level of tax that ordinary Australians struggling to get by would consider reasonable. They may also see particular individuals using a large number of companies interlinked in complex ways to avoid paying the income tax that they also would be reasonably expected by the rest of the public to pay.


Throughout this debate there have been people on the other side of the chamber who have said that the publication of this information, putting this information into the public domain, could cause misunderstanding, and that perhaps the Australian public are not smart enough or mature enough to understand the information that would be put before them when this information is published. My assessment is that the opposite is true. People are not really afraid that the Australian public will not understand the information that is put before them. People are afraid that the Australian public will understand the information that is put before them. They will understand that the situation where one in five private companies is paying zero tax is unfair and unreasonable and sees a small group of people shirking their obligation to contribute to the services that are valued by all Australians, because that is the truth of it. When we are talking about tax, we are also talking about government services.


As my colleague Senator Lines pointed out, the social wage in this country is absolutely essential to the support of so many very low-paid workers who struggle day to day to get by buying food, buying clothing and supporting their children through education. Those families are dependent on a health system that works. In their retirement they will be dependent on an age pension, and they will be dependent from time to time, if they fall into unemployment or underemployment, on some level of government support to keep their family on their feet until such time as they can, once again, provide for themselves. Each of these measures that a civilised government provides are absolutely dependent on adequate levels of taxation. It is, to that end, most important that we are able to have a serious debate about tax in this country. But you cannot have the debate if you do not have the information.


There has also been a series of spurious arguments made about some of the personal security risks presented by the publication of tax information. We saw the embarrassing circumstance where government agencies contradicted these arguments, pointing out that the AFP had never provided any concrete examples of threats to individuals arising from their financial information being in the public domain. We also saw arguments that the disclosure of this information would harm Australian owned private companies in their market environment. Of course, what we do understand is that, in any market, competition is absolutely dependent on fair information and an even playing field. We ought to be looking to even up the playing field between publicly listed companies, whose financial reporting gives a clearer picture of the risks related to the companies, and the private companies. This lack of reporting about their tax affairs may well conceal some risks associated with those companies. We have heard about compliance costs. This cannot be a serious reason for opposing tax transparency. Compliance, of course, must also always be proportional. We must always be balanced. But if there is some public good, it is not unreasonable to ask compliance costs to be borne by these businesses.


What is astonishing then is to come into this chamber this morning and hear news that the hard-fought efforts of, the hard-fought gains won by, many in this chamber to improve levels of tax transparency—against the wishes of the government—have been undermined overnight by a deal by the Australian Greens in concert with their friends in the government. We are frequently lectured on this side of the chamber by the Australian Greens about their role in protecting progressive interests in this country. We have been told by Senator Di Natale that his goal is for the Greens to become the natural home for mainstream aggressive voters.


It is a pretty funny way to go about it, because if I were looking to displace the Australian Labor Party—which, of course, is the true home for mainstream progressive voters—I would not set about doing that by repudiating hard-fought gains in tax transparency. I would stand with the only progressive party that is capable of forming government in this country, and I would stand by the legislation that they put in place to improve the level of tax transparency in this country. What I would not do, similarly, is defend this proposed legislation. I would not come into the chamber and say, 'This half-baked deal gets us somewhere.' It really does not. There was a majority view formed in this chamber to stick with the arrangements that Labor had put in place. The unilateral decision by the Australian Greens to walk away from that view for some, as yet unexplained, benefit—which, I suspect, is not going to prove to be particularly impressive—is really inexplicable to me and I think will be a source of real disappointment for many progressive activists out there who do look to the progressive parties in this chamber to defend their interests and their beliefs.


I note that the Australian Greens are fond of putting up enthusiastic memes and enthusiastic posters like, 'We did it!' Well, what have we done today? We did it; we managed to work with the government senators to water down tax transparency provisions in this chamber. I say to all senators here: I think that this is a very great shame. It does not reflect well on the Australian Greens, but the Australian Labor Party will not walk away from our commitments on this matter.

They will be spitting out their coffee, and they will be absolutely astounded that the trust that they placed in the Australian Greens to defend their interests in this issue of tax transparency has been entirely misplaced. They have been betrayed by the Australian Greens. One must give some credit to former Senator Milne for her work in being part of the instigation of the Senate Economics Committee's inquiry into tax transparency. But that work has been betrayed by the current leadership of the Australian Greens.


We have woken up today to see that the Australian Greens have undercut the good work that Labor and the crossbenchers have been doing, working together to try to bring about a better outcome when it comes to tax transparency. What I am specifically referring to is the fact that the Greens have sided with the government in raising the threshold for the disclosure of tax. We know that, under the $100 million threshold which had been passed through this place, about 900 private firms would have been required to disclose their tax arrangements. Under this new threshold of $200 million of income, it is now likely to be fewer than 300 companies. Some estimates put it as low as 281 private Australian companies. This number could be even lower, because it is well open to billionaires to come forward, as they are prone to do, to restructure their businesses and to hive off parts of their structures so that they come below the proposed $200 million threshold.


This is the sort of activity that people in this area get up to because they are particularly keen to ensure that the light of day is not shone on their tax arrangements. There are many prominent Australians who have come out and said they want sunlight to be shone on these tax dealings. We have had Mr Dick Smith come out. He actually savaged the Prime Minister for shielding the rich from tax transparency and he accused the Prime Minister of 'ratting' on typical Australians who pay their tax if the coalition goes through with plans to shield large private companies from having to disclose how much tax they pay.


We know that trust is the important thing. A key pillar of any successful economy is trust. Market driven systems are inherently based on trust—trust by workers that they will be paid by their employers; trust by businesses that other businesses will fulfil contract obligations; trust by everyone in the banks and the financial system; and, above all, trust in the government. We are currently at a low point in public trust in our institutions. The past year of publicity on the devious ways in which multinationals avoid paying taxes in Australia, albeit through legal loopholes, has eroded public confidence in the government's commitment to ensuring that there is a level playing field when it comes to tax.


While the tax office hounds our small businesses to register for GST, submit quarterly statements and deliver chapter and verse on their financial affairs, we are aware that Australia's richest individuals employ expensive tax accountants to find the loopholes that help them to minimise their tax. Tax data from the 2012-13 financial year reveals that 40 of Australia's top income earners claimed $42½ million for their tax advisers, an average spend of over $1 million each to bring down their taxable payments. Most Australians will never see $1 million in their lifetimes. It is hard for an average Australian to understand that someone gets $1 million deducted from their taxes just to pay for their tax accountant. It is not surprising their confidence in our tax system and in our values of fairness for all is being sorely tested.


But there was bipartisan support to expose and close the rorts that global multinationals are getting away with via a myriad of complex overseas arrangements that reduce their tax exposure in Australia. Everybody agrees that multinationals need to pay their fair share of tax that relates to their activities in Australia. But what about the many Australian companies and the private holdings of our wealthy individuals? Are Australians expected simply to take the government's word that our Australian owned businesses are beyond scrutiny, that we can expect them all to do the right thing, even though we know that many of our top income earners pay no tax whatsoever? If these companies and private trusts have nothing to hide, then why are the government and its Treasurer so outraged that the wealthy should be asked to put very basic financial information on the public record? As Dick Smith has recently said, we know who most of them are. There are currently around 1,498 Australian companies that enjoy an exemption from the normal financial reporting requirements that apply to all other Australian companies with revenue over $25 million. 


In light of the recent exposure of how multinationals are avoiding tax in Australia, we should return to the issue of why so many of the top Australian businesses are able to keep their tax affairs secret. There were some temporary exemptions from full financial reporting, but this is now something which we are focused on. There is a reason why we have joined in the bipartisan effort to combat multinational tax avoidance. It is that we are sick and tired of hearing all the stories of how much tax many global, iconic companies here in Australia are not paying—companies like Chevron, Glencore, Uber, Apple, Google et cetera. But are we simply to accept, without any information whatsoever, that our own wealthy Australians, whether they be companies like Myer or Linfox or simply wealthy Australian families, are paying their taxes here? Our tax transparency proposals would go a long way to redressing the suspicion that Australians hold about how fair our tax system is. Greater transparency would ensure that the public is better informed about the tax contributions that our large corporations are making, discourage aggressive tax minimisation practices that we know exist and inform our ongoing debate about the efficiency and equity of our tax system.


We are not asking for a lot of information, which makes it all the more surprising that the Treasurer is so outraged by our proposal. We believe that the government's stand here to maintain secrecy is a matter which ordinary Australians should be particularly concerned about. What are they trying to hide and why? In this era of corporate ethics and responsibility, shouldn't the wealthy bend over backwards to demonstrate how great their contribution is?

"Dastyari, Sen Sam",ALP,2015-12-03,"



Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (11:08):  I ask that the question be divided in respect of each of the amendments and foreshadow that I have an alternative amendment to move in relation to amendment (3) and wish to vote differently in relation to amendments (1) and (2).



The CHAIRMAN:  The question before the chair is that the amendments that have been passed by the Senate not be insisted upon. Senators may recall there were three amendments passed by the Senate when it last dealt with this matter. Senator Dastyari has asked that the question be applied individually to each of those three amendments, on the basis that he wishes to replace one of those amendments with his own amendment. That is in order, so I will separate those amendments and deal with them separately. The first question is that the committee does not insist on amendment (1) with which the House has disagreed.




Senator DASTYARI:
  I think it is a shame that there has been a rush to get this legislation through. I believe that there is an hours motion in place which now means that we will not be leaving this chamber until this bill has been dealt with. I think that is a disappointing development for the Greens political party, who have made it pretty clear to us in the past that they do not support these types of gags. But in effect there is a gag being placed here. They realise that the opportunity for proper, detailed discussion, for us to have a proper analysis of the details of the dirty deal that has been done here, has been removed. In the next 24 hours or so we will have to vote on this, and the opportunity to go away and actually talk to people and analyse these amendments is lacking.


It is amazing. We had Senator McKim the other night go on this big rant, in relation to a different piece of legislation, about a lack of information and how quickly and how soon all this had been sprung on him. That was a piece of legislation with amendments that had gone through an entire committee process, that had gone through public canvassing, that had been part of the public debate for weeks, if not months—months of public debate. And yet here we find out that late last night there was a dirty deal being done by Senator Di Natale. It is amazing what one night in in the Treasurer's office can get you—one night with the Treasurer. I have heard of deals done cheap. I just was not sure that things were done that cheap.




Senator Kim Carr:
  Macfarlane's joined the National Party!




Senator DASTYARI:
  Ian Macfarlane has joined the National Party? Jeez.




Senator Kim Carr:
  You'll take anybody!




Senator DASTYARI:
  They will take anyone.




Senator Kim Carr:
  You'll have Richard Di Natale next!




Senator DASTYARI:
  Well, they vote together now, the Greens and the Nationals. 


What is so amazing is that we are dealing with amendments now that, yes, were supported just weeks ago by the Australian Labor Party, the Australian Greens and the majority of crossbench senators. And yet it appears that those same amendments that were good enough just two or three weeks ago are now being dealt with as going too far. There is this premise that we somehow do not need to stay firm and that any deal is better than no deal. Frankly, Senator Di Natale, there were better deals that could have been done. What is so disappointing here is not just the type of deal you have done but that you did it so cheaply and so stupidly. That you were prepared to sell out for so little is unbelievable.


Let us be clear. The government tried to foist these kinds of cheap, dirty deals on everyone in this chamber. They tried to do it with the crossbenchers. They tried to do it with the Labor Party. They went to each Independent individually and made these types of offers. Everyone else who actually had advocated in the past for these tax transparency measures, thought to themselves: 'Let's not sell out. Let's stay true to some principles. Let's believe in something. Let's demand a better deal.' But there was one conversation from Scott Morrison with the leader of the Greens, where he said, 'It's this or nothing,' and, like the doormat that the Greens have become under Senator Di Natale, they just rolled over. They roll over every time. They just fold. They have clearly been learning from the Nats. The Nats are growing—you just got a new member. They just roll over every time.


This is the worst negotiation tactic imaginable. If you want to negotiate with Senator Di Natale, all you have to do is go in there, make some kind of outrageous claim, and he will fold. He folds every time. What is so shocking here is that he has folded on a matter that was something that, frankly, I wrongly believed was a point of principle for the Greens political party. I thought it was something that they actually had passion about and had fought for. I have said in this chamber many, many times, and I have paid respect to the incredible work of former Senator Christine Milne in this place on the issue of tax transparency. To see those measures, those bills, those matters watered down, rolled back under Senator Di Natale is just appalling. 


Senator, I want to make it clear to you just exactly who it is that you are actually going to be protecting today. Senator Di Natale made it very clear earlier this morning—he was up-front and frank about it—that he would not be supporting the amendments in the names of Senator Muir and Senator Lambie regarding grandfathering, which is a difficult issue that took a long period of time to build the necessary level of political will. Let us not kid ourselves. One in six of the 1,498 companies we are talking about here, the list of which was published in full by the Guardian—is a political donor or government contractor. Senator Di Natale, one in six of them. 


Today there was going to be an amendment before the Senate—there are two that are very similar—in the name of either Senator Lambie or Senator Muir, to actually shut down that loophole. This morning you announced that you would be voting against any such amendment. Yesterday we confirmed that the numbers were there in the Senate to pass that amendment. Of course, the big lobbyists and the big donors are beside themselves with glee. The threat of the government having to disclose and actually closing that loophole has now been removed for them. Why? Because Senator Di Natale did a dirty deal—a desperate, dirty deal. Senator Di Natale, I am not aware of whether you actually understood the enormity of what you have sold out or whether you just do not understand this issue well enough. And I really do not know which of those two is worse.


On tax transparency and the issue of disclosure, the argument will be, 'It's a $200 million disclosure instead of a $100 million disclosure. It was an arbitrary figure to begin with.' True. The $100 million figure was meant to capture in the vicinity of the 1,000 largest private companies. That is where the figure came from. The idea was built around: how do you get a figure around the 1,000 largest companies? Almost 75 per cent of them have now been exempted because of the deal that you have done. Why? Because of some threat from the government that they would not pass their own legislation if you tried to improve it on the front of transparency. That is the deal you did. That is the con you fell for. The government's own legislation, their own MAAL bill—it was Joe Hockey's legacy item. It was a bill that everybody supported, and they went to you and said, 'We're not going to pass our own bill that everybody supports unless you fold on everything else.' And Senator Di Natale says, 'Then I'd better fold on everything now.' That is what a negotiation with you must be like. It must be fantastic. I would love to buy a property off you. 




Senator Lines:
  You'd get it dirt cheap!




Senator DASTYARI:
  That's right. You would get it cheap. I am not sure what you would have to do in the office—



Senator Edwards interjecting—




Senator DASTYARI:
  I am outraged, Senator Edwards. I am disgusted. I am appalled. Look, I am fairly new to this place, so maybe I have been naive the whole time because, frankly, I expected better from Senator Di Natale. I expected better from a Greens political party, the rhetoric of which on this issue has been so strong for so many years, who have always said the right thing, and when the opportunity comes for them to actually stay tough and force a better bill, he folds. And he folds under some lie or premise that there is some kind of threat that the bill will not pass and the government is going to dump its own legislation. Senator Di Natale, through the chair: if you believe that, you will believe anything. The idea that you are going to fold on every matter, every issue and every point of principle just because the government is prepared to do this—




Senator Conroy:
  He'd better take his bat and ball and go home. Seriously. You fell for it.




Senator DASTYARI:
  No, no—I think it is important to understand what would have happened if Senator Di Natale had stood firm on this. The government would have had one of two options. One is that they would have had to bring back their own bill today and they would have accepted what the Senate was going to do and adopted it. He believes they would have gone all the way to $200 million, but they could not possibly have gone to $100 million because those 500 companies need to be protected. Why do those 500 companies need to be protected, Senator Di Natale? Why would you fold on that? Why would you fold on those 500 companies needing to be protected? The other option is that the government would have had to bring back the bill early in the new year because the MAAL bill involved measures they needed to get through for their G20 commitments.


That was the leverage to get a better bill. You have sold out the leverage to get better legislation. That is the con you fell for. They would have had to bring it back early in the new year, at the latest. The fact that they needed that legislation to pass before the budget would have been the opportunity for those of us who believe in transparency, who believe in a better bill and who believe in more accountability to get the best legislation. But at the first chance you got, you went soft.




Senator Edwards:
  It needed to start on 1 January.




Senator DASTYARI:
  No, this legislation could comfortably—




Senator Edwards:
  Tax reform needs to start on 1 January. This is the last sitting day.




Senator DASTYARI:
  There would have been amendments and then it would have been early February legislation. But you are ramming it through at the first chance, the first opportunity, the first sit-down—




Senator Edwards:
  This is nonsense.



The CHAIRMAN:  Senator Edwards, you will have an opportunity if you want to contribute to the debate. We are in committee.




Senator DASTYARI:
  Mate, we are going to have all day to do this, Sean.




Senator Canavan:
  Proper title, please.




Senator DASTYARI:
  Sorry; Senator Edwards—who, may I say, is looking remarkably handsome now that he has shaved off his moustache. Senator Di Natale is doing this at the first opportunity, the first sit down and, I hate to say it, the first date—faults and everything. So we have a situation where the entire leverage of this movement and what this campaign had been building towards, with all the work that had been done over two full years now not only by the Labor Party—and the Labor Party played a very big role—but also people like Christine Milne, community groups, activities and movements everywhere has been sold out.


I am going to have a lot to say today about how some of these groups feel about it all. He has gone to all of them and said, 'I'm going to fold on the first opportunity I get. I'm going to fold because it is easier to fold.' Yes, Senator Di Natale, it is always easier to cop out. It is always easier to give up on principle. It is always easier to say, 'You know what? They are a bunch of really powerful companies and the government here is playing a big role in protecting them, and the easiest thing for me to do is just to have the debate go away.' It is disappointing, it is disgusting and it is horrible that someone who professes to actually be passionate about these issues, who professes to care about these issues, who professes that these issues are a priority for them and their political party would come into this chamber and sell out on this point of principle.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2015-12-03,"



Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (11:24):  There was one point in particular that Senator Whish-Wilson made earlier that I took some offence at that, and that was when he claimed that Labor were just upset because the Greens had done the deal before Labor. Let me just put some facts on the record. Last night we rejected the final begging, grovelling approaches from the big end of town's representatives on the other side of the chamber and we said, 'No, we will not compromise on this. You have to fold and you have to deliver this bill with full tax transparency.' When offered the same 30 pieces of silver, we rejected it. Those who have now signed this deal—the political geniuses sitting down there preparing their notes to speak—took the 30 pieces of silver.


So I want to absolutely put on the record that, when Senator Whish-Wilson said that Labor were just upset because the Greens did the deal before we did, he could not have misled this chamber more seriously and, importantly, besmirched those on this side, who have been campaigning for full tax transparency for a vast number of years along with many, many members of the Greens. And they will be horrified that the geniuses in charge of the Greens decided that they could do a filthy deal and exempt all of these companies that are donors to the Liberal Party. That is on their head and their head alone.


If you had a spine or some political courage, there was no need to roll over and give the government this bill. They needed this bill. It was important legislation. It is flawed and it does not go far enough, but the government needed this bill—and all they had to do was agree to reveal the level of tax that these companies were paying. Let us not forget that Malcolm Turnbull's own company was in there. But you have chosen to give the government a leave pass. The Australian public is being kept in the dark because of the Australian Greens' lack of spine on this. And you will pay a price—and you deserve to pay a price.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2015-12-03,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (11:27):  I was a union official for 27 years, and my day-to-day job was negotiation. Some of the negotiations that you entered into were negotiations that you did not think that you had a lot of chance of winning. But you had to work out a strategy, you had to sit down and look at what you can achieve and you had to push a little bit further than what you thought the employer was going to give you. When the employer eye-balled you and said, 'That's all we've got. If you don't accept what we are offering, you can go on strike or you can leave. You can do what you like, but we are not going to give you anymore,' that is when the tough choices had to be made. That is when you had to dig in. That is when working people dug in and said, 'We will call the bluff.' If workers and unions had behaved like the Greens have behaved in this set of negotiations, workers would still be earning very little, their penalty rates would be gone and their annual leave loading would be gone.


From time to time you actually have to show some courage and be tough in negotiations—the exact opposite to what the Greens have done in relation to these negotiations on tax avoidance and tax transparency in this country. They have just given in. They were weak in their strategic approach to the negotiations. They were incapable of understanding that what we should have achieved here was much more transparency and a much better outcome for the public purse and the national interest. The Greens did not show any courage. They did not show any negotiating skills. They did not show any capacity to actually understand the importance of this issue to the public purse. It is tragic that they would keel over so quickly to the Liberal Party and the National Party on this issue.


When you see Senator Heffernan up defending the Greens you know there is a problem. You know something has gone wrong. What has gone wrong is that Senator Di Natale did not have the capacity, did not have the courage and did not have the commitment to actually deal with this issue effectively, and I am not sure whether he had the backing of his party to do so. By simply giving in at the first sign of a bullet flying past you, by simply conceding at the first sign of the coalition eyeballing you and staring you down, demonstrates a major weakness in the Greens and a major weakness in their strategy and a major weakness in their leader's capacity to understand what is important for the Australian public.


You see, this issue now means that the political donors—the multimillionaires that are running companies around this country—who donate to the National Party and the Liberal Party, who fund their election campaigns, will now not pay their fair share of tax. They will continue to hide exactly how much tax they pay, yet ordinary workers in this country and families in this country are being told by those opposite that everything is on the table in terms of tax, including a GST. We know that a GST would leave families thousands of dollars worse off. They are maintaining a GST on the table to take more tax from ordinary working families who are battling to keep their heads above water now, battling to ensure that they can put school shoes on their kids' feet, battling to buy books for their kids to go to school and probably have not had a holiday for some years. They are the ones who are being targeted by this mob over here, while their mates who donate to them, who donate millions of dollars to the Liberal Party election coffers, are being let off scot-free. That is the problem here: if you donate to the Liberal Party and if you are a mate of the Liberal Party, then they will cover for you in terms of how much tax you pay.


The perfect example of that is 7-Eleven. The head of 7-Eleven presided over a company that ripped off migrant workers, that ripped off 457 workers and that ripped off every franchisee it could. Do they have to indicate how much tax they have paid? No, they do not, and why don't they? Because the Greens capitulated. Because the Greens did not have the courage, the capacity or the will to take on the coalition for transparency.


If you go back to the former Greens leader, the Greens were not a party that was determined to be in the mainstream. What is the mainstream for the Greens? Obviously, the mainstream for the Greens is to sit side-by-side with the coalition and their big business backers to hide what is happening in relation to tax in this country. If that is the mainstream, it is not the mainstream where the Labor Party wants to be. We do not want to be there. We want to be in the spot that makes sure that everybody pays their fair share of tax, especially the multimillionaires and especially those companies that are ripping off workers and want to get rid of their penalty rates while not paying an appropriate amount of tax in this country. 


What did Christine Milne say back a few years ago? She said, 'Corporate tax avoidance in Australia is endemic.' Will this bill deal with the endemic tax avoidance? Of course it won't. The Greens have sold out their former leader in terms of the vision and the values that Christine Milne had. She said, 'Billions are being lost to Australians via so-called aggressive tax planning'. Will this bill resolve the aggressive tax planning for those that are ripping off the tax system in this country? Of course it won't. So Senator Di Natale and the Greens again have sold out on a value and a principle that former Greens leader Christine Milne aspired to achieve. Former Greens leader Senator Milne said:


Big corporates are exploiting loopholes in our tax laws and the global nature of their business to avoid tax. That means that it is Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey's job to act now.


Does this bill resolve that position? No, it does not, because it still leaves corporations in this country ripping off the taxpayer. She went onto say:


Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey are going to extreme lengths to defend the indefensible and protect the profits of the big end of town.


This was a press release from Senator Milne. I hope she puts a press release out today and says that Senator Di Natale and the Greens are going to extreme lengths to defend the indefensible and protect the profits of the big end of town, because that is exactly what is happening here. Everything that Senator Milne stood for is being trashed by this Greens party room today—absolutely trashed. What does this do about defending the indefensible? A Greens leader standing here defending what they are doing now is indefensible. Senator Milne's press release goes on to say that:


As well as increased transparency and reporting of subsidiaries, strengthening the tax act on profit shifting and properly resourcing the tax office, some further immediate steps we can take have been identified during the inquiry.


So Senator Milne kicked off the inquiry, Senator Dastyari took on that inquiry and took it to levels I do not think many other people would have taken it to in terms of exposing the rorts that were going on and exposing the unfairness of the tax system in this country. Senator Dastyari has done that and, after all that work, what do we have? We have the Greens doing a deal in return for what? In return for nothing. Did they get any deal on tax profit sharing and tax profit shifting, as their former leader wanted? No, they did not. Did they get more resources for the tax office as a result of negotiations on this bill? No, they did not. They sold out completely and utterly. Why did they sell out? Because they want to be so-called 'relevant'. They want to be in the mainstream .


My lesson for the Greens is that you do not become relevant and you do not judge the mainstream as supporting tax avoidance in this country and, if you continue to support tax avoidance in this country, what you will get is more pressure on ordinary families to give up more of their support systems from government. The coalition will continue to try to cut pensions. The coalition will continue to try to cut support from seniors. The coalition will continue to cut health in this country, to cut education funding in this country and will force the states to argue for a GST that will hit everybody and will hit the poorest hardest. That is the strategy that the coalition have set out to achieve. 


I never thought for a minute that the Greens would be the ones who would not have any idea about that strategy or would capitulate to that strategy so quickly, capitulate in a way that leaves ordinary people in this country open to further attacks on their standard of living while the big end of town walks away untouched. That is what has happened with the Greens and, if that is the mainstream, the Greens should not be in the mainstream on these issues because the mainstream, according to your mates across on the bench with whom you are voting today, is about protecting the tax avoiders, protecting those who have wealth, power and privilege, making sure that inequality in this country increases because the big end of town, those who are rich, will not be paying the proper tax and ordinary battlers out there who go to work every day, battling hard to make a quid, battling hard to get food on the table for their family, they pay their mortgage or they pay their rent, they are going to have to pay more because this bill allows the tax rorters, the tax scammers and the tax avoiders to get away with it. That is what the coalition have done—backed in the avoiders, the scammers and the rorters. That is what has happened here. 


There are people who are on standard of living that ordinary Australians could never dream of because they are not paying their fair share of tax. They are getting richer by the year as the poorer in this country battle every day to put food on the family table. That is what the Greens have done. How obnoxious is it that the Greens could have descended so low in a debate of such importance. They have descended to a position of simply backing in the rorters, the tax avoiders and the people who do not want to make a contribution to health, to education. That is what has happened with the Greens here. What former Senator Christine Milne said was that she wanted:


… the Abbott government to immediately make public the ATO's settlement register so that everyone knows to what extent we are missing out on revenue from the big end of town.


Does this meet the test that the former Leader of the Greens set? No, it absolutely does not. The Greens are an absolute disgrace on this issue. They have sold out the working class in this country. They have capitulated to the Liberals. They are simply supporting tax avoidance and tax rorting. They should be absolutely ashamed of themselves. (Time expired)

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2015-12-03,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:43):  I am going to be a bit boring and ask a number of questions about the technical aspects of these amendments because insofar as we are dealing with the first set of amendments and it was entirely appropriate that—




Senator Canavan:
  Relevant, I think you mean.




Senator XENOPHON:
  Don't taunt me, Senator Canavan. I just want to get on with it. We will never know whether we could have got a better deal. My preference was to have got a better deal, but I am not going to engage in who is to blame—I do not think that is helpful. I want to understand this. In the context of general purpose accounting, which is a real issue of concern, this is about companies with turnover of a billion dollars or more—the Googles, the Apples, the Microsofts—which for many years have been getting away with special purpose accounting where they give very little information about transfer pricing and about a whole range of measures, where they simply get away with blue murder by saying as little as possible about their finances. I moved the amendment; it was supported by the Australian Labor Party, the Australian Greens and a number of my crossbench colleagues. That passed and this is one of the amendments that is in contention.


From the brief discussion I have had this morning with government advisers in relation to this, the Australian Greens, through Senator Di Natale, will be moving an amendment relating to general purpose accounting, but it will be different in some respects. It will be different in respect of the reporting requirement. Instead of going to the ATO, it will go to ASIC. I do not have a problem with that but I do have a series of questions to ask about it.




Senator Cameron:
  ASIC have no money.




Senator XENOPHON:
  Senator Cameron says that ASIC have no money—well, they have money, but whether they can do the enforcement that they are meant to is another issue. So I would be grateful if the minister could advise: in what material respects is the amendment being proposed by Senator Di Natale any different to the amendment that the Senate agreed upon in terms of general-purpose accounting? That is the first question. I understand that the first difference may be in terms of reporting to ASIC or to the ATO. The other concern is: will this do what is intended in the amended form by the government? Will those companies that have been grandfathered out of the system, that have been exempted, be exempt from these provisions in respect of what the government is proposing?


That is for starters. I know I am being boring, but I want to deal with the substantive measures here. I want to see what we are getting as an alternative in respect of this and whether it will deal with that key issue. At the risk of damaging his journalistic career, I call this the Michael West amendment, because Fairfax business journalist Michael West has been writing about this articulately for some considerable time and it was his investigative work that influenced me to put this amendment up in the first place.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:46):  To clarify, the government is not moving any amendments and the government is not intending to move any amendments. The only motion the government has moved, that I have moved on behalf of the government, is that the committee does not insist on its amendments with which the House has disagreed. Now Senator Dastyari has asked for that question to be taken in detail one by one, and that is fine, but the government does not intend to move any amendments.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (11:47):  I want to draw the Senate's attention to the fact that moving responsibility from the ATO to ASIC is fraught with danger. The key regulator, ASIC, themselves warn that their ability to have an impact and to do their job properly and supervise markets and companies was substantially reduced by the $120 million cut in the first coalition budget, which brought so much devastation to families around this country. We all remember that first budget. We remember the former Treasurer and Senator Cormann sitting out there with their Havanas, puffing away with great satisfaction after they had ripped into pensioners, ripped into welfare recipients and forced more costs onto workers every time they went to see the doctor. They were very satisfied with that. But what the public did not understand was that some of the regulation that put checks and balances into the corporate system was also ripped away in that first budget, to the extent that the ASIC chairman, Greg Medcraft, had said that their capacity to fulfil their role would be substantially reduced.


I recently participated in the insolvency inquiry into the building and construction industry, and what ASIC were clearly demonstrating there was that they have limited capacity to handle corporate malfeasance because they do not have the money. They just do not have the resources. So to put a proposition here that takes responsibility away from the ATO, which has had its funding cut as well, and gives it to ASIC and to present that as an acceptable proposition—to put that responsibility to an organisation that does not have the money and the resources to fulfil its existing obligations and responsibilities—shows just what this bill is about. It is about making sure that there is no capacity for the regulators to actually track down the tax rorters and the tax avoiders.


How the Greens could possibly agree to that amendment beggars belief. Surely someone in the Greens understands that both the tax office and ASIC are being starved of funding as part of the austerity approach to 'balance the budget' from the coalition. It was one of these 'budget emergencies'. We do not hear about budget emergencies anymore, even though our position is deteriorating under the coalition. We do not hear about that anymore, but we still see the cuts going into the corporate regulators who are there to try and ensure that business pays its fair share of tax. This proposition that you take it away from the ATO and put it into ASIC and ASIC will be able to handle it is just not true, and it should not be agreed to. Mr Medcraft is saying they want to push the case for user-funded models, because they are desperate to get cash so that they can do their job.


In that committee I was in it was clear that people could 'phoenix' companies in the building and construction industry and generally across the economy. That means they could deliberately kill a company and leave it with all its debts and set up another company that would be a new company—it would be what is described as a phoenix company. The evidence we had was that they could do that with impunity because ASIC did not have the resources or the funding to deal properly with phoenixing in any industry in this country. But now we are being told that, as part of this bill, we will take more responsibility from the ATO and put it into ASIC, and ASIC will be able to handle it. Well, ASIC will not be able to handle it. 


The outcome of that will be exactly what the coalition want—that is, to ensure that there are no checks and balances on their mates that provide the funding for their election resources. That is what it is about. They just do not want their mates in the big end of town to pay their fair share of tax. Everyone else in the country can pay a higher GST—15 per cent GST. We know the secret plans there. That was reported yesterday. It is there—15 per cent GST on everything; on health, on education, on fresh food. That is where it is at. 


Yet, what we have from the other side now are all these manoeuvres to try to make sure that if there is any capacity for this bill to deal with tax evasion properly, it will be diminished because ASIC are the organisation that have to deal with it and ASIC will not have the resources. This is another demonstration that Senator Di Natale was comprehensively outmanoeuvred, comprehensively done over, comprehensively pushed aside by whoever negotiated on behalf of the coalition—a great victory for the coalition, a great defeat for the Australian public. The Australian public are the ones who are going to have to pay the price for this. To actually contemplate asking ASIC to do more oversight and overview work with reduced resources is just not an acceptable proposition.


We even had Nationals Senator John Williams calling for a user-pays system to be introduced for financial advisers so that ASIC could better police the industry. I have a lot of differences with Senator Williams, and certainly the National Party, but there is one thing you can say about Senator Williams: he is on to this issue; he is on to the issue about corporate rorting. He is a lone voice in the coalition on this. He has understood the need for extra resources. Why couldn't the Greens understand that? Why couldn't the Greens understand that by moving any responsibility out of the tax office in to ASIC, we end up moving the responsibility to an organisation that does not have the resources or the capacity to deal with this effectively?


It is bad enough being totally outmanoeuvred in your negotiating position, as the Greens have been, it is bad enough just capitulating, as the Greens have, and it is bad enough making workers in this country pay more because you are not prepared to make sure that the big end of town pays their fair share, but to come here and argue on technical points that ASIC can do the job is just a complete misunderstanding of how things work and what has happened under this Abbott Turnbull government. 


They look after the big end of town. They look after your mates. They do not care about those who are battling to look after their families, who are struggling to keep their heads above water, who know how difficult it is to buy the school uniforms and get the kids off to school, who know how expensive it is to go on public transport that could cost an extra 15 per cent in terms of GST. They do not care. I never thought I would see the day when the Greens would not care either. By passing this amendment, or supporting this bill, it shows that they really do not care, or they either do not care or do not understand the key issues affecting the Australian public in trying to simply get a fair go on taxation.


Capitulating to the negotiating strategy of the coalition is not about being on the side of the angels, as the Greens would have had us have it this morning. It is not about being on the side of the angels; it is about capitulating. It is about an absolutely amateurish approach to negotiation. It is about not having the courage to stand up for your convictions. It is about not having the values that your previous leader had in relation to making sure that everybody pays their fair share. What a capitulation from the Greens. What a disgrace. For a party who say they are progressive, for a party who say that they stand up for the battler, it is an absolute nonsense.


This is an area where this Senate had an opportunity to make sure that the rorters, the tax avoiders and the big businesses that are ripping off their workers paid their fair share of tax. This bill makes sure that that will not happen because there will be secrecy in place—we will not know what is in there. Joe Stiglitz, the Nobel winning economist, spoke about information asymmetry. That means you need to get all the information that you can for a properly operating market. Well, the market will not operate properly when you have certain companies that are not paying tax and nobody knows what is happening. There can be no public pressure on these companies because it is all kept quiet and secret. 


Why is it kept quiet and secret? It is kept quiet and secret because these are the people who fund the coalition's election campaigns. They are the ones who are out arguing to rip off workers, get rid of their penalty rates, rip off 457 workers, rip off migrant workers. The big end of town are the people who are being protected under this bill. They will not even be required to disclose how much tax they are paying. ASIC will not be able to enforce it because they do not have the resources. This is an absolute joke. This is an area where the Greens have been absolutely outmanoeuvred, treated like absolute mugs, and they have not done what their previous leader said they should do—that is, deal with a comprehensive problem, an endemic problem, that meant that ordinary working people paid more tax. We heard that we were starting a journey. You do not start a long journey without a suitcase or without anything in it. Let me tell you: this long journey that the Greens think that they are starting on—the suitcase is empty, because they get no extra resources for ASIC. They get no extra resources for the ATO. They get no protection for the ordinary families of this country. It is an absolute debacle what has happened here. 


I cannot understand the Greens for a minute who argue that they are the protectors of working people in this country. What an absolute joke! How can you protect ordinary working families when you simply give in to the big end of town—when you do not have the backbone, when you do not have the intellect and when you do not have the strength and courage of your convictions to stand up to the Havana-smoking frontbenchers over there who want to rip working people off? How can you have any credibility in this debate at all? 


This is a party that has completely lost its way. What for? They want to be relevant—you are not relevant to the Australian public, if you allow the rip-offs to go on. You are not relevant to the Australian public, if you do not stand up for them. You are simply trying to achieve relevance, and relevance at any cost. Relevance of numbers and year do not automatically mean relevance for the Australian public. I think the relevance that is important is to stand up against the rip-off merchants, the big end of town and the rorters that are out there.


Senator Milne had it right: the former leader of the Greens identified the problems and the issues that had to be dealt with. Senator Dastyari took that work on, and we have got a way forward. But the Greens capitulated. They let the Havana-smoking frontbenchers over there—the supporters of the big end of town—take them to the cleaners with absolutely no capacity to negotiate, no courage to eyeball the coalition and no attempt to support ordinary working people. It is a disgrace. (Time expired)

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:02):  Whilst we are dealing with the first lot of amendments—appropriately moved by Senator Dastyari so that it will be split—it is relevant to understand, before we vote on this, the context of the amendments that are being proposed as a result of the agreement between the Australian Greens and the coalition in relation to this. Senator Di Natale has an amendment that he will be moving that seeks to supplant the amendment that was accepted and voted on by the Senate—3D, reporting of information about significant global entities. My question to the Minister for Finance is: to what extent is what has been agreed between the government and the Australian Greens in terms of the significant global entities reporting requirements—this relates to general purpose accounts? It is very important to find out, as Senator Cameron alluded to, how the Googles, the Apples and these large multinational corporations and pharmaceutical companies, Big Pharma—and I acknowledge the work that Senator Dastyari has done on this and indeed former Senator Milne. 


I am just trying to understand for the purposes of this debate: what are the differences between the two? When you have international tax experts who do not work for the big end of town asking questions, will it be based on consolidated revenue—I am asking specific questions, for instance, whether it applies to consolidated revenues? Does it have to be a general purpose financial statement Tier 1 as set out in accounting standard AASB 1053, the same as for companies listed on the ASX—these are technical questions but they are important as to how this will work. I just want to make sure that it does what it is intended to, so I ask these questions genuinely of the finance minister. I just want to get to the core of the substance of what we are dealing with here.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:04):  I wish to put a number of questions to the finance minister. I do not have an issue, if the Minister for Finance gets back to the committee stages not immediately but within a few minutes or half an hour so we can just understand this, because they are technical in nature. 


I am very pleased that the finance minister has said on the record that they are better drafted—although I think that the Senate drafting office does a pretty damn good job, given their resources and the pressures they are put under. He says that this will give effect to what is intended. What was intended in the course of the debate on and the committee stages of this bill was to ensure that general purpose accounting requirements apply. So I am very pleased and I thank the finance minister for saying that.


My specific questions are: firstly, is the test for the application based on consolidated revenues as defined by accounting standards—that is, the same as in a large proprietary company test in the Corporations Act? For ease of reference to the advisers, I will provide a copy of these questions—that might be useful.


The second question I want to put on record is: does it apply to the Australian group defined as the ultimate Australian holding company and all of the entities it controls? Thirdly, does it relate to general purpose financial statements Tier 1 as set out in accounting standard AASB 1053—that is, the same as for companies listed on the ASX? Fourthly, is the same timely financial information being lodged with the ATO no later than four months after year end—the same deadline as in the Corporations Act? Fifthly, does it have to be audited and the lead audit partner has to rotate every five years—the same requirements applying for the Corporations Act?


I genuinely thank the finance minister for saying that this is about a better drafting for the intent of what the Senate wanted to do in terms of general-purpose accounts. I am grateful for that. I will go and see the advisers and give them a copy of these specific questions.

"Lines, Sen Susan",ALP,2015-12-03,"



Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (12:07):  I guess my journey on tax advocacy really started in around 2006. I am just really disgusted that we are here today responding to a dirty deal done by the Greens in the middle of the night. It just shows how little they understand what they are actually doing. But I want to talk for a moment about my journey. It shows again the inexperience of the Greens. I come out of a trade union, and I have spent the majority of my working life working with low-paid workers.


In 2006 we thought we, along with members, had done a really good deal at a public hospital. We had got workers a four per cent wage increase. But, when we put it to the general membership, they rejected it overwhelmingly. We were really shocked because we did think this was a good deal. We had done it with members. The issue that they raised with us was that the cost of living for them had gotten to the stage where they needed a much bigger increase than the four per cent that was on offer by the state government. Their rent had gone up. Their utilities costs had gone up. Food costs had gone up. And four per cent really was not going to cut it.


So we sat down with union delegates and low-paid hospital workers—orderlies, cleaners, personal care workers, enrolled nurses, technicians and so on—and we worked out that there was no way we could ask the state government for the sort of money, the sort of wage increase, that those low-paid hospital workers needed to cover their costs. So we started to look at what the tax system offered us. What did it offer for low-paid workers? Obviously, to try to lobby the state government and agitate for the state government to give workers the sort of increase in wages they needed was not possible without additional revenue. That was really when my tax journey started. It was absolutely motivated by low-income workers in Western Australia saying to me, as their elected representative, 'A four per cent wage increase just doesn't cut it.'


It just shows how out of touch the Greens are that they do not appreciate, that they do not understand, because none of them have ever really been in front of low-paid workers, that the deal that they have done here today to lock away the transparency of private companies absolutely hurts low-income workers because it stops the government getting increased revenue. I have heard the Greens go on about how we have a revenue problem in this country. It just shows that their words speak a lot louder than their actions. Someone who really believes that we have a revenue problem in this country would not have done the dirty deal that they have done in the middle of the night. It hurts low-paid workers, like hospital workers in Western Australia, because the government continues to get a shrinking revenue. Let us see how they explain that.


But of course low-income workers do not support the Greens. Low-income workers do not look to the Greens for their salvation. Labor stand for low-income workers, and we stand for tax transparency.


It is amazing. I am not quite sure how the Greens who have sat on the Senate committee that has looked at the kinds of rorts of 7-Eleven—a company on the secret list, a company the Greens have just given an exemption to—think. How do they justify the stories we have heard from 7-Eleven workers who have been ripped off? Yet today they have sat with the government and said, 'It's okay for 7-Eleven to rip workers off, and we're going to continue to allow them to sit on a secret list so that ordinary Australians don't really get to see the sorts of profits that 7-Eleven have made.' I can tell you that 7-Eleven have given us the run-around on that Senate inquiry. We keep calling them back, and we keep calling them back, and we ask them more questions, and they can hide. They can hide, and the Greens on that committee are going to allow 7-Eleven to continue to hide.


I wonder what the Greens will say to the low-paid cleaners in this place, who need the government to increase its revenue so they can get a decent wage. They are on strike this week. Those cleaners are on strike this week. Maybe the Greens have not noticed. They certainly do not care, because if they cared they would not have done the dirty deal they have done this week. It shows how out of touch they are with low-paid workers, particularly cleaners cleaning their offices. What are they going to say to them? They say: 'Look, we've done a dirty deal. We're going to allow these companies—companies that ripped off workers—to continue to be on a secret list. We're going to allow these companies to avoid paying tax. That's what we're going to do as the Greens party.' What a disgrace.


Last night we had an event here at Parliament House which a couple of the Greens came to. When you came to meet with those sacked MV Portland workers last night, you did not have the decency to tell them you had done a dirty deal with the government. You proudly stood there and said, 'We're with workers.' Well, I tell you what: I have already told the MV Portland workers that came here last night that the Greens do not stand with them. How could they front that function last night and say to those MV Portland workers, 'We're with you'? Clearly, the Greens are not with them, because no-one who stands with sacked MV Portland workers would have done that deal that the Greens did in the middle of the night. Had they already done the deal when they were standing in front of the MV Portland workers? Who knows? But you do not stand there and say one thing, 'We're with you,' and then turn around and do this dirty deal with the government on the other hand. You do not do that. It is hypocrisy.


And we have heard them today—what wusses. I am glad none of them were union officials, because boy they have sold out really easily. You have to be tough in negotiations. You have to stand up to the government, and this is a just cause. The Australian tax network must be throwing its hands up saying, 'We've done all this work for a couple of years and the Greens, in the middle of the night, on the second last day of sitting for this year, struck a deal with the government.'


My union, United Voice, have advocated so hard for tax reform, because tax reform is a salvation for low-income workers. I do not know what they will be saying about the dirty deal the Greens have done this morning. Again, it just demonstrates that they have no understanding of what it is like to walk a day in the shoes of a low-paid cleaner, a low-paid hospital worker, a low-paid early childhood educator or a low-paid hospitality worker. They have no idea, because they so quickly sold them out.


They are allowing these companies to continue behind this veil of secrecy. This morning we heard Senator Dastyari say in this place that one in six of those companies on that secret list are either political donors or government contractors, and of course we know who they donate to: they donate to the Liberal Party and the National Party. That is the deal the Greens have done. Let them hold their heads up and stand like they did last night with the MV Portland workers and say that the Greens were proud to do a deal that continues to let one in six on that list donate to the Liberal Party and the National Party in order to get government contracts but to hide their tax obligations. That is the deal the Greens have done in the middle of the night.


As Senator Dastyari also told us this morning, the $100 million figure was not just plucked out of the air, and the Greens know that. It was there because it captures 1,000 of Australia's largest private companies. We all understand that the Turnbull government always wants to protect its mates at the big end of town, and we also know that Mr Turnbull and his wife have a company that was on the secret list. A couple of weeks ago in this place, when that list was first published, I stood up and informed the Senate of that—and guess what those opposite did? They tried to call a point of order on me. They did not want me, through the Senate, to tell the Australian public that Mr Turnbull and his wife were on that list. During my 10-minute speech, I think they got up at least twice to pull that point of order on me: 'We can't have a Labor senator from Western Australia saying that Mr Turnbull and his wife, Lucy, are on that list!' The Greens know that, and that is who are they are protecting. Who would have thought the Greens would line up behind the Prime Minister of this country and run a protection racket? That is what they have done today, and I am angry about it, because I stand for low-paid Australians.


I stand for paying my tax, and I have never, ever complained about paying my tax. It is my obligation as a citizen in this country to pay my tax, not to set up some shonky scheme to avoid it. I do not hold any shares, and you can look at my senators' interests. I have no interest in hiding my tax. I do not have private companies. I want to pay my tax, and I can tell you that members I work with at United Voice also want to pay their tax. Why is it that we pay our taxes but the Turnbull government and the Greens want to allow the Prime Minister and companies like 7-Eleven to be on this secret list to avoid that transparency? Why have the Greens done that? It is because they do not represent ordinary working Australians; that is why the Greens have done that. And how dare they stand with those MV Portland workers last night and somehow pretend they are with them? They are not with people when they do that—they are absolutely not.


This legislation is flawed because it does not go far enough, and for Labor it was worth hanging out for a better deal. Just two weeks ago the Greens were with us, but we heard Senator Di Natale stand in this place and say this bit of legislation was 'better than nothing'. It is not. We should have stared the government down, but again the Greens are trying to find some relevancy, just like the deal they did a couple of months back that affected part pensions in this country. And now most organisations believe the Greens sold out middle Australia with that deal, which they did. They are just not experienced at this stuff. It is not where they come from. Their hearts are not with ordinary working Australians. Their hearts are now with the Turnbull government, who just wants to continue to protect these big companies, and this is not good enough.


We know where the Liberals stand on tax transparency. They have always voted against Labor's move. They are predictable. We know they want to protect their mates at the big end of town. They voted against the moves that Labor put up when we were in government time and time again. It is what we expect from them. Their constituency is very clear. They do not support ordinary working Australians. They have been completely silent on what is happening to those Australian seafarers on the MV Portland. They apparently have little understanding of or compassion for cleaners on strike in this building this week. They took money out of the pockets of early childhood educators. They took money out of the pockets of aged-care workers, and now the Greens have joined them. That is now what the Greens stand for. Well, let's see where the Greens stand on the GST. We know where Labor stands. We oppose a big fat new tax. We oppose an increase in the GST to 15 per cent. We oppose it. We believe it, and it is who we are.


It is not who the Greens are. Maybe the next thing they will be trotting up to support the government on is a big, fat new increase in the GST to 15 per cent and putting it on everything. They do not represent low-paid workers; Labor does. That is who our constituency is. We know the damage a GST would do to low-income earners. But let's see where the Greens go next on the GST—striving for relevance, clinging to the tails of the Turnbull government. What a place to find yourself in at the end of the year. What a place to be. I am proud to be Labor. I am proud to stand for tax transparency. (Time expired)

Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales) (12:22):  We have been told quite a bit in the last week about the government's desire to have a mature, grown-up conversation about taxation. To that end the government has been keen to assure us that they have not ruled out GST. In fact, not a single member of the government has been willing to rule out the introduction of an increased GST in either its level or the breadth of its application.


But I will stay to government senators that it is a pretty funny way to start a mature conversation.




Senator Cormann:
  Mr Chairman, I rise on a point of order. I appreciate that this is a wide-ranging debate, but there is a question before the chair and the question before the chair does not relate in any way, shape or form to the GST or other matters that the senator has started to touch on. The issue that we are dealing with is a government bill to combat multinational tax avoidance and how the Senate proposes to deal with a position adopted in the House of Representatives. I ask you to draw the senator back to the question before the chair.




Senator McALLISTER:
  On the point of order: I am simply seeking to place the matters before this chamber in the context of the broader debate on taxation.



The CHAIRMAN:  While the minister is right—there is a question before the chair—Senator McAllister has only been speaking for less than a minute. We will see whether her comments become relevant in due course.




Senator McALLISTER:
  I simply wanted to observe that it is a funny way to have a conversation about taxation when all of the things that do seem on the table relate to penalties for low-income people in the tax-and-transfer system. Very few of the things that are on the table go to the question of corporate taxation and of the big end of town paying its fair share. That is, of course, the debate that we are having here this morning.


The Tax Laws Amendment (Combating Multinational Tax Avoidance) Bill 2015 was an opportunity for the government to demonstrate that they would be even-handed in this mature conversation that we are embarking upon about taxation. Sadly, that is not what has been presented to us this morning and is not what has been presented to us over recent months. This bill in general has been supported by Labor, but our sense is that it is utterly inadequate in addressing the very real challenges of corporate tax avoidance that are presented to us. The bill, of course, takes a completely untested approach to closing some of the loopholes present in our corporate tax system. There are no precedents for the approach around the world.


The extraordinary thing—and I remember looking at this on budget evening—is that in the budget papers the measures provided for in this bill could not be quantified. Instead of a number, the usual thing that one expects to see in budget papers, there was a series of asterisks which substituted for an actual quantified assessment of the impact of this bill on levels of revenue for the government. I think that tells you quite a lot about the seriousness with which the government has approached this task. I draw people's attention to the way that we might have been treated if we had put forward a set of propositions around corporate tax reform but just put a series of asterisks in place. That would have been laughed out of town. That would have been a case for serious mockery. But this government has had the effrontery to present their arguments with absolutely zero information about what the likely impacts of the bill will be in addressing serious problems.


The specific questions that the chamber is debating this morning go to transparency. It has been the subject of quite some examination in both the Senate Economics References Committee and here in the chamber over the last two years, as previous speakers have pointed out. Of course, when last in government, the senators on this side of the chamber and Labor ministers took this issue seriously. We passed legislation in government that required the Australian Taxation Office to publish information about the income and tax paid by companies earning more than $100 million. Ever since we put that legislation through, this has been the source of real anxiety for the government but, more particularly, real anxiety for the very wealthy individuals who fear that their own tax affairs may be the subject of additional scrutiny and, quite frankly, should they be scrutinised, might not really stand up to that scrutiny.


The truth is that there are quite a number of companies in this country that are in legally grey areas. The ATO has said that privately owned corporate groups, often controlled by a wealthy individual or a family, pose significant tax compliance risks. These are the very companies that our legislation sough to target and these are the very companies that the government today, with the agreement of the Australian Greens, is seeking to exempt from scrutiny.


The thing about these companies is that in many instances their arrangements may well be legal. It may be that they are in strict compliance with the tax laws in a black-letter sense. But if we do want to have a mature and serious debate about taxation then we need to understand that, in certain instances, people may well be in compliance with the law but nonetheless the practices that the law enables may not be fair. They may not see very large, very wealthy organisations paying a level of tax that ordinary Australians struggling to get by would consider reasonable. They may also see particular individuals using a large number of companies interlinked in complex ways to avoid paying the income tax that they also would be reasonably expected by the rest of the public to pay.


Throughout this debate there have been people on the other side of the chamber who have said that the publication of this information, putting this information into the public domain, could cause misunderstanding, and that perhaps the Australian public are not smart enough or mature enough to understand the information that would be put before them when this information is published. My assessment is that the opposite is true. People are not really afraid that the Australian public will not understand the information that is put before them. People are afraid that the Australian public will understand the information that is put before them. They will understand that the situation where one in five private companies is paying zero tax is unfair and unreasonable and sees a small group of people shirking their obligation to contribute to the services that are valued by all Australians, because that is the truth of it. When we are talking about tax, we are also talking about government services.


As my colleague Senator Lines pointed out, the social wage in this country is absolutely essential to the support of so many very low-paid workers who struggle day to day to get by buying food, buying clothing and supporting their children through education. Those families are dependent on a health system that works. In their retirement they will be dependent on an age pension, and they will be dependent from time to time, if they fall into unemployment or underemployment, on some level of government support to keep their family on their feet until such time as they can, once again, provide for themselves. Each of these measures that a civilised government provides are absolutely dependent on adequate levels of taxation. It is, to that end, most important that we are able to have a serious debate about tax in this country. But you cannot have the debate if you do not have the information.


There has also been a series of spurious arguments made about some of the personal security risks presented by the publication of tax information. We saw the embarrassing circumstance where government agencies contradicted these arguments, pointing out that the AFP had never provided any concrete examples of threats to individuals arising from their financial information being in the public domain. We also saw arguments that the disclosure of this information would harm Australian owned private companies in their market environment. Of course, what we do understand is that, in any market, competition is absolutely dependent on fair information and an even playing field. We ought to be looking to even up the playing field between publicly listed companies, whose financial reporting gives a clearer picture of the risks related to the companies, and the private companies. This lack of reporting about their tax affairs may well conceal some risks associated with those companies. We have heard about compliance costs. This cannot be a serious reason for opposing tax transparency. Compliance, of course, must also always be proportional. We must always be balanced. But if there is some public good, it is not unreasonable to ask compliance costs to be borne by these businesses.


What is astonishing then is to come into this chamber this morning and hear news that the hard-fought efforts of, the hard-fought gains won by, many in this chamber to improve levels of tax transparency—against the wishes of the government—have been undermined overnight by a deal by the Australian Greens in concert with their friends in the government. We are frequently lectured on this side of the chamber by the Australian Greens about their role in protecting progressive interests in this country. We have been told by Senator Di Natale that his goal is for the Greens to become the natural home for mainstream aggressive voters.


It is a pretty funny way to go about it, because if I were looking to displace the Australian Labor Party—which, of course, is the true home for mainstream progressive voters—I would not set about doing that by repudiating hard-fought gains in tax transparency. I would stand with the only progressive party that is capable of forming government in this country, and I would stand by the legislation that they put in place to improve the level of tax transparency in this country. What I would not do, similarly, is defend this proposed legislation. I would not come into the chamber and say, 'This half-baked deal gets us somewhere.' It really does not. There was a majority view formed in this chamber to stick with the arrangements that Labor had put in place. The unilateral decision by the Australian Greens to walk away from that view for some, as yet unexplained, benefit—which, I suspect, is not going to prove to be particularly impressive—is really inexplicable to me and I think will be a source of real disappointment for many progressive activists out there who do look to the progressive parties in this chamber to defend their interests and their beliefs.


I note that the Australian Greens are fond of putting up enthusiastic memes and enthusiastic posters like, 'We did it!' Well, what have we done today? We did it; we managed to work with the government senators to water down tax transparency provisions in this chamber. I say to all senators here: I think that this is a very great shame. It does not reflect well on the Australian Greens, but the Australian Labor Party will not walk away from our commitments on this matter.

"Ketter, Sen Christopher",ALP,2015-12-03,"



Senator KETTER
 (Queensland) (12:36):  Across Australia this morning, and I trust tomorrow morning as well, supporters of the Australian Greens will be choking on their Weet-Bix. They will be spitting out their coffee, and they will be absolutely astounded that the trust that they placed in the Australian Greens to defend their interests in this issue of tax transparency has been entirely misplaced. They have been betrayed by the Australian Greens. One must give some credit to former Senator Milne for her work in being part of the instigation of the Senate Economics Committee's inquiry into tax transparency. But that work has been betrayed by the current leadership of the Australian Greens.


We have woken up today to see that the Australian Greens have undercut the good work that Labor and the crossbenchers have been doing, working together to try to bring about a better outcome when it comes to tax transparency. What I am specifically referring to is the fact that the Greens have sided with the government in raising the threshold for the disclosure of tax. We know that, under the $100 million threshold which had been passed through this place, about 900 private firms would have been required to disclose their tax arrangements. Under this new threshold of $200 million of income, it is now likely to be fewer than 300 companies. Some estimates put it as low as 281 private Australian companies. This number could be even lower, because it is well open to billionaires to come forward, as they are prone to do, to restructure their businesses and to hive off parts of their structures so that they come below the proposed $200 million threshold.


This is the sort of activity that people in this area get up to because they are particularly keen to ensure that the light of day is not shone on their tax arrangements. There are many prominent Australians who have come out and said they want sunlight to be shone on these tax dealings. We have had Mr Dick Smith come out. He actually savaged the Prime Minister for shielding the rich from tax transparency and he accused the Prime Minister of 'ratting' on typical Australians who pay their tax if the coalition goes through with plans to shield large private companies from having to disclose how much tax they pay.


We know that trust is the important thing. A key pillar of any successful economy is trust. Market driven systems are inherently based on trust—trust by workers that they will be paid by their employers; trust by businesses that other businesses will fulfil contract obligations; trust by everyone in the banks and the financial system; and, above all, trust in the government. We are currently at a low point in public trust in our institutions. The past year of publicity on the devious ways in which multinationals avoid paying taxes in Australia, albeit through legal loopholes, has eroded public confidence in the government's commitment to ensuring that there is a level playing field when it comes to tax.


While the tax office hounds our small businesses to register for GST, submit quarterly statements and deliver chapter and verse on their financial affairs, we are aware that Australia's richest individuals employ expensive tax accountants to find the loopholes that help them to minimise their tax. Tax data from the 2012-13 financial year reveals that 40 of Australia's top income earners claimed $42½ million for their tax advisers, an average spend of over $1 million each to bring down their taxable payments. Most Australians will never see $1 million in their lifetimes. It is hard for an average Australian to understand that someone gets $1 million deducted from their taxes just to pay for their tax accountant. It is not surprising their confidence in our tax system and in our values of fairness for all is being sorely tested.


But there was bipartisan support to expose and close the rorts that global multinationals are getting away with via a myriad of complex overseas arrangements that reduce their tax exposure in Australia. Everybody agrees that multinationals need to pay their fair share of tax that relates to their activities in Australia. But what about the many Australian companies and the private holdings of our wealthy individuals? Are Australians expected simply to take the government's word that our Australian owned businesses are beyond scrutiny, that we can expect them all to do the right thing, even though we know that many of our top income earners pay no tax whatsoever? If these companies and private trusts have nothing to hide, then why are the government and its Treasurer so outraged that the wealthy should be asked to put very basic financial information on the public record? As Dick Smith has recently said, we know who most of them are. There are currently around 1,498 Australian companies that enjoy an exemption from the normal financial reporting requirements that apply to all other Australian companies with revenue over $25 million. 


In light of the recent exposure of how multinationals are avoiding tax in Australia, we should return to the issue of why so many of the top Australian businesses are able to keep their tax affairs secret. There were some temporary exemptions from full financial reporting, but this is now something which we are focused on. There is a reason why we have joined in the bipartisan effort to combat multinational tax avoidance. It is that we are sick and tired of hearing all the stories of how much tax many global, iconic companies here in Australia are not paying—companies like Chevron, Glencore, Uber, Apple, Google et cetera. But are we simply to accept, without any information whatsoever, that our own wealthy Australians, whether they be companies like Myer or Linfox or simply wealthy Australian families, are paying their taxes here? Our tax transparency proposals would go a long way to redressing the suspicion that Australians hold about how fair our tax system is. Greater transparency would ensure that the public is better informed about the tax contributions that our large corporations are making, discourage aggressive tax minimisation practices that we know exist and inform our ongoing debate about the efficiency and equity of our tax system.


We are not asking for a lot of information, which makes it all the more surprising that the Treasurer is so outraged by our proposal. We believe that the government's stand here to maintain secrecy is a matter which ordinary Australians should be particularly concerned about. What are they trying to hide and why? In this era of corporate ethics and responsibility, shouldn't the wealthy bend over backwards to demonstrate how great their contribution is?

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (15:07):  On Tuesday, 1 December, I was asked a question by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate concerning the execution of a search warrant on the home of Mr Brough, and I undertook to get back to her with further information.


The primary question was:


I refer to guidelines issued by the Australian Federal Police for search warrants, which state:


'All matters where the execution of a search warrant may have politically sensitive implications (not limited to fraud) should be raised with the Minister responsible for the AFP …'


When was the Minister for Justice first informed of the AFP's intention to execute a search warrant at the home of Mr Brough? Did the minister inform Mr Brough, and if so when? 


The answer that I have been provided by the Minister for Justice is:


As is usual practice, the Australian Federal Police informed the Minister for Justice just prior to it being executed. The Minister for Justice did not inform Mr Brough of the execution of the search warrant.


The first supplementary question was:


Did the Minister for Justice inform his senior minister, the Attorney-General, of the AFP's intention to execute a search warrant at the home of Mr Brough? Was the Attorney-General copied into any brief for the Minister for Justice informing him of the warrant?


I was not informed by the Minister for Justice of the AFP's intention to execute a search warrant at the home of Mr Brough. As is usual practice, the Minister for Justice provided me with an oral briefing after the warrants were executed.


The second supplementary question was:


Did the Minister for Justice inform the Prime Minister of the AFP's intention to execute a search warrant at the home of Mr Brough? If so when, and did the Minister for Justice inform anyone else of the AFP's intention to execute this search warrant?


The answer provided by the Minister for Justice is:


As the Minister for Justice informed the House of Representatives on 1 December, after the warrants were executed, as I would normally do in a matter like this, I informed the Prime Minister's Chief of Staff and the Attorney-General, as the Cabinet Minister in the portfolio.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (15:16):  I move:


Senator Collins moved—That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Attorney-General (Senator Brandis), the Minister for Finance (Senator Cormann) and the Minister for Rural Health (Senator Nash) to questions without notice asked by Senators Cameron, Collins and Gallagher today relating to the Special Minister of State (Mr Brough) and to mental health policy.


In relation to answers provided by Senator Brandis, he maintains that we should wait until guilt is established rather than apply the ministerial standards. He knows what those standards are. Arthur Sinodinos knows what those standards are. It is not appropriate that we wait until guilt has been established when a prima facie case is very clear, even more so as Senator Brandis tries to dance around a basic contradiction. You cannot say on national television, 'Yes, I did,' and then say in the House of Representatives, 'No,' and not accept that there is a clear contradiction there.



Senator Heffernan interjecting—




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  Senator Heffernan it seems is again trying to say that my voice is too loud. I am sorry, Senator Heffernan, that is bad luck for you. We have every reason to be outraged by the behaviour that is occurring here.


Let me move to Senator Cormann's non-answer to questions today. What is particularly instructive is that he would not indicate confidence in his junior minister. He is not hanging himself out here.


I think I should return, though, to Senator Brandis and his various attempts to avoid answering questions and to refuse to take questions to the Prime Minister on notice earlier and, indeed, his not dealing with them comprehensively. It is tempting for senators to switch off as we are on the receiving end of Senator Brandis's odious pomposity. It happens time and time again and it is hard to continue to listen to him. But, for example, he and his interjecting colleagues burnt up close to 20 minutes of question time and time to take note of answers yesterday by misconstruing Senator Wong's paraphrasing and debating whether or not she had used the correct tense. This is what question time yesterday deteriorated into, rather than question time being about the government of the day, the executive government, answering questions.


Of course, Senator Brandis gets into trouble when he is answering questions, and we all need to ask: what is he hiding? Here is an example of what he is seeking to hide and why he is stonewalling. Senator Brandis told the Senate about his knowledge of the James Ashby affair, stating, 'I have no knowledge of the James Ashby affair beyond what I have read in the media.' We now know that Senator Brandis was briefed by the justice minister, Michael Keenan. This is directly contradictory to the evidence that he provided to the Senate. As we now know that Senator Brandis had information other than what was reported in the media, the question is: what else did he know and from what other sources? We now know why he danced around today and why he wasted 20 minutes of question time and taking note time yesterday. He is attempting to hide the real issue. The real issue was his answer that he knows nothing more than what he had gleaned from media coverage of this matter, and what we now know is very different.


Not only do we have Mr Brough misleading parliament; there are serious questions now over whether the Attorney-General is guilty of misleading the Australian parliament. That was the issue he was hiding yesterday. That is where the trickly lawyer was dancing around again with his odious pomposity. We know he is stonewalling and we know now he is clearly hiding his own knowledge and his own involvement in this tawdry matter. And, of course, it is a tawdry matter.


Other movements in the Queensland Liberal National Party do make you wonder. There are defections to the National Party. What else is yet to occur here? Others are running away from Mr Brough. Senator Bernardi does not want to indicate his confidence. Senator Cormann does not want to indicate his confidence. Senator Brandis hid behind a generalisation that Mr Turnbull would have confidence in all of his ministers. We know what the lines are behind there. I look forward to Senator Bernardi's defence of Mr Brough because it will be most— (Time expired)

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (15:21):  It was really quite interesting to stand here and listen to Senator Collins's contribution.



Senator Bernardi interjecting—




Senator RUSTON:
  I have just been accused by my colleague of misleading the Senate by saying it was quite interesting. The comment that we heard from Senator Collins about question time deteriorating because of actions on this side of the place is really quite extraordinary. I am sure everybody who was in this place today saw that the majority of the deterioration that occurred in question time certainly did not originate from this side of the chamber.


One of the things I must say are quite extraordinary is the absolutely incredible obsession by those opposite with issues such as the one Senator Collins has just been speaking about. If only we had the same level of obsession about the prosperity of this country from those opposite, maybe we would be a little further down the track than where we are currently, instead of wasting the time of those in this chamber and those who were unfortunate enough to have had to listen to the goings-on today. 


The most important thing we could be discussing today is the prosperity of Australia. We should be talking about jobs, we should be talking about the economy and we should be talking about the government's agenda. To be prosecuting aspects of the broader government agenda in question time I would have thought was the purpose of question time. We should be prosecuting the issues of innovation, we should be prosecuting the issues of government agility and Australia's agility to be able to deliver for the future. Which made me all the more surprised when a senator opposite got up and asked a question about the NBN. I would have thought they would have learnt their lesson by now and realised that trying to defend the indefensible, which was the NBN under their watch, instead of working towards looking at the positive aspects that are happening with the NBN under our watch, is quite extraordinary. 


How many times have those opposite talked about the NBN and about an article that had been leaked to The Australian? There is absolutely no doubt that Senator Conroy has a couple of friends in the media because of the number of times we have seen leaked documents coming out on the NBN which are then refuted by nbn co. They have not been peer-group analysed and they get put into this place as though they are fact. It is quite extraordinary.


I concede that the NBN is a nation-building transformative piece of infrastructure. I congratulate those opposite because there is no doubt that that is the case. However, the way it was being delivered under those opposite and the previous government was nothing short of absolutely farcical. But there is some good news around the NBN. So I thought I would take a quick opportunity today to tell you a few good things about the NBN, so people are not misled by the rubbish they read in the paper sometimes.


The NBN is powering ahead. There is a plan that 3.9 million premises will be passed over the next three years and using existing copper technology, in conjunction with the HFC infrastructure, which already exists, not only can the NBN be completed with much less cost but it can also be completed much quicker and will be more affordable to the taxpayer. 


To be standing here and trying to continually prosecute something which occurred in the past, instead of looking forward, seems to me to be another political waste of time—as we see so often from those opposite. If we really want to talk about some negative things about the NBN, we only have to look at the extraordinary mismanagement of the project under those opposite. It was the most poorly managed project that I can remember since coming here. 


When Labor embarked on this mammoth venture they were absolutely clueless. They deliberately avoided a cost-benefit analysis. They abandoned a normal cabinet process and just went for a rubber stamp policy. They then ignored advice from the Public Service about what was going on, instead favouring some advice that they got from agencies that suited their ultimate outcome. Then Senator Conroy even had the audacity to appoint nobody to the board who had any telecommunications experience. So I find it extraordinary that we should be standing here today prosecuting these silly things when there are so many more important things to be done for the country. (Time expired)

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (15:26):  Here we are: we had plenty of opportunity for those opposite to defend the member in the lower house, Mr Brough, but what did they talk about? The NBN. They were not game to go near this cabinet minister, who is under incredible attack not only in the lower house but in the Senate and in the media. Not one coalition senator was prepared to say that they stand by this man.




Senator Bernardi:
  Just you wait!




Senator CAMERON:
  Senator Bernardi is going to stand by a cabinet minister who has misled parliament? It does not surprise me that Senator Bernardi would be getting up and supporting Mr Brough, because what Mr Brough has done trashes what is supposedly a clear obligation of a minister to act according to Westminster principles and to not mislead the parliament. He has misled parliament and the issue which is very interesting right now is that it is clear that Senator Brandis has misled the Senate. Senator Brandis said in his initial responses to the issue of what Mr Brough had done that he had no knowledge other than that which he had read in the media. That position was clarified today, and we have a different position where they received an oral briefing after the execution of the warrant. So the standard of ministerial responsibility in this place, either in the House of Representatives or in the Senate, under this government, has deteriorated so badly that ministers do not find it a problem to stand up and mislead the Senate or to mislead the House of Representatives.



Senator Ruston said there was some incredible obsession on this issue and then she ran away from the issue as quickly as she possibly could. She did not want to talk about it. There is no incredible obsession. This is about ministerial accountability—a very low bar to jump when it comes to the coalition. Ministerial responsibility under this government is out the window 


You can go on national television and admit to criminal activity, then come into the House of Representatives and deny it, mislead the House of Representatives and then claim that you are acting completely correctly. It is just nonsense. Ministers have a responsibility to tell the truth and not mislead either the Senate or the House of Representatives.


Senator Brandis has some questions to answer here as well. Senator Brandis has some explanations to make, because he told the Senate unequivocally that he had no knowledge of anything to do with Minister Brough's position other than what he had read in the media. Then he comes in today and indicates that he had an oral briefing after the execution of the warrant. So Senator Brandis has some explanation to make. Senator Brandis is absolutely doing the same thing that has been done by Minister Brough in the House of Representatives—that is, saying something that is not accurate and misleading the Senate. He has misled the Senate.


If we talk about courage and conviction in politics, surely it is about time that the Prime Minister acted with some courage and conviction. Surely it is about time that this Prime Minister had some backbone and actually stood up for the conventions and the rules that apply in both the House of Representatives and in the Senate, because this Prime Minister has shown no courage, no conviction and no commitment to the principles that apply in both Houses.

What I said—and what I continue to say, because it is the case—is that I had no knowledge of the James Ashby affair beyond what I learned from the media, and that is the case.

I said I had no knowledge of the James Ashby affair other than what I learned in the media, and that is the case. The fact of a search warrant being executed on Mr Brough's home, which was in the media, and the fact that I was advised of it by the Minister for Justice as a matter of course after the warrant had been executed, is not the James Ashby affair. It is an investigation.

Senator GALLAGHER
 (Australian Capital Territory) (15:32):  I rise to take note of the answer given by Senator Nash, representing the Minister for Health, to the question I asked about the suicide reduction target. Firstly, I was quite surprised by the response from Senator Nash when she answered the question. The question was: can the minister confirm that the government has not accepted the recommendation of the Mental Health Commission to adopt a suicide reduction target of 50 per cent? Her answer to that was, 'I understand that that is correct—that they have rejected that recommendation.' But she was not able to explain, despite being asked twice, why the government had rejected that and why that was the case.


This is a very serious situation here in Australia. Tragically, we have 2,500 people who lose their lives to suicide every year and another 65,000 Australians who attempt to take their own life. It is now double the annual road toll in any specific year, and it equals seven people losing their life to suicide every day. I think there certainly is unanimous agreement that we have to do something to reduce this number. We have to better support people and provide them with access to crisis support and with education, information and early intervention to prevent these tragic numbers becoming a permanent reality.


The Mental Health Commission's response to the review of mental health programs and services made it very clear that something further needs to be done and that it needs to be tackled similarly to ways that other terrible outcomes, such as the road toll, are being tackled, where you have a specific focus, pull in your effort behind it, set yourself a target and then measure progress against that target. We do that in a whole range of areas across public administration, particularly in government, when we are evaluating our programs. Targets are often included in there. There is simply no reason that is obvious to me or to others interested in mental health as to why, of all of the recommendations in this report, that one would have been rejected by the government without any explanation.


There are other questions, of course, about the government's response to this report. It is very light on detail. It is a 900-page report to which the government's response, I think, is 28 pages, if that. There is no indication of how it is going to be done, the cost of rolling out the program or the changes that will be made—and there will need to be significant changes if you can believe the overarching principles of what is in this document. There is no information about that. It is very light on in relation to suicide prevention and it is completely silent on the issue of the target or rejecting the target, although today the Minister representing the Minister for Health has very clearly answered the question—that they have rejected that target. She also indicated very clearly that, no, the government would not be reconsidering that recommendation. This is really disappointing, particularly when you look at the crisis that is suicide across this country and when you look at the disproportionate impact that suicide has on particular communities—particularly Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and those Australians living in rural or remote Australia, without as much access to high-quality support services as would be available to people in the city.


It is the leading cause of death for people under the age of 44 in this country. It is staggering that we would have that result and the response from the government to perhaps the most comprehensive review of the mental health system in the last few years with a recommendation on which the government is simply silent. But they talk the talk, 'Yes, we need to do more and effort needs to be put in,' but then they do not indicate how that will be done, the timetable for doing it or why, indeed, they are refusing to measure progress against it. As anyone knows who has been in government before, when you put out a program and you attach targets to it, the reason you do it is not because you might fail—and you have to acknowledge that over time—but because you want to make progress and you want to measure where you are going and be able to work out whether you have been successful. The government should reconsider their position. (Time expired)

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2015-12-03,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (15:38):  Before I address the substance of what I really wanted to do in taking note, I want to comment on what Senator Gallagher has said. Suicide is an extraordinary epidemic in our country. I do not think there are too many families who have not been touched by it in one way, shape or form either through extended friends or experience. In my own case, it caused me to reflect to when I was an employer and one of my employees took her own life. A couple of us went to inquire as to her welfare and we found her. It was a devastating experience for all involved—family, friends, work colleagues and everyone else. While Senator Gallagher was talking, I thought 'Could we have done more?' and it may have simply been to inquire further after someone's welfare. I support whatever endeavours are taking place on either side of the parliament in respect to inquiring as to the mental health and wellbeing of other people.


However, during question time there were lots of allegations made about misleading the parliament and misleading the Senate. In question time, I made a contribution which was to wish everyone a merry Christmas. I was not misleading the Senate when I said that. I was absolutely genuine in my good wishes for all of those in this chamber. Christmas is a time for reflection, where we think very carefully about the blessings that we have, the great fortune that we have and extend goodwill and best wishes to those all across the Senate.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Bernardi—




Senator BERNARDI:
  I wondered how long this would take.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  if you could resume your seat. Senator McEwen, on a point of order.




Senator McEwen:
  Yes, a point of order. The question before the chair is to take note of answers to questions asked by Senators Cameron and Collins about Minister Brough and also answers to questions asked by Senator Gallagher about mental health. I know Senator Bernardi addressed mental health, but I have no idea which of those answers he is addressing in this part of his contribution.




Senator BERNARDI:
  Mr Deputy President, in response to the point of order. It was very clear that I referenced how the allegations in question time were about misleading the parliament or the Senate and I was merely contrasting the allegations on that side with the fact that I was absolutely genuine in my contribution during question time, and I think the segue is perfectly legitimate and plausible. If the Christmas grinches on the other side do not want to hear about goodwill to all, that is for them and they can leave.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you. I cannot actually rule on this point of order. I do not want to upset you, Senator Bernardi, but I was not listening to your contribution because I was getting instructions from the Clerk about how we are proceeding for the rest of the day. So you have the call and I think you are going to finish in about two minutes.




Senator BERNARDI:
  Are you looking forward to me completing my response? I will not take it personally that you were not listening to me. I will I send you the Hansard, if you like, and you can enjoy my contribution once again! There was certainly a segue from the allegations that were made in question time to my own contribution, which was on a point of order, and it may have been spurious but it was about saying Merry Christmas to everyone. In the cut and thrust of political battle, where we often make all sorts of allegations about others and motives on the other side, it is important to reflect on the importance of the Christmas season. You do not have to be a particularly religious person to embrace the culture that arises out of it. That is where we give thanks for—




Senator Carol Brown:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order on direct relevance. It is quite clear that Senator Bernardi is responding to the motion before the chair. It is also quite clear that Senator Bernardi is not prepared to support his colleague in the House, Mr Brough. If he does not want to do that, he should just sit down.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Are you going to speak on the point of order, Senator Bernardi?




Senator BERNARDI:
  I would be delighted to respond. Senator Brown may have been asleep while I was addressing the important thing of suicide, which Senator Gallagher raised, and also in my subsequent response which has been about the allegations of misleading the parliament. I am proving my bona fides in that I have not misled the parliament. It is very clear.




Senator Cameron:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on the point of order. I just do not think Senator Bernardi has gone anywhere near the issue that is before the Senate. In relation to what he has been saying, it sounds as if he is looking for a new career outside of parliament as a Methodist preacher. He should not be doing an interview for a Methodist preacher and wasting the time of the parliament.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thankfully, I have been listening to Senator Bernardi's contribution since the last point of order and I think he may have strayed from the question before the chair. So I would remind him of the question.




Senator BERNARDI:
  Who am I to disagree with your ruling, Mr Deputy President. I want to thank the honourable senator's on the other side for allowing me to make a contribution. With only 10 seconds left, I would really like to take this opportunity to once again wish all of my colleagues the spirit of goodwill and merry Christmas, no matter where they sit in this chamber.

Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (15:49):  by leave—I present the following petition of SAS Trooper Evan Donaldson, containing about 5500 signatures. I have placed on my social media an interview I carried out with Trooper Donaldson and his wife. This family have been involved in a six-year battle to understand why Trooper Donaldson's official Army records have been fraudulently altered in order to deny his service with the SAS.


Overwhelming evidence has been presented to me which indicates that Trooper Donaldson is the innocent victim of a criminal reprisal action by his direct superiors, which has been condoned and covered up at the highest levels of this government, the SAS and ADF.


I want a special Senate investigation into these claims. I want ADFA Sergeant Major and Warrant Officer William Maher; Brigadier Stuart Davies; Head of Defence Legal Services, Mark Cunliffe; and Head of the Fraud Investigation and Control Branch, Michael Callan to appear under oath before this Senate committee.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2015-12-03,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (16:30):  As we know, yesterday marked the six-year anniversary of the Greens joining with the Liberals to vote down the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. Today will go down in history as another remarkable day when the Greens again have joined with the Liberals to help Australia's richest companies keep their tax dealings secret—selling out on ordinary Australian taxpayers in the process. Not only have the Greens sold out on themselves; they have sold out on everyday Australian taxpayers. Let us be clear about that. This goes beyond their own base but goes to everyday Australian taxpayers. I think that is completely immoral. 


The other thing that I think would sit very uncomfortably with the Greens is what their former leader, Christine Milne, would think of this dirty deal that they have done with the Liberals. It was Christine Milne who helped initiate the multinational tax inquiry to start with—and I give her credit for that. The former Greens leader, Christine Milne, certainly has more respect and integrity when it comes to issues of multinational tax avoidance than any Green in this place today, because all of them are selling out on that legacy that she leaves behind—a legacy where she knew that it was not fair and it was not right that hundreds and hundreds of Australian multinational companies were getting away with not paying their fair share of tax.


Let us go specifically to what this deal means for Australians. It means that, in effect, where there was going to be a threshold of $100 million where transparency laws would apply to about 900 private firms, now the Greens, siding with the government, will exempt two-thirds of those companies.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  More lies. Shame.



The CHAIRMAN:  Senator Singh, resume your seat. Senator Whish-Wilson, you need to withdraw those comments.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  I withdraw.



The CHAIRMAN:  Thank you, Senator Whish-Wilson. It is bad enough when there are loud interjections across the chamber, but when senators are in close proximity on the same side I think loud interjections are unfair to the speaker. I ask all senators to keep that in mind. 




Senator SINGH:
  Two weeks ago the Senate sought to restore the previous tax transparency laws. Labor, the Greens and a number of Independent senators demanded that the government bring the tax transparency threshold back to $100 million for all companies so as not to increase the complexity in the system and to ensure that the private and public companies were treated alike. Now, as a result of an enormous backflip, as a result of the enormity of what occurred yesterday, some six years after the Greens joined the Liberals to vote down the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, two out of three of the private companies that would have been caught in the tax transparency net will be taken out—thanks to the deal that the Greens have done with the government. 


The decision of the Leader of the Greens, Richard Di Natale, is I think a repudiation of the hard work that his own senators had done in the weeks and months prior to protect the tax transparency laws and to ensure big companies were held accountable. This decision flies in the face of their own Greens senators and what they agreed to. 


The Australian community and the Greens' own members will be rightly outraged at the new leader's capitulation in the face of pressure from the government. Perhaps it is appropriate that we reflect on the fact that, as I said, yesterday marked that six-year anniversary of the CPRS. In some attempt to become more mainstream the Greens are perpetuating a tax system that Australians see as unfair and which the Greens saw as unfair only two weeks ago. Now, all of a sudden, it is okay because the Greens want to move into this mainstream space—and, looking for relevance in that process, they have decided on some incredibly poor policy outcomes.


As we are all aware, the ATO gave evidence that one in five Australian private companies earning over $100 million paid no tax at all last year. But it is okay for hardworking Australian taxpayers to pay their fair share of tax. They cannot hide the amount of tax that they are supposed to pay. They are hardworking Australians and they pay all their tax, as they should and as we expect all people and companies in this country to do. We do not expect companies to hide their tax. If there is a loophole in the law, let's fix it, let's expose it, let's recognise the lack of transparency and do something about. That is what we did in this place a couple of weeks ago with the support of the Greens and the Independents. What they have done today flies in the face of that commitment that they gave to Australian taxpayers two weeks ago. It is sheer hypocrisy—absolute hypocrisy—when they know that this is not what they believed in only two weeks ago.


This goes to the heart of what the Greens' values are. This goes to the heart of what the Greens stand for and what they believe in. What do they believe in? Who would know? Two weeks ago they believed in transparency for multinational companies; today they do not. Today, the Greens are quite happy to sell out all the Australian taxpayers in this country. Why? Because they want to become 'more mainstream' and more relevant—arising from a fear of becoming irrelevant—or some other bizarre notion that they have concocted. As I have said, I am sure a number of Greens members today are saying, 'Bring back Christine Milne, because she stood for something.' She stood for proper Green values that they at one point held dear.


Now, we do not know what those values are because, let's face it, they have decided, 'Better to shore ourselves up with the Liberals; perhaps one day we'll get in government with them and then we will be really relevant.' Do you know what you will be relevant for? Nothing; because you will stand for nothing. As long as you come in here and backflip all over the place and sell out Australian taxpayers, as you have, no-one will vote for you. No-one will care anymore about who you are, because you do not stand for anything. We on this side of the chamber do stand for something. We stand for fairness for Australian taxpayers and we want to see those multinational companies pay their fair share of tax. They have gotten away with paying nothing—absolutely nothing. That is a disgrace, and it flies in the face of all of those hardworking Australians who day in and day out work hard and pay their fair share of tax.


I say to the Greens that it is not too late; you can actually change your mind again. Do a courageous backflip for once. Do a backflip that actually means something. Go back to your original position—a position which stood for something; a position of integrity—which meant that there would be transparency in our laws for these companies who, for too long, have gotten away with not paying their fair share of tax. If the Greens had not wilted—as I think my colleague Dr Andrew Leigh and our shadow Treasurer, Chris Bowen said—like week-old kale, the government would have had no choice but to pass this bill with the transparency amendments included. This would have been the best outcome for the Australian community and for tax fairness—'fairness'; a word which is no longer part of the Greens party after today. Instead, the Greens have delivered the government the votes that they need to gut tax transparency.


Let's just go to the heart of what that means. That means the Greens are protecting the Liberal Party's donors for the next election. All of those big companies—we know them; Philip Morris et cetera—that donate to the Liberal Party are safe and sound thanks to the Greens. So not only are the Greens delivering no tax transparency; they are delivering the government an election outcome. They are ensuring that the government's pot is full for the next election. We know that it is probably less than a year away, so I am sure that they are doing the numbers already. They are ensuring that the Liberals have the money they need from those companies. That is a disgrace. I am sure that is not what those Australians who voted for the Greens thought that they were getting. They would not have thought that that is what they were going to get from the Greens party in this country. After today, I would be very interested to see how the Greens progress in whatever it is that they are going to go forward with in this place, What we have seen today has been absolutely shameful. It has been a disgrace. It has been a sell-out and it flies in the face of anything that I thought the Greens perhaps did stand for. I thought that, at some point in time, they did stand for fairness. But they certainly do not seem to be standing for fairness anymore.


At the heart of all of this what we have wanted to talk about is the need for more transparency and not less, so that we can hold to account those companies that are not paying their fair share of tax. I thought that we had got there, and I thought that this Christmas we would be facing a situation where we had righted a wrong in our laws in relation to companies that were avoiding their fair share of tax. But, after today, if the Greens go ahead and join with the government in voting down what they supported with us only two weeks ago, all has been lost. That would be an incredible shame for democracy in this country and a shame for all of those hardworking Australians who, day in and day out, fight hard to ensure that we have fair and decent outcomes in this country. That is what I thought we were doing in this place—but not so much after today. As we know, that $200 million threshold will mean that fewer than 300 companies in Australia will be covered by this new law. That is an incredible drop from the 900 private firms that this law was going to cover. I think it is an absolute shame, and I ask the Greens to reconsider their position—and save some credibility in the process—so that this country can have fair and decent transparency and companies will pay their fair share of tax.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (16:43):  You are on your feet again, Senator Conroy. You are supposed to take a point of order when you are on your feet. It was good that Senator Singh made a contribution. We had numerous contributions from Labor senators this morning prior to business changing. I see Senator Urquhart is ready to make a contribution as well, which is good because she was on the speaking list when the kidnap amendment went down but she did not get a chance to speak. Senator Singh did not speak on the kidnap amendment. I went back and checked which Labor Party senators spoke on it. Senator Dastyari spoke on it—so he is off the hook—and Senator McAllister spoke on it. Apart from that the Labor Party put up three speakers. So when the kidnap amendment came to parliament, before the speaking list collapsed—



Senator Dastyari interjecting—




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  I am going to need a Strepsil very soon, Senator Dastyari.



The CHAIRMAN:  Senator Dastyari, you need to withdraw those remarks.




Senator Dastyari:
  Yes, I withdraw.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  Through you chair, I think you are going to need a Strepsil too, Senator Conroy. I think we all are because we are going to have a very healthy debate about this. Let me get back to the kidnap amendment bill. If there is any finger pointing in here as to why we are dealing with this legislation today it is because of the kidnap amendment bill. Labor put up—apart from Senator Dastyari who was introducing the bill—three speakers for the whole bill. Two of them got to speak before the bill collapsed—



Senator Dastyari interjecting—




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  I think I have definitely hit a raw nerve here, Senator Dastyari.



The CHAIRMAN:  I can advise senators that we are actually in the committee stage, so if senators want to contribute to the debate there is no limitation on their ability to contribute but you should do it one at a time.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  I have visited the original senate chamber in the old city of Rome and sat on the marble chairs, and this is what I imagine it must have been like with the original senators having a very robust debate, but I digress. Let me get back to the issue here of the kidnap amendment bill which went down in this place. As I mentioned earlier today—and I did say it very loudly in case you did not listen—I was sitting in the chair at the time and not only did the speaking list collapse and Labor not put up any speakers—that is how strongly they thought about tax transparency—



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  We had two speakers on the list before it collapsed so that is not fair. We had two speakers on the list. Senator Di Natale and I were due to speak before the list collapsed but Labor had put up two whole speakers. We have had about 50 in here today already. It is a shame we did not see that passion defending their original legislation when it was before the Senate. That is a question for the Labor Party. Maybe they decided that the politics were not really in their favour at that stage, whereas now they can see some gain out of it. So outraged were they that their original Bradbury legislation was going to go down that they put up two speakers and then they let the list collapse. When I was in the chair and the division was called, I cannot even say it went to the voices because there were no voices from the Labor Party, so that is why the Greens moved an amendment to bring the tax transparency issue back—



Senator Dastyari interjecting—




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  Senator Dastyari, we are dealing with the original amendment—the original legislation—which you let go. Now you are trying to scramble to look like you actually care about tax transparency—




Senator Dastyari:
  You are a con man.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  I ask the senator to withdraw that. I am not a con man.



The CHAIRMAN:  Again, I remind senators that they do have numerous opportunities to contribute to the debate but now is not the time. When Senator Whish-Wilson concludes his remarks, that is the time.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  Let us talk about respect. Let us talk about respect and integrity. The Labor Party sent an email around today to their supporters, and I have read it as have other people in the Greens. We are sending it to ABC to have it fact checked at the moment because we want someone impartial to look at this—



Senator Conroy interjecting—




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  Let me tell you, Senator Conroy, if you want to talk about respect and integrity the list of talking points that you have given speakers is also quite outrageous. It is totally misleading and lacks any factual basis. The Labor Party are saying that this legislation today lets the biggest multinationals—the biggest corporations—off the hook. It could not be further from the truth. We have put in place an outcome that companies over $200 million have to disclose their tax, so how that can be letting the biggest multinationals and the biggest corporations off the hook beats me, but let's let a third party decide.


Also, we have introduced a general purpose accounting standard which makes the biggest multinational corporations—under the definition in the original legislation that the Liberal Party have brought here—accountable with significant information. Once again, how that can be letting the biggest multinationals off the hook beats me. It is absolute BS. That is what it is. It is a lie and it has presumably gone out to thousands of Australians—



Senator Conroy interjecting—




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  I have been answering the phone calls, Senator Conroy, as have my fellow senators. We have been speaking to the callers as they have been coming in and letting them know—as triggered by the ALP—what the facts are and sending them more information. It is giving us an opportunity to put our side of the story straight and I think things are going pretty well in that respect. We have set the record straight, as we will continue to do so.


I will get back to the fact that the Greens would like to see some substantive debate in here on the legislation in front of us. We would like the Labor Party to explain why they are not going to support the introduction of general purpose accounting and why that is not important, especially in light of the key evidence the Senate inquiry has heard—the economics committee—about the loopholes that are used around special purpose accounting and the types of companies that have been getting away with blue murder. We would like the Labor Party to explain why they are not going to support that. We would like the Labor Party to explain why they are not going to support making 300 companies over $200 million declare their tax position.


The other thing that is totally misleading and deceptive in that email that has been going out from the Labor Party is that they are saying that we are letting 600 companies off the hook. Guess what? None of them are disclosing their tax now because you did not field a speaking list when the tax amendment—the kidnap bill—was before this house. You let it collapse and you did not call a division. You go back and check the tapes. I have got a copy of them—




Senator Conroy:
  You should not mislead the chamber like this.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  I am not misleading the chamber, Senator Conroy, and I think you should withdraw that statement.





Senator Conroy:
  I said that if you deliberately misled the chamber you would have to withdraw it.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  That is true. I learnt that in Senate school. Nevertheless, let me tell you who is misleading the Australian people. There is no transparency in place now. Had the kidnap amendment failed, then yes, the original bill put up by the Labor Party many years ago—and I acknowledged even in my rage this morning that the Labor Party has legacy on this issue, but that has gone because of the failure of this place to make sure we had the numbers to defeat it. We did not. We missed it. I and Senator Xenophon have both admitted publicly that the Senate itself has egg on its face. I have been man enough to admit that we could have done a better job and that the committee had the wool pulled over its eyes by certain front groups who were masquerading as being much bigger representatives than they were in terms of the people who wanted to avoid disclosing their tax and be shielded. We admitted that we got that wrong and that is why we brought the amendment back a few weeks ago and why we are having this debate now.


We need now to discuss why general purpose accounting—which is an amendment legitimately moved by Senator Xenophon—is so critical to this debate. It has been written on by some very good journalists, like Michael West from Fairfax and others, and it is an absolutely critical part of this debate. The government has agreed that this will be included in the legislation. That is a win for tax transparency. Whichever way you look at it, it is a significant win that the largest corporations in the world will be compelled to provide detailed information.




Senator Conroy:
  You sold out. You had the numbers to get a better deal, but you haven't got the gumption or the brains.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  Senator Conroy, in case you have not read it, there is a 'Statement of Accounting Concepts', with a chapter 'Objectives of general purpose financial reporting', which is a nice summary of why general purpose accounting is really important. I know, because I have chatted to Andrew Leigh, a member of parliament, about the work the Labor Party wants to do in the future on tax disclosure and on multinational reporting, that things such as profit shifting, thin capitalisation and transfer pricing—this is where you get your information on what actually does need to change. 


These things are being discussed in the context of the G20, but we have a chance to lead the pack before the G20, to take some action here today to put in place legislation that will kick a goal for multinational tax avoidance. That is what we are dealing with here today. Let us move the debate to why we need general purpose accounting, why that is a good amendment that will be put up by the Australian Greens and was put up originally by Senator Xenophon and then let us discuss why the $200 million threshold is a good start. It is easy to come in here and to say, 'We could've done better. If you'd left it to us, the government would've crumbled,' but I know, and this is what the Greens discussed and is why we have arrived at this great result today—




Senator Conroy:
  This great result today! You are so proud of it. We can hear it in your voice.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  We are proud of it. The reason we have done this today is that we know that once we get the disclosure we will get momentum. Once we get disclosure for those companies of over $200 million, once it becomes the norm for wealthy corporations to disclose their tax affairs, then we can take the next step. This is very good legislation and for anyone who cares about multinational tax avoidance, tax transparency and tax justice in this country, rather than just taking political pot shots, you must support this legislation today. So let us get on with the substantive amendments. Let us debate the detail. Put the politics aside and let the Australian people focus on what is in this bill.




Senator Conroy:
  They are not going to allow you to cover up your—




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  Senator Conroy, that is because you want to distract away from the fact that you are going to vote against some very good legislation and you will have a lot of explaining to do when you do it, because that is what is at stake here. Our party firmly believes we have delivered a good outcome. Is it perfect? No, it is not. All the bills we have looked at, including your Bradbury bill, is not perfect either. There is still a long way to go down this road if we are going to defeat multinational tax avoidance. There is still a long way to go but this is a very good and very important first step.




Senator Conroy:
  Your step is backwards.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  You let your first step get defeated in here a few weeks ago by failing to put up speakers and by not calling a division.




Senator Conroy:
  You stop misleading the Senate.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  I am not misleading the Senate, Senator Conroy. I was in the chair when it happened and I am very aware of what happened, but it took the Greens to get this issue back on the table. We are the ones who moved the amendment and that is why we are having this debate today. And that is why we have delivered a good legislative outcome. I urge the Senate to focus, right now in committee, on debating the detail of the bills in front of us.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland) (16:58):  I want to come back to the government for a moment—I will come back to the Greens shortly. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee, in Alert Digest No. 7 of 2015, made these requests:


The committee … seeks a detailed justification from the Minister which addresses the fairness of these provisions in light of the above—


I will stop there for a moment. I am too outraged by the Greens, actually. I cannot deal with that question. I have to leave you alone, Senator Cormann. It is just too hard for me. I will come back to you shortly. Let me deal with the Greens first because it is a complete sell out. I just worked myself up. I was going to ask the government some very detailed questions about this bill, but I will come back to that shortly. What is so outrageous about this is the Greens get on their feet and take the high moral ground on every point they can. They could not be more holier-than-thou in their utterances and—




Senator Conroy:
  On the side of the angels.




Senator LUDWIG:
  Yes, on the absolute side of the angels! But despite the Senate hearings—



Senator Conroy interjecting—




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Gallacher
):  Order, Senator Conroy! Let Senator Ludwig be heard.




Senator LUDWIG:
  Despite the Senate hearings, community support and a general campaign from the public for greater transparency and the end of multinational tax avoidance, the Senate had already passed the amended version of the bill. The votes were here in the Senate for the legislation, but, no, the Greens have done a deal with the government to lower that threshold. Lower it—not increase it, not expand it, but lower the threshold to exempt more companies from this legislation. Make no mistake: the Greens do not actually believe in anything anymore—if they ever did. If they do, they can certainly be bought. And, judging by what happened today, they can be bought pretty cheaply as well.


I would have thought, from the Greens' high moral ground, that they would have asked for something that even the government may have blushed at giving them. The government may have given it to them in the end but would have blushed in doing so. But we do not know yet what the deal is. We assume, of course, that in lowering the threshold and walking backwards from tough multinational tax avoidance legislation the Greens have taken the high moral ground and said, 'Better something than nothing.' I think what the Greens have secured as part of this grubby deal with the government is yet to be revealed. I think Senator Cormann is clever enough to offer them a good deal, and they have taken it. What is that good deal, Senator Cormann? We will only find out in the course of time, when it comes to light and we can see what the Greens got as a consequence of signing up to this grubby deal.


I understand that, as new leader of the Greens, Senator Di Natale feels the need to make his mark and fill the shoes of people like Dr Bob Brown and Christine Milne, but this is not the way to do it. It is a desperate attempt by the Greens to grasp relevancy by selling out on multinational tax avoidance. Senator Di Natale said yesterday that he was taking our advice about not just shouting from the sidelines. If this is what happens when the Greens become engaged, then please, please go back to the sidelines from whence you came. At least that way you do not break anything.


The Greens and the Liberals are legislating for multinational tax dodges to continue inhabiting the loopholes that exist in our tax system. The Greens and Liberals are in coalition on less transparency for hundreds of companies, to support the big end of town. The rational way of putting this is: you would expect the government, in a multinational tax avoidance bill, to lower the threshold. You would expect this government to try to obscure transparency. They have done that with FOI. They have an extraordinary record in making sure that there is no transparency in FOI. They have closed it down. They have shut the door, and in this area they are doing the same. They do not want the light of day to penetrate. From anybody's perspective, I can understand why the coalition wants that. The big end of town supports them. They tip their hat to the big end of town. They support the big end of town. They get their donations from the big end of town, so it makes sense. The Greens, on the other hand, have not been able to recognise that—by the way it looks. Because by signing up to this deal you have signed up to the big end of town. You have signed up to ensure that there is less transparency.


The other matter is, of course, that just like when they supported the defeat of the CPRS in the Senate, to the environment's detriment, we see them now supporting corporate tax dodgers. That is the Greens party of today. I have been here long enough to see the Greens take the high moral ground in many debates in this place over many, many hours of debating from a positive perspective—sometimes I did not agree with them, but they certainly put their arguments forward. Now we have the Greens of today. They are a mere shadow of that party, and are now the party that receives six-figure donations from corporate donors, the party that votes with the Liberals to support a watered down, weak piece of legislation that does nothing to capture the majority of multinational tax dodges. Progressives everywhere should be dismayed at the Greens' position—in fact, the Greens' capitulation. 


Senator Cormann has done a good job in corralling the Greens and doing a deal with them. I would not have expected Senator Cormann to achieve that, quite frankly, but he has. He did it either through a brilliant manoeuvre or a brilliant piece of negotiation—actually, I do not think that. I would like to ascribe it to Senator Cormann, but I think they just rolled. I think he got handed it on a plate and was smart enough to take it, because I do not think the Greens would have negotiated this in a fair negotiation. I think they are desperate for relevancy and, as such, they have chosen this course. The question, however, is: for what reason would they do this? Was it simply a case of, as I have described, bad negotiation or sharp negotiation by Senator Cormann? Was it the negotiation skills of a new, weak, inexperienced leader from the Greens? Or, as I said earlier, do they expect to get something out of this which is not transparent today?


They ought to come clean in this debate and tell the Senate what they have traded for this rollover, because we will find it at some point. It will be transparent; it will bubble up to the surface as always. These things cannot be hidden.


We have the wonderful contribution by Senator McKim. I listened to it on Monday, but I thought I would share it with you again. There is the beauty of the speech by Senator McKim. I am not wont to give other senators advice in this place—it is not my place generally—but I will comment on this. It is wonderful. This is on the exemption debate with respect to the Australian citizenship bill. He said:


This is a disgraceful abuse of parliamentary process, an outrageous collusion between the government and their mates on national security in the Labor Party. They are treating this parliament with utter contempt, and I say to the crossbenchers and I say to good longstanding senators in this place: you should stand up for the Senate here. You should vote against the motion that is currently before the Senate and give us all a chance to actually get our heads around the amendments that have been put through the House of Representatives and that appeared in the Senate only moments ago this evening.


There is the beauty of that paragraph. Within fewer than three days we had Senator McKim completely ignore what he said in the debate on Monday. The only advice I would generally give to anyone is: make sure you remember what you say from one day to the next in this place, because it will come back to bite you if you overstep the mark. He was using much rhetorical flourish that day attacking the Labor Party for being sensible with respect to national security, but he also complained bitterly about our position. Within a couple of days, we find that Senator McKim ought to come back into this place and apologise for those words.


In fact, you could read Senator McKim back into that paragraph, because it is a disgraceful abuse of the parliamentary process for the Greens and the government to come together and ram this legislation through with a dirty, outrageous deal. As he went on to say, it was an outrageous collusion between the government and the Greens with respect to that matter and they are treating the parliament with utter contempt. I say to the crossbenchers and the Labor Party: good, longstanding senators in this place should stand up for the Senate here, should vote against the bill that is currently before the Senate, give us all a chance to get our heads around proper amendments to the bill and pass a much better bill than what is currently before the Senate. That would have been a much better speech given today, following on from his contribution with respect to the earlier debate. But, no, we only get that from him.


There is still an opportunity within the debate in this place to not proceed, look at the amendments that Labor have to keep the multinationals honest in this debate and ensure that any multinational tax package is fair for all and asks all Australians to pay their fair share of tax, including the multinationals. On this side of the chamber—notwithstanding that the Greens think they might sometimes be here—we think the priority should be to shut down the loopholes that allow big multinationals to send the profits overseas. We think that the coalition's path is the wrong path. They are on the path of cutting pensions and they are on the path of making sure young Australians pay more tax, while the Greens have now sidled up to them and have completely debased themselves by enjoining with the coalition on this matter.

 (South Australia) (17:12):  I have some specific questions that I want to put to the Minister for Finance. They relate to specific questions that I put to him earlier. I understand that there will be some comprehensive responses that go to the substance of this debate, particularly in relation to the general purpose account amendments that Senator Di Natale will be moving shortly as part of the debate. It is important to get those matters on the record given that those amendments will be moved. My first question previously was: will the test for application have to be based on consolidated revenues as defined by accounting standards, the same as in the large proprietary company test in the Corporations Act?

 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (17:13):  I thank Senator Xenophon for actually asking me a question and making a contribution that relates to the bill in front of us. It is not normally my custom to provide answers in relation to somebody else's amendments—in particular when those amendments have not been moved yet. However, in the spirit of Christmas and because I feel like I have been ignored in the debate as there was the ferocious debate between Labor and the Greens, I am happy to provide the information that Senator Xenophon is seeking. In short, in answer to his question: yes, the test for application is on a consolidated revenues basis, as defined by the accounting standards. This is stated explicitly in the bill, pursuant to subsection 960-555(2A).

Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (17:16):  I am indebted today to the Greens for discovering a socioeconomic new creature. It is the blackmailer and kidnapper who distinguishes between people whose companies have $100 million and those who have $200 million. Let's be clear, the only argument the government have advanced for why we should not be doing this is based on the fact that people would be kidnapped. The Greens have managed to discover kidnappers who actually distinguish between $100 million and $200 million. You are geniuses, absolute geniuses. I want to congratulate you on that, because you are voting to accept an argument that says: people with more than $200 million are going to be kidnapped, but people who have less than $200 million are not going to be kidnapped. So I want to congratulate you on finding the socioeconomic kidnapping fraternity, because it is marvellous.

Senator CONROY:
  My apologies. I accept your admonishment, Mr Temporary Chairman.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Request your advice, Senator Conroy.




Senator CONROY:
  I do have one question for Senator Cormann. My understanding is that the Liberal party room opposed all of the $100 million upwards being removed. So, did you take this deal back to the Liberal party room, given you have a party room decision not to move from $100 million? Could I just seek clarification? Did you take this deal to cabinet and has it gone to your party room?

Let me just say that all legislation and all amendments are dealt with through the proper process in the usual way, as has happened on this occasion.

Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (17:18):  Thank you. I will take that as a 'no'. The cabinet has not considered the deal and the party has not endorsed this deal.




Senator Dastyari:
  You didn't take it to the party room.




Senator CONROY:
  I am being harassed here, Mr Temporary Chairman, particularly by Senator Dastyari, so I ask you to call him to order.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Desist from the harassment, Senator Dastyari.




Senator CONROY:
  Let me be clear, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull promised the Liberal party room that he would engage in the proper cabinet processes and the proper party room processes. What Senator Cormann has just admitted is that there was no proper party room consultation on overturning a decision made previously by the cabinet and previously by the party room.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  A point of order, resume your seat. Minister, on a point of order.




Senator Cormann:
  The point of order is that Senator Conroy is actually misleading the Senate. He is verballing what I said and inaccurately representing what I said. I did not make any such suggestion and he should desist from misleading the Senate.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Thank you. I am sure Senator Conroy will amend.




Senator CONROY:
  That was not a point of order at all. What has become apparent here, as Senator Cormann knows, is that an existing party room vote has been overturned by his deal with the Greens, and they have not gone back to the party room. You have not gone back to the party room to get approval to change the position of the party room. The processes that Prime Minister Turnbull put in place have been, as usual, rode over roughshod. The backbench party members are deeply unhappy about lack of process. Some of them are so unhappy that they have defected to the Queensland National Party. What a success you guys are. You are on a tare.


You have overturned your cabinet decision and you have overturned your party room decision. I just wanted to make sure, and confirm through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, that it is on the public record that this deal, which overturns an existing Liberal party room position, is not approved by the cabinet of Australia or by the Liberal party room. No-one has been given an opportunity to say what they think. No-one has been given an opportunity to make an argument against the deal that has been done. I can understand, Senator Cormann, when you get a mug who is going to accept the purchase of the Sydney Harbour Bridge from you, you have to try to ram it through quickly. The Liberal party room has been treated with contempt by the ministers involved in these discussions. I wanted to make sure that was on the record.


I now want to address some untruths—some misleading of the Senate that has taken place in the last hour or so. It is quite embarrassing when you have a guilty conscience and you want to distract people from the fact that you have just sold your soul and sold out on everything you have campaigned for for two years, and overturned your own party and platform's position and what you have been seeking to do; I understand you would want to try and distract. So you want to fabricate history. Senator Whish-Wilson, the story you have attempted to tell and the story you are telling those poor, upset, ordinary Australians—or possibly even your branch members—when they have phoned your offices is untrue. Okay? Untrue.


So I want to put this on the public record. Firstly, as you well know, I was not here—I was overseas on a delegation when the debate took place. So do not try and represent that there were not people in the Labor Party willing to speak on this issue. That is the first point.


Secondly, and more importantly, as Senator Dastyari has said, and I will not need to speak for him because he will be speaking shortly, you have absolutely fabricated—Mr Temporary Chairman, could you ask Senator Heffernan to take his seat, please—




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Back
):  I will indeed, Senator Conroy.




Senator CONROY:
  fabricated—no, no; his seat.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  I think that is a fair request of you, Senator Heffernan. Would you move over to your seat. Senator Conroy is being distracted, and the last thing we need is a furthering of his distraction. Senator Conroy, please proceed.




Senator CONROY:
  Thank you, Mr Temporary Chairman.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Senator Heffernan! Would you please go over to your seat. In the meantime you are disrupting proceedings.




Senator CONROY:
  He is disrupting deliberately, but ask him to sit down.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Senator Conroy, proceed.




Senator CONROY:
  So the Greens know full well—particularly Senator Whish-Wilson, who has incorrectly stated that he was in the chair, knows full well—that he actually asked Labor to help bring the vote on. And then the bill collapsed—actually, a bill collapsed, and it was brought on suddenly—




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  What? How could I do that?




Senator CONROY:
  No, it was not your fault. No, I did not say, 'You collapsed the bill.' The bill being debated beforehand collapsed, and then there was confusion in the chamber about what happened, and a vote was put, and nothing was recorded. There was not a desire by the Labor senators not to speak on this bill, as Senator Whish-Wilson is attempting to portray. This is a complete and utter fabrication that you are constructing to distract from your guilty conscience. Well, you are not going to get away with this. I know Senator Dastyari is going to speak at some considerable length on this particular issue so that the truth is on Hansard, not the fabrications that you have put onto the Hansard today. When you pick up the phone and answer, you are not going to be able to say, 'See what I said on Hansard,' because the truth will be on Hansard, not what you are attempting to portray as the truth. You have a guilty conscience, Senator Whish-Wilson, and I understand that. Sorry, my apologies.




Senator Heffernan:
  Mr Temporary Chairman, I rise on a point of order. The point of order I would like to make is that I want to make sure it will also be on Hansard that these characters—



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Is this a point of order or a debating point?




Senator Heffernan:
  described these people, the Greens, as 'lickspittles' today, which I think is disgusting.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Thank you, Senator Heffernan. That is not a point of order.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Mr Temporary Chairman, I rise on a point of order. It is relevant, Chair. Senator Conroy is addressing me directly. He should be addressing you in the chair.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Thank you; I will take on that point of order. Thank you, Senator Conroy. Please continue. I know you will continue to address Senator Whish-Wilson through the chair.




Senator CONROY:
  I accept your admonishment, Mr Temporary Chairman. I have strayed again. I did not realise that poor Senator Whish-Wilson was such a tender soul. I had come to know him as slightly more robust than that.




Senator Heffernan:
  Mr Temporary Chairman, I rise on a point of order. I just want to make it abundantly clear: the senator over here who is doing the speaking, Conroy, is not a boofhead.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Sit down, Senator Heffernan. It is not a point of order. Senator Conroy, please continue.




Senator CONROY:
  We are actually in committee, just for the record—



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  We are.




Senator CONROY:
  so it is a slightly different process.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Absolutely. No problem.




Senator CONROY:
  I understand a guilty conscience when I see one, Senator Whish-Wilson. I understand a guilty conscience. But you do not get to come in here and fabricate history. The Labor Party has campaigned hard on this. Senator Whish-Wilson, I will do my best to avoid revealing private conversations, but I was gratified by what you said to me when I made a contribution on this debate the last time it was in the chamber. I was gratified. What I did not know was that you were a wolf in sheep's clothing—that you were planning on actually thanking me so you could sell me out a few weeks later. But I do actually have a question: were you even invited to the meeting last night? My understanding is that they did not let you go. They did not let you go, did they? Oh dear! It's classic!




Senator Heffernan:
  Mr Temporary Chairman, I rise on a point of order. I am sorry, but if we are going to go silly, why aren't you insisting that this is not a personal conversation but should be addressed through the chair?




Senator Conroy:
  We are in committee, you idiot!



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Senator Heffernan, you have made your point. I accept it. We are in committee. Senator Conroy is in order.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Mr Temporary Chairman, I rise on a point of order. I do not think Senator Conroy is in order, Mr Temporary Chairman. He just called Senator Heffernan an idiot. You withdraw it!




Senator CONROY:
  I withdraw. I know Senator Heffernan is not a tender soul, but I am happy to withdraw. But I want it on the record: the Greens have just defended Senator Heffernan!



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN interjecting—




Senator CONROY:
  I really want to make sure it is on the record. Senator Heffernan protects the Greens; the Greens protect Senator Heffernan. I am with the program. Don't worry—we're with the program!


But I do think it is sad that you were not even invited to the meeting last night, Senator Whish-Wilson. You were not even invited into the room to make the case that you wanted to make. That is the sad part: when your leader runs rogue on you and leaves you sitting outside the door while he is inside, trying to pretend he is a mover and shaker and that he can get an outcome so that he can make himself important. Welcome, Senator McKim. I am not surprised that you are taking a higher profile since you came here, because it won't be long for you, don't worry; it won't be long for you. When your membership work out what you have done today, you will be able to say: 'It wasn't me. I wasn't invited either. The brains trust up the front of the chamber—this was their idea. We campaigned for two years. We had the numbers. We campaigned and we had the numbers. We had the government over a barrel, and then Senator Di Natale took charge.' You ran a fantastic campaign—a fantastic campaign. 'We had the numbers, and then the boss sold me out. The boss wandered in, without us'—without any of you there—'and they tickled his tummy, gave him a few Tim Tams, and they sold him the Harbour Bridge!' You have had to keep looking in the mirror, saying: 'It's a good deal. It's a good deal. It's a good deal'. You have had to convince yourself so that you can come in here today.


Senator Whish-Wilson cannot rewrite history. He cannot try and pretend that Labor has not been as committed as he has on this issue. There may have been genuine mistakes and things that went wrong on the floor the first time this came through, but we all worked to try and deliver to the Australian taxpayers the truth that the big end of town do not want revealed. There is nothing you can say today that will change the fact that you have accepted an argument that people whose companies earn over $200 million are in fear of being kidnapped if the truth was revealed! That is the only argument the government put forward, and you have now swallowed it and signed up to it. Even Senator Muir, a relative newcomer to the chamber, accepted, when he heard how silly that argument was, that it had to be changed. It had to be changed. But you, Senator Whish-Wilson, always knew that it was a complete and utter load of rubbish. 


Apparently, your leader did not. Apparently, your leader fell for it. You let him out of your sight for five minutes and he has sold you down the drain. I could at least have some respect for your leader if he had invited you to come to the meeting. Were you afraid that he would embarrass you, Senator Di Natale? Were you afraid that Senator Whish-Wilson might actually not be quite so willing to roll over? I mean, really! You did not take your shadow spokesperson to this most important meeting even though he has campaigned on this for two years. To not be invited by your leader to the meeting, Senator Whish-Wilson—




Senator Dastyari:
  He is apologising now!




Senator CONROY:
  There is no point showing him some Twitter feed to try and pretend that people are on your side, Senator Di Natale. Let me promise you, they are not on your side. Your members are not on your side. They know a sell-out when they see it. They can smell a sell-out, and no amount of convincing yourselves each morning in the mirror for the next six months—'we didn't sell out; we didn't sell out'. You will have to keep telling yourselves that because your members will know. Your members will know by Christmas that you protected the big end of town, that you caved in when you had the numbers. It was not like it was in the balance. We had said 'no'.



And I was very offended by something you said earlier. I have spoken on it already, Senator Whish-Wilson, but I do not think you were here. You were pretending that we were somehow on the verge of selling out, and you took the deal before we did—Senator Whish-Wilson, that one was beneath you. You are better than that. We had absolutely, emphatically rejected the offer last night—rejected it. It was a joke.



Honourable senators interjecting—




Senator CONROY:
  Yes, they made us an offer last night—they picked up the phone—and we said 'no'. You mugs picked up the phone and said 'yes'. You picked up the phone and said 'yes'. We rejected it last night. They kept coming back and knocking on our door, so don't you fabricate history by trying to justify your behaviour by saying that we were on the verge—



Senator Cormann interjecting—




Senator CONROY:
  You were not on the phone call. We were not on the verge—



A government senator interjecting— 




Senator CONROY:
  You were not even on the phone call—unless, you are keeping track of Mr Morrison's phone calls!



A government senator interjecting—




Senator CONROY:
  Oh, yes, absolutely! There are those of you who will have to try and justify protecting the biggest private companies in this country when you had the numbers. It is not that there was a negotiation and it was in the mix—that there might have been a win here and there might have been a loss there. We had the numbers. We actually got together and got the numbers, and we got an outcome where the government was over a barrel. And you blinked. You let them off the hook. You blinked!




Senator Dastyari:
  One night with Scotty!




Senator CONROY:
  It does not bear thinking about! You blinked. You will not be able to get away from the fact that we had the numbers to get a much, much better outcome than this and you blinked. Stop trying to justify it by saying that they were not going to do it; that this is better than nothing. We could have got better than this, and you blinked. You know it; you blinked. Because your genius leader decided he would not invite you and would not let you actually have the debate with the Treasurer—he was too embarrassed to have you in the room or whatever the excuse was—you blinked. There is no way to hide the fact that the numbers in this chamber were on your side. Two years of work, and you blinked and you let this government off the hook. We would have got a better outcome if you had a spine, a bit of backbone and a bit of political courage. That was not shown by your leader when he left you behind and went off and negotiated with the Treasurer.


Let me be very clear: when Senator Cormann knocks on your door and says that he has another harbour bridge to sell you, you have already bought it! You do not have to buy it a second time. You have already bought it. At least make him sell you the gateway bridge!

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2015-12-03,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (17:36):  Is that is the best you have? We heard about one-week-old kale—I feel like I have been slapped by one-week-old kale! That is the best you have! All the faux outrage in the world. You are so committed to tax transparency that you were about to sign onto an hours motion that would have ditched it and kicked it down the road. You had no commitment to this issue. You were going to sign on to a hours motion that did not have the multinational tax avoidance bill in it. It did not even have it in the hours motion. You are so committed to this issue!




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Senator Heffernan on a point of order.




Senator Heffernan:
  He made the point—smart alec here cannot say things like that.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  That is not a point of order.




Senator DI NATALE:
  So committed is the Labor Party to tax transparency that when they negotiated the hours motion for today it was not even on the agenda. They are so committed to it. They think it is so important that when they had the opportunity to talk with the coalition and insist on what legislation should be debated today, no, it was not on the agenda. Do you know what that would have done? It would have meant for companies like Serco: another year off scot-free—don't publish your affairs. Glencore: another year—don't worry about it, we'll let you off the hook. News Limited: who would have thought that the Labor Party would be out there defending the tax affairs of News Limited? Who would have thought it? But here we have the Labor Party saying to News Limited, 'You pay whatever tax you like, because we are not coming after you.'


Let's have a look at some of their donors. Ingham Chicken, one of the companies that will be captured as a result of the Greens amendment, a huge donor to the ALP: 'No, we don't want you to pay your tax affairs. No, let's go quiet. We are doing an hour's motion today. We'll make sure multinational tax avoidance isn't even debated today in the parliament.' Pratt Holdings, another private company, and the second-largest donor on the grandfathered list of the ALP and the Liberal Party: 'No, let's go quiet today. We'll make a big deal of it but we will kick the can down the road. You can continue not publishing how much tax you pay.'


Then we hear about 7-Eleven—the outrage of the 7-Eleven workers. What would the 7-Eleven workers say now that we hear that 7-Eleven will not have to disclose their tax affairs? They do not even understand their own legislation. 7-Eleven is on the list. They will be voting against 7-Eleven from declaring their tax affairs. That is what they will be doing. That is what the Labor Party will be doing.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Senator Heffernan on a point of order.




Senator Heffernan:
  I note that Senator Dastyari has fled the chamber and Senator Conroy has joined the Greens for God's sake!



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  There is no point of order.




Senator DI NATALE:
  Let us just put a few facts on the table. To those punters at home who were confused by all the huff and bluster and all the theatre and so on, let us be clear about what the situation is at the moment. At the moment those multinational companies do not have to disclose their affairs. At the moment, 281 of Australia's richest private companies do not have to tell the Australian public how much tax they pay. We walk away from today without passing this legislation and those big multinational tax avoiders get off scot-free. The Labor Party wants to shout from the sidelines and yell at the coalition about how terrible the coalition is on multinational tax avoidance, and do nothing about it. That is what the Labor Party wants to do. They want to shout from the sidelines and run up to an election saying, 'You guys are terrible,' but when they have the chance to pass legislation to do something about it they are missing in action. That is the Labor Party's tactic on this issue. Well, we are not going to buy it. We have a responsibility in this place, when we can, to get outcomes for people.


Here we have today an opportunity to ensure that companies like Serco, like Glencore, like News Limited, like Johnson & Johnson, like Pfizer, like Unilever all have to disclose their general purpose accounts, which means we know exactly how they structure their affairs and how much tax they are not paying. If we do not pass this legislation those companies get off scot-free. That is what the Labor Party wants to do today. How shameful that we have private companies, companies like Transfield, the organisation that has been contracted to run our detention centre network, worth billions of dollars, and the Labor Party is saying to them, 'Don't worry, we don't want you to disclose your tax affairs to the Australian community.' That is what the Labor Party is saying today.


Some facts need to be laid down on the table. If we do nothing today, do you know what tax transparency we have? Zero, zilch, nada, nothing. We have the opportunity to disclose the affairs of those multinational tax avoiders by passing this legislation.


Senator Conroy says, 'We had the numbers.' Well, he needs a lesson on how democracy works in Australia. There is something called the Lower House, and the government has control of the Lower House. The government has said they will not pass that legislation, and we get another year where we have those big companies that do not disclose their affairs, so that the Labor Party have an issue to campaign on right up to the next election. Well, do you know what? I want outcomes. I want to get things done. Our party wants outcomes. That is why we together made a consensus decision to ensure that these laws would be passed.


The government's bill ensures that next year, consistent with the G20 arrangements, we have country by country reporting. Without the passage of these laws we do not get it—another year where these companies are off scot-free. This legislation will double the penalties that these tax dodgers face by disclosing their affairs. It gives the ATO increased powers. We have the opportunity to do that right now, today, by passing this legislation, and the Labor Party is saying, 'No, let's do nothing. Let's just shout from the sidelines.' Well, we are not shouting from the sidelines. We are rolling up our sleeves and we are making sure that these companies pay their fair share.


I also want to say thank you to the Labor Party. The Labor Party today put out an email where they have said to their members and supporters, 'Contact the Greens office, contact Richard Di Natale, and tell him what you think.' Well, thank you very much. We have a scoreboard in the office right now. Can I tell you about the scoreboard? We are running at 95 per cent conversion rate. People are ringing up and complaining about what we have supposedly done, according to the ALP, so we have a conversation with them and let them know what is actually happening in the Senate, and nine out of 10 people who were previously supporters of Labor are now voting for the Greens at the next election. My request to the Labor Party: can you put another one out tomorrow? Put another one out, please. We love it. It is terrific. Thank you very much. We are thrilled.


Apparently, by not passing multinational tax avoidance we have less money to spend on schools and hospitals. Let's have a look at the logic here. The logic is that if we do not pass legislation that forces multinationals to disclose their tax, that gives increased powers to the ATO, and that ensures private companies disclose their tax affairs, there is less money for schools and hospitals. Thank you very much—what a gift! Where is the brains trust who thought that one up? Terrific—we love it. It is a great opportunity.


And we have the Tax Justice Network—the people who have been leading this campaign, who triggered it off, who said years ago to those people in this place: 'Something has to be done around multinational tax avoidance. We need you to do something on multinational tax avoidance.' We listened. We referred the issue to a Senate inquiry. The reason we are having this debate is that the Greens led the charge and referred it to a Senate inquiry. We did that and, as a result of that, we have laws from this government—one of the few decent pieces of legislation put to this parliament that we have been able to amend and to strengthen to ensure that we give more powers to those organisations that are pursuing multinational tax dodgers. We are getting more transparency for private companies, we are getting more transparency for those multinationals and we are going to ensure that we listen to the Tax Justice Network, who today have said, 'What a great step forward for transparency.' This is a step forward for transparency. Year-by-year, country-by-country reporting will get underway this year. This legislation will ensure that happens.


You have a choice in this business: you can throw rocks from the sidelines, you can try and gee people up and do nothing, or you can roll your sleeves up and get an outcome. You had the option to decide what you wanted to do, and yesterday, when you were negotiating with this government on what you thought were the priority pieces of legislation, where was multinational tax avoidance? Where was it? Nowhere. It was not on the government's business for today and next year, kicking the can down the road. Well, we did something. For all the faux outrage, for all the anger, for all the theatrics, there is a key lesson here. When you are in this place you get outcomes. You have an opportunity to ensure that you listen to those people who have campaigned on these issues and you ensure that what you get is companies like Transfield, like Grocon, like Inghams chicken—big donors to the Labor Party, let me tell you—like Pratt Holdings, like Meriton and like 7-Eleven, and you ensure that they disclose the amount of tax that they pay. We have stopped multinationals like News Limited, like Glencore, like BMW and like big pharma from filing flimsy financial reports and forced them to provide the details that ensure that we can keep a close eye on them, because transparency is critical. Transparency is absolutely fundamental in this. We have taken a good piece of legislation and we have made it better.


We hear, 'What about those other 600 companies?' At the moment they do not have to declare one cent—not one cent. As a result of this legislation, 281 companies are now declaring how much tax they paid.



Senator Dastyari interjecting—




Senator DI NATALE:
  I hear the faux outrage from Senator Dastyari. He does not like this deal. Do you know why he does not like this deal? He does not like this outcome for the Australian community. Do you know why he does not like it? Because he has not been able to feed it to his mates in the press gallery and to stand up and start grandstanding about how he is leading the charge. He is missing in action. The man is missing in action. He is all huff, all bluster and no substance—all tip and no iceberg. This is a man who is more intent on grandstanding and shouting from the sidelines than on delivering outcomes. Well, we believe in outcomes. That is why we have supported this legislation—and not just supported it, but strengthened it and amended it—and ensured that multinationals, huge private companies, finally declare how much tax they are not paying. We know that is a driver to more transparency and to ensuring that those companies change their arrangements and justify to the Australian community why they are not paying their fair share of tax.


Ultimately we know that in this place it is a bubble, but out there the Australian community, as a result of the passage of this legislation, will know that finally the Australian parliament has taken some huge strides forward in terms of going after those companies that are not paying their fair share. We have a choice: again, the Labor Party can run a GST campaign, they can talk about multinational tax avoidance, they can talk about those things and do nothing; or, if we are going to pay for schools, if we are going to pay for hospitals, if we are going to pay for the services that the Australian community wants and deserves, then we need a fairer tax system. A fairer tax system means going after multinational tax avoiders, not shielding them. It means going after them. It means ensuring you end unfair tax breaks like superannuation tax concessions, like the huge fossil fuel subsidies to the mining industry—another Labor party gift to Gina Rinehart and her ilk. We have a choice. We can have a fairer tax base, and the way to achieve that is through measures that go after the tax dodgers, the big end of town—measures that go after those high-wealth individuals who use superannuation, negative gearing and capital gains tax reform as a tax break.


It is the Greens who are leading the economic debate in this country. It is the Greens who are now showing what is necessary to ensure that we balance our budget, that we address some of the structural challenges in Australia's budget. We are leading the charge to making the country fairer and more decent, to raising revenue and to ensuring that schools and hospitals are funded. You guys can shout from the sidelines, but we are in the business of rolling our sleeves up and getting it done, and we will continue to do it. This is just the start. The next stop with transparency is to ensure that we get more companies brought in under this legislation, that we give more powers to the ATO, that we resource ASIC and the Taxation Office, and that we finally make some progress towards getting a fairer tax base so that we can have the community that the Australian people deserve.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2015-12-03,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (17:51):  I rise to express a personal view in which I support the pursuit of multinationals who are avoiding the Australian taxation system, but I also flag with the Senate that I am unable to support this legislation if it is successful in having an amendment about the disclosure of tax affairs of private companies published on the ATO website. I want to explain why I have come to this position. About 18 months ago, I was made aware of a circumstance where private companies' tax affairs were going to be disclosed on the ATO's website. It was Labor Party policy. I raised that with some ministers in my own party. They undertook to examine repealing it and that happened a few weeks ago. The work done by Josh Frydenberg and others in that respect was valued. That decision went to our party room and the party room unanimously endorsed it and hence it was shepherded through both houses of parliament.


That policy decision has never been revisited in our party room. It has never been discussed at any level that I am aware of and I first became aware of it this morning when I asked what the price of the deal was with the Greens party for the passage of this amendment.




Senator Dastyari:
  What's the price?




Senator BERNARDI:
  The price was, indeed, this overturning of a party room decision, something that I feel very strongly about. So why I not be supporting the amendment to disclose the tax affairs of private companies. If it is successful, I will not be supporting the passage of this bill. I regret that it has come to this, but the circumstances are the party room have undertaken a position. 


I commend the minister who was responsible for it and for shepherding it through this place—Josh Frydenberg worked very hard. To have this sprung on us at the last minute, I think, is not in the best interests of my party and the procedures and policies we work with. I regret very much it has come to this and I also regret the Labor Party will make merry hay over this. It is not about that; it is really about the principles and the processes that need to be endorsed.

"Muir, Sen Ricky",AMEP,2015-12-03,"



Senator MUIR
 (Victoria) (17:54):  I hope we are getting towards the end of this. The Leader of the Greens does not have much voice left. 




Senator Conroy:
  Voice and integrity.




Senator MUIR:
  Just stay there, please, Senator Conroy, you do need to listen to what I have to say. I rise to talk about some amendments that I am moving today on the Tax Laws Amendment (Combating Multinational Tax Avoidance) Bill 2015. I intend on moving two amendments. In an effort to save time during this debate, I would like to discuss them both now as they are related. Right from the start of this debate, my concerns have been directly related to the issue of privacy. This should be no surprise to those who have been following my work to hear this. My amendment will ensure that a successful small business is not unintentionally caught up in this legislation. My amendment in this area seeks to use the existing definition under the Corporations Act as a safety net. 


The Corporations Act has a distinction between large and small proprietary companies. That distinction determines which businesses must disclose their financial information publicly. This disclosure is made via the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, otherwise known as ASIC. ASIC then publish this information on their website and it is available to the public for a small fee. Only large proprietary companies have this disclosure obligation to ASIC; small proprietary companies are exempt. I sought to apply this standard to these amendments to ensure that if a limited view of the company's tax information were to be displayed by the ATO, the full financial picture would be then available via ASIC. This was to minimise the risk of any public misunderstanding. 


In addition to this, I also sought to educate the public viewing this information, that the full financial information is required to better understand what they were looking at on the ATO website. I sought to do this via a disclaimer on the ATO website. I even went as far as requiring a direct website link to the full financial information on the ASIC website. This was all done in an attempt to present this information in a fair and balanced way.


I have attempted to work with the government and the Greens on these issues today. I had been hopeful that the Greens and the government could see the common sense in this. I do think that the government see merit in this, and probably support it, but due to the deal with the Greens, they cannot. I would have thought that the government would be supportive of an amendment that limits the number of businesses that would be captured by the tax transparency laws but, to my surprise, they do not. This is a significant shift. Who would have thought that it would be me, a senator from the Motoring Enthusiast Party, standing up for small proprietary companies in the face of government opposition. This leads me to the second amendment that I will be moving to this bill.


During my research into this topic, I became aware of a 20-year-old transitional provision, referred to as grandfathering. Around 1,500 private companies enjoy an exemption from disclosing financial information to ASIC when they meet the large proprietary company test. It is my understanding that this provision was intended to only last three years, to allow these companies to transition their accounting practices to those required by ASIC. Rather than enforcing this transition period, governments from both sides have decided to keep this loophole in place. 


It is also my understanding that there is a bit of a black market in the trading of the grandfathered entities because of the exemption that they enjoy. There have also been allegations made that a significant amount of these companies are not only large donors to the major political parties but also have contracts with the government. I am concerned about how this affects the transparency of politics and government in this country. The major parties, despite various commitments made over the years, have failed to resolve this issue. Therefore, it is my intent to try to clear this up today. 


I understand that the Australian Labor Party will support my amendment to remove grandfathering. I also understand that the Australian Greens would like to as well, but they are committed to the agreement with the government and are now forced to vote against this amendment. I will be very interested to see if the Australian Greens, and perhaps the government, can have a last minute change of heart. The reality is the Greens are the ones in control on this matter. They are the ones that have the bargaining power on this issue. I call on the Greens to work together on this issue and support the integrity in our country's financial disclosure laws, politics and government to close this transitional loophole.


Before I finish, the last couple of contributions I have made in this chamber have been followed by lengthy off-the-cuff-criticism from Senator Conroy. I would like to say to Senator Conroy, through you, Chair, that I hope this contribution attracts a more favourable response, and I look forward to the rest of the debate.

"Dastyari, Sen Sam",ALP,2015-12-03,"



Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (18:00):  I want to begin by—and I have got a few questions at the end of this—acknowledging a couple of the contributions that have been made. I want to acknowledge the contribution of Senator Bernardi. I do not hold the same view at all on the issue of tax transparency that Senator Bernardi holds. I acknowledge that Senator Bernardi has always come to this with a point of principle that I disagree with and, unlike others in this chamber, he has maintained that point of principle.


I also note the contribution of Senator Muir in this debate, which I think has been nothing but constructive and positive. I think, Senator Muir, your amendments are fantastic. The reality is: the major politics of this country for many years did not tackle a lot of these issues, because they were put in the too-hard basket. Frankly, I think that is a responsibility that lies across all the major parties. 


I acknowledge that we did some good things when we were in power. There were several pieces of significant legislation, but I believe that the last Labor government could have and should have gone further in some of it, and perhaps having crossbench senators such as you here at that point in time would have pressured us to do so. We are better off for having you in this chamber.


It is more amazing as this day goes by that we keep realising who has actually been duped throughout this process. It is almost everybody, Mr Chairman. The people who have been duped are: the federal cabinet, because the process, the decision and the deal were not taken to the cabinet; the Liberal Party room, who had already met, discussed this issue and reached a position, were not told about this secret deal; and the crossbench senators, who had worked with the Greens—and the Greens had played a great role, great rhetoric, on this issue over a long period of time. As I have said many times before, of the many legacies that Senator Milne left in this place highlighting this issue over many years, this is something she should be rightly very proud of.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  One you were very happy to take over.




Senator DASTYARI:
  Senator Milne was a fantastic senator and an amazing person.




Senator Cormann:
  Did you vote for her?




Senator DASTYARI:
  I never had the opportunity to. After what they have done today, I will never vote green again. The crossbench senators had been working with the government. Let's be clear: after the last round and the legislation got passed by the Senate—the tough measures, the right measures, these good amendments, the amendments the Greens at the time felt were good amendments, that we had all supported together—Senator Di Natale made it very, very clear that he was going to be insisting and their party's position was going to be insisting; and, if that position was going to change, then he would not leave everyone else hanging on a rock. 


That wasn't the case. Senator Di Natale informed me and others after they had reached agreement. Let's be very clear—




Senator Di Natale:
  You were trying to do a deal last night!




Senator DASTYARI:
  That is a lie, Senator Di Natale.



The CHAIRMAN:  Senator Dastyari, please resume your seat. The Senate will come to order. As I have made the point on a number of occasions already, we are in committee. There is no limitation to the number of contributions people can make, but only one senator should be making a contribution at any one time. Senator Dastyari, you have the call.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  On a point of order: Senator Dastyari just accused Senator Di Natale of lying, and I think he needs to withdraw that.




Senator DASTYARI:
  I withdraw.



The CHAIRMAN:  I don't think he did actually use those words. Nonetheless, Senator Dastyari has withdrawn, so thank you.




Senator DASTYARI:
  This issue of tax transparency—let's just be clear about the role of the Labor Party in this, because I think it warrants it. Yes, the Treasurer of Australia, Mr Scott Morrison, did ask the Labor Party whether or not we were prepared to negotiate on this matter. We made our position very clear: we said we would not negotiate on any point of principle or policy and, after we had been notified of that—and you know this, Senator Whish-Wilson—I made sure that you were aware of that. I said to you that they had been talking to us and that we had rejected it. We were not going to negotiate on watering down—we call it the Bradbury amendment; other people call it the 'kidnapping' bill—the piece of legislation that we all know we are talking about here. It goes by many different names but, effectively, it was the $100 million disclosure bill, which may become a $200 million disclosure bill.


The duplicity and hypocrisy that has gone on in this place and in this chamber on this piece of legislation is outrageous. I believe there was a point of principle here that had we—and we should have—stood firm for a better deal and a better outcome, we would not be exempting right now the number of companies, the 500 or 600 companies, that are now going to be exempted. 


I just want to let Senator Di Natale know of some of the companies that it appears he has let off the hook. There is Pacific Petroleum. There is the NSW Business Chamber. There is the Victoria Racing Club. There is Ego Pharmaceuticals. There is Meat & Livestock Australia. They are privately owned companies which sit somewhere between $100 million and $200 million and which now will not be under any pressure.


Let us be clear: the leverage to get a better deal was making sure that the government's measures that the government itself desperately wanted were actually using that. On this idea that we are now somehow going to get a future better deal: no, the leverage is gone. The government's position has actually been consistent on this front. I do not begrudge the government. If I could get these kinds of deals out of the Greens, I would be doing it all the time. Unlike the government, I would be taking it to my party room and I would be taking it through a proper party process. It is unbelievable that, in the world of Malcolm Turnbull and this whole good-government process, all of a sudden we find out that they are not taking these matters to the party room and they are not taking these matters to cabinet, but I imagine that is an internal matter for the Liberal Party. They can discuss it over cake in the monkeypod room.


It takes one night for the Greens to go limp. It takes one night for them to fold completely on this matter. One night with Scotty, one night with the Treasurer, and the world is their oyster. It takes one night, and Senator Di Natale will fold on every matter. It has not even been a one-night stand. They could not even get past question time together. You cannot even call it a one-night stand. There are three parties involved. There are the Greens. There are the Nats. There are the Libs. I think in the Greens party they call that group love! But they do not even make it through a day. They cannot even make it through a day.


What they have done here is that they have sold out for a cheap, quickie deal done dirty on the table of the Treasurer. You should be appalled. The fact that you are prepared to sell out tax transparency under some desperate, pathetic desire to try to claw some kind of economic relevance—and let us be clear about what Senator Di Natale has actually said. The position, he said, is this: 'If the government tell us they're not going to pass something in the lower house, we can't possibly stand firm and try to fight for things here in the Senate.' That is their position. That is the principle. The principle is: 'We will be dictated to. We will be dictated to by what the government tell us they are prepared to do and not do.' What a pathetically weak party to be doing that! What is the point of principle? What is the point of principle in that matter? What is the point of principle there?


The senator goes on. His position is this: 'But we got something! But we got something!' Well, as Adele would have said, you could have had it all. You could have had it all, Senator Di Natale. If it took you more than one night, if it took more than one night to get you, you could have had it all. And that is what you have gone ahead and done on a quick deal.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  You're just jealous you didn't get it!




Senator DASTYARI:
  Oh, no. No, no, no.



Senator Conroy interjecting—




Senator DASTYARI:
  That is right! No, unlike you, Senator Whish-Wilson, tonight I will not need to bathe in kerosene. Unlike you, I will not need to be bathing in kerosene tonight!



The CHAIRMAN:  Senator Dastyari, just resume your seat for a minute. I think it is time that we maybe just review where we are at the present time. I would ask senators to be considering the comments that they make in the chamber. Senator Dastyari, you have the call.



Senator Heffernan interjecting—



The CHAIRMAN:  Sit back down, Senator Dastyari. Really, Senator Heffernan, that advice also applies to you.



Senator Heffernan interjecting—



The CHAIRMAN:  I do not care. The advice applies to you.




Senator DASTYARI:
  I just want to say that it is not as if the Greens have been penniless. I want to note that I believe that Graeme Wood no longer owns Wotif. I believe that Graeme Wood has actually sold Wotif. That is my understanding. It is funny to note, though, that that is a firm that has $149.69 million revenue turnover—the largest ever donor to the Liberal Party.



An honourable senator:  The Greens.




Senator DASTYARI:
  The Greens, sorry. It is the largest single donation that has ever been given to a political party by an individual, as I understand it. But they are the types of companies, the types of private companies, the types of individuals, who will now have their disclosure requirements lowered.


I want to draw everyone's attention and the Senate's attention to the importance of tax transparency, the importance of staying firm, the importance of not selling out. You do not need to take my word for it. You can take Senator Richard Di Natale's words in the additional comments he provided, signed by him.



Senator Di Natale interjecting—




Senator DASTYARI:
  Oh, the words were fantastic; it is the actions that were dirty! Your words are always sweet. You are a great speaker. It is all eloquent. It is well written. You have some fantastic staff. People like Jay and Fraser, who actually stand up and believe in these issues, have done a great job writing this for you. The fact is: you have walked into this place, and tonight you are going to be selling all of it out. You are selling out the principles of transparency that you went for so strongly in your own statement. I am not going to have time to read all of this into the Hansard. I am not going to be using the opportunity afforded to me tonight to do so. But I do urge anyone who is listening who is interested in this issue—and I assume there is at least one person out there—to go onto the website and have a look at the additional comments and compare what Senator Di Natale has said on points of principle and how he has behaved.


At the heart of the argument that has been made by the Australian Greens is a lie. There is a lie at the heart of the argument because at the heart of the argument they are putting is that, firstly, any deal is better than no deal, which is a straw man, a false argument that does not stand the test of reality. It is a false argument that has been made. Let us be clear. They say, 'Oh, if we didn't do this, it was all going to fall over.' No. What is actually the fact is this. The government needed and wanted to get their legislation through. This was Joe Hockey's legacy legislation. On one night, with a brief meeting, in a secret room in the Treasurer's office, without key members of your own team present, you fold; you roll over; you are desperate to do it; you are in love with the idea of being some kind of a doormat.


You are going to give the Nationals a run for their money. The way the Nationals are going at the moment, they are going to be double or triple the size of you by the time they have finished, with these Libs defecting. You are learning from their experience about how to be a doormat. You have actually folded and you have given up, and, rather than using the leverage to get the best possible deal on tax transparency, at the first opportunity, the first deal you got, the first chance to fold, you folded. You folded as quickly as you could. You gave up instantaneously. You did not put up any kind of a fight. You did not put up any kind of a principle. You did not say: 'Hang on. How do we get the best possible deal? How do we get the best possible outcome? How do we stand firm for the principles that we have been standing firm on, not just by ourselves but with crossbench senators, with Labor senators, with cross-party, with community groups, with trade unions and with activists?' You said, 'No, the first deal we get, the first chance, we're so desperate to appease a conservative, right-wing government we will fold.' And fold you did, and quickly. It is disappointing, and it is disgusting.


In concluding—because I am very conscious of time—I am going to say something very briefly about Senator Whish-Wilson. I have to say I am utterly, utterly disappointed in the position that Senator Whish-Wilson has taken in this. I will never know the truth of this, but I do not believe this is the type of decision or the type of selling-out move that someone like Senator Whish-Wilson would otherwise do. He is a person of principle and a person of integrity. He is a person I have had the opportunity to work with very closely through the Senate economics committee process. He is someone I hold in the highest regard, and, frankly, I have to say, Senator Whish Wilson, you are a lot better than this.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Mr Chairman, I rise on a point of order.



The CHAIRMAN:  I do need to give the minister priority.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (18:16):  I am rising to respond to the issues that were raised by Senator Muir. The government will not support the amendments proposed by Senator Muir on behalf of the Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party in relation to either the reporting of information about corporate tax entities or the so-called grandfathering arrangements. The government is committed to tax transparency, but it does not believe these proposed amendments contribute to a fairer or more transparent tax system beyond what the government already supports.


The existing measures which the government has in place, in addition to the action being taken by the government currently around disclosure, achieve the right balance for disclosure and transparency. The proposed amendments from the Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party in relation to reporting of information about corporate tax entities inserts a definition of 'private companies' based on a definition of large proprietary companies in the Corporations Act. This adds further complexity to the rules around disclosure that do not further the purpose of the transparency rules. As such, the government does not believe these proposed amendments are necessary and therefore shall not be supporting that particular set of amendments.


The government also does not support the amendments proposed in relation to the so-called grandfathering arrangements. This government does not support the removing of grandfathering of proprietary companies, which has been in place for decades. The grandfathering of these entities was a policy that had bipartisan support for decades because without it the new disclosure rules at the time could potentially disrupt commercial activities. The grandfathering of exempted proprietary companies was done to avoid disrupting businesses which would have established themselves under other business forms if they had known they would have additional compliance and reporting requirements which might be subsequently introduced.


The removal of the exemption for large exempt proprietary companies was considered in 2001 by the Parliamentary Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities and again in 2006 by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer. The government does not support amending these rules on the fly as part of this critical piece of tax integrity legislation. This issue has been extensively considered in the past and decisions made to keep the current arrangements in place. The government therefore does not support this amendment either.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2015-12-03,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:19):  I want to speak very briefly to Senator Muir's amendments. In relation to the grandfathering clause amendment I do support that amendment. It is interesting to note that in the context of this debate the information about those so-called grandfathered companies that are able to have their information kept secret from the Australian public was only disclosed after the debate, and I think that it is appropriate that it became a live issue after that and that this is an appropriate bill in which to deal with this amendment.


I note that despite what the minister says there have been a number of views within the Public Service, as I understand, in the tax office and the Treasury. I will be corrected as to who actually said this, but my understanding is that there were concerns that the grandfathering arrangement was outdated and needed to be reformed, so I will support Senator Muir in relation to that amendment.


On reflection I will support Senator Muir in relation to his other amendment for small, private companies, because this applies to what are defined as not large proprietary companies. If a company fulfils two out of the three criteria—either less than $25 million in turnover, assets of less than $12½ million or fewer than 50 employees—I do not think it is unreasonable that they be exempt from that provision. The minister is right. We are doing things not in the most satisfactory of circumstances and doing things on the run, but I think that it is a worthy amendment, so I will be supporting both the amendments from Senator Muir.

We support the principle and we congratulate Senator Muir for raising this issue, but we will not be supporting his amendment tonight.

Senator DASTYARI:
  Thank you. I am going to keep my remarks here very brief. I believe we have had a very long general discussion that has actually tackled a lot of the issues relating to these amendments. I want to make it clear to the Senate, however, what is about to go on here. This is the amendment moved in the name of Senator Di Natale which removes the amendments that had been earlier added to this legislation by the Greens and replaces them with what will be in our opinion—or, I think, a matter of fact—a watered down version in relation to the matter of the threshold but also in relation to the matter of the SP reporting.


Are these the amendments that relate to the threshold being changed from what was earlier $100 million and also the SP reporting, or is it jus the SP reporting?

Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (18:25):  I think you are confused. This relates to global entities. This in fact is absolutely consistent with the amendment that was put to the Senate previously. It requires multinationals with a turnover of over $1 billion to ensure that they file detailed general purpose accounts. This is an important amendment. It ensures greater transparency and it is the reason that this amendment has been put to this legislation.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (18:26):  To assist Senator Dastyari and the chamber: it is, of course, exactly as Senator Di Natale has just indicated. This amendment requires incorporated significant global entities with revenues above $1 billion to prepare general purpose accounts on a group or individual entity basis. General purpose accounts may be prepared on a grouped domestic basis or on a global grouped basis and general purpose accounts must be lodged with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.


The government, as we have said on the record for some time, believe that this bill, as it was introduced, is an important integrity measure. It is an important measure in the fight against multinational tax avoidance. We would have preferred if this bill had passed unamended, but, in order to facilitate the passage of this important piece of legislation tonight, the government have agreed not to oppose this amendment moved by Senator Di Natale.

"Dastyari, Sen Sam",ALP,2015-12-03,"



Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (18:27):  I thank the minister for clarifying that. I think there is going to be a series of different amendments. I believe a lot of this confusion would have been avoided if these were amendments that we had not received on the day and we had had an opportunity to properly examine at an earlier point time.


My understanding is that this is the amendment that initially had been added to the legislation. It was proposed by Senator Xenophon when this bill first came to the Senate. The government has now taken the drafting of the Senate clerks and replaced it with wording that had been written by Treasury. There is a serious concern that those of us on this side of the chamber have that this is a watered down version of what was initially moved by Senator Xenophon. Unfortunately, getting to the bottom of the significance of the changes that have been proposed has not been an opportunity afforded to us, because this dirty deal was done last night and these are amendments that were shown to the House only a few hours ago. Because of that, the Labor Party cannot and does not have confidence. While some of the language may only have minor impacts, the concern is that some of it—particularly things relating to corporate tax entities being Australian residents or having Australian permanent establishments in order to file a general purpose financial statement—means that this amendment may not be able to capture firms like Google, Apple, Microsoft and major technology companies. These are big issues. These are big concerns. Frankly, we are concerned that, in the rush of drafting this amendment, we do not have confidence it has got it right.


I hope the Greens do realise that it actually puts off the reporting by almost three years because of the 2016 start date. It puts it off by almost three years because of the late period in which companies can start to report. But, I have to say, I have more faith in Senator Xenophon than I do in some of the government's and the ministerial drafting. I trust Senator Xenophon more, and, as such, the Labor Party will be voting to insist on the initial amendment as drafted by Senator Xenophon.

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2015-12-03,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (18:30):  Just to be clear about this amendment, it ensures that, if you are a big multinational company with a turnover of $1 billion, you have to publish detailed financial general purpose accounts. This amendment ensures that companies like News Limited, Glencore, and the big pharma companies like Pfizer and so on all have to publish detailed financial accounts.




Senator Dastyari:
  What about Google? Senator Xenophon's amendment does that.



The CHAIRMAN:  Order!




Senator DI NATALE:
  This ensures that we get those companies with a turnover of over $1 billion to publish detailed financial accounts. I have to say it is hugely disappointing to hear that the Labor Party are going to vote against an amendment which ensures that there is transparency around the financial accounts of those huge multinational companies. We have an opportunity here to support an amendment to the government's legislation that ensures that those companies with a billion dollar turnover publish detailed financial accounts.


So just to explain: at the moment, you can apply to the tax office to publish what is called a special purpose account. In simple terms, you do not have to outline your financial affairs in any detail. This amendment ensures that those huge multinational companies now have to file detailed accounts. They have to justify why they are paying so little tax. I am flabbergasted that we are now hearing from the Labor Party that they will not support that amendment. We are not talking about mum and dad who have the local milk bar; we are talking about companies like News Limited. Who would have thought that we would have an amendment that says to News Limited—




Senator Dastyari:
  You're a fraud! You're watering it down!



The CHAIRMAN:  Resume your seat, Senator Di Natale. Senator Dastyari, you will need to withdraw those remarks.




Senator Dastyari:
  I withdraw.



The CHAIRMAN:  Again, I remind senators to be conscious of the words they use in this place.




Senator DI NATALE:
  Again, just as an example, we have News Limited, who, through the Senate inquiry, were outed as being major risk when it comes to the level of tax that they pay—or, indeed, do not pay. This amendment says that we are now going to ensure that you publish in detail your accounts so we can track your arrangements and make an assessment about what a fair level of tax should be, given the profits that you make. And we have the Labor Party saying to News Limited, 'No, we don't want to do that. We're going to let you off the hook.' I have to say it is remarkable that for the past three or four hours we have heard about how important tax transparency is to the Labor Party, and now they are going to vote against an amendment that enforces those companies—Pfizer, Glencore, News Limited—to disclose their accounts, and we are having a debate about whether the Labor Party should or should not support it! Now we hear that they are not going to.


What it says to me is that those words ring very hollow. All the huff, all the bluster and all of the rhetoric that we have heard for the past few hours have been exposed as nothing more than grandstanding, because we have an opportunity. We are in the parliament. Our words actually do not matter that much. What matters are our actions. And right now we have the opportunity with our vote, the most precious thing that we are given in this place, to support legislation that would force those companies with a billion dollar turnover to disclose their affairs, and we know what that means. We know that when you force companies—as we saw in the UK with the number of companies who were forced to disclose their affairs; it drastically changed their behaviour—they realise that, to have a social licence, it actually hurts their bottom line when they are paying an unfair level of tax. It removes their social licence. So now we have legislation that is going to do that to those multinationals based here in Australia, and the Labor Party are saying no.


It says to the Australian community that all the rhetoric we have heard for the last few hours is hollow and meaningless and this is all about grandstanding and not about outcomes. You have an opportunity to move from the sidelines into this debate and to support legislation that will ensure that those companies pay their fair share. I just urge the Labor Party, and, indeed, the crossbenchers, to support this amendment, because it will be a critical tool in the fight against multinational tax avoidance.

Senator Di Natale is not strengthening a government bill; he is watering down amendments moved by Senator Xenophon that he supported two or three weeks ago. To stand in this chamber and try and pretend that he is delivering a stronger position than is already in this bill is a total fabrication, and you will and should be exposed for trying to perpetrate that untruth on this chamber. We will not let you pretend that you are not voting against amendments that you supported previously that are tougher than what you caved in and rolled over to the government for. That is the truth.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:38):  I will speak to these amendments directly, but I think maybe what some of us need here is a long cold shower, rather than a long hot shower! It might wake us up. 


There is my amendment that the Greens and the government say we should not insist upon, and there is an alternative amendment. I am going to be very boring here and just dispassionately go through these amendments very quickly in terms of what the key differences are. The two amendments are quite similar, but my amendment does include a reference to auditing, saying that a general purpose financial report must be prepared and audited, which is broader than the amendment moved by Senator Di Natale. The other key difference is that ASIC is the main reporting agency in respect of this in the Australian Greens amendment. They seem to be the two differences. There are some drafting differences, but those seem to be the substantial differences. If a company turns over $1 billion a year, if it is part of a subsidiary of a global giant, if it is a big pharmaceutical company— where Senator Dastyari had a wonderful expression; what was it, a trestle?




Senator Dastyari:
  A trestle—a big board.




Senator XENOPHON:
  about how little pharmaceutical companies paid in tax—or if it is Google, Apple, Microsoft, all those companies, or a large Australian company, my understanding is that it will be picked up by this. That is just one question. If it is an Australian company that turns over $1 billion or more, unless it is solely based in Australia, my understanding is that the Australian Greens amendment will pick it up. My understanding is that my amendment would pick it up by virtue of the $1 billion threshold. They are the key differences. I will put some questions in relation to that. I do have a couple of questions to put to the government, because they will be responsible for enforcing this. These are technical questions. The Australian Greens amendment has no requirement for an audit as such, but my first question to the Minister for Finance is: will part 2M.3 of the Corporations Act apply in respect of a requirement for auditing? If it does, then that minimises the differences between the two amendments.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:41):  I am grateful to the minister for his answer. The other question is this. My understanding of my amendment was that it would apply to a company even if it did not have overseas activities, as long as it had a turnover of $1 billion or more. Does the agreement that the government will agree to, that it will support the Australian Greens amendment, only apply to a company that is multinational in its operation?

It does not really matter where that income is generated, so I do not quite understand the distinction that you are trying to draw here.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (18:43):  I just wanted to make it very clear, after Senator Conroy's rant, about what is one of the most substantial parts of the legislation we are dealing with here tonight, which is getting the application of general purpose accounting to significant global entities. We heard all the evidence in our Senate inquiry about the biggest potential tax avoiders, who may be getting away without paying their fair share of tax. They are the ones who are going to be required to meet this level of reporting. That is why this is so significant. I just want to get on record that the Greens have worked this afternoon—and I thank the minister and his staff here from Treasury, who have been very helpful in going through this in significant detail, with not just me and other people within the Greens but also Senator Xenophon and others—and we have looked at this very closely. As much as Labor have tried to pick holes in this, because it suits their argument, what we are seeing is not any weakening of Senator Xenophon's amendment. We have clarified some issues around Senator Xenophon's amendment, but we are convinced from what we have heard—




Senator Dastyari:
  Of course you're convinced. You'd buy the Harbour Bridge!




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  Yes, and Senator Xenophon did not exactly say that this has been significantly weakened or watered down, like you did, Senator Conroy or Senator Dastyari. He did not say that at all. Let us be very clear, to get this on record. This is a substantial part of this legislation. This is the key reason that we have put this legislation and why the Greens have supported this. It is a strong set of legislation and I just want to make sure that it is on record that what Senator Conroy said was not technically correct. In fact, it was not correct at all. It was a nice political attempt to slur, but we have gone through this in detail.

  I think the key phrase 'sell-out rats' has been used a few times already tonight.

  And 'sell-out Greens'. So, in the interest of moving forward with legislation, I do not believe we need to articulate the point that has already been made extensively.




Senator Lines:
  But you could.




Senator DASTYARI:
  I could, and perhaps I will. But let's just be very, very clear about what this is. This amendment insists on the $100 million threshold. That is what the proposal that we are about to vote on is. So the question here is: will we insist on the amendment that had already been moved to this legislation, which was supported by a majority of this Senate, or will we not support an amendment that already had majority support?




Senator Conroy:
  The Greens voted for it.




Senator DASTYARI:
  The Greens voted for it. So we will now find out whether they will go against the amendment that they already voted for that set $100 million as the threshold. So that there is no confusion at all: there is an amendment and it has already been passed. The Greens have voted for it already. The amendment I am moving will insist on that amendment. So let's just see how they choose to vote on it.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (18:55):  The government does not support the amendment proposed by the Labor opposition. The government is committed to tax transparency, but the government will not go so far as to reveal taxpayer information for private companies under such low thresholds as Labor is proposing. The government is already taking action. We are implementing the G20 OECD base erosion and profit-shifting recommendations on country-by-country reporting and harmful tax practices to address multinational tax avoidance and the common reporting standard for the automatic exchange of financial account information to address taxpayer offshore tax evasion.


The government has also asked the Board of Taxation to work with business to develop a voluntary code for greater disclosure by companies of their tax information. The board is expected to finalise the code in early 2016. The government has also maintained the Australian Taxation Office's corporation tax transparency publication. The exclusion of certain private companies below a reasonable threshold has no impact on the comprehensive powers of the Commissioner of Taxation to require companies to produce any information that is relevant to making an assessment of their tax liability. It also has no impact on the amount of tax paid by these companies under the law. The proposed public disclosure of taxpayer information will continue to apply to multinational enterprises operating in Australia and to Australian public companies.

The CHAIRMAN:  Senator Di Natale, just resume your seat.



Opposition senators interjecting—



The CHAIRMAN:  Senator Di Natale.




Senator DI NATALE:
  As I have tried to say on three or four consecutive occasions, by supporting this amendment we get nothing. Companies like News Limited will continue to be able to engage in their tax avoidance and it will not be published.




Senator Conroy:
  Stop making it up. Have a bit of spine.




Senator DI NATALE:
  Companies like Transfield—



Opposition senators interjecting—



The CHAIRMAN:  Order! Senator Di Natale, just resume your seat. I can at this point advise senators that I have cancelled my flight tonight. So I am in no hurry to finish this, but we will finish this with the Senate having some order. Senator Di Natale, you have the call.




Senator DI NATALE:
  By supporting this amendment, companies like Transfield will not have to declare the amount of tax that they pay. Companies like Ingham chicken, the largest donor on the grandfathered list to the ALP and the Liberal Party—so one of the Labor Party's donors—will not have to disclose the amount of tax that they pay. That is what happens if we support this amendment. What we have is an opportunity to continue—



Opposition senators interjecting—



The CHAIRMAN:  Just resume your seat, Senator Di Natale.




Senator Conroy:
  He sat down before. He is sulking.



The CHAIRMAN:  No; I had indicated to the senator that I wanted him to resume his seat.




Senator Conroy:
  No; he sat down before you said that.



The CHAIRMAN:  Yes, before I said it but I had indicated to the senator to resume his seat. Senator Di Natale.





Senator DI NATALE:
  As I said, companies like News Limited, Pfizer and Pratt Holdings—another big donor to the Australian Labor Party—will all get off scot-free. We will get nothing. Ultimately, this is a question of whether you get 90 per cent of something or 100 per cent of nothing. What the Labor Party is saying right now is that they would prefer to have 100 per cent of nothing. They would prefer to have an issue to grandstand with in the lead-up to the next election. It is critical it is passed today because from 1 January next year we will get country-by-country reporting. That would not happen if this legislation were not passed today, and that is why it is so critical. 



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator DI NATALE:
  Ultimately, we believe that it is important to get some action on multinational tax avoidance rather than standing on the sidelines and grandstanding—that is the issue here. You have a choice. In this place you can grandstand from the sidelines or you can roll your sleeves up and actually get action on multinational tax avoidance, so that is what we have decided to do. 



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator DI NATALE:
  Ultimately, we have decided that in the interests of ensuring that we get those huge multinationals, those private companies—who currently do not have any requirements: none, zero, zip, nada, zilch—to declare the amount of tax that they pay, we believe that it is critical to pass this bill tonight. The Labor Party is saying, 'We don't want to do that. We don't want legislation on multinational tax avoidance. We don't want it. We want to stand here and grandstand and have the House decide to reject this legislation to give the coalition an opportunity to say, ""Hang on, the Senate can't agree. You've given us an out.""' We are not going to give them an out.


What we are going to do is support legislation that ensures that those big companies pay their fair share, and that is what we are doing right now. We are ensuring that, by rejecting this amendment, which was rejected already by the lower House—



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator DI NATALE:
  Which means that nothing happens and that we do not get any legislation—nothing, zero! It is a choice: do you grandstand or do you take some action in this area. We think action is important, so we are rolling our sleeves up and we are ensuring that we get legislation tonight, and the passage of this amendment would sink that legislation.

  Well, 281 is bigger than zero, Senator Dastyari. If you think this amendment is meaningless, I think the fact that Senator Bernardi has already said that he will be crossing the floor and voting with the Labor Party tells you everything you need to know. The fact that Senator Bernardi came into this chamber a little earlier, stood up and said that he cannot in good faith support an amendment that means that 281 private companies now need to disclose their tax affairs tells you everything you need to know. So you will now have Senator Bernardi joining the Labor Party in shielding the tax affairs of 281 companies. How does it feel? How does it feel to be sitting on the benches next to Senator Bernardi, saying: 'We want to shield 281 companies from disclosing how much tax they pay'? There is a lot more that I could say, but we have ventilated all of the arguments. I think the most telling one is that, when you have the Labor Party and Senator Bernardi together, you do not need to say anything else.

 (Tasmania) (19:28):  I would like to add to the debate. I do not think Senator Muir has anything more to say. The rowdy debate today and the chaos which has descended on the chamber backs up my call for drug and alcohol testing in this parliament. That would be the first thing. The Senate had a chance to get rid of a loophole which allowed almost 1,500 companies to remain on a secret list, which did not have to report to ASIC. The Greens deal with the government today and the level of political donations by people on the secret tax list and from the Chinese government to Australian political parties show just how corrupt our political system is. It is disgusting, absolutely disgusting.


A royal commissioner has said that there is a grave threat to the power and authority of Australians, and today I think we are on the tip of the iceberg of why—Merry Christmas and goodbye to the chance for ordinary Australians, who do not make big political donations, having their voice heard and valued in this place today.


So, Senator Cormann, through the Chair, I would like to know: out of these people who are exempt, how many of them are your political donors, and how much do they give in donations to the Liberal Party? Let's go.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (19:30):  What I would say to Senator Lambie is that, truthfully, I do not know and I do not care. We determine public policy by what is in the public interest. What the government is doing here today is legislating a very robust multinational tax avoidance scheme which will ensure that multinational companies generating profits in Australia pay their fair share of tax in Australia.


This legislation, which hopefully will be passed tonight, will see the tax commissioner being given appropriate powers to be able to see through a whole range of contrived arrangements that are in place in relation to some of these companies from time to time.


So the bill in front of us today is a serious measure to combat multinational tax avoidance. These measures will force multinational companies with significant activities in Australia to pay their fair share of tax and level the playing field for all taxpayers. It will ensure that the Commissioner of Taxation can force multinationals that have significant activities in Australia to pay tax on profits from economic activities undertaken here. Multinationals will no longer be able to justify using contrived schemes to avoid paying tax.


This rule will strengthen our anti-avoidance rules for multinationals by catching arrangements that are designed to obtain both Australian and foreign tax benefits to stop companies claiming they are only seeking to avoid foreign tax and by lowering the purpose test from sole or dominant purpose to one of the principal purpose, making it easier to apply.


Where the scheme is captured, the Commissioner of Taxation will be able to look through the contrived scheme and apply the tax rules as if the multinational company had booked the profit from Australian sales here in Australia. Furthermore, penalties for larger companies that enter into tax avoidance or profit-shifting schemes will be doubled. This means that they will now pay tax on profits and they will pay more tax on profits, if they have sought to avoid paying tax.


Country-by-country reporting will require large multinationals to report additional information to the ATO. These are significant improvements in transparency that will help the ATO undertake targeted assessments of transfer-pricing risk.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (19:33):  In the spirit of Christmas and of helpfulness, I have actually addressed this particular question before in response to the amendments flagged by Senator Muir.


The government does not support the amendments in relation to grandfathering arrangements. The government does not support the longstanding grandfathering of proprietary companies from complying with certain ASIC reporting requirements which have been considered extensively in the past. The grandfathering of these entities has been a policy that had bipartisan support for decades because, without it, the new disclosure rules at the time would have disrupted commercial activities. The grandfathering of exempted proprietary companies was done to avoid disrupting businesses which would have established themselves under other business forms, if they had known that they would have had additional compliance and reporting requirements which might be subsequently introduced.


The removal of the exemption for the large exempt proprietary companies was considered in 2001 by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Corporations and Securities and again in 2006 by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer. The government does not support revisiting this issue on the fly as is suggested in this amendment. We want to move ahead and get on with legislating this critical piece of tax integrity legislation. This is an issue that has been extensively considered in the past, and we believe that the principle of not making these sorts of changes retrospectively is a very important principle that ought to be upheld.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (19:35):  I indicate that I will be supporting this amendment. There are 1500 companies that have been part of this grandfathering arrangement, so-called. My understanding is that Treasury looked into this back in 2006. It reported, I think, at the end of 2006-07. There was a media release, as I understand it, on the Treasury website that has now been removed. It no longer exists. It has disappeared from the website. I would like to find out what that release said. 


My understanding is that it actually supported the removing of these amendments. Furthermore, ASIC in their submission to the Senate inquiry into multinational tax avoidance in February 2015—chaired by Senator Dastyari at the time—said that this particular exemption could be removed. They did not put up any obstacles towards its removal.


As far as this grandfathering amendment—these 1500 grandfathered companies—it is time these 1500 grandparents got a bit of sunshine. That is what I think we should do and why I support this amendment very strongly.

Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (19:36):  I did flag this earlier: Labor will be supporting this amendment. I think this is a timely measure. I think we have to be fairly honest and not pussyfoot around this issue. This has been a very vexed and difficult matter over many years. The 1500 companies we are talking about—these private companies—do represent some of the wealthiest, most powerful and influential Australians. This is a provision that was given initially on a temporary basis. I think it is the right time and the right move for it to be remove I think the community out there desperately wants more information and more transparency, and I believe it is difficult to explain why particular companies are treated one way simply because of a grandfathering that was initially designed as a temporary provision and are treated differently from other companies. I think the arguments fall flat, especially the transparency arguments or even the privacy arguments or the other arguments, when you realise that there are a certain number of companies that get this special treatment and nobody else gets that same treatment. It is the inconsistency that I believe is really at the heart of it.


I note that the list that was produced by ASIC—and I think The Guardian ran the entire list online—had on it one of the Prime Minister's companies, Turnbull and associates. The Prime Minister rightly contacted ASIC and had himself removed from the grandfather list. How that process is undertaken is really a matter for them. We will find out at estimates. I want to point out that, when you have a situation where it is such a bad look that even the Prime Minister himself realises that being on this list is so toxic that he has to remove himself immediately from being notified by the media that he is on this list, you have to question why 1,497 companies remain on that list. That is the 2011 list; a few people may have been moved since then.


I believe it is an important, timely matter. I believe there has previously been a lot of lobbying for the maintenance of these kinds of grandfathering exemptions. I think it is right for the Labor Party to be voting to remove the grandfathering provision. I believe that we did many, many great things in the area of disclosure and transparency in the last Labor government. Again, I have extensively gone through that in this chamber in previous speeches.


As I said earlier—and there are more senators here, so I want to say it again—I believe, Senator Muir, that this is a good amendment. This is an important measure. This is increased transparency. Perhaps, had you been in the last parliament and had the balance of power to help hold political and major parties to account as you are able to do in this parliament, you would have been able to improve some of that legislation, which was great legislation. These are the types of measures with which we would all have been better off had you brought them into the parliament. So I want to congratulate you for this amendment.


I have to say that the Greens political party have made it clear—and I raised this with them this morning—that they will not be supporting this amendment. I believe that is a real disappointment. The logic that has been presented both to me and in the media is this: 'Oh, that's okay. We can come back to this amendment. We can come back. There's nothing stopping the Senate having a private member's bill, and there's nothing stopping the Senate from passing this later.' That is absolutely baloney when you come to the reality.


Let us be clear about the leverage. The government's position, in fairness, has not been inconsistent on this front. They have actually been incredibly consistent. The government's position has been that they do not support grandfathering. What the government needed to get passed and wanted to get passed was the Joe Hockey legacy bill which we are debating today, which we are amending at the moment. As we have said repeatedly, it is not a bad piece of legislation; it just does not go anywhere near far enough. Adding grandfathering as part of the disclosure requirements would have simply improved that bill. Frankly, without the support of the Greens political party, it is unlikely that the amendment will pass in this chamber. The leverage to get that big change, to get that important change, to get these 1,497 companies in that disclosure, is about to be lost. On the idea that there could be some private member's bill and that we pass them all the time in this chamber: as senators know, we have great debates, and unfortunately we know where private members' bills go unless you have the leverage. The leverage was here. The leverage was attaching it to this bill, and the Greens sold it out.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (19:41):  I have to correct Senator Dastyari, as hesitant as I am to contribute to this debate at this late hour. Senator Dastyari suggested that grandfathering was introduced with the intention of it being temporary. That is just false. The grandfathering arrangements were introduced by the Keating government in 1995. If you want to make something temporary, either you give something delayed effect in the legislation or you have transitional arrangements. Grandfathering by definition is that you do not want a new piece of legislation to apply to those that had previous arrangements put in place under the previous legislation.


For example, in September 1985 the capital gains tax came into effect—also with Mr Keating as Treasurer and under the Hawke Labor government—and all pre-1985 assets were grandfathered. Now, I have not heard the Labor Party suggest that these grandfathering arrangements should have been changed, and of course they should not be changed, because it would be entirely unreasonable. When you make changes to the tax laws, in order for people to be able to have confidence in the system, in order for people to be able to plan their personal affairs with some certainty, people need to have confidence that, when government changes the rules on them, changes when it comes to tax arrangements are prospective changes.



Senator Dastyari interjecting—




Senator CORMANN:
  Of course you change things prospectively, Senator Dastyari. But to suggest that it was the intention of the Keating Labor government for this to be a temporary—



An opposition senator interjecting— 




Senator CORMANN:
  Oh, so there was a review? A review? Well, in 1997, two years later, they just happened to be in opposition. If only they had stayed in government, it would have all been different! Well, why then did the Rudd and Gillard Labor governments not change it? Why then did the Rudd and Gillard Labor governments never touch it? This is just complete hypocrisy.


We know that Senator Dastyari has been able to make a lot of political hay for himself out of this whole issue. He is not interested in the outcome. Senator Di Natale is quite right. He is just interested in the headlines. He is interested in the colour and movement. He is interested in being able to jump up and down in front of the cameras. Senator Dastyari has no interest at all in actually achieving an outcome.


So what I would say here, Senator Dastyari, is: stop misleading the Senate. The grandfathering arrangement we are talking about here was put in place by the Keating government. It was kept in place by the Howard government. It was kept in place by the Rudd and Gillard Labor governments. And we do not believe that in the context of an important piece of legislation, given that this has been considered on a number of occasions, we should just, on the fly, make this sort of change. That is why we are not supporting this.

Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (19:44):  I have just a brief contribution here, just to follow on from Senator Cormann's comments about the issue of grandstanding and wanting a headline. I just stumbled across an article from Michael West. Michael West says of Sam Dastyari:


… before he had a laugh and conceded the outcome was not too bad.


So here we have Senator Dastyari, who has wasted the Senate's time for three hours with grandstanding and with the rhetoric around Labor standing up for battlers, and Michael West says Senator Dastyari says the outcome was not too bad. What it reflects is that the debate we have had for the past three hours has been nothing more than hollow, empty gestures. The result was not too bad. So what has all this been about, Senator Dastyari? Why have we wasted the Senate's time with these outrageous accusations when in your heart of hearts you know the outcome is not a bad one? It is not a bad outcome. So here we have an article from Michael West, who says the outcome is not too bad. We actually think it is better than that. We think it is a terrific outcome, because Australians for the first time will see some tax transparency from 281 companies like Transfield, like Grocon and like the Labor Party's donors Inghams chicken, Pratt Holdings and Meriton.


It is disappointing that we come to the eleventh hour and Michael West bells the cat. All the huff and the bluster, and this is an outcome that is 'not too bad'. We think it is better than that, but what has all this been about? What has it all been about if the outcome, in your words, Senator Dastyari, is 'not too bad'? Again, what we have is 90 per cent of something versus 100 per cent of nothing. We prefer to roll our sleeves up and get outcomes for the community, and you prefer to shout from the sidelines.

Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (19:46):  I think it is important to clarify this for the record. Let's be very clear. On the MAAL bill, I have said repeatedly in this chamber—I have congratulated Joe Hockey for the piece of legislation, and I have been very clear and have said this from the start and have spoken about this bill on perhaps 10 occasions now—that it is a bill worthy of support, but it can and should be improved. And there are measures that could have made the bill even better than what we will be voting on tonight. So we end up with a bad system. There is a government proposal to make it slightly better, and the MAAL bill does some good things. We have always said that as the Labor Party. Then this chamber moves a whole bunch of amendments that massively improve that legislation, and the Greens cut a last-minute deal to water it back again. So let's be clear: they cave in.




Senator Kim Carr:
  When they have the numbers.




Senator DASTYARI:
  When they have the numbers. So can we have a better bill? Yes, there are things we could do to make it an even better bill. I want more transparency, more disclosure, more openness and more information. And the grandfathering amendment that is before us makes it an even better bill, and that is why it is worthy of support. We can make this bill better, we should make this bill better, and if we had stood firm we would have made this bill better. Is the MAAL bill a bad bill? Is it a bill that does not deserve support? No. Is the MAAL bill better than other proposals that have previously been put forward? It does the right thing, but we could have made it an even stronger bill. We could have made it a much better bill, and it is unfortunate that the weakness of Senator Di Natale, the patheticness of his position when it comes to these matters and his complete and utter desperation resulted in him actually going weak when he had the numbers. It must be amazing negotiating with Senator Di Natale. You negotiate with a bloke who starts with the numbers, he starts with the coalition—




Senator Cormann:
  He still has got the numbers!




Senator DASTYARI:
  Well put. He starts with the numbers on the position that he advocates for. He keeps the numbers. Then he folds. Is transparency better than no transparency? We have discussed this already, but what you have done, Senator Di Natale, is stopped it from being as good a bill as it could have been. You stopped it being as strong a bill as it could have been and you stopped it being able to achieve everything that it could have achieved because, Senator Di Natale—through the chair—you went weak, mate. You went weak.

"Lambie, Sen Jacqui",Ind.,2015-12-03,"



Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (19:49):  So I think we have established one thing here, and that is that the Leader of the Greens has done a deal with the Liberal Party that about equates to a woman that is in her first trimester of pregnancy—because you have done about 30 per cent of a deal. You have done a crappy deal for Australians out there today and you should be ashamed of yourself. I can tell you what: I would like to see what Christine Milne has to say about this. This was her baby, and I will tell you what: you just blew it out of the water, babe! That is it. I will tell you that now.


The other thing that I have a problem with is that, when it comes to the upper house and the lower house in parliament, it is not run by parliamentarians. That has been made very loud and clear here this evening. These laws and their regulations are made by their political donors in here. So—through the chair—Senator Cormann, you will have no problem helping me call for a royal commission on political donations in the future.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2015-12-03,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (19:50):  On Senator Dastyari's passionate statement about how we could have actually had a deal here tonight, let's be very clear what we are talking about. He said we had the numbers as a Senate. We had the numbers for a political outcome, not for a policy outcome. There is a big difference between actually getting a bill passed into legislation and getting a political outcome that you can go and do a press conference on.


The point I wanted to make about grandfathering is that with companies over $200 million it does not matter if they are grandfathered; there are nearly 300 companies that will now have to disclose. It does not matter that you are grandfathered; you will still have to disclose that basic financial information that this bill outlines.


Let's be clear: Senator Muir initially put up this amendment around grandfathering not because he wanted to get rid of it; he did it because of a technicality. His original amendment going back to the first bill made it clear that he did not want people distorting the sensitive information. He did not want tabloids, greenies or whoever beating people up because of this information. And it was a sensible thing. He said: 'Let them go through and look at ASIC's accounts so they can actually get a clearer picture of all the information there.' Following that, he discovered that some companies do not file with ASIC, because they have this grandfather amendment. So he said, 'Well, if I'm going to stick to my principles here, every company has to have their info on the ASIC register.' That is where it has come from. It has not come from a desire to get rid of it per se.


I want to make it clear that, with the transparency that we have in place here for companies over $200 million, it does not matter if you are grandfathered or not; you will be on this list. If people want to know more about your financial affairs and they cannot find it, that is going to be a very good incentive to put your accounts on ASIC. This is the important factor that we are dealing with here. We are building momentum towards getting that transparency that we want in place. Do not ignore this fact: if you vote against this tonight, you are voting against having a version of the Bradbury legislation—or the kidnap bill or whatever you want to call it. We have at least got that tonight. Let's be very clear about that. And it does not matter if you have been grandfathered or not; you are going to have to put your information on there. So, we have actually delivered a very good result on this.

"Dastyari, Sen Sam",ALP,2015-12-03,"



Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (19:54):  I do not really want to engage in a huge political point here. I note that Senator Whish-Wilson did say in his own press release this morning:


The Grandfathering provisions put in place by the Labor Party are unacceptable and today's result will help build momentum to consign them to the scrap heap.


There is a way of consigning them to the scrap heap, and that is how you are about to vote.



Senator Whish-Wilson interjecting—




Senator DASTYARI:
  I think giving up is not the answer.


Senator Cormann, I want to slightly clarify my understanding of what initially happened with grandfathering. I do not know if it is worthy to go over some political matters here. My understanding is that it was a measure that was put in place in 1995. At the time, the PJC recommended a three-year sunset clause. Instead, a two-year review was undertaken. At the end of the two-year review, the Howard government, which was elected in 1996, chose not to remove it, and then the Labor government chose not to remove it either.




Senator Cormann:
  And in 1995 you chose not to put in a sunset clause. As you were dying in government, you were promising a review!




Senator DASTYARI:
  I am not making a partisan point, and you know all about dying in government! But I do want to go back to the overall point from Senator Muir here because this is an amendment from Senator Muir. I want to acknowledge the history of both major political parties and our resolve to tackle these kinds of issues. It has not been as strong as it should have been, and we are better off by having people like Senator Muir, who are able to hold our feet to the fire on some of these matters. Him having the balance of power on legislation like this has the potential to make this a better place and to push major political parties to make sometimes tough decisions that are sometimes easier for them not to make. I congratulate him on that and say again that the Greens will not be voting with us on this.


I believe Senator Whish-Wilson is quite genuine in his opposition to grandfathering. I believe he ideologically does believe it is the wrong thing. I share that view with him. But I believe he also—




Senator Conroy:
  got rolled.




Senator DASTYARI:
  I believe he got rolled by his own party, but that is a whole separate matter—and he was not in the meeting that did the deal that said he could not do it, but put all that aside. I do believe that it is misguided to believe that the momentum building in this will achieve that. I hold a different view. But we have articulated these cases all night, and going through those debates is not going to achieve anything.



The CHAIRMAN:  The question is that the amendment moved by Senator Muir on sheet 7833 be agreed to.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (23:13):  The hour has arrived when, by custom, on the adjournment of the Senate on the last day of sitting we make some seasonal remarks to thank those with whom we have worked or who have enabled us to do our work as senators in the past year. On behalf of the government, may I thank, in particular, the Senate staff, led by the Clerk of the Senate, Rosemary Laing; the Deputy Clerk, Richard Pye; and all the staff of the Clerk's office; the staff of the Table Office; the attendants; the Comcar drivers, who look after us so well; the security, who protect us; and indeed all who work in this place.


This has been a very big year for the Senate. It is a year which has seen the departure of five of our colleagues: Senator Faulkner, Senator Milne, Senator Mason, Senator Wright and Senator Lundy. The departure of Senator John Faulkner earlier this year was the departure of a man who had won a reputation as a very distinguished senator, who had been the leader of the Labor Party in the Senate for many years and who had achieved the honour of being the father of the Senate. With his departure, the Senate acknowledged a new Father of the Senate—my friend Senator Ian Macdonald, who came into this place in 1990 after he beat me in a preselection. To think, Ian, that I could have been the Father of the Senate rather than you, but I am too young!


We also saw the retirement of another party leader, Senator Christine Milne, and the election of Senator Richard Di Natale as the Leader of the Australian Greens. As well, Senator Mason, who has gone off to greener pastures in the Netherlands, Senator Wright and Senator Lundy brought illustrious parliamentary careers to a conclusion.


I thank my own team, the government leadership in the Senate. I acknowledge in that regard the distinguished service as Leader of the Government in the Senate over the last two years or so of Senator Eric Abetz. I congratulate and thank most warmly the new Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, my friend Senator Mathias Cormann. I thank the Leader of the National Party in the Senate, Senator Nigel Scullion, the Manager of Government Business, Senator Mitch Fifield—he has been sorely challenged, particularly in the last few days, but he has risen to the challenge with aplomb—and the Deputy Manager of Government Business, Senator Scott Ryan. I thank the whips, led by Senator David Bushby, Senator David Fawcett, Senator Dean Smith and Senator Matt Canavan.


I thank my own staff, particularly those of my staff who assist me in relation to the affairs of the Senate, led by my Senate adviser, Liam Brennan, and my assistant adviser, Daniel Ward. I also thank my senior adviser Dr Don Markwell, who is in the chamber this evening and is responsible, among other things, for crossbench liaison.


There have been many significant things achieved in this chamber this year. There have been moments of controversy. There have been moments of invective. There have been moments of goodwill. There have been moments of friendship. There has been the whole panoply of parliamentary life. Parliamentary life exposes all of us for good or ill as the human beings we are, driven by commitment and passion but flawed by that which makes us human. We in parliament are on display under the remorseless gaze of the lens for all to see. Every one of us, all 76 of us who have the honour to serve in this place, comes here to pursue our own particular vision for the Australian future. In wishing all senators and their staff the compliments of the season, I thank everyone for the contribution they have made according to their own lives in the debates in this chamber to make Australia a better place. Happy Christmas!

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2015-12-03,"



Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (23:18):  I associate myself with many of the remarks of the Leader of the Government in the Senate, particularly in relation to those senators who we have seen leave this year. I start by first recognising you, Mr President. The role of the President is a challenging but essential one. We thank you for your service to the Senate and the parliament this year. I did have a Christmas hope that you might uphold a point of order on direct relevance at some stage, but maybe you will next year, because hope springs eternal! I thank your deputy, Senator Marshall, for his work, particularly as Chair of the Procedure Committee and his wider responsibilities.


I thank my deputy, Senator Conroy, for the work he has done inside and outside the chamber this year. As I have said previously, there is no-one else I would rather have by my side in a political fight. I thank other members of our team, including Senator Moore, who is one of the people in this place who undertakes her role with unfailing courtesy although, at times, in the face of great stress. I thank Clare Nairn from her office for her work this year. I also congratulate and thank Senator Dastyari on his recent appointment as Deputy Manager of Opposition Business.


I thank also the Opposition Whip, Senator McEwen, and the deputy whips, Senator Bilyk and Senator Urquhart. It can be hard for people who do not have any direct engagement with the work of this place to understand how critical their role is. We are very fortunate on this side of the chamber to be served by these senators and their fabulous staff, and I particularly pay tribute to Senator McEwen's staff, Maria Neill and Kay O'Leary, who do a wonderful job. We also thank them for the lollies.


I thank all of my colleagues for their efforts this year. The Labor Senate team has continued to advance our agenda and continued to hold the government to account. Labor senators have worked extraordinarily hard. I thank them one and all and I hope they get a good break.


I thank particularly the Clerk, Rosemary Laing; the Deputy Clerk, Richard Pye; the Clerks Assistant, Brien Hallett, Chris Reid and Maureen Weeks; the Usher of the Black Rod, Rachel Callinan; and all the staff of the Department of the Senate. We are extraordinarily well served in this place by the staff of the Department of the Senate, whether in chamber, management, personal advice services to senators, committee support or other ways. I thank and acknowledge Dr Laing for her leadership of the department, as well as for her counsel, her advice and her occasional admonition. I also recognise the Senior Clerk of Committees, Jackie Morris, and all of the staff of committees.


Thank you to all those at the Department of Parliamentary Services, including the library, the Parliamentary Budget Office, Hansard, security, maintenance and ancillary staff that work to ensure the effective running of this place. I would like to make particular mention of the Parliament House cleaners, who are currently on strike for fair wages and conditions. These are hardworking men and women who come into this building in the early hours of the morning, while many of us are still sleeping, to keep our offices and our facilities clean and tidy.


I thank also the Comcar drivers, who are often the friendly faces in the morning and at the end of the day. We thank them for their assistance. I make particular mention of Peter Monck, who has recently retired, and Ian Miller, who is retiring as we speak, both of Senate transport. They have been not only helpful but trustworthy, courteous and accommodating of what has been asked of them. We will miss them and we wish them both well in their retirement. 


In all things we do in this place, we rely on the assistance of our staff, and I thank them all for their service. Opposition is hard work, but the fruits of the labour of staff can be reflected in the contributions senators make in this place to debate, to committees and in all the ways in which senators make a contribution in the Senate. Senators are only ever as good as their staff, and I thank all of the opposition staff, who are so diligent, dedicated and loyal to their senators. To all those Labor members and supporters throughout Australia—who, as Senator Conroy said last year, continue to maintain their rage and enthusiasm—I wish them all the very best for the Christmas break and for the New Year. To all senators, on behalf of the opposition, I extend to you Christmas greetings and good wishes for the festive season. We know that the most important things in our lives are other people we love: family and friends. They are far more important than anything that takes place in this chamber. I hope you spend much time with them over this break, and I wish you all the very best for the Christmas season.

Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria) (23:23):  I will be brief. Senator Wong and Senator Brandis have covered much of the terrain that I wanted to cover. Mr President, firstly I want to thank you for doing a terrific job in your role. You have been very even-handed and balanced. I am always amazed at the fact that you actually listen to the questions and make rulings on the questions after having listened to them. I think that is a terrific achievement.


I want to thank the Senate staff: the clerks and the attendants. They keep this place ticking over. I know that we have kept them back late tonight. I want to thank them for all the hard work that they do on behalf of the Australian people. They keep our manila folders full, our glasses full and our doors open. They do a terrific job. I want to thank the Comcar drivers, Ian and Peter, who are both leaving us. Thank you for all the service you have given us. 


I thank the security staff. Yesterday, they were confronted with a very difficult situation. They had a number of people in the foyer protesting, including a few disobedient senators! They conducted themselves with aplomb. They were very courteous. They did their job well. I want to thank them for the work that they did yesterday and, indeed, for the work that they have done for the year. To the cleaners, who we know are currently on strike, I want to say: thank you for the work that you do. They are the fairies in the middle of the night who come and clean up—and I suspect there will be a bit of cleaning up to do tonight, possibly in the alcove next door. I would like to thank the Department of Parliamentary Services for the work that they do.


I want to thank my team. It has been a big year for us. We have had some significant changes, with the departure of Christine and, of course, Penny Wright. We have welcomed Nick and Robert, who have been incredibly valuable additions to our team. My deputies, Scott and Larissa, have done a sterling job in supporting this team through the transition. I want to thank Rachel, our Whip, and everybody. We have a terrific team here. For our staff, the staff in the leader's office, it has been a huge transition. It is a big thing to do—to take over this role. I want to thank all of my staff for the wonderful work that they do. I will be a little self-indulgent and say thank you to my family. I cannot be with them tonight as I am heading off to Paris. I want to thank Lucy and the boys for being such a strong source of support for me.


I will just sign off by saying to those of you who do not believe in Christmas: happy non-denominational, gender-neutral, environmentally sustainable, socially responsible holidays. For the rest of us: happy Christmas. Happy Christmas, everybody!

Senator DAY
 (South Australia) (23:26):  I am on chamber duty again for the crossbench, I think. The crossbench occupy a rather unique place here. Our crossbenchers, as we know, have interests almost as diverse as the coalition and Labor. I do not know an awful lot about the Greens but I presume there is a diversity of interests there as well. On behalf of Senators Leyonhjelm, Madigan, Lazarus, Lambie, Muir, Wang and myself, we would like to thank the staff, Rosemary, Richard and Brien, and the chamber staff—Rosemary, Adrienne, Fiona, Wally, John and Bryan—for looking after us all so well.


I would like to thank the whips and the major parties for their lobbying—I mean assistance!—during interesting legislation debates. It is very kind of them. Thank you also, Mr President, for your kind comments during rowdy question times when you have held up the crossbench as the model of decorum, courtesy and civility. We wish everyone a happy Christmas, for those who do believe in Christmas. For others: compliments of the season. We look forward to seeing you all next year.

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (23:28):  I rise on behalf of The Nationals in the Senate to say thank you to all who have supported us in this place. We wish everyone a very merry Christmas. To you, Mr President: thank you so much. This place would not work without an even hand, mate. You have given that in spades under some pretty trying circumstances. So, for that, thank you. To my colleagues in The Nationals, particularly my deputy, Fiona: thank you so much for being a great team. I am really looking forward to coming back and punching on with you in a successful 2016.


To all of those on the various benches in this place: I wish you and your families a very merry Christmas and an enjoyable and restful break. While at times we may disagree, we are all in this game together. I suspect the friendships that we share across the political divide are often what get us through what can otherwise be a somewhat isolated life. I would like to take the opportunity to say thank you to all the staff in the Senate and particularly acknowledge Dr Rosemary Laing and her incredible team, who help manage the business of this place every day. In particular, I thank all the staff in all our offices. They are up at this completely ungodly hour. They are looking very much forward to going home as well. Thank you for your ongoing work.


I also thank those who work with our staff, including the Comcar drivers. A particular thankyou to Ian and Peter for your efforts. How you get those cars to the places we end up sometimes staggers me. A particular thank you to the security guards and to the cleaners, particularly to those cleaners who help themselves—as they should—to the rabbits from my freezer, which enables me to go out on the weeknights and keep the feral population at a decent level. All of them have a wonderful, friendly face for senators. It does not matter what time of the day we are here, so thank you.


Most importantly, thank you to our families for the unconditional support you provide. Although we are often away, I am sure we could not do our jobs with the conviction that we have without your support. As we enter this festive season, I encourage everyone to take that well-earned break, enjoy the valuable time with family, get some sunlight and recharge those batteries. I am looking forward to seeing you all in the new year. Merry Christmas.

The PRESIDENT
 (23:30):  Just in concluding the fine speeches that have just been made, I think the best Christmas present I could give you all is not repeating all that again. But, in saying that, I do not want to belittle the thanks that have been afforded to many here—in particular, the entire staff of the Department of the Senate, led by the Clerk. So I add my comments to that in all sincerity, because the work they do is fantastic, as with the Department of Parliamentary Services. I also acknowledge and single out the Deputy President. I thank the Deputy President, Gavin Marshall, for his loyalty and his assistance throughout the year also. Thank you all, Senators, for what you have done and the contribution you make to this place.


Senator Wong, according to senators on my right, apparently I do uphold your points of order. I do remind ministers of the question from time to time. Senator Wong, I also have a Christmas wish for next year: I hope we all come back with a renewed commitment to make sure that this place maintains a strong sense of decorum and also a great sense of purpose and that we uphold what the public of Australia would like us to uphold, and that is a fine institution that actually has good debate, less argument with the chair and maybe less debate across the chamber. Thank you all for all the support you have shown me in my office as well. I do appreciate that.


I understand another Christmas bonus is that we are following convention this year and no-one wishes to speak on the adjournment debate. I now propose:


That the Senate do now adjourn.


The Senate will meet again on Tuesday, 2 February 2016, at 12.30 pm. Have a safe and happy Christmas.




Senate adjourned at 
23:32
 until Tuesday, 
2 February 2016 at 12:30.
