"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2002-08-22,"—I was speaking to a distinguished colleague—and I think we would all call him that—Senator Ray, about the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 and he said to me that this is essentially a bill about a dash for cash for the Liberal Party. After having done a bit of research on this bill, I understand that this is a bill to assist the federal secretariat of the Liberal Party, bunkered down in Robert Menzies House, in their dispute with the Queensland division of the Liberal Party.
—I thought you were going to talk about Centenary House. That's your dash for cash.
—No, Senator Ferguson. I am not sure what position the South Australian Liberal Party is in at the moment. You are not in power there at the moment, are you, Senator Ferguson? In fact, as you would know, Mr President, in no state or territory is the Liberal Party in power. 
This bill, as Senator Ray explained to me, quite emotionally—this dash for cash by the coalition to get this money—has a long and tawdry history. I have been here only since 1998, but I have become aware of this growing division within the Liberal Party and their particular bureaucracies as a result of this bill being once again presented to the Senate. I am aware that the Queensland Liberal Senators Mason and Brandis and indeed potentially our new ambassador to Ireland, Senator Herron, have been involved in lobbying to assist their Queensland state division. These divisions, I imagine, go back to why a lot of parties start to fall out of favour with each other—the fact of the appalling performance of the Queensland Liberal Party over the past few years, and of the conservative forces up there in Queensland. As a young man, I never thought that someone like Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen would have ever been defeated—he looked invincible. Yet after many years of that coalition government up there the people had had enough and they punted them. When parties fall into so much disarray and there is anger within themselves and there are internal disputes, they sometimes spill out publicly, as we have seen in my own party. But for the Queensland Liberals to do some of the things that it has been alleged Senators Brandis, Mason and Herron have done is quite outrageous. 
I cannot for the life of me think that we in the Labor Party would even consider approaching the Democrats and asking them to make sure that this bill was defeated, even if we had received instructions from our state branch like those the Queensland Liberal Party have given to people like Senators Mason, Brandis and Herron. In fact, Mr President, in your exalted role within the Liberal Party, you will be well aware, no doubt, that in the Sydney Morning Herald of August last year, the Prime Minister complained about the Queensland division. I gather he said that it had reneged on handing over its share of funding. He made it clear, undoubtedly, to your party room meeting that the bill was going ahead. As a consequence of that, people like Senators Brandis, Mason and Herron started to lobby the divided Democrats. They want this bill defeated. They do not want the federal secretariat of the Liberal Party having this money. They want it to go back to their own mates in Queensland. I gather from reports in the Age of April and July last year that this so-called great coalition party, this great conservative party, is in debt to the tune of $300,000 north of the Tweed.
Mr Acting Deputy President, can you imagine the sort of flaying that we would get on our side of politics if we were not even able to run our own political party. As a president of the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party, I can tell you that we are always operating in surpluses. We will always operate, and have always operated, in surpluses. Can you believe that these geniuses on the other side who would purport to represent and govern this country cannot even run their own political party? We have to have special legislation, which has been presented to us this morning, to get them out of the—I was going to use a swear word, but I know you cannot do that in the chamber, so `poo' will do. We have to try to dig them out of their own graves. I am not in favour of it. I have spoken to Senator Ray and Senator Faulkner about this. I know that Senator Faulkner has a deep and lasting affection for state branches of political parties, but, indeed, not even Senator Faulkner could come at this bland hypocrisy that is ensconced in this bill. The Courier-Mail of 30 August last year said that Senators Brandis and Mason were lobbying the Australian Democrats to make sure that they opposed this bill. I suppose as good state righters they have been dispatched to Canberra to represent their party, but to treacherously go round and talk to the Australian Democrats to make sure that this bill was defeated is a new low.
—They are treacherous, but they are also right on this.
—In fact, Senator Faulkner, it was reported that in the cabinet meeting the Prime Minister was so angry about the actions of Senators Brandis and Mason that he himself labelled them treacherous. As I said, the treachery and duplicity of these new-age Liberals that have been dispatched to Canberra from Queensland was reported on 30 August last year. Mr Acting Deputy President, you only have to listen to some of their speeches, particularly those by Senator Mason, to realise that they think the triumph of capitalism has finally occurred and that they and their predecessors have been proven right about the combat between the Left and the Right. Listening to some of the madcap speeches that Senators Brandis and Mason have made in here, you would sometimes think that Dr Strangelove had been let into the Senate. 
These two gentlemen get up here and beat their chests about the triumph of Liberal capitalism that they believe has occurred over the last few years, but we have not heard them comment at all on the appalling performances of their capitalist mates in America. Where are their answers to what has happened to Enron and WorldCom? Where is their apologia for what is happening in the HIH royal commission? Where is their apologia for what Adler and all of those sorts of people have got up to? Their answers are nowhere; the silence is very deafening. We still wait to hear their contribution about this so-called triumph of Liberal capitalism. The only triumph that they are trying to have in the Senate in this period is to make sure that this bill is defeated. When a division is called on this bill, I hope they are not gutless and get paired or something like that. I would like to see exactly where their loyalties lie. What about Senator Herron? You have to give it to him. He has an ambassadorship in the offing, and he may not be able to vote in accordance with the wishes of the Queensland division of the Liberal Party. But Brandis and Mason do not. I am looking forward to seeing what they will do and where their loyalties are. Are their loyalties with their Queensland state branch or with the federal coalition here?
The Prime Minister has made it clear where he thinks their loyalties are. As I said earlier, he believes they are treacherous. Can you imagine a successful Prime Minister—I have to say it—like John Howard going into a full cabinet meeting and labelling two of his obscure backbenchers as treacherous? That is what he has done. What are we expected to do here today? We are waiting again for the government to respond on this.
One of the reasons this legislation is before us is that both the federal and state divisions of the Liberal Party have cash flow problems, not only in Queensland but particularly in Western Australia. In fact, in the Canberra Times of 8 August 2001 the Western Australian Liberal Party director, Mr Wells, said in relation to the changes, `Why mess around with the GST if you don't have to?' This rationale was rejected by Lynton Crosby, who instead claimed that the changes will—and it sounds very Orwellian—`more accurately reflect the purpose for which public funding is paid'; that is, for us for the federal election campaign.
Can you imagine small businesses being satisfied with one of the paid servants, one of the paid puppies, of the Liberal Party saying, `Why mess around with the GST if you don't have to'? Mr Acting Deputy President, can you imagine going to one of the small businesses in the southern suburbs of Sydney— as I know you do all the time—shoving one of those quotes in front of them and saying, `Why muck around if you don't have to'? I will tell you what they would say; they would say that the Taxation Office would be up you like a rat up a drainpipe, wouldn't they? Imagine that. All these taxation officers have been crawling over these small businesses, except of course the Queensland Liberal Party and the Western Australian division. I invite Senators Brandis and Mason—and, as I said, I can understand the predicament Senator Herron is in at the moment, because he does not want to get anybody offside. He has his loyalties to his Queensland division but he does have Dublin and Rome in sight. I can understand that he would not want to get people browned off about taking them on. But, definitely, Brandis and Mason could at least come down here—
 (Senator Forshaw)—Order! Senator Hutchins, you should refer to senators by their correct titles.
—Thank you. That is correct.
—Senator George Brandis and Senator Brett Mason. I am not sure of their second names but I will try to read them out, Senator Troeth, if I can get a hold of them at the moment. You can see the divisions in the Liberal Party, not only in Queensland, where they are rocking and rolling on this, but also in Western Australia, where they feel that compliance with the GST is something you might not need to look at if you can get away with it.
In our state of New South Wales, Mr Acting Deputy President, we have some interesting things going on, particularly in the seat of Wentworth. I have become aware, as we would all have become aware, of the rorting and stacking that has been going on in the seat of Wentworth. We saw Andrew Thomson, who was the member for Wentworth, getting rolled by Ian Sinclair's son-in-law in last year's preselection. That was a conflict, I suppose, between the Left and the Right. In fact, in 2000 it got so bad in Wentworth—this is one of `the' suburbs in Australia; this is one of the rich suburbs in Australia. 
—This is where all the patricians live.
—This is where all the patricians live, of course. It got so bad for Andrew Thomson that he had to call in the police to stop factional operators from signing up members. There were also allegations that 120 Young Liberals were stacked into the meeting of the University of New South Wales Young Liberals Club and that they were enticed to go to the meeting for the free grog. I could not imagine Young Liberals going along to a meeting where they were offered, say, Tooheys Draught or Resch's—
—Was it Verve Cliquot?
—Senator Faulkner, I think that is what it would have to have been. I could not imagine them being enticed to go to a meeting unless they were offered Verve Cliquot, or some nice, expensive French red or something like that. But, apparently, they turned up. I gather that, after King was selected—
—Order! Senator Hutchins, you should refer to members by their full names.
—I am sorry: Mr Peter King—Ian Sinclair's son-in-law. After Mr Peter King was selected, a member of one of the other dynasties in Sydney, one of the Hughes in-laws, was not happy with the Sinclair in-laws getting the selection—it is a bit like Romeo and Juliet, the Capulets and the Montagues—so the Hughes in-laws conducted a poll—
—Do you think it would have reached the same sticky end?
—It could have, but the Hughes in-laws conducted a poll against the Sinclair in-laws and they found that the Hughes in-law, Turnbull, was more popular than the Sinclair in-law, Peter King. That was released to the press. However, that did not get too far because we have the Sinclair in-law in here now rather than the Hughes son-in-law. I know it is confusing but among the aristocracy they are all related anyway, and it is just a matter of getting the surnames correct. When this occurred there was obviously some conflict in the Wentworth area. I am not sure if you received it, Mr Acting Deputy President, or even if my leader Senator Faulkner received it. But I certainly received this anonymous email and I put this caveat on it.
—No, I did not but I would like to receive one.
—In your interests, Senator Faulkner, I think that I should probably should read it out.
—Thank you.
—Before I read the contents of this email and the transcript, I would like to point out that I am not necessarily alleging that this email and the attached transcript of the recording implies that it is actually going on. I am merely relaying to the Senate what has been sent to me by an unidentified source as evidence of the level of disarray at their level in the party. The email says:
Dear Recipient,
The following is a recorded telephone conversation (22/05/02) between a source from Woollahra Young Liberals, and one Mr. Adam Crozier, a member of the branch, who clearly states that a Mr. John Hyde Page—
No-one has single names anymore in the Liberal Party. I wonder whether you have to have Saxe-Coburg-Gotha or something like that—
had offered a bribe to induce Mr. Crozier to attend a meeting.
Context:
Mr. JHP has been lobbying to `take out' certain members of Woollahra Young Liberals as a consequence of the defection of those who control the branch from `The Group' (the Left faction) to the Right wing faction of the Liberal Party. 
Several meetings have already been held at Woollahra—
I do not know how much champagne or red wine they spilt in Woollahra—
without much success to re-take the branch from the Right. Senior members of the Party have been implicated in activities surrounding the `Woollahra war'.
This transcript reads:
FIRST SPEAKER:	I'd just like you to know I won't be attending that meeting at this point despite someone expecting me to.
SECOND SPEAKER:	Is that you Mr Crozier?
FIRST SPEAKER:	Yes, that's right.
SECOND SPEAKER:	Have you had a call have you?
FIRST SPEAKER:	Yes I have.
SECOND SPEAKER:	Can you tell us who called you?
FIRST SPEAKER:	John Hyde Page.
I do not know whose in-law he is. Maybe the Liberals who follow me can assist us. The transcript goes on to say:
SECOND SPEAKER:	Has anyone else called you?
FIRST SPEAKER:	Apart from being indicated at this meeting yesterday, no nothing else.
SECOND SPEAKER:	How did he try to convince you to get to the meeting?
FIRST SPEAKER:	Cash inducement.
SECOND SPEAKER:	He offered you a cash inducement?
FIRST SPEAKER:	Yes.
SECOND SPEAKER:	How much did he offer you, just out of interest?
FIRST SPEAKER:	Seventy dollars.
SECOND SPEAKER:	How much?
FIRST SPEAKER:	Seventy dollars.
That is all they were offered. You would think that the Woollahra Young Liberals in particular would have been offered more than 70 bucks.
—You would think there would be a few noughts on the end of that!
—You would think so. It is outrageous that they were only offered $70 to try to stack out the meeting against one of the Sinclair in-laws as opposed to the Hughes in-laws. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1,speech
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2002-08-22,"—I am very grateful that the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 has been brought on by the government. It certainly gives me an opportunity to say a few things that need to be said. This bill is known as the `dash for cash' bill. I think that is probably more closely aligned to the TV program Who Wants to be a Millionaire because, when I looked at it, that is what it is really about. It is really a grab for the funds that would have otherwise been allocated to the Queensland branch of the Liberal Party in a federal election by the national secretariat of that party. The bill comes about because the Liberal Party is unable to resolve its own internal administrative problems. It is shameful that it has been left to this parliament to sort out those particular problems. That is certainly not the purpose of this parliament; that is not why this parliament is here. The Liberal Party should at least be able to sort out its own problems within its own party. We will come to the Queensland branch in a few moments.
I likened the bill to the program Who Wants to be a Millionaire. In that program you are given a number of options and you lock in your answer. As I understand it, if you get the answer right you progress and you could potentially win the big prize. The big prize, if you get it right for the national secretariat of the Liberal Party, is the federal funding out of Queensland. The competitors in this are their state rivals. This has led to a very bitter struggle within the Liberal Party, both in the Queensland branch and nationally.
I always turn to the Bills Digest, because I think that it is always a very handy document to refer to when one is considering a bill before this parliament. It talks about the rationales for this bill being before parliament. I will take those rationales straight from the Bills Digest. I think they are very good options. Those who are listening and watching, get ready to lock in your options. The official rationale is that the amendments reflect the purpose and the pattern of election funding expenditure. That is option one. The second rationale is that the amendments will relieve the Liberal Party of an unnecessary administrative burden associated with the goods and services tax. The third rationale alleges that the amendments serve to settle an unresolved dispute between the federal secretariat and certain of the state and territory divisions. These are the three options before the contestants. Lock in your options. If you picked the third option, you are right. If you picked the second option, you are right. If you picked the first option, you picked a furphy. 
We are now heading down the path of the further options. Undoubtedly, anyone out there with no real hand in the political process can see that this is a set-up by the government. It wishes to use this parliament and its legislative processes to overcome the difficulties that exist within the Queensland branch of the Liberal Party in particular. Having identified the fact that the source of the problem was the internal problems within the Liberal Party in Queensland, I was led back to the Financial Review of 2001. For those who are still wanting to compete in the contest, we will have some more options to choose from in a few moments. The article in the Financial Review of 27 June 2001—12 months ago—says:
Outraged Liberal backbenchers forced the Government to remove the Commonwealth Electoral Law amendment from the top of the agenda for discussion at yesterday's joint Coalition party to allow for more consultation.
The article goes on to say:
Unusually, the amendment—which would redirect funding from the States to the Liberal Party's federal headquarters—was listed for discussion under the name of the Prime Minister, Mr John Howard. This is an indication of the importance the Government attaches to its efforts to strengthen federal control before the next election, which is due by the end of the year.
Then the article really gets to the nub of the issue:
The bid to strengthen central party control has angered backbenchers when the Federal Government is also intervening in State affairs on an unprecedented scale.
So we see a number of prominent people in the Senate, the House of Representatives and within the machinery of the Liberal Party in Queensland participating in open warfare for the control of the party and the funds. This is a party which is reduced to substantially less even than the reserves that you would have for a cricket team and which cannot even get anywhere near the line in the Brisbane City Council elections, let alone the state government elections.
Those who are ready to plug in their answers, get pen and paper ready, because we will be getting to that in a short moment. Further on in this article, we find the following quote, from one of the same angered backbenchers who are still running around today:
`This will make us mendicants,' said a Liberal backbencher. `Bear in mind [Robert] Menzies deliberately created a federal party structure. What is being proposed would subvert Menzies' designs.'
It seems there are a number of recalcitrants in the Queensland branch of the Liberal Party. These recalcitrants are readily identifiable. For the purpose of this debate, we need not give them any publicity here today. They know who they are.
This led me down the path of trying to find out if there was another way to describe these recalcitrants. I went into the thesaurus on my computer and it came up with a number of alternative descriptions. I wonder if these fit the recalcitrants that are in the Queensland branch of the Liberal Party. `Unruly'—I think that has been clearly exhibited by the outbreaks that have taken place in preselection battles in Queensland. `Unruly' clearly fits them. `Intractable'—now, there is a good word for them. They are intractable. They have dug their toes in. They are not here today fighting for their little piece of turf, which surprises me, but they are intractable. `Disobedient'—I cannot say that about them. `Refractory'—I think one would have to use one's own judgment there. `Wayward'—now, there is a good word to describe the recalcitrants. I will include that in the list. `Obstinate'—I do not think they are obstinate, because they have given in too quickly and too easily and vacated their piece of turf. `Unmanageable'—they are definitely unmanageable. Most of their consultations and decisions are taken at a trendy coffee shop in Racecourse Road at Ascot or in Park Road at Milton or at some plush cafe at Mount Gravatt. 
I think I have covered all the principal players there. They are unmanageable, uncontrollable and are causing undoubted difficulties within their own party, for which I am very grateful because it has helped our prospects in Queensland no end, not only for retaining state government but also for retaining the Brisbane City Council. `Non-compliant'—yes, I think that could be said to apply very readily to these people, and so could `stubborn'. You have a number of words that you can now lock in to choose to get you closer to the prize. Of course, the prize at the end of the day will be whether or not this chamber chooses to pass the legislation and take the funding away from the Queensland branch of the Liberal Party and hand it to the national secretariat of the Liberal Party. If this legislation is defeated, then it will be up to the internal processes and goodwill of the party—which I find does not exist within the Liberal Party in Queensland—to resolve their problems.
One might say, `If you live in a glasshouse, you should not throw stones.' In the political argy-bargy, there are difficulties within political parties. We all have our fights and our battles from time to time. One accepts that there will be stiff contests for some positions within the party, but, if one reads a number of the articles that are available on the internal machinations within the Liberal Party in Queensland, one will find that we in the Labor Party are in absolute peace in Queensland and that we have been at peace for years.
This article from the Courier-Mail of 18 March 2000 highlights the internal factionalism and the fighting in the Queensland Liberal Party. I have this argument with a number of people that I know on the other side of politics about whether or not there are factions within the Liberal Party. I get a wry smile out of one of the people on the other side of the chamber now, but I am assured that there are factions. I am sure that that will prove to be much of a problem for them in the longer term and something that they would not like to throw back to us. The Courier-Mail of 18 March 2000 reports about the Brisbane City Council election which was imminent at that stage. I think it was actually held that Saturday. The article says: 
A poor result in the council poll could reignite recent Liberal problems, including factional in-fighting, and trigger speculation over the future of Queensland president, Con Galtos.
Con is now history as branch president of the Queensland party. Then an article on 27 March 2000, post the Brisbane City Council election, says:
Mr Galtos said last night his party had failed to properly resource its councillors in the past nine years, making it difficult for them to develop policies. 
But he said the key to the Liberals' stunning loss was party disunity, with five or six figures constantly leaking information and creating faction-based disunity.
`These five or six people should not even call themselves Liberals,' Mr Galtos said.
These are the people in the smoke filled rooms. These are the people who are doing the plotting and the scheming. These are the people who are creating the havoc within the Liberal Party. I say to keep at it; you are doing a good job. Having said that, it does not give you the right to bring a bill before this parliament and misuse the purpose and the role of the parliament. Settle your disputes down at the coffee shop at Racecourse Road, Ascot or wherever. Sip on your caffe latte and work out your difficulties. Go to Park Road and have your cappuccino, but do not bring your problem here. The next bit of the article is even more interesting. I quote again from the Courier-Mail of 27 March 2000:
Dr Watson—
who was the state Liberal parliamentary leader at that time—
said the council result would not translate to the next state election, due in the middle of next year.
`Mr Beattie isn't in the same league as Lord Jim,' Dr Watson said.
Lord Jim, for those who do not know, is Jim Soorley, the long-serving Mayor of the City of Brisbane. He continues:
`The Premier has made more mistakes in 18 months than Lord Jim in nine years.' 
That was reassuring indeed for the Labor forces in Queensland. That was the best thing that could have been said. From the prediction of Dr Watson—I do not know if Sherlock Holmes was in on this—we ended up with a record majority in the state parliament in Queensland. The disunity reduced the Liberals, as I said, to fewer than the number of reserves you would put in a cricket team. The party in Queensland has frittered away its resources and lost its credibility, and its only way to resource itself is through federal funding. Then you find that you end up in a battle with the national secretariat of the Liberal Party, who want to take that federal funding away. It is an absolute disgrace and absolute shame that this bill has shown up here at all. If you want to be a millionaire, then you have got to plug in either of the answers. You vote for the bill and it goes to the national secretariat, or you do not vote for it and it stays in Queensland. I would be only too pleased to see that happen. They have now developed into an art form frittering money away on internal fights and internal preselections—thereby enhancing Labor's standing as a responsible state government and also Labor's standing in the Brisbane City Council, the principal council in the state of Queensland if not the whole of Australia.
I turn for one moment to the preselection crisis. It now looks as though Senator Herron is departing us for other climes. Will we go through the same haggling and wrangling that took place in the wake of Senator Parer's resignation? I hope we do. I have got the same notice of motion ready for when that happens as I had when Senator Parer left. The wrangling, the infighting and the factionalism within the Liberal Party in Queensland led to a record 117 days elapsing before the party could present Senator Brandis to us here as the replacement for Senator Parer. I hope that happens again; it gave me a notice of motion to put up each day. I know it was followed with interest around the parliament and around Australia, because the previous record was 109 days. That record was set when Senator Lightfoot got the casual vacancy in Western Australia. It is really saying something when the Liberal Party in Queensland can outstrip the Liberal Party in Western Australia. I note that my colleague, Senator Webber, is going to talk about the highlights of that.
I would have loved to have put a lot more quotes on the record, but time does not permit. This really boils down to a hypocritical act, in my view. We should not have to resolve internal party differences. If you have an internal party difference, go down and have your caffe latte, cappuccino or whatever you have at that hour of the morning and resolve it down on Racecourse Road in a restaurant or coffee shop. But do not bring your problems here. Do not expect us to resolve them. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1,speech
"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2002-08-22,"—I join with my colleagues from the opposition to speak today to the extraordinary Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002. In fact, I join many other members on this side of the chamber to state my wholehearted opposition. As Senator Faulkner so eloquently said earlier in this debate, this bill is commonly described on our side as the `dash for cash' bill. It is outrageous that the mechanics of this bill are basically to allow a party interest—in this case the federal secretariat of the Liberal Party—to overcome its own internal difficulties. The specific nature of this bill is to allow the federal Liberal Party to circumvent the operation of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. The Electoral Act is designed, above all else, to ensure that elections in this country are conducted in a transparent manner. If we cannot be guaranteed that, then what can we be guaranteed? What the Liberal Party want us to do is to amend the act so that they can ensure that the distribution of funds between the federal secretariat and the state branches of the Liberal Party is undertaken in the interests of the federal wing. In essence, the federal secretariat of the Liberal Party is forcing this parliament to pass legislation because it cannot get the numbers to make the organisational changes necessary to allow it to receive moneys from public funding.
When I gave my first speech in this place the other day, I started by quoting Edmund Burke, and a number of people opposite congratulated me on that. I now have another one. Edmund Burke once observed: 
One of the first motives of civil society, and which becomes one of its fundamental rules, is that no man should judge in his own cause.
This bill seeks to allow the federal secretariat to circumvent the Electoral Act to judge in its own cause. The Electoral Act currently provides for public funding to be paid to the agent of the state branch of the party for which the candidate stood. We all know that; we have all had to sign appointment of agent forms as part of the process of getting elected.
The current act allows a mechanism through section 299(5A) whereby a state branch lodges a notice with the Australian Electoral Commission requesting that payment be made to an agent of another party. Section 299 allows a straightforward approach that permits public funding to be paid to an agent rather than to the state branch for which the candidate stood. Unlike Mr Lynton Crosby and his colleagues, our national secretariat in the ALP is quite capable and has reached agreement with each state branch of our party and, in accordance with section 299, such notice was duly lodged.
Everyone carries on about the internal difficulties that the ALP is supposedly having because we are quite happy to have an open and transparent process where we engage our rank-and-file membership and the community at large in our internal processes and our process for policy development, yet we can make sure that, whilst we are doing that, the mechanics of conducting an election and the mechanics of managing our own internal structural affairs duly comply with the act. Why is it that we now have to change it because the Liberal Party is completely unable to achieve the same thing?
Those opposite know that this legislation is being proposed only because they cannot achieve it. They cannot manage to get it together. Having met some of the more interesting characters from the WA division of the Liberal Party, it is little wonder Lynton Crosby cannot get them to agree. They cannot agree amongst themselves. As Senator Hogg said before, when Senator Lightfoot was preselected they had to have two goes at it. They ran it up, he nominated, it was a contested preselection and he won with the able assistance of former Senator Crichton-Browne. Some did not like that result, so what did they do? They did it all over again. And just to prove that former Senator Crichton-Browne could actually count, Senator Lightfoot won again. In the meantime my state of Western Australia was underrepresented in this chamber because the Liberal Party could not manage their internal difficulties.
Having been involved with the WA branch of the ALP for some time and having worked for our former state government, I understand how difficult it is to make the transition from government to opposition. I went through that process. As I say, I worked for the Lawrence state government and therefore went through all the heartache that goes with losing government, so I have some sympathy for what Colin Barnett is going through as Leader of the Opposition, and I am sure he is trying to do his level best. I think he would have a fair bit of sympathy for Senator Stott Despoja at the moment in that he is being undermined by four of his own at every turn.
Not only do we have Colin Barnett, who wants to be and is Leader of the Opposition, but also we have Matt Birney, the new member for Kalgoorlie, who would really like to be leader—but the trouble is that, with one vote, one value, he will probably lose his seat; he is actually going to have to find a seat because you have to be in the parliament to be the Leader of the Opposition—and Mike Board, who is the AMA spokesperson for health in the state parliament, who would really like to be leader as well, although it is a bit of hard work and you need more than the AMA to help you develop policy if you have to deal with more than the health portfolio. Next is Rob Johnson, who seems to be trying to be involved in who is going to be leader. He would probably like to be leader and, if not that, at least deputy leader—that is when he is not helping to organise the members of One Nation to be elected to his local council! Then, of course, there is the dark horse, Cheryl Edwardes. She has had a longstanding involvement in the northern suburbs of Perth, and I would have to say that, of all of those candidates, she is probably the one I am most in awe of it. She has a tremendous network within her local community and an incredible work ethic; she works really hard. She is probably the one whom they would all like to draught, but she is frustrating them because she just won't play: she keeps saying that she is backing the current leader. So the Liberal Party have all sorts of internal difficulties in my part of the world. And I gather, from having listened to some of the debate here, that my state is not on its own. 
As I say, if you cannot manage who is going to be the leader and you cannot successfully manage to preselect senators, little wonder that you cannot sign forms and make sure that you are going to disburse public funding accordingly. In fact, I would like to be so bold as to suggest that it would be far more appropriate if the Liberal Party invested some of their time and effort into getting their own house in order rather than devaluing the role of this place by proposing this legislation.
Why should the federal parliament be forced to pick up the pieces because the Liberal Party hierarchy cannot get all of their state divisions to reach agreement on the public funding disbursements under the current act? Simply, it should not. Instead of having the courage to adopt a truly national structure—and what is wrong with having a national structure?—we now have to have federal legislation to deal with their internal difficulties. This comes from the states rights party—they come into chambers like this all the time and give us lectures about how you have to stand up for your own state and are not allowed to be partisan and about how we all have to be from Western Australia together or from Queensland together or whatever. But it would seem that they cannot actually bring all of those state branches together into a federation and act as a truly national body.
Instead of adopting a truly national structure and having a proper national structure with an enforceable code rather than nice reports and critiques of what goes wrong in each state branch, the Liberal Party want the Australian parliament to pass a bill that is nothing less than a shameless attempt to impose a legislative solution on a purely internal matter. They have the cheek to claim that the ALP is the party with internal problems. Where is this nonsense going to end? How many other pieces of legislation will we be asked to pass to resolve their internal difficulties? Perhaps we could have an act to restore the former President of this place to her former position—that would certainly resolve another internal dispute—or we could introduce a bill to allow Dr Napthine to be returned as Leader of the Opposition in Victoria. Of course, we can do none of these things, and nor should we allow this bill to pass into law.
If we pass this bill we will create a precedent that at any time it is acceptable to pass amendments to laws that are to the direct benefit of one political party. This bill is so obviously a bill for the benefit of the Liberal Party that it is mentioned directly by name. This bill was not designed for the general operation of the disbursement of public funding but specifically for the benefit of the Liberal Party alone. As I said before, no-one should be entitled to be the judge in their own cause. Neither should the legislative power of the Australian parliament be used to act as the circuit-breaker for an internal problem of the Liberal Party. This government has become so arrogant that it comes into this place with legislation that is designed for nothing other than its own benefit. How could anyone support this crass attempt to resolve its own organisational and structural problems? In fact, it must be incredibly embarrassing to actually have to draft and introduce and then try to negotiate the passage of a bill for an act of parliament to address your own internal structures.
It is clear that this attempt to amend the Electoral Act to their own benefit is a case of their judging in their own cause, and they just assume that the Australian parliament is going to roll over and assist in their self-interest. In fact, if you examine the statement of Senator Abetz on 15 May this year when the motion for the bill's second reading was moved, there is no doubt that this is solely to the benefit of the Liberal Party. You need only read the minister's own words to confirm that the bill is intended to allow the Commonwealth legislation to be used for the purpose of resolving an internal party problem. He said: 
However, as the Federal Secretariat of the Liberal Party is responsible for federal election campaigns, it is appropriate that all or part of the public funding be paid to the agent of the Federal Secretariat
I agree—that is the way it is handled within the ALP. We do not need an amendment act to make sure that that happens; we have an agreed structure that governs the conduct of federal elections. We have lots of robust internal, and sometimes external, debates, but we can actually agree on the fundamentals of the organisation of our party and the conduct of an election campaign. As I have said before, that payment of public funding to the federal secretariat can already be achieved through section 299 of the current act, if the Liberal Party could only get all of their state directors to actually trust their federal director.
There can be no doubt that a mature political party should be able to resolve these matters. On this side of the chamber we have copped nothing but abuse and criticism because we are prepared to review and reform our structures in a very public, open and transparent manner, whilst those on the other side cannot even agree, it would seem, on who is going to bank the money. After 60 years—60 long, hard years in some cases— the Liberal Party are so poorly organised and structured that they would rather skulk in here and use parliament's legislative powers than address their own structural and organisational problems. This legislation does absolutely nothing to create any benefit for our fellow Australians: it does not create one additional job; it does not help one Australian achieve a better standard of living. It is a shameful exercise that is designed to benefit the federal secretariat of the Liberal Party, and for these reasons this bill should be rejected.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-08-22,"—The Greens oppose this legislation. We believe that it is up to the Liberal Party to deal with public funding through its own structure and, if it wants to aggregate that into the national office from the states, it should arrange to have that done within its own democratic and administrative processes. It is very evident, as other speakers have said, that there is some fault line within the party that is preventing that, but it is not up to us to arbitrate a matter of dispute within the Liberal Party from outside. Legislation is not the way to go.
On behalf of the Australian Greens I will be moving an amendment to this legislation on another very pertinent aspect of the funding of political parties: what happens when donations from the corporate sector come to political parties from donors who then turn out to be insolvent or go insolvent. There is some dispute about this at the moment, as you will know, in relation to a couple of companies. I will talk about those in a moment. It is a very contentious issue that shareholders in Australia are left out of pocket when a company goes insolvent. Indeed, some face bankruptcy themselves through the loss of money through that insolvency. It has a negative cascading effect. The question is: isn't it the `moral duty', as the headline of the Sunday Telegraph editorial of August 18 puts it, of politicians to ensure that in such circumstances donations that have come from those companies to the political parties be returned so that there will at least be that amount of assistance to the shareholders who are at loss? I think so.
You will know, Mr Acting Deputy President, that the Greens believe that donations from the corporate sector to political parties should go into an opaque trust and then be disbursed according to the vote at the election—in other words, on a basis exactly the same as that on which public funding is disbursed. We believe that there is a corrupting influence on politics from donations coming from the corporate sector. We are not alone in this. Various presidents of the United States over the last century have commented on the untoward effect on policy and democratic outcomes from the pressure of corporations—not least from their financial pressure.
I am stating the obvious when I say that a corporation which is acting effectively on behalf of the shareholders cannot ethically give donations to political parties without expecting a return—without discussing this at board level and being able to say, `It is a wise investment for our corporation to give this many dollars to that political party, because it will advantage the corporation's profit line and therefore the interests of the shareholders.' For a corporation not to behave in that way would go against the whole philosophy of corporate ethics, which should ultimately be ethics which advantage the shareholder. Where the rules advantage the shareholder, the whole thrust of the corporation is to make a profit which is going to maximise the interests of its members, who are its shareholders. That is not happening in Australia today. 
We have recently had a number of corporate collapses which have left people in terrible financial loss—citizens of Australia who have put hundreds of thousands of dollars, in some cases, into investments. These dollars that they have earned through their own lifetime's hard work have gone into companies like HIH—the most notable one at the moment. The company has then become insolvent and they have lost nearly all, if not all, of that money. One only has to stop and think for a little while about the plight of shareholders who have put most of their money into a corporation like HIH to know how devastating it is for them.
HIH is a case in point. Since 1994 that company has given $800,000 to the Liberal Party. In 1999 alone—and there is evidence to suggest that insolvency was already coming down the line—$100,500 was given to the Liberal Party and, I understand, another $15,000 to the National Party. This is money that, we submit, should now be returned from those parties to the shareholders, because they are the people who are really suffering. I would of course like to hear argument on this. It may be that the Liberals in this case could mount an argument that their suffering is greater, but I doubt it. I might add that, while our amendment would mean that moneys that have come from a corporate entity that has gone bust within the three previous years should be returned, there is an argument for making it a decade. Why should the $800,000 not be returned? However, we are being conservative about this and our amendment would mean that the $115,500 that has gone to the government parties would be returned.
Of course, donations occur across the board. The company Froggy, built up by entrepreneur Mr Karl Suleman, gave the New South Wales ALP $181,000 in recent times. The company is apparently facing losses of $65 million. We know that that is hitting shareholders—I would think potentially thousands of small shareholders across the country—and I believe that in these circumstances that money ought to be returned. The return of neither of those donations—either by the Liberals to the authorities looking after the bankruptcy of HIH or by the New South Wales ALP to those looking after the insolvency of Froggy—is going to create a huge problem for the political parties involved. It is a matter of real ethics that we show, as politicians, we are capable of understanding the suffering at a very personal level when bankruptcies like those occur— because party political donations do become personal for those politicians who are advantaged by them—and there is a willingness to be fair, to be reasonable, to be responsible and to give back the money.
The amendment that the Greens are putting forward has been circulated, but I will flag it by reading it to the chamber. It proposes that, after subsection 306 of section 7, you would insert 306A, headlined `Repayment of donations where corporations wound up etc'. The amendment reads: 
Where:
(a)	a political party, a candidate or a member of a group receives a donation from a corporation being a donation the amount of which is equal to or exceeds $1,000; and
that has to be recorded—
(b)	the corporation for a period concluding three years after making the donation has been wound up in insolvency or wound up by the court on other grounds;
an amount equal to the amount of the donation is payable by the political party to the liquidator and may be recovered by the liquidator as a debt due to the liquidator by action, in a court of competent jurisdiction against: 
(c)	in the case of a donation to or for the benefit of a political party or a State branch of a political party:
(i)	if the party or branch, as the case may be is a body corporate—the party or branch, as the case may be; or
(ii)	in any other case—the agent of the party or branch, as the case may be; or
(d)	in any other case—the candidate or a member of the group or the agent of the candidate or of the group, as the case may be.
There are two notes at the conclusion of the amendment. The first note reads:
The donation received by the liquidator is an asset of the corporation to be distributed under the provisions of the Corporations Act 2001.
The second note reads:
This section applies to donations made after the commencement of this provision.
It was very tempting to put in a retrospective clause here, which would include the HIH and Froggy donations. I am not an advocate of retrospectivity. I think we have to appeal here to the goodwill of the parties involved that they return those donations. I note that in one case it has become a little bit of `if you do, I will'. It should not be that way; it should be: `We'll do the right thing here by shareholders.' If the political parties return that money, they will be doing the right thing not just by the shareholders but for the kudos of politics. It is not just a giving thing to do—this is not a charity—but a reasonable, fair-minded thing to do, and it should and must happen. I also point out, regarding the note at the bottom of the flagged amendment, that if this legislation does not pass the second reading—and I reiterate the Greens will be opposing it—at the next opportunity, under any amendment to the Commonwealth Electoral Act, or maybe better still, to the Corporations Act 2001, I will be moving a similar amendment. 
I strongly commend this amendment to the chamber. I ask all parties to look at it very seriously. It is an amendment which is about good governance. It is a timely amendment, and it will put us all on notice when we are taking corporate donations that not only do we get the benefit from them but also we share the risk and the donation will have to be returned if the corporation becomes insolvent. I do not see why political parties should be protected from that risk— in fact, quite the opposite. If there is a risk to be borne by anybody, I think head of the list should be political entities that are taking donations from the corporate sector. There will be the argument: if the political parties do it, why shouldn't football clubs or art galleries or Opera Australia? This is a very different matter to a political party which has gained an advantage in circumstances which the Greens find very troubling. We are very concerned about the influence of the donation system on politics and on the outcomes in this place. I have said that a number of times before. The amendment I am flagging on behalf of the Australian Greens is a small step towards bringing some control, some transparency and some responsibility into the corporate donation system. We believe that, if it ought not be abolished—public funding is a much better option—it should, as I said earlier, become opaque to political advantage through a trust which disburses moneys without fear or favour or the current potential for political advantage.
That said, we oppose the legislation. I commend this amendment very strongly to the house. I flag right now that, if the opportunity to move it does not succeed because this legislation is knocked out on the second reading, I will be taking the very next opportunity to amend either the electoral legislation or the corporations legislation and return this amendment to the house. I earnestly ask for very diligent consideration of it by all others concerned.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2002-08-22,"—We are debating the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002. The long title of the bill reads:
A Bill for an Act to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, and for related purposes
Anybody picking up this piece of legislation for the first time would think, `Yes, this has got something to do with the electoral process in this country. We are amending the Commonwealth Electoral Act.' As honourable senators know, when legislation is introduced into this parliament, of necessity we have to read it. You then read the explanatory memorandum, which is a document provided by the government to explain in supposedly plain English what the legislation is about. You have to read very closely the many explanatory memorandums and pieces of legislation that come before the parliament. You have to study them and try and find what might be the hidden consequences of the bill or the real purpose or intention behind the legislation, because it is not always clear. But I have to hand it to the government on this one! They have not tried to dress this up in some way to hide from the public or the parliament what they are really about. They have no shame when it comes to this legislation. When you read the bill—this bill that has six clauses—you find the words `Liberal Party' mentioned 33 times. 
I have not done a full search of all of the legislation that operates in this country or of all of the legislation that has been passed by or brought before parliament since Federation in 1901—that is a mammoth task. I am sure the library would be able to do it, but it would be a huge task. I would be prepared to bet on the fact that if you searched the legislation of the Commonwealth parliament you would probably not find any legislation that mentions the name of a political party. You would certainly not find any legislation as blatant as this, which provides for the Liberal Party national secretariat to be given the legislative power to control the electoral funding that the Liberal Party may receive following federal elections.
We all know the reason this bill has been introduced—it is to fix up a problem in the Liberal Party in Queensland that the Liberal Party itself is unable to fix up. As we know, the problem is quite simply that, under the electoral funding system that operates in this country, political parties and candidates are entitled to receive electoral funding following elections on a formula based upon the vote that they receive at the election, and that money goes to the nominated political party. What happens in Queensland, of course, is that the money goes to the Queensland branch of the Liberal Party. Not much of it goes to them because their vote has been pretty damn low—we know that—but the money goes to the Queensland branch of the Liberal Party. Because of the internal divisions within the Liberal Party in Queensland, the national secretariat of the Liberal Party wants to get its hands on the money, but the Liberal Party branch in Queensland have said no. As has been referred to, they want to continue with the structure that has been in operation in the Liberal Party since it was founded by Sir Robert Menzies, which is that of a federalist approach. This is the party that has lectured us year after year.
I notice that the two senators leaving the chamber, Senator Brandis and Senator Mason, have been some of the fiercest advocates for the maintenance of states rights within the Liberal Party and within this country. They have made speeches in the Senate on many occasions opposing the concept of centralism. But what do we find on this occasion? They have been silent. As was so eloquently pointed out in earlier speeches—I particularly listened to Senator Hutchins's and other speeches—Senators Brandis and Mason have been rolled on this bill. They do not want the funds that would otherwise be paid to the Liberal Party branch in Queensland to fall into the hands of the national secretariat. But, if this legislation is passed, that is clearly what will happen. As has been said, this bill should more properly be called the `dash for cash' bill. I would suggest that it possibly should be called the `Lynton Crosby slush fund' bill, because that is what this bill is about.
As the explanatory memorandum says, the bill seeks to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act to allow the agent of the Liberal Party, before polling day, to determine how the percentage of public funding for the Liberal Party will be distributed between the federal secretariat and the state and territory divisions of the Liberal Party. On reading that, you have to say that this is a total abuse of the parliamentary procedure of this country. This is outrageous! Why should the parliament of this country—why should we, as elected representatives of the people—be required to consider legislation that relates to the internal financial arrangements of the Liberal Party?
It is a total abuse of the principles of parliamentary government that you have a piece of legislation that so specifically refers to the Liberal Party—as I said, on 33 occasions in the bill—and gives the Liberal Party national secretary power, by virtue of legislation, that his own organisational state branches are not prepared to give him. This is an outrage! This bill is not directed at better accountability of the public funding process. This bill is not about improving the electoral process in this country. This bill is simply about solving divisions within the Liberal Party. This bill should be thrown out, and the Liberal Party should go away and solve its own internal differences. But of course the Liberal Party cannot. Why can't it? Because right across this country the Liberal Party at the state level is racked with division and dissension. It is in a hopeless mess. 
Senators Brandis and Mason of course have been mentioned on a number of occasions, and we know why. They have fought a battle within their own party against this legislation. As we know, their actions have been described, according to newspaper reports, as treacherous by no less a person than the Prime Minister. Senators Brandis and Mason have tried to stand up for the principles of the Prime Minister's great hero Sir Robert Menzies—as I said, the principles of states rights and federalism. But the current Prime Minister, who claims to carry the mantle and the torch of Sir Robert Menzies, has apparently attacked them as being treacherous. It is not hard to work out, when it comes to the principles that the Liberal Party has so long espoused—the Menzies tradition—who is really treacherous to that tradition.
As I said, the Liberal Party around this country at the state level is in total disarray. Other senators of course have made reference to this, but it is worth repeating because it is at the heart of why this legislation is in the parliament. The Liberal Party cannot govern itself in any of those states, and that is why it is not in government in any of those states—or in the territories. In my home state of New South Wales the Labor Party is in government with a record majority. Premier Bob Carr enjoys unparalleled popularity, and there is no doubt that when the elections are held in March next year his government will be returned, again with a significant majority. What we saw in New South Wales prior to the last election was a desperate attempt by people within the Liberal Party—led by the former member Ron Phillips, who lost his seat—to undermine their own leader and replace Peter Collins with Kerry Chikarovski.
—There is such a list—I would need another 20 minutes, Senator Hutchins. But we remember it so well. Kerry Chikarovski was going to be the heroine of the Liberal Party; she was going to be the Joan of Arc of the Liberal Party and lead them into the electoral battle and win the election. What happened was that Kerry Chikarovski was absolutely humiliated. Of course, Kerry Chikarovski not only was humiliated at the election but, in a coup within her own party—I think about 20 of them got a vote—was rolled by John Brogden. Her popularity was so low that my state colleague the Minister for Primary Industries in New South Wales, Richard Amery, once said that he had noxious weeds in his portfolio area that had a higher popularity rating than Kerry Chikarovski—and he was right.
—And Chopper Read.
—Chopper Read even, yes. The Liberal Party certainly know something about the exploits of Chopper Read. You can go through all of the other states. Recently in Tasmania, Jim Bacon obtained a huge majority in a landslide win. Getting landslide victories in Tasmania has never been easy because of the nature of the electoral system, but Labor did it under Jim Bacon. The Liberal Party were humiliated and Bob Cheek lost his seat. In Queensland, Premier Beattie obtained a landslide victory. In the state where this legislation is designed to try and help the Liberal Party heal their own divisions, Labor leader Peter Beattie achieved a magnificent victory. In Victoria, Steve Bracks achieved a win for Labor. In Western Australia, Geoff Gallop has been elected. In South Australia, Mike Rann is the Labor Premier. We also know that, in the Northern Territory, Clare Martin was elected with a record victory for the Labor Party. In the ACT election, Jon Stanhope was elected as the ALP leader. Every state and territory in this country is governed by state Labor governments because the Liberal Party are a hopeless rabble. It is just a disgrace. 
—I notice that in Victoria, in the home state of Senator Kemp—who is interjecting because he obviously cannot stand hearing the truth—they have just dumped Denis Napthine as leader and replaced him with Robert Doyle.
—He was a member of the right club.
—That is right. The facts are that the Liberal Party at the state level right across this country cannot govern itself. It cannot solve its own internal problems. We know about the rorting of branch memberships in Queensland; we know about that in New South Wales. It cannot keep these young turks under control in the Young Liberals.
 (Senator Chapman)—Order! Excessive interjections are unruly, Minister. You may enter the debate at an appropriate time and respond if you choose.
—There was even an instance in New South Wales with the Young Liberals where they had on their web site a link to the Nazi party. That is how low it has got in some parts of the Liberal Party. You have got these young activists who are only interested in total power and they do not care at all about the electoral consequences on their own party. Sir Robert Menzies would be ashamed to see what is being done here today. As much as he was our political opponent, Sir Robert Menzies was, as we know, a great parliamentarian—a person who trained in the law and, as a parliamentary figure, someone who understood and respected the role of the parliament. Many other leaders of the Liberal Party and the coalition parties have carried on that tradition, but that tradition is being torn up now. It has been thrown out of the window simply to try and fix a problem in the Liberal Party over who gets their hands on the money.
In conclusion, my colleague Senator Hogg in his remarks quite appropriately drew an analogy with that TV program Who Wants to be a Millionaire. There are strong analogies to be drawn between what this legislation is about and that particular quiz show. When you think about the likely prospects of the Queensland Liberal Party in the future, I do not think that, if they were on Who Wants to be a Millionaire, they would get to the stage of answering the questions for the million dollars or even the $500,000. They would be knocked out on the first question. That is how pathetic it would be.
At the end of the day, the amount of money that would be available to the Queensland Liberal Party under the public funding formula is not going to be all that much. Lynton Crosby may think that if this legislation were passed he will get his hands on a bundle of money. I have to say that he will be surprised. He certainly will be disappointed. But I do not think that this legislation is going to be passed. I think the members of this Senate already realise that this is nothing but a rort. This is nothing but an abuse of parliamentary procedure to try to sort out the internal problems of the Liberal Party. I challenge Senator Brandis and Senator Mason, particularly, and the other Queensland senators and the other Liberal Party senators who claim that they stand up for the federal structure of the Liberal Party and support state rights: here is your opportunity to put your mouth where your money is and vote this bill down.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2002-08-22,"— The Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 clearly illustrates how the Liberal Party works. Their essential problem is that, as a political party, they are of course moribund. Their problem essentially is that they have failed to modernise in their approach to government, in their approach to dealing with conflict and in their approach to resolving differences about the direction in which the party should go. This bill seeks to impose a parliamentary solution on a failure of the Liberal Party to reach internal agreement. The reason they cannot reach internal agreement is that they have no processes by which that can be undertaken. 
We have before us a bill that gives carte blanche to the Liberal Party national secretariat to divide money between the various fractious elements within the divisions of the Liberal Party itself. As members of this chamber, you are being asked to resolve a problem that the Liberal Party cannot resolve itself. The Prime Minister made it perfectly clear when this bill was first proposed back in August 2001—perhaps earlier than that— when he said that the Queensland division of the Liberal Party had reneged upon funding arrangements. As a consequence, the Prime Minister's office initiated this bill. It failed to go through the normal parliamentary procedures in terms of the joint house committees, and it failed to acknowledge the appropriate consultations within the parliament on such basic issues as the electoral bill and sought to impose upon this parliament a very partisan political fix to sort out a problem within the Liberal Party. 
We saw the initial responses around the states to the GST. The Western Australian divisional secretary indicated that he was concerned to avoid the GST obligations—a concern that was of course reflected right around the country by small business. But in the Liberal Party's case, you come into parliament to fix up your problem. If we look at the subsections 299(5E) to (5G) of the bill, we see that there are no accountability mechanisms whatsoever for how this money is going to be distributed. There is no attempt being made to employ the normal parliamentary processes that come to the distribution of funds. It is a centralisation of decision making within the Liberal Party.
It is quite clear that this bill is not urgent. It has been around for a little while, that is true. We saw at the end of the last parliamentary session an attempt to pre-empt much more urgent legislation by bringing on this matter. Now at the beginning of this particular sitting period an attempt is being made to pre-empt much more urgent matters. No doubt, at Christmas time, we will hear the cries and see the crocodile tears from the other side of this chamber about the failure to pass urgent legislation. We have plenty of time now to discuss this frivolous matter, this attempt to essentially impose upon this parliament a rort by the Liberal-National secretariat to fix up its internal problems! We have an attempt by the Prime Minister's office on behalf of the Liberal secretariat to deal with problems that should be dealt with internally.
We have noticed that throughout the states there are serious problems in the Liberal Party, so I can understand why the Liberal-National secretariat feels it necessary to do this. Their failure to develop proper processes is to be deplored. Their failure to develop a decent factional system that acknowledges the importance of conflict resolution is to be deplored. Their ancient attitudes, their primitive views, the notion that the winner takes all, the psychology of the Liberal Party that essentially argues that a narrow clique can dominate all effective decision making within the political organisation are inevitably going to lead to disaster.
What is the evidence for that? The evidence from around the country can be found in every single division of the Liberal Party. We see the dominant characteristic of a narrow group of people based essentially on exclusivity—more often than not, as we see in Victoria, linked to the big end of town; the special private club that is called the Liberal Party. We see the new leader of the Liberal Party in Victoria exemplifying the principle that one has to be a member of the right club, go to the right schools and enjoy the right social connections to get on—and if you do not, you call on the Liberal Party national secretariat to sort out your problems. What we have is the failure of the Liberal Party to modernise. To be dominated by vested interests—
—Lawyers!
—It is not just lawyers; it is these corporate types who feel the need to express their social ambition through the Liberal Party. It is not a political party in the modern sense of the word at all; it is essentially a social club designed to allow certain persons to get on at the expense of the overall majority. The interest of the clique dominates the interest of the total. A recent report by the Liberal secretariat itself identified this. I do not have to be relied upon here; I can rely upon the Liberal Party itself. What does Mr Crosby say? He says that there is no effective management mechanism in place to deal with constructive resolution of internal conflict. I acknowledge quite freely that in the Labor Party there are differences of opinion about the pace and the route of social reform and social change, but in the parties of town and country capital, as they were once called, there is no mechanism. It is a winner-take-all attitude of brute force. We have, essentially, disputes being fixed in the Liberal Party in a very visceral way. We have an irrational, self-destructive approach being taken. We have a bitterness borne on personal ambition and `fuelled by spite', to quote Mr Crosby himself. 
In Victoria in recent times we have seen quite serious problems emerge as a demonstration of this. The problem, as we have seen and has been brought to public attention, between Dr Napthine and Mr Doyle was fuelled, we might say, by the great backroom boys of the Liberal Party—Mr Kennett and Mr Kroger are out there, Mr Costello, of course, is lining up for his chop as well.
—Enough! I've run out of room!
—I hear an interjection from the man who, as I have often said, proves the point that the National Party in Victoria is an absolute irrelevance. His father put him here as a result of his great wealth. Buying a seat in this Senate is the means by which the National Party operates in Victoria, so we should not hear much more of the National Party's view of political reform and modernisation. There is nothing older in the political lexicon than the capacity to buy a seat in parliament.
With this discussion with Dr Napthine and Mr Doyle, we have Mr Bailleau sitting there. The great Bailleau family of Victoria is just waiting for their chance to hop in for their chop. We have an example in Victoria that is characteristic of every state in the Commonwealth as far as the Liberal Party is concerned. We could go through it state by state. They are characterised by disarray, by uncertainty over policies. Mr Doyle in Victoria in his first decision said: `I repudiate all that the previous occupant of this office held dear. I repudiate every promise that I have made. Every commitment I have made is now repudiated. We have no policies in Victoria whatsoever.' That is not inconsistent with the approach taken around the Commonwealth. We have tensions between the factions in Victoria. We have huge doubts about the future leadership. Even though Mr Doyle has only been in there for five minutes, already there is speculation about what is going to happen to him in the future.
Let me talk about the way in which the carve-up in Victoria occurs. Let us take the simple example of the seat of Forest Hill. The seat of Forest Hill is one of those interesting cases where we will see, I trust, within the foreseeable future just what impact this sort of corruption in the Liberal Party produces. In Forest Hill, the upper house MP Maree Luckins was defeated in a preselection battle against an Indian-born businessman who, I might say, was fortunate enough to attract the support of 500 new members— 500 new members in a state seat! These new members, who were mainly from Sri Lankan and Fijian communities, were attracted to the Liberal Party in that electorate to assist the candidate to gain preselection. You have to understand what it means to have 500 new members in a state electorate such as Forest Hill at the edges of Melbourne—an area that is not known for its huge levels of participation in any political party—and what that would do to a preselection ballot.
—It's called a successful membership drive.
—I call it corruption. When you stack 500 members in a state electorate, you have corruption, and that is a perfect example thereof. I read in a report in the Age on 12 March that at one branch at least 12 of the 16 votes came from Indians and two from Young Liberals who were also from the Indian community. Forest Hill rose as a vacancy because the veteran MP, Mr John Richardson, was retiring. I bet Mr Richardson would not have found this sort of behaviour in the past, but that is characteristic now of the Liberal Party in Victoria.
Mr Doyle says that he will bring in a new broom. I know damn well what has happened here: a coup has been organised by the Kroger-Costello forces. I know meetings occurred about it, but it all happened very early in the morning with Mr Doyle, I can tell you that. They only could have happened early in the morning; you would not want to get this bloke too late in the day as he would not make much sense at all. I am afraid to say that you have a Liberal Party that is characterised by its inability to face up to the challenges that it should be meeting. 
We could turn to New South Wales, where a similar pattern emerges and where we have the backroom powerbrokers, the shadowy figures, the shadowy men of money and influence associated with Mr Yabsley and the Millenium Forum—
—What was Senator McGauran doing?
—I do not think the National Party counts for much in New South Wales. The McGauran family does not have that sort of influence in New South Wales.
—If they only have three per cent of the vote, how did McGauran get in?
—His problem is that they spent so much money financing the DLP.
—I did read about the DLP.
—It is extraordinary. They were once a very wealthy family in Victoria. Unfortunately, they managed to lose it on a whole range of things, and presumably investing in the Liberal Party, and if it is not investing in the Liberal Party it is investing in the DLP. If only the National Party could attract that level of support. I would have thought that the National Party in Victoria could probably do a lot better than it currently is.
—But they had to find Julian a job.
—He was not buying himself a seat on the Melbourne City Council. In fact, if you live in East Melbourne, it is very hard to represent rural Victoria.
—I have an office in Benalla.
—That is the problem: have you moved out of Collins Street?
—Yes.
—You have? How long have you been out of Collins Street?
—I have two offices now.
—So you have two offices now, but you have an office in Collins Street. Is that correct?
—I have been years in Benalla—catch up!
—But you have an office in Collins Street. That is where the National Party are; they are Collins Street farmers. They do a very good job of representing Collins Street farmers. What they do is make sure that, first of all, they get a seat in this Senate as a result of being a Collins Street farmer. They are not representing the people of Victoria; they are representing that small unrepresentative clique that fosters its influence through the private clubs of Melbourne. As I say, I am afraid that is a pattern that is repeated around the country. I notice that in Victoria there is again talk of coalitions, but it is instantly rejected. They cannot even agree among themselves.
Talking about coalitions, Victoria pales into insignificance when we look at Queensland, where the results are quite profound. Again there are examples of widespread branch stacking involving ministers in this government and state members of the parliament of Queensland. It is very difficult to involve the state members in Queensland because there are only three of them. I understand that, of the three, one is about to retire and the other one is being groomed for a leadership challenge. So it is only a question of time before the internal divisions in Queensland come to the fore again.
—Julian McGauran as a leader in the Senate!
—It is a very difficult thing to have, out of three, at least one retiring and the other one being groomed for a leadership challenge. Mr Quinn said in the paper this morning that if he does not get what he wants they might be left leaderless within a very short period of time. One shudders to think of the prospect of a leaderless Liberal Party. It is an extraordinary proposition. 
As I said, there is a similar pattern around the country. In New South Wales the situation in relation to the Millenium Forum has become infamous. We had Mr Michael Yabsley, former MP Mr Photios, former Premier Mr Nick Greiner and, of course, Mr Greg Daniel pulling the strings and organising the coup against Mrs Chikarovski. According to the reports, we have a situation where various persons in this parliament are being targeted by Senator Heffernan for their failure to meet the requirements with regard to fundraising. The Daily Telegraph of 27 March 2002 states:
Senator Heffernan was understood to have drawn up a hit-list of Liberal MPs who had not met their fundraising targets over a certain time-frame.
This is a party based on intimidation, not just on intrigue and bitterness in terms of their personal attitudes. Let us have a look at it around the country: in Queensland, three out of 89 seats are held by the Liberal Party; in Western Australia, 16 of the 57 seats are held by the Liberal Party. In each of those states there is leadership conflict. In New South Wales, 20 out of 93 seats are held by the Liberal Party—and we assume that it is only a matter of time before there is a further leadership challenge in that state; in Victoria, it is 35 out of 88 seats; and in South Australia, 21 of 47 seats and, again, questions about leadership emerge. In Tasmania they have seven out of 25 seats. One has to question just how long it will be before there is another leadership ballot there.
—The leader and the deputy have both lost their seats.
—That is basically right, Senator Sherry: we have a party that is unable to function; it is a dysfunctional organisation. We have a bill before the parliament that seeks to fix up these problems by the Liberal Party national secretariat imposing its will on these increasingly fractious, ineffective and desultory organisations that run their business in a visceral way, aimed at tearing down opponents rather than thinking about the future direction of this country. It is a pattern that will inevitably lead to the destruction of the Howard government. I heard what was said about the last election. The Howard government won the last election by utilising the great darkness of race and xenophobia in Australian society. They were the characteristics this Prime Minister used to hold together this house of cards. Essentially, the result was a status quo. If you think about the number of people who came in and the number of people who went out in the House of Representatives, you can see that it was essentially a status quo result. So the Prime Minister was able to produce a stay of execution on the collapse of this house of cards by basically gluing it together with racism and xenophobia. The Liberal Party now seeks this parliament's assistance to fix up its problems by trying to get us to agree to handing out very large sums of public money to the Liberal Party national secretariat.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. Senator Carr has just accused the Prime Minister of racism. That type of comment is completely out of order and should be withdrawn.
 (Senator Forshaw)—I did not actually hear the full words that Senator Carr used because I was just coming to the chair as he was talking. If those words were used, Senator Carr, I think you should withdraw them.
—I withdraw anything that is regarded as unparliamentary. I would say that the Liberal Party in the last election used the issues of racism and xenophobia as the glue to try to hold this house of cards together. By this bill they are seeking to find a mechanism to channel public moneys to the Liberal Party national secretariat.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. The Hawke-Wran report showed that the Labor Party failed at the last election because of their hopelessness on policy.
—Order! Senator Kemp will resume his seat. That is not a point of order and you know it.
—This is a bill that should be rejected. This is a bill that is essentially improper. It is totally inappropriate. The bill has not gone through the normal processes that one would expect for such a fundamental piece of legislation as the Commonwealth Electoral Act. The Commonwealth Electoral Act ought to be amended from time to time, as we all know, but it ought to be done on the basis of general agreement. Essentially, there is an attempt being made here to impose a partisan solution. It is a partisan proposition that asks us to interfere in the Liberal Party's internal affairs in a manner that gives precedence to a centralised administration. It asks us to try and sort out the problems that the Liberal Party should be able to sort out itself.

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2002-08-22,"—Mr Acting Deputy President, may I draw your attention to the fact that what we have heard this morning is the most outrageous litany of hypocrisy. If we look back to what happened in 1994 and subsequently, in 1995, we can see that this is exactly what the Labor Party did with respect to the public funding. They have chopped their state divisions off at the knees. They set the system in place in 1994 and then, in 1995, they amended the act so that they took all of the money.
Let me explain something to my learned senators opposite. The Liberal Party in Western Australia, which I represent, has a structure. That structure is one of branches. We have over 200 branches in various towns and communities throughout our state. May I say that the number of our branches is far in excess of the handful of ALP branches spread through the state. Those branches elect delegates to divisions. Each of the divisions is representative of the federal divisions. Those divisions elect delegates right up to the preselection committees, the state council and the state conference, which is held once a year in my state. The Labor Party does not have such a structure. In this place, representative members are chosen for their states from here, through EMILY's List. So there is absolutely no representation of the states in this place by the Labor Party.
When you look at the way our party has functioned and is structured, you can see that there are strong individual state divisional bodies. Those divisional bodies work in cohesion with the federal body and the federal funding is divided up in an ad hoc informal way. What this legislation seeks to do is to perfect that system so that everybody knows where they stand. This is in stark contrast to the arbitrary and centralist exercise that was performed in 1995 by Labor. It said, `We will take every cent of the money and we will not dole it out to the divisions. We will run the campaign centrally.' Effectively, their state divisions are just a facade and that facade is totally unrepresentative.
 (Senator Forshaw)—Order! Would senators on my right please resume their seats or carry on their conversations outside the chamber.
—There is a stark contrast between a representative body such as my division, and the senators who are chosen by my division, and what happens right around Australia with respect to ALP selection. I will give an example. In Western Australia there is an Independent member in Pilbara called Mr Larry Graham, who was a true believer—a long-term member of the Western Australian division of the ALP. His family before him were all strong, loyal members of the Labor Party. He lost his preselection. It was a seat that he had held very comfortably for many years through many elections. He lost his seat at the whim of a group of people sitting in Perth who do not live in his seat of Pilbara. They had absolutely no knowledge of the work of that member on the ground. They had no understanding of his commitment to his electorate. But they decided, through a factional brawl and deal, that he should lose his seat. And, of course, what happened? He held his seat quite dramatically, obviously and convincingly in the face of a Labor candidate who I think lost her deposit.
In Western Australia the diversity of our communities is reflected in our structure. This is in absolutely stark contrast to what happens in the Labor Party. We have members choosing their elected representatives from the Pilbara, the Gascoyne, east Gascoyne and the Goldfields. All of these towns and communities have representatives who come along and choose their members. The Labor Party chooses them in a small, dimly lit back room at the bottom of Curtin House. It is absolutely unrepresentative. We conduct 50 preselections over the course of a state campaign. The Labor Party sits there— two or three faceless men who are unelected—parachuting people into these seats. The members opposite have the audacity to call us corrupt! Forget about the corruption of anything other than the system, by them. They have corrupted the system to deliver to some of their favoured few a reward for services to the other favoured few. It is a partnership made in dimly lit rooms, one that largely had its genesis in the favouritism and nepotism of the union movement. 
Back in the year 2000—I think it was— when the Labor Party held their national conference, they had 189 delegates voting. Forty-seven per cent of them were union representatives. A further 30 per cent of the Labor politicians present were former union heavyweights. Of course, union representation is below 20 per cent in the private sector in this country. Only five per cent of the ordinary run-of-the-mill community based membership of the Labor Party is not affiliated to the union movement. They are totally and utterly unrepresentative of anything other than their own nepotistic empire. In an article in the Australian of 27 July 2000, Malcolm McGregor wrote one of the most stunning indictments of my political opponents and the members sitting opposite when he said that that conference was: 
... in reality, emblematic of Labor's deterioration into a narrow, spiteful, schismatic political ghetto presided over by a hereditary cloister of petty shoguns. It exists mainly as a conduit for its own born-to-rule caste to secure public office, from whence to dispense largesse to immediate family members and assorted sycophantic supporters in the lobbying and public relations industries.
And they say we are corrupt! This is the greatest example of hypocrisy and corruption of the democratic process that anyone could possibly imagine in Australia today. The article went on to say:
It is an avant garde outfit that rates Della Bosca more highly than Barry Jones. Better to have a cadre of loyal boofheads than a community-based party whose members may actually be interested in issues.
And they cannot understand how they are not in the Lodge painting the walls today! They have chosen the colour scheme and they have done all the curtain matching but they cannot understand how it happened that they did not win. They fought another GST election, they would have us believe. They will talk about the good ship Tampa, but we know about the policy vacuum and the fact that they are an unrepresentative party. And they have the audacity to come into this place and say we are corrupt. Who went to jail in Queensland? A woman going to jail in this country for nine months—
—A mother!
—She was a mother. Now who is corrupt? I could go on, but I will be brief. Let me quote former Keating government minister Gary Johns— one of their own—talking about the ALP division in Western Australia:
Local Branch members have no say in preselection, there is no sense of democracy in WA—it has the most overwhelmingly union dominated pre-selection rules. Branch members are irrelevant—
—I wouldn't go there, if I were you. You'll open up a can of worms.
—That's right, Cookie.
—The honourable senator knows what I am talking about.
—Order! There is far too much conversation and interjection across the chamber. Would you please desist.
—Gary Johns goes on to say of WA:
Branch members are irrelevant—it is whatever the main union characters at the time think. Kim (Beazley) has been a major beneficiary so he won't try to change anything. He'll do things when it suits him and I think we are looking for better things from our leaders.
So were the Australian people at the last federal election—and they got better things. The West Australian newspaper of 14 April 2002 stated:
The WA Labor Party gave a sop to branch representation on preselection ballots at its conference last year when local branches with at least 40 members were granted a 15% say in choosing their candidates. 
And they say we are corrupt! Larry Graham says, of the way that Geoff Gallop, the Premier of Western Australia, runs the ALP:
... if he ran a polling booth like that in a general election, he would be arrested. 
This bill simply seeks to deliver to our representative structure what the Labor Party does now.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1,speech
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2002-08-22,"—This bill is entitled the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002. That is its formal title. It sounds grand. It is in fact the `Dash for Cash Bill'. It is a bill introduced into this chamber by the executive of the parliament—that is to say, the ministry—but it is in essence a sordid, seamy exercise only understandable if you follow the money trail, because the money trail leads you to the conclusions. In Australia, we have public funding of elections. Quite a wad of taxpayers' money goes to support the democracy of Australia, to allow the cases to be put fairly to the electors by political parties. This bill is about who pockets that cash in the Liberal Party. It is not about who does it in the Labor Party or the National Party. There is certainly a reference to the Democrats, but none to the Greens. It is about the Liberal Party. It is a dash for cash. If you follow the dollar signs, you find out what this bill is about.
Let me go through the purposes of this bill. First of all, this is its second appearance. It was introduced before the last election. It lapsed and it has now been brought back again for a second try. Normally, legislation of this sort would go to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. Has this legislation been there? No. Why? Because it is inconvenient to open up this bill for proper public scrutiny, something that would take place if the committee had a hearing into the contents of this bill. This is an attempt—although it is broad daylight now—to sneak this through in the dead of night in order to get in place legislation that solves an internal party problem in the Liberal Party.
My colleague Senator Ray said yesterday that the Liberal Party is mentioned by name in this legislation more times than there are members of the Liberal Party in this chamber, and that is true. That is what this bill is about. Why? The Liberal Party—which claims to be foremost among political parties in Australia in supporting the concept of federation, that is, our constitutional entity as a federation of states—has a party organisation that mirrors a federation of state divisions. Under their rules they pocket the public funding at state level but, despite their record of being federalists, they want to pocket the money at national level in the federal secretariat of the Liberal Party and not at state level. Lynton Crosby, the national secretary of the Liberal Party, wants the cheque; he does not want it to go to his states. I do not want to blame Lynton Crosby in this. We know that the Prime Minister—who, in the words of Shane Stone, the President of the Liberal Party, is `mean and tricky' and who we know is the most hands-on, interventionist Prime Minister in political and campaigning organisation of any party at any time in our history—wants this cheque in the hands of Lynton Crosby so he can decide who are the favourites and who are not; who gets the dollars and who does not. That is what this is about. It is just a seamy, sordid dash for cash.
All political parties have internal disputes, and from time to time these disputes blow up in public. At the moment we are witnessing the implosion of the Australian Democrats as they go through internal argument, division and power struggle. We have seen it on the front pages of our newspapers over the last couple of weeks. We know that the National Party are going through a similar thing. The Western Australian branch of the National Party have delivered an ultimatum to the federal organisation. They say that they will withdraw from the National Party and stand alone if the National Party here in Canberra support the privatisation of Telstra. We know that the National Party went through all sorts of internal ructions before the last election in deciding whether they supported Pauline Hanson as a second preference or whether they did not and put her last. They could not agree. In the end they threw their hands up in the air and let each individual person decide.
I must say that from time to time even the Labor Party has internal disputes that attract public attention. In the history of politics in this country up until this day, though, no political party has come to the Senate—the legislature of Australia—to solve an internal party problem by legislation of the federal parliament. No-one has ever done that. Everyone has had the dignity and honour to settle in-house squabbles in-house, and not pull the parliament into solving divisions between different groups and forces within their own party. We are being asked now—and I find this absolutely incredible—to legislate, as a serious legislative chamber, to solve an internal dispute in the Liberal Party. I do not know why the Liberal members in this place do not turn a vivid red in embarrassment. The Liberal members of this parliament must have a hide thicker than a rhinoceros to pretend that there is any public interest or national public purpose in carrying this bill. 
The last speaker, Senator Johnston—a former president of the Western Australian division of the Liberal Party—said that the Labor Party has some problems. We do from time to time, but we have never come in here to solve them. Since he has raised the question of the Western Australian situation, let me complete the picture. His has been, dare I say, a one-sided, biased presentation of the facts. Let us look at the Liberal Party division in Western Australia. They have trouble keeping a leader. Colin Barnett is elected as the leader; weekly, members of his caucus leak against him. Most recently, the Sunday Times carried a headline that he was going to be deposed at a party meeting on the following Tuesday. On Monday night, as Liberal members turned up for a sitting of the parliament, we saw doorstop interviews by almost all of them with none of them genuinely endorsing their leader. The best he got was condemnation by faint praise; some of them were outrightly hostile to him. Did they have the ticker to go ahead with their leaked threat? Of course not; they all backed off. One of their putative candidates, Mr Matt Birney, the member for Kalgoorlie, retreated from all of the innuendo and leaked threats by declaring—and this is a stunning political quote—that he is a `lover not a fighter'.
Then we have the spectacle which occurred in the last sitting week that this parliament was together, when we had a valedictory for outgoing senators. A Liberal senator from Western Australia—one who, to listen to his colleagues in this chamber and in my view too, has a long and distinguished career in this place—stood in his place and wept. He shed a tear, he said—and his words are in the Hansard for all of us to read—on the basis that he had been stabbed in the back. Hoping for guidance and assistance, he had gone to the president of his party division and shared concerns about a police investigation into the rorting of his travel expenses. He then found that information he had passed in confidence to his president was used against him to remove his endorsement as a Liberal Party candidate. He stood there—just over there—and physically wept as he told this chamber, lips trembling, what had happened to him. A real happy ship, you would have to say.
But it gets worse. Just recently, the Liberal Party in Western Australia had its state conference. The notorious Graham Kierath, who was the party's hero in introducing the third wave of industrial legislation, was defeated for the presidency of the party and, in bad faith, left the meeting declaring that he had been done over by the powerbrokers and that it was not a fair vote of the rank and file. We have heard those sorts of stories before. The thing that takes the cake, though, is the seamy saga that we had on the front page of the West Australian newspaper a couple of years ago when the office of the then member for Stirling, Mr Eoin Cameron, was raided by the Australian Federal Police because, as it turned out later, Senator Sue Knowles had tipped them off that he was the source of a document that had been spreading discontent in the Liberal Party and that this was scurrilous. Senator Knowles went before a disciplinary committee of her party and was in fact expelled for a time. She was brought back only by the intervention of the Prime Minister, it would seem.
So goes this saga of sordid internal squabbles. It is not exceptional—it sometimes happens in other places—but no-one ever comes here to try to solve it. The thing that I think illustrates this is a letter that has been given to me by a former prominent senator representing the Liberal Party in this place— a letter he has personally sent me. It is a copy of a letter to another senator in this chamber. Mr Acting Deputy President, I propose to read part of the letter provided to me by a former, dare I say, distinguished Liberal senator. It is addressed to Senator Ian Campbell, Parliament House, Canberra ACT 2600. It says: 
Dear Ian
I have become aware of the full extent of your insulting and abusive conduct towards State Council delegates and State members of parliament at Sue Knowles' appeal. Apparently you think you have a right to act like a lout towards anybody and everybody who disagrees with your opinion of what is right.
It does not offend you that Knowles lied about her allegations of death threats, conspired with the Labor Party to have those lies published, lied to her pre-selection, deceived the public before the last federal election ...
—Who would have written that?
 (Senator Forshaw)—Order! Senator Cook, I understand you are reading from a copy of a letter. The words in that letter may have been written by someone else, but nevertheless their use in this chamber is a reflection on another senator. Therefore, it is unparliamentary to use the words you did. I ask that you withdraw them.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I withdraw anything I have said. I make the point, however, that I am quoting from a letter by a former senator who was a Deputy President in this chamber.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on a point of order—
—Senator Kemp, would you resume your seat. I am listening to Senator Cook's—
—I am not saying that this is my opinion, Mr Acting Deputy President.
—I have ruled on the point of order and I understand Senator Cook has withdrawn the words, but Senator Kemp is now taking a point of order.
—I withdraw any reflection on an honourable senator in this chamber. I do not know whether this is true. All I am saying is that this is what has been said.
—Senator Cook, you have withdrawn. Do you wish to still take a point of order, Senator Kemp?
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: I think the withdrawal is not the correct withdrawal. The withdrawal should be that the inappropriate comments made about Senator Knowles and Senator Campbell should be withdrawn directly, and Senator Cook has not said that.
—Senator Cook has withdrawn the words—
—In the appropriate form, Senator.
—There is no point of order, Senator Kemp, and I ask you, Senator Cook, to resume your speech.
—Thank you, Mr President, and I will, but I want to say this, too, because it relates to what I am quoting into the Hansard: I withdraw any reflection on an honourable senator. I am not saying these words are true. As I said, when I introduced this letter for quoting, these are the opinions of Liberal Party members about other Liberal Party members. They may or may not be true. I do not make a reflection either way on another senator. It is just emblematic of the problem, and I withdraw any reflection that is made. Let me continue with this letter, and I will observe the standing order as far as any unparliamentary expressions that might be contained in this letter are concerned. I will start where I left off. It says:
It does not offend you that Knowles—
delete—
about her allegations of death threats, conspired with the Labor Party to have those—
delete— 
published ...
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: it is very clear that Senator Cook, in a rather underhand and sleazy manner—
—Senator Kemp, you will withdraw that word.
—I withdraw that word. It is very clear from the manner of Senator Cook that he is trying to go around your ruling. He is persisting in reading this letter, which contains a scurrilous attack on two members of this chamber. I think that Senator Cook should now observe the ruling that you have made and stop attempting to get around it by this most unfortunate behaviour that he is adopting, which I might say is becoming more typical of him in recent months.
—Senator Cook, I am not aware of the rest of the words that you are going to read in the letter, so I am not able to rule on any future comment at this time, but I draw to your attention the fact that you should refrain from using any words or any imputations or making any references which would be unparliamentary and reflect on other senators. Even though you are quoting from a letter, that does not remove the fact that it is still unparliamentary to use those words or those references.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I therefore seek leave to incorporate the letter in Hansard.
Leave not granted.
—Mr Acting Deputy President. I seek leave to table the correspondence.
Leave not granted.
—I note for the Hansard that Senator Kemp, a Liberal Party minister, denied leave for the incorporation or tabling of this letter. I now should say that this is a letter written by a former Deputy President of this chamber and former Liberal senator for Western Australia, Noel Crichton-Browne. It concludes with the words:
Feel free to distribute this correspondence. I shall.
Yours sincerely,
Noel Crichton-Browne.
I do not think I can read this letter honestly and conform with standing orders at the same time. Therefore, I will summarise essentially what it says and do so in conformity with standing orders, because it serves to illustrate the deep divisions within the Liberal Party and the divisions that give rise to a manipulation by this government of this legislature to solve those problems in the Liberal Party by having a Liberal government enact laws that settle an internal party dispute. This is a relevant piece of evidence that the party disputes in the Liberal Party are deep, entrenched, bitter and personal, and it is therefore not surprising that there is anger and distrust.
—Order! Senator Kemp, would you be quiet. I need to hear what Senator Cook is saying.
—In all dignity, it ought to be the proper reaction for the Liberal Party to solve those problems itself, not to come here and ask us to vote in order to solve those problems for it. If I can summarise this letter, it is a damming, almost incendiary, indictment of the ethical behaviour and conduct of honourable senators—and I will not go to the details. It sets it out in some considerable detail; the letter runs to one and a bit pages. It refers to me directly by name— which is obviously why it has come to me— because the imputation of this letter is that I was the victim of misconduct by individual members of the Liberal Party, some of whom are members of this parliament. I am certainly interested to know that that is the view of at least one member, who was a deputy president of this chamber.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Senator Cook has alleged that he was the `victim' of misconduct by members of this chamber.
—No, I didn't. I said that the letter said it.
—This is a very grubby way to get around your ruling, Mr Acting Deputy President. The fact of the matter is that if Senator Cook wants to attack members of this parliament there are ways to do it and they should be warned. 
—There is no point of order.
—Politics is a rough game sometimes. Perhaps it should be less rough and more civil or less vulgar and more genteel, but from time to time it breaks out. I have not complained about being the victim of alleged Liberal Party misconduct toward me; it only becomes relevant in the context of the stupidity underlying this bill. Here we have a government trying to solve problems within its own political party by, in my submission, misusing this legislature to solve a factional dispute in its own party. It is a disgrace that this should occur.
I do not complain about being the subject of rough treatment—if that is the rough and tumble of politics I am prepared to wear it and get on with the job, because my interest in this place is in policy, not personality. But when this issue comes before us in the manner that it has it is a relevant element of this debate to put before this chamber the sort of trenchant distrust that occurs between members of this organisation called the Liberal Party, which has fielded candidates that other members—who have achieved distinction and are in good standing—regard as less than worthy. I will leave it there.
In leaving it there, I make this point. Senator Johnston is new to this chamber and is entitled, as a debutant member of this chamber, to make his regulation number of mistakes. We all did it, and he is entitled to do it and not have it held against him. But in an excess of zeal a few moments ago he used this platform in this chamber to try and denigrate my party. I resent and reject that. All of those things that he said are fundamentally untrue, yet we see this sleazy operation of the art of the big lie and giving the lie to the conduct of the Labor Party. We know that there is this element in politics; I reject it, but we keep hearing about it. If anyone is in any doubt then they should wait until question time, because we will see a number of ministers come in here just for the purpose of slagging off against the Labor Party, not for the purpose of providing answers to questions asked of the executive. If that is the sort of seamy politics they play here, it is not surprising that within their own organisation they cannot agree and that they would seek to put their hands on public money by legislating to solve that problem through this chamber, not by fixing it as they would if they had any dignity and self-respect within their own party.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2002-08-22,"—Mr Acting Deputy President Forshaw, as you know, I am rarely shocked— indeed, rarely surprised—by the sanctimony and hypocrisy of the Labor Party when it comes to organisational structures, party integrity and policy relevance.
—You're from the Queensland branch of the Liberal Party, so you haven't had a good experience.
—Thanks, Senator Evans. I have not heard many of the speeches from the opposition, but I did hear my good friend Senator Carr—perhaps the last of the unreconstructed Stalinists in any Australian parliament—giving the Liberal Party a lecture on policy irrelevance. The other day I was at the tree of knowledge in Barcaldine. The tree of knowledge, which I have dubbed `the shrub of ignorance' is withering, just as the Labor Party is.
 (Senator Forshaw)—Order! Senator Mason, I ask you to withdraw the comment you made a moment ago in respect to another senator. I ask you to withdraw the word you used.
—Which one?
—I suspect, given that Stalin murdered thousands, it is probably not very—
—The word is unparliamentary.
—I understand what you are saying, Mr Acting Deputy President, and I withdraw it. We received a lecture from Senator Carr about policy irrelevance. What I do know about this debate is that the people here in the chamber and those who will read the Hansard later are not interested in this debate at all. This is the ultimate insider's debate. They are actually interested in trade, globalisation, industrial relations reform, mutual obligation, welfare reform, social issues and changing policies relating to families. They do not care at all about the internal structures of political parties. So when I hear lectures from the Labor Party— including, I might add, from those who are supposedly the best and the brightest of the Labor Party—I find it (1) unbelievable and (2) pathetic, and (3) in some ways I cannot understand why I have been asked to speak in a debate on which I have very little interest. If we are talking about policy irrelevance—and you have heard me so often on this subject, Mr Acting Deputy President—I could go on for hours. 
The 20th century was won by those who wanted to liberate humanity, not by those who wished to enslave it. The Labor Party finally adopted conservative economic policies in the eighties and the nineties. I will make this prediction: they adopted conservative economic policies but within the next, let us say, decade they will adopt the conservative formula of mutual obligation. You watch. They will, because they now know that the Australian community will not tolerate welfare without some reciprocity from the recipient. Slowly and steadily the Liberal Party has had to drag the Labor Party into the 21st century and relevance. As you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, because you have heard me on this many times, I dislike the Left not so much because they generously lent their lunatic economic policies to the Third World, nationalising industry and things like that, and thereby impoverished thousands of millions of people—I can forgive that; they probably cannot, but I can—
—Tell us about the Queensland Liberal Party.
—but because, and this is what I can never forgive, and I will not get onto this now, Senator Hutchins, of the arguments about moral equivalence. You will hear a speech on this matter from me shortly. Moving on, if you do not believe what I say, let me cite what former Senator Button recently said in his article `Beyond belief: What future for Labor', published in the Quarterly Essay. On page 4, he said:
The ALP is seen as a pale alternative to the Coalition. It is incapable of embracing and speaking for the divergent progressive groups in the community. It has been unable to respond effectively to new aspirations. It no longer represents contemporary Australia.
Let me repeat that:
It no longer represents contemporary Australia.
Mr Button said this; not me. He said:
It may not even represent its members any more: its national body has become an offshore island adrift from the rest of the party, inaccessible to its rank and file, a barren and rocky outcrop untouched by new ideas—
except those they borrow from us! Mr Blair is pretty intelligent; he got rid of the union movement. It took some courage, but he did it, and the policies that he has adopted are called the `third way'. Do you know what that is? It is the Left grabbing our ideas, rebadging them and saying, `They're ours.' That is what has happened in the Labor Party and the Left over the last 20 years. They may have state governments and they might build nice highways, but the best the Labor Party can do these days is become a pack of straighteners and managerialists. The right wing of the ALP has made that party a pack of managerialists and straighteners—they are all that is left, because they lost the big issues of the 20th century. I will move on to structural problems.
—Tell us about Enron!
—I concede that there can be peccadilloes by individuals on both sides of politics. I accept that. I certainly do not claim to be closer to the angels than Senator Hutchins is. The point, of course, is that it is not so much about whether individual Liberal senators or individual Labor Party senators are good or bad but about whether the structure and the organisation of a party are corrupt. The Labor Party are dominated by an increasingly irrelevant bunch of people—namely, the trade unions. Once again, you might think, `Oh, that's not right'—they are tethered to the trade union movement. I will again quote from former Senator Button. At page 36, he said:
In August 2001 unions made up less than 25 per cent of the total workforce and only 19.2 per cent of the private sector workforce.
This is the crux of why the Labor Party are irrelevant, this is why they are tethered to the trade union movement, and this is why they will go nowhere in the battle for ideas. Mr Button says: 
Unions affiliated with the Australian Labor Party represent less than 15 per cent of the workforce.
That is who they represent: less than 15 per cent—and they come in here and claim to speak for a majority of Australians! Less than 15 per cent of the work force is who they represent.
—And they do not like it, Senator Hutchins, when this is brought up. The one thing the Labor Party hate is when they are exposed as frauds—speaking for an absolute minority of working Australians. We represent ordinary Australians; the Labor Party do not. Mr Button refers at page 37 in his essay to `less than 15 per cent', Senator Evans. Mr Button continues: 
The past twenty-five years have seen no new union affiliations to the ALP in technical and professional areas. Membership of unions in the growth sectors of the economy—information technology, telecommunications, electronics, biotechnology and financial and business services—
and that is where this country is moving—
is low, sometimes tiny. 
They are not even attached to those parts of the economy that are growing. They represent less than 15 per cent of the workers of this nation, and they sit there with smirks on their faces saying that they represent the average Australian worker. It is pathetic, hypocritical and sanctimonious.
—The comparison is stacking branches with people who have left the country; that is your—
—Order! I know this is a very vigorous debate but I would ask all senators to conform to the standing orders of the chamber.
—Give him a Mogadon.
—Order! Senator Hutchins, do not interrupt while the chair is speaking. I ask all senators to tone it down a bit and observe the standing orders.
—If you thought, Senator Hutchins, that somehow the union hold over the Labor Party might have changed, you are wrong. I have a copy here of the Hawke-Wran report of August this year titled An enduring partnership: Labor and the union movement. Senator Ferris, it says that less than 15 per cent—
—Senator Mason, direct your remarks through the chair and not directly to other senators.
—The report An enduring partnership: Labor and the union movement says:
Unions affiliated with the Australian Labor Party represent less than 15 per cent of the workforce.
How pathetic! I think my friend Senator Evans said something about factions; so does Mr Button. Let us get to that now. He says on page 21 that in Labor:
These disputes represent something important. They are signs of a Labor Party corrupted by petty conflicts, dominated by what unionist Martin Foley calls factional `warlords'—
that is them sitting over there—
and distracted from its historic purpose. This is the new inward-looking, corrosive culture of the ALP.
Of course, factional disputes are hardly unknown to the Labor Party. What is new is the domination of the party hierarchy by a new class of labour movement professionals—
there they are—
who rely on factions and unions affiliated to the party for their career advancement. These people come from the ranks of political advisers, trade union policy officers and electoral office staff. Individually they can be thoughtful and decent people.
I think that is right; I can see some individually thoughtful and decent people—
Collectively—
the Labor Party are collectivists—
they are destroying the diversity and appeal of the ALP and its affiliated unions.
Mr Button states in his essay: 
The overall effect on the ALP has been profoundly destructive. Federally, the party is in retreat. Its primary vote, its membership and the breadth of people it sends to parliament are all shrinking. These things are intimately connected, and they are made possible by a party structure that has barely changed in the past century, that is moribund and out of touch with contemporary society. 
He goes on to say:
What had replaced a broad spectrum of backgrounds was a new class of political operator who had been filtered through the net of ALP machine politics. Out of a total of ninety-six members, fifty-three came from jobs in party or union offices. 
And I wonder why they are irrelevant to policy debate! What more can I say? It gets worse, far worse.
—There's more!
—There is a lot more, and this is perhaps the worst part. It goes on to say:
The narrowing parliamentary base is symbolised by the predominance of a number of holy families of Labor politics—
this Comcar aristocracy that the Labor Party has developed—
Once upon a time it was conservative clans like the Downers and the Anthonys who tended to monopolise parliamentary dynasties, but today the ALP has a rival list that reads like a row of gentlemen's outfitters in the lower end of Bond Street: Beazley and Son, Crean and Son, Ferguson Brothers, Fitzgibbon and Son, Brown and Hoare (father and daughter), McClelland and Son ... The list goes on, and they are all worthy and respectable concerns; there can be no serious objection to their continuing in the family business. Between them, however—
and listen to this—
the present generation of dynastic representatives makes up about 10 per cent of the ALP lower house.
Ten per cent of the Labor members of the House of Representatives are part of a dynasty—and they are against hereditary monarchies! The argument I am developing is that while there are individual peccadilloes, and I concede there are on all sides, the institutional corruption—indeed, the sordid institutional corruption—in the ALP is much worse simply because of its tethering to the union movement. Mr Button says on page 28:
Unions, of course, have had a long involvement in politics. They started the ALP and once dominated party conferences with numbers and ideas. They pumped their best-qualified members into parliament, often from self-educated and politically motivated rank and file members. Now it is the other way around.
Mr Button writes:
ALP factions try to capture the allegiance of unions to advance the interests of a breed of Labor professionals.
Not to advance the workers but to advance the breed of Labor professionals. He says:
These professionals do not come from the rank and file of union members, and so a gap widens between the leadership of the union and its members. Too often the members switch off politics as a result, to the long-term detriment of the ALP.
I will make one last mention of Mr Button's article before I get onto even more interesting themes. He says:
Hyped-up by the heady tribalism of group loyalty, factional warriors—
and there they sit—
are primed to suffer, like athletes overdosed on steroids, from testicular atrophy when confronted by the real enemy.
Quite right. I have never been afraid—not of this lot. He goes on:
They can make good constituent members, but in parliament their identity is swamped by sexual fealty and the need for tribal approval.
You see: testicular atrophy. He continues:
Because of this a curious phenomenon occurs: they often have no strongly developed sense of difference from the Liberals sitting opposite them.
Because we have won the battle of ideas, they want to be like us.
—I don't know why you don't go home if you've won everything.
—You might think I am saying nasty things about my friends opposite, but I have tagged all their backgrounds in the Parliamentary Handbook, and I will get to that in a minute, because I am sure the gallery will be amused. I note, and I say again, that we have our peccadilloes in the Liberal Party—I concede that—and I know the Labor Party does. But the difference is the institutional tethering of the Labor Party by the union movement. I did not see it but I understand that Senator Ray had a go at my preselection yesterday. Then I had this memory—a flash—going back over 20 years, Senator Hutchins. 
—You should be a preacher, you know.
—Yes. In fact, perhaps it was divine! When Senator Ray said that my preselection was bitter and everything else, I remembered—I may have been at high school or just at university, but it was the late seventies to early eighties—when Senator Ray knocked off that old leftie Jean Melzer. That was the most bitter struggle in the Labor division in Victoria ever. And apparently that is okay, but a close run in the Liberal Party is not okay. I remember, even as a student, that I thought it was all right. Do you know why? I thought, `They got rid of an old leftie—that's good.' And I applauded Senator Ray for doing it. I thought, `Great stuff. Get rid of an old leftie from the Labor Party. That's good for democracy.' But do you know what? It was the most bitter, the most sordid and the most disgusting campaign. I do not care about how Senator Ray got here, because I used to think he performs a good job, but the fact that the best and the brightest of the Labor Party spent all their time going through the gutters and the rubbish of this place makes me sick. I will take on Senator Ray in a policy debate any day of the week and win.
Someone like Senator Ray or Senator Faulkner—bright people though they are— will never come in here and debate policy, because when they do they lose. The one constant is that they always lose. So what they do is they think, `We'll see if we can find a bit of rubbish, a bit of dirt, a bit of this and a bit of that and we might get somewhere.' They will never come in here and debate taxation policy, industrial relations reform or welfare reform, because if they do they will lose—because they are irrelevant. That is what makes me so sick about this debate: the best and the brightest of the Labor movement have nothing new to say on the agenda. It is becoming increasingly apparent, so they come in here and talk about the internal structures of the Liberal Party. The day that the Labor Party get over the union movement and have the courage to say, `We only represent less than 15 per cent of the work force, we should do something about this,' is the day they can come in here and lecture to us. They are irrelevant because they represent no-one except the professionals climbing up the greasy pole to end up in this place.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1,speech
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2002-08-22,"—The Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 has a seemingly very innocuous name. Unlike the government's colourfully and, I think, inaccurately titled bills like More Jobs Better Pay, A New Tax System or the quite strangely named fair termination bill, this bill would have you believe that it was simple and plain and that it would change the way that the Commonwealth Electoral Act works for the betterment of our nation. Nothing is further from the truth. All politicians are aware of the community's view of us all. There is a sense of disengagement and contempt for political processes. I think the community would welcome positive and sensible reforms of the electoral process. 
 (Senator Forshaw)—Order! Excuse me, Senator McLucas. Would honourable senators on my right resume their seats or leave the chamber if they wish to have a conversation.
—I think the community would welcome a thorough review of our political processes and our electoral system. But this seemingly innocuously named bill does nothing like that. It is simply a bill to solve the internal problems and factional wars of the Liberal Party.
This bill is designed to use the processes of the parliament to manage the power battles and struggles in the Liberal Party, both nationally and between the states. It is to my mind an outrageous abuse of the parliament and the parliamentary system. Essentially, the bill allows the federal secretariat of the Liberal Party to control the disbursement of all the public funding due to the Liberal Party following an election. Liberal Party state divisions would only receive the proportion of public funding agreed to with their federal secretariat. It is a bill about money; it is a bill that strips electoral public funding from the state based organisations and provides it to the federal secretariat. It is a bill that should be called `Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (Liberals Dash For Cash)', if the government were following true to form in the way that they have misnamed other legislation in this place. It is reasonable, I believe, for the community to ask why it is that the parliament is spending all of this time—I say, wasting all of this time—talking about the internal processes of a political party. The answer is that the Liberals cannot, will not and do not talk to each other. It is across these benches that we, the parliamentarians of this country, have to solve the internal problems of the Liberal Party. 
All of the state branches of the Liberal Party are in enormous disarray, and the Queensland branch of the Liberal Party, more than any of the others, is the champion of factional warfare. Over the last few months in Queensland we have seen the most unseemly public brawling reported in the newspapers and other media. It seems that every Friday night we see a trooping of the factional chiefs off to Liberal Party headquarters to carry out the next stage of the battle. We see the sad and sorry Leader of the Liberal Party of Queensland pleading for his party to adopt electoral reform. We see the Leader of the Liberal Party leading a parliamentary party of three: himself, Dr David Watson and Mrs Joan Sheldon. The Liberals are irrelevant in Queensland—they have three seats out of 89. One would wonder what they are squabbling about!
The only game you can play with three players is piggie-in-the-middle. I think that Mr Quinn is the unfortunate player standing in the middle trying to catch that ball—the prize. The prize in my mind is party electoral democracy, but he just cannot catch it. He has tried—a couple of weeks ago he tried very hard. He tried to do what Peter Beattie has done so successfully, I believe, in Queensland in cleaning up internal party electoral corruption. Peter Beattie has done it showing enormous leadership. He got rid of the `rorters'—to use his language. It was tough and it was hard, but he did it. However, it is too hard for the Liberal Party. Mr Quinn himself said:
Peter Beattie has shown us what to do ...
We have to move to put those sorts of reforms in place in our own party. We can't bury our head in the sand.
Mr Quinn tried to adopt the Beattie style electoral reforms that had cleaned up corruption in the Queensland branch of the ALP, but he has failed. In the Liberal Party in Queensland you can still vote in a preselection if you are not an Australian citizen or even if you do not live in the electorate for which you are selecting a candidate. Surely that is a fundamental democratic principle for any preselection process, but unfortunately it would seem that Mr Quinn will fail in his attempt to clean up electoral rorting within the Liberal Party in that state. As I said, Mr Quinn failed to deliver party reform to stop branch stacking but then, as has been reported very widely, he also lost the stack itself.
On 9 August this year, we saw unprecedented growth in the membership of the Liberal Party of Queensland—20 per cent growth. A total of 800 new members were joined up on that evening, adding to the membership of 4,500. The Santoro-Carroll faction, which includes the state president, Mr Caltabiano, stacked 500 votes, it is said, on that night. It is important to note that Senator Brandis and Senator Mason are part of that group. The scuttlebutt is that they will have the numbers to preselect Mr Santo Santoro, the failed member for Clayfield, as a replacement for Senator Herron. That will not please a number of women in the Liberal Party of Queensland, especially Kathy Sullivan, a former member of the House of Representatives, who has been arguing for and urging the Liberal Party to do the right thing and find a woman candidate to replace Senator Herron when he moves to his next appointment. But unfortunately I do not know that the women of the Liberal Party in Queensland actually carry a lot of weight. 
The other player of course is Mr Michael Johnson, the new member for Ryan. He is clearly at the moment the champion branch stacker in Queensland. He is the head of what is known as the `fly in, fly out branch' and is aligned with, but not a captive of, the Santoro-Carroll faction. Mr Johnson controls the largest membership of the Liberal Party in Queensland and is a powerful player— someone that requires respect from all of the combatants. It is said, though, that Qantas shares will rise in the lead-up to the state conference this year as some of the Liberal Party people have to travel from quite a long way, including from overseas. 
On the other side of the battle we have the old Bob Tucker faction, known as the `Western Suburbs Wets'. I understand that includes Senator Ian Macdonald, so there is also a division within this place. Mr Mal Brough has been busy in his attempt to win the stacker of the year trophy, but I do not know that he has quite made it. It is reported that he personally took most of the 300 new membership forms to party headquarters on 9 August and that those memberships were paid for with a small number of cheques. Mr Quinn has been attempting to rule out this sort of branch stacking. This is the sort of branch stacking that has been comprehensively ruled out by the work of Peter Beattie. We do not have that sort of corruption in the Labor Party anymore in Queensland because we dealt with it. Unfortunately, it seems that the Liberal Party in Queensland is not quite prepared to. Mr Quinn, as I said, is a member of this group—the Bob Tucker group—and I do not think it would sit well with his tough words about reform. As is reported in the Courier-Mail on 16 July, he said:
The reason I'm proposing these tougher reforms for the Liberal Party is I want to make the Liberal party respectable and electable and I think those are the key words here ...
If the community doesn't respect you, they won't elect you.
That is pretty clear: there are only three of them! The Courier-Mail article continues:
Mr Quinn said his party would not be electable or presentable until it stamped out branch-stacking.
But it is evident from the events of 9 August that his group are up to their ears in it as well. So you can say one thing, Mr Quinn, but then your actions have to sit well with your words. Mr Quinn went on:
I'm trying to hand the party back to the members of the party rather than the elected people sitting around state executive ...
It's that important.
Well, Mr Quinn, we will see at the state conference whether or not you have been successful in delivering to the Liberal Party the reforms that you speak of. In the Courier-Mail at a later date, he also said:
If we are going to clean up this party, then I need to work with people who do support the reforms that I am proposing. The current president isn't supporting them. He is more of a hindrance than a help, quite frankly.
Mr Quinn said:
Mr Caltabiano was not interested in complete reform and was part of a “small clique” of factional power brokers more interested in preserving their stranglehold than making the Liberal Party respectable enough to deserve election.
It is very unedifying. It is not a pretty sight. The actions of the Liberal Party in Queensland are undignified, just as this bill is an undignified misuse of this parliament. This should have been solved internally in the Liberal Party; it should not be wasting the time of this Senate or the parliament.
This bill is about money and power. Unfortunately, it seems that that is what the Liberal Party stands for. Last week the Howard government cabinet travelled to Cairns, the place where I live. When I heard that the cabinet was coming to Cairns I was initially very welcoming. It is very important that parliamentarians travel outside Canberra and the major cities to understand what is happening, especially in rural places. I was initially pleased that they were going to make some sort of attempt to connect with the community, to understand the issues that face people, especially in regional Australia. It is important, as I said, for parliamentarians to travel, to get to places outside the major cities and I always encourage it. It is an opportunity to understand those community concerns. But it became evident very early in the piece after we found out that the cabinet was coming that there was really no attempt at all for true community connection.
As an aside, I would like to explain what happens when Peter Beattie does what are called the `community cabinet visits' in Queensland. Every three weeks the cabinet travel to a regional place in Queensland. On the Sunday afternoon they sit down with community members at an open forum. Everyone is invited. There is an advertisement in the newspaper and everyone comes. Anybody can raise any issue from the floor. That lasts for a couple of hours and then the meeting breaks into smaller groups where each cabinet member sits at a table and anybody in the world can walk up and have a discussion with that cabinet member about the issue that concerns them. They are invited openly and freely and they do not pay a cent; anyone can come. Later on that Sunday evening—and it is the same pattern at every community cabinet meeting—Peter Beattie hosts an open barbecue or drinks. It is very cheap and once again anyone can come along. The following day the cabinet meet and then there is an open luncheon to which usually the local government invites whomever they would like to come along to it. These visits are very open, very communication based and extremely effective. It is something that the Beattie government should be commended for. I know community members across Queensland welcome these events as an opportunity to truly connect with their members of parliament. 
The contrast between those events that happen every three weeks in Queensland and the fanfare and palaver of the cabinet visit to Cairns could not be more extreme. The itinerary was a litany of publicity opportunities and fundraising events. In North Queensland we live in a wonderful part of Australia. Members of parliament and businesspeople are often criticised for travelling to our part of the world in the winter when it is 27 degrees, there are beautiful clear skies, Trinity Inlet sparkles and the Great Barrier Reef sits out there. People are often criticised for coming to North Queensland at that time of the year. I always say to them that that is unfair. We deserve parliamentarians to come to our part of the world, and we would like you to come when it is attractive and beautiful—not that it is not all the time, but it is always better in the winter. In fact, the logo of the convention centre is `Serious business in a stunning location'. We are serious in North Queensland about doing business but we do not like it when our community is treated in the way that I say the Howard cabinet treated us last week. It is important that MPs are always seen to be working.
There were three opportunities for the community to meet with the cabinet during their time in Cairns. The first one was at a cocktail welcome reception. It cost you $40 to go to that. According to Mr Entsch in the Cairns Post,450 people came along to that event. At a cost of, let us say, $15 per head, I would put the profit from that connection with community at about $11,250. So the Liberal Party of Leichhardt FEC made $11,250 by hosting an event where community members could meet the cabinet. That was on the Monday night. That was followed later in the evening by a dinner party. The Cairns Post put it beautifully:
Dinner with the Prime Minister for $2000 a plate.
We have done a bit of figuring on that one, too. Let us say that eight people sat at Mr Howard's table. That gives a net income from that table of about $16,000. I understand that not all members of the cabinet are worth $2,000—Mr Costello was worth $1,500, so $13,500 would have been collected from the eight or nine people who sat around that table. The other 15 ministers ranged in value from $750 to $1,500. Let us be conservative and say that they were all worth $750. That brings us to $101,250 that could have been made from those tables. With 170 people, the total income would be $130,750, less—let us say it was $50 a plate—$18,500, giving a final profit from the dinner with the Prime Minister—this event where we connect with the community, where we understand what the community thinks—of $122,200. The total income to the Leichhardt FEC would be $135,450—not a bad thing if you can do it.
Debate interrupted.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-08-22,"—I rise to speak briefly to the Family Law Amendment (Child Protection Convention) Bill 2002. It is an example of the government actually implementing, through legislation, international conventions. It is worth noting that fact, given this government's own propensity from time to time to criticise and to be seen to be undermining the importance of international conventions, particularly ones relating to human rights, such as this one. This government uses rhetoric to suggest that we should not be dictated to by people in Geneva or by people in ivory towers in the UN and that we should determine for ourselves what we wish to do, despite the fact that we have signed up to particular conventions.
However, as this legislation shows, whilst that may be good rhetoric to appeal to the anti-internationalists, quasi-One Nation vote, it is not reflected in the reality of how the government operates in practice a lot of the time, thankfully. This legislation is one example of that, where it implements an international convention that the government has adopted and incorporates it into law. It is worth emphasising that, because I do not think there is a common misunderstanding amongst the Australian public that Australia's ratification of an international convention does not automatically make it enforceable in Australia. If there is no other law to the contrary, it is certainly open to courts to take that into account when interpreting how existing laws should be enforced or how they should operate. Unless the convention is specifically incorporated in Australian law, then it has no direct legal effect.
That is nowhere more evident than in areas such as the refugee area. Whilst the refugee convention is partly incorporated in the Migration Act, it is also regularly and repeatedly undermined in the Migration Act through various components of it. The many breaches of the refugee convention that this government continues to allow to occur daily do so because our national law allows it, despite the fact that we have ratified an international convention. This is even more the case in a convention such as the Convention Against Torture, which we have ratified and, technically, are accountable to. But we have not incorporated it in Australian law, so there is no mechanism for people to legally enforce through the courts their right to protection under the Convention Against Torture, despite the fact that Australia has ratified it. They do have an option, if all their legal avenues have been exhausted, to go to the relevant UN committee overseeing that, which can examine their situation. But the government is under no compulsion to pay any attention to what that committee finds or, indeed, whilst the committee makes its considerations, even to allow the person to remain in the country. The government has followed that convention to allow that to happen in previous times, but it is purely on its own wishes. There is no legal requirement for it to do so, and there is no legal way that people, if they have a complaint before the relevant UN committee, can enforce the government to do so. All we are left with in that area is ministerial discretion, which ministers can use or not use as they choose, without any right for that to be compelled through a court.
It is important to emphasise that, under many of these crucial human rights treaties, such as the Convention Against Torture, whilst it is obviously good if Australia ratifies them, we are reliant in many cases purely on the goodwill of the government of the day. Even if one were to suggest that this government and its current minister operated in an appropriate way in that area—and that is, in the very least, debatable—there is no legal guarantee that future governments will feel bound to uphold the conventions they have signed. That is a long way of saying that bills like this are important and welcome, because they do actually put into legislation the principles that we have signed up to in conventions, so that people will have a legal right and are able to seek legal remedy if those rights are breached or if they need to be enforced. 
It is an important process and it is an important bill, and the Democrats support it. But it needs to be emphasised that, whilst it might seem a run-of-the-mill thing to simply reflect international conventions in legislation, it actually does not happen automatically. It does not happen as often as it should. I think there is no surer way of undermining our credibility as a nation and our support for international conventions than if we ratify them and then flout them, regardless of the topic, but particularly in areas like human rights. 
Australia needs to play an effective role internationally as an advocate for strong human rights protection—I believe we have played that role effectively in the past—and it is one of the constructive international approaches we can take. But we cannot be effective at it if we preach to other governments, saying, `You should pick up your act on human rights; you should ratify these conventions; you should meet these standards,' and breach them ourselves. That is one, amongst many, of the real tragedies of this government's flagrant abuses of human rights in the refugee area in the last couple of years, and that is an extra negative consequence of those actions. When we perform so badly ourselves, it dramatically reduces our ability to effectively advocate and push internationally for better performances by other nations.
This bill relates to the child protection convention and the family law components of that, which in many ways are tangential to the refugee issues but they do have a common link in the recognition of the fundamental rights of children and putting children's interests first. I have circulated a second reading amendment to emphasise this fact. I have decided not to go with moving amendments to the bill, because I do not want to hold up its passage, but I do think it is important for the Senate to express an opinion about the broader issue.
The child protection convention that this bill deals with stresses the need to improve the protection of children in international situations. It notes the importance of international cooperation for the protection of children, which the bill deals with. The convention confirms that the best interests of the child are to be of primary consideration and it reinforces the obligation of Australia to protect refugee and internationally displaced children. It specifically makes reference to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which is a much broader convention that we are also a signatory to. That is another convention that we have regularly breached, and continue to breach—not just under this government but also under the previous Labor government—with our insistence on detaining children for prolonged periods of time.
We have the recent outrageous case of the Bakhtiyari family being detained in Woomera for over 18 months while the father was out in the community. There have been allegations from the minister about whether the father has told the truth and whether or not his story is genuine. That is an important issue, but it is irrelevant to the fact that this family had a parent recognised as a refugee under our system out in the community but being kept separate from his wife and children. I do not think you would get a more blatant breach not just of the refugee convention, which recognises the importance of immediate family reunification, but also of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Imprisoning children should be absolutely a last resort and for absolutely the minimum time possible. There can be no excuse for those children to have been kept in jail—and they are still there— for over 18 months, without any certainty as to how much longer they will be there, while a parent is legitimately out in the Australian community. That goes directly to the protection of children and the broader Convention on the Rights of the Child. If we are serious about not just the content of legislation and treaties like these but also the spirit, intent and aim of treaties like these, we need to make that clear. We need to put on the record a clear statement that we reinforce that the best interests of the child must be given primary consideration. 
The practice of mandatory detention of child asylum seekers has been widely condemned throughout the Australian community, even by people who are broadly supportive of other aspects of this government's approach to unauthorised arrivals. The area of ongoing detention of children is one that I believe the majority of the community are not supportive of and are keen to see other alternatives explored. There have been no serious attempts to adopt other alternatives by this government; instead, we have a situation where, at any time a child story becomes public and there is a potential for public sympathy to come out, the relevant child, their family or their circumstances are dragged through the mud and they are discredited in some way or other. Quite frankly, while it is important to get the truth of what people's circumstances are, in relation to children, I do not care. They should not be locked up for prolonged periods of time. They should not be locked up at all unless there is a very strong case, and we should not be deliberately confusing the issue between looking after the interests of the child and any broader issues about the credibility or otherwise of their parents. If there is one group that are the most innocent victims of displaced people, of refugees, of people-smuggling—of all of those things—it is the children. They should not be the pawns and victims of government policy, particularly one that has been driven so clearly for political reasons.
So apart from reinforcing the importance of the best interests of the child being taken into consideration, the amendment specifically condemns the practice of detaining child asylum seekers and calls on the government to detain children only as a matter of last resort. I think this is a fundamental principle that should be expressed. It is relevant to the bill, because it specifically mentions not just family law situations but also the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which it links to. It is part of the schedule of the convention, it is part of the principles that Australia has signed up to and it is part of the broader principle of respecting the conventions that we adopt not just in word but in practice. I believe this amendment will play an important role both in sending that message and in reinforcing it for the future implementation of this particular act.
Having said that, the act itself is one that we support and we do not wish to hold up its passage. But we do believe the principles within it need to be reflected more broadly in the policy approach this government takes towards children across the board. That is not the case at the moment. Children's best interests are not being put first; in fact, they are not being put anywhere other than dead last if they happen to be in a refugee or asylum seeker situation. That is something the Democrats believe needs to be changed. Amongst virtually everything else that needs to be changed about the approach this government takes to asylum seekers its approach to children is the one thing that I think has to change most urgently and most comprehensively. I commend the amendment, along with the bill, to the chamber. I move Democrats second reading amendment:
At the end of the motion, add:
		“But the Senate:
	(a)	recognises that the Child Protection Convention:
	(i)	stresses the need to improve the protection of children in international situations;
	(ii)	recalls the importance of international cooperation for the protection of children;
	(iii)	confirms that the best interests of the child are to be a primary consideration; and
	(iv)	reinforces the obligation of Australia to protect refugee and internationally displaced children;
	(b)	and therefore:

	(ii)	calls upon the Government to detain children only as a measure of last resort, and then only for the shortest appropriate period of time, necessary to conduct background health and identity checks”.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2002-08-22,"—Labor supports the second reading amendment to the Family Law Amendment (Child Protection Convention) Bill 2002, moved by the Australian Democrats. Perhaps I can add that the bill highlights the complexities that arise in national disputes involving children, yet equal complexities do arise in laws and regulations affecting children between states in Australia. We do sometimes lose sight of the fact that, as governments, we should be trying to make sure that the best interests of children are put first when determining how to resolve these complexities. It does require a lot of hard work and cooperation between states and the Commonwealth, which is sometimes difficult to obtain. The detailed work that went on in the preparation and review of this bill is a sign that it can be done in the area of children and youth. Labor has highlighted areas where more work needs to be done to protect our children's interests, in particular the need for a children's commissioner, which we believe will further the best interests and protection of children nationally.
As an independent statutory office, a children's commissioner would be able to consider the best interests of children and advocate, both to the government and to the public, measures to advance the interests of children in society. Details of the proposal were announced by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Simon Crean, in May on the occasion of this bill. I commend Labor's proposal to the Senate in relation to a children's commissioner and support the second reading amendment moved by the Australian Democrats.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT (CHILD PROTECTION CONVENTION) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2002-08-22,"—I rise to speak on the Family Law Amendment (Child Protection Convention) Bill 2002. This bill seeks to amend the Family Law Act 1975 so that it is consistent with the Hague Convention on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Cooperation in respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children—the child protection convention— thus enabling Australia to ratify that convention. As its long title indicates, the convention defines when a national court or administrative body has jurisdiction in respect of a child, what law it should apply, the circumstances in which a national court or administration body should recognise a foreign determination affecting a child and provides for cooperation through central authorities between member states—that is, countries that are a party to the convention. It applies to parental rights existing by operation of law such as the attribution of parental responsibilities to each of the natural parents at birth, to court orders and to administrative decisions. As defined in article 3, it broadly covers three types of situations: firstly, the private sphere of parental responsibility, custody and access rights—and this is the most important aspect of the convention; secondly, the public sphere of child protection by or on behalf of public authorities; and, thirdly, the property rights of children. 
It is said that the advantages of the convention for Australia would include, firstly, the clarification of responsibilities and the elimination of conflicts in jurisdiction between Australia and overseas authorities in relation to child protection and family law matters. Secondly, it would ensure recognition and enforcement abroad of Australian court orders and other measures of protection overseas where appropriate. Thirdly, it would provide mechanisms for child protection authorities in Australia and other countries to cooperate in relation to protective measures for an Australian child abroad or a child returning to another country who is subject to Australian protective measures.
The Family Law Association of New South Wales commends the ratification of the Hague convention insofar as it strengthens and extends the rights of children who are wrongfully removed from their country of habitual residence and extends the rights of the parent left behind. The association also supports the objective of enhancing the effectiveness of provisions for the protection of children from abuse and neglect. However, the association notes that many signatory states have applied their obligations to the convention in an entirely unsatisfactory way. Recent cases involving children wrongfully removed from their mothers from Greece and Mexico have caused great concern, and this could be seen to undermine Australia's reputation as a signatory. 
I now give an example of how the child protection convention works in relation to applicable law. Article 51.1 of the convention states a principle long applied by Australian courts: once the court has jurisdiction it shall apply its own law. However, article 15.2 gives the court an option by way of exception to apply the law of another state— not necessarily that of another contracting state—with which the situation has a substantial connection. The law of the forum will therefore be applied in most situations even if the child is foreign. Questions as to whom residency will be granted, or in whose favour an order for contract should be made, will be determined by local law. But this does not apply to the issue of whether a person has parental responsibility by operation of law, by agreement or by some other act— such as recognition of paternity—which does not require the intervention of a court of administrative authority.
Article 16 subjects those issues to the law of the state, not necessarily a contracting state, of the habitual residence of the child. A change in the child's habitual residence will not extinguish by itself an already existing parental responsibility even if the law of the new residence does not confer parental responsibility on that person. Thus, if a child of unmarried parents is taken from eastern Australia to England, the father will be treated in England as retaining parental responsibility even though English law does not confer it on an unmarried father. But if the new habitual residence confers parental responsibility, when the old one did not, that person gains parental responsibility under the new law. In the converse case of the example given, an English unmarried father will gain parental responsibility in England and Australia—assuming they are both contracting states—if the child moves to eastern Australia. It is not necessary in either case that the father change his habitual residence. The court of the new habitual residence may, of course, by orders made according to its own law, extinguish or grant another parental responsibility notwithstanding the provisions of article 16.
In essence, the bill does not appear to take away any rights of the states to deal with the matters of child protection and interventions. Nor does it appear to seek any significant level of uniformity on how child protection intervention will be determined, implemented or executed across state boundaries. In other words, families seeking consistency between countries in matters of child protection will be sorely disappointed. Rather, it appears to focus purely on the matter of jurisdiction where a child may have been moved from one country to another or through multiple jurisdictions over any given period of time. I draw the minister's attention to clause 17 of the bill which reads:
At the end of subsection 67P(1) Add: 
; or (f) with the leave of the court that made the location order: 
(i) the Commonwealth central authority; or 
(ii) a central authority or a competent authority of a Convention country. 
The bill is reasonably straightforward, although by necessity it is complex in its functions because of the issues related to it. My concern is that, in relation specifically to clause 17, the second sentence appears to make the provision ambiguous. It appears to say that as soon as a parent absconds, or with a legal right changes to another state with a child and takes up residence there, it becomes the child's habitual state of residence as a matter of fact. In other words, in terms of residency, under the bill it becomes a fact that they are habitually resident in the new area rather than a fact that is determined by law. The bill clearly states that the fact that the child moves, either by being abducted or by legal means, changes the habitual residency place. It is not the fact that it is decided at law that it has moved. The mere fact of change of residence makes it habitual instead of considering the meaning of `habitual'. 
I want to place on record the fact that One Nation supports the bill. As I said, we have some concerns whether it will deliver the outcomes of security for the parents of the children involved, and we are concerned that by merely relocating, the legislation as it stands clearly sets out that the child's place of residency has changed. I look forward to the minister's contribution. ",SENATE,<title>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT (CHILD PROTECTION CONVENTION) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1,speech

To save us going into committee, I want to answer a question that Senator Harris raised. In reply to Senator Harris, may I say that, although the law says that habitual residence would be a fact, it would not be a fact if there were an abduction because it would be illegal and the abduction convention would overrule that. If it were an illegal abduction—as an abduction is—that would not be a fact. 
—What if it was a legal movement?
—That would be a different situation. If it were an abduction, it would obviously not be a fact. I thank all honourable senators and I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2002-08-22,"—My question is to Senator Alston, the Minister representing the Minister for Education, Science and Training. What action does the government propose to take to address the concerns expressed by Professor Frank Fenner, the recipient of this year's Prime Minister's Prize for Science, about the future of scientific research in Australia following the government's drastic funding cuts? Is the minister aware that Professor Fenner has said that he is concerned about the government's policy on the commercialisation of research and that:
... with the fall off in direct government spending and the dependence on commercial support, the chance for doing blue sky research, something for which there is no apparent commercial end in view, is diminished.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Scientific Research: Funding Cuts</title>,Questions Without Notice,13,1,question
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2002-08-22,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Minister, had Professor Fenner's remarks been edited in the published video displayed to the dinner the other night? Were statements to the effect that I have read today broadcast on ABC's Radio National yesterday? I can quote those words directly. Professor Fenner said that he was concerned about the `fall-off in direct government spending and the dependence on commercial support' and that `the chance for doing blue sky research, something for which there is no apparent commercial end in view, is diminished.' Further, is it also the case, since you cite ABS figures—and the Group of Eight also cites ABS figures—that the fall-off in GDP has in fact been from 1.68 per cent to 1.4 per cent, which is an equivalent of $3.5 billion in support for science and research in this country?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Scientific Research: Funding Cuts</title>,Questions Without Notice,13,1,question
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2002-08-22,"—I am not sure whether Senator Carr is referring to remarks made by Professor Fenner, as I understand the correct pronunciation to be, at the Prime Minister's science awards the other night. If he was then that is not my recollection of what he said. Professor Fenner certainly did emphasise the importance of blue sky research. I think we all understand the significance of that—in the same way that we do not want an obsessive emphasis on the sciences as opposed to the humanities—but that is a far cry from suggesting that somehow there have been drastic funding cuts. I certainly do not think he said that to the audience. Maybe he had a word to Senator Carr afterward or maybe, as usual, Senator Carr was away with the fairies and was making up notes of things that he would have liked Professor Fenner to have referred to. 
The fact is that the latest ABS statistics show that Australia's gross expenditure on R&D in 2000 and 2001 was at an all-time high of more than $10 billion—more than $1 billion higher than it was in the previous survey. All of those present the other night were very laudatory of the government's efforts with Backing Australia's Ability. They were too polite to say that the poor, unfortunate `noodle nation', which disappeared without trace, offered not the slightest sense of encouragement to them. It was all funding on the never-never and it did not touch the sides.
Those present were extraordinarily grateful for what we have committed ourselves to over the next few years. The announcement of the awards, the Federation Fellowships and all of the things that are happening now in a very dynamic scientific sector are very positive indeed. Certainly, as far as the government is concerned, Backing Australia's Ability is going to provide an enormous fillip to the scientific community. Priorities will need to be set and we have already started down that path but, at the end of the day, we will be encouraging research in all its manifestations.
Senator Carr should not for a moment try to suggest that Professor Fenner was standing up there being critical. As I recall it, almost his opening remark was, `It is 20-odd years since I retired and I'd feel very diffident talking about current public policy issues.' I think that, if you put Professor Fenner's remarks in context, you will see that he was stressing the importance of blue sky research, but he was not for a moment suggesting that what has happened in the last couple of years has not been enormous progress.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Scientific Research: Funding Cuts</title>,Questions Without Notice,13,1,answer
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2002-08-22,"—I do not know if Senator Carr meant to say what he said, but he talked about a fall-off in GDP. I am sure that is not right—I presume that he meant the proportion of GDP devoted to science. The fact is that this year's science and innovation budget exceeded $5 billion for the first time. That $3 billion package is making a huge difference. You offered no serious alternative. You dithered for about nine months as to whether you would endorse it. You finally came out with that very amusing alternative to a policy proposal, but there was no serious financial commitment. I think that the science community well and truly understands who is backing the right horse and who is not. They understand our commitment to innovation and to research in all of its manifestations.

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2002-08-22,"—No, it is not. The matter is off the Notice Paper. You know that. It was disposed of yesterday. I can understand your exquisite sensitivity on this issue, because once again it is a classic example of laziness. Rather than have your union masters get out there and work for a living and persuade people to join unions because of their inexorable decline, you want to impose a non-performance levy. In other words, what you have in mind is to just rake hundreds of dollars into union coffers so that you will be able to have this cosy relationship continue indefinitely.
The facts are that the contribution of the union movement in recent years to the Labor Party has been little short of spectacular in financial terms but, at the same time, you have less than 20 per cent of the private sector now choosing to belong to unions. There is a fundamental disconnect here between servicing the needs of workers and servicing the needs of unionists. What do workers want? Workers want increases in wages and salaries and conditions. They want a better standard of living. They want security for their families. What do unionists want? Of course, they want money, power and influence, but they also want security. But it is a different form of security. What they want is the free trip into parliament. When you have done a few years apprenticeship, you actually end up in the Senate. What did we see after all these modernisation reforms? Come 1 July, there were six new members of the Labor Party in the Senate. Four of them are trade union officials. Two of them represent the public sector, which is what you would expect, and, of the other two, one is simply a party official and the other, representing the real community, is an academic lawyer. There it is: a party that looks like Australia?

Honourable senators interjecting—
—Order! There are far too many interjections on both sides of the house. I ask you to come to order.
—Mr President, I rise on a point of order, which relates to your ruling yesterday on the point of order taken by Senator Abetz on Tuesday. It relates to standing order 73. Standing order 73(4) says:
In answering a question, a senator shall not debate it.
Mr President, you ruled narrowly—as it was termed in this chamber—on Senator Abetz's point of order in relation to this section of the standing orders about questions. I ask you now to apply the same standard that you applied in your ruling on questions to answers, under standing order 73(4). Clearly, the minister is not answering the question. Clearly, he is debating it. Normally, the point of order would be on relevance, because what he is now saying is irrelevant to the question he was asked, but it is clear under the standing orders—and from the announcement you made yesterday on how the standing orders are to be interpreted—that this answer is out of order and that you should rule that the minister confine his remarks to the question, answer the question and not debate it. If he wants to debate it, he should be sat down immediately by you, under the standard that you now apply—with respect. 
—Senator Cook, I hear your point of order. I rule that there is no point of order, but I ask the minister to return to the question.
—Mr President, I rise again on a point of order: consistent with your ruling yesterday, you now rule there is no point of order. I accept your ruling, but would you please take on board what I have said and provide reasons why you think that questions should be narrowly confined but, in answers, ministers should be able to cut loose, irrespective of what the black letter of the standing orders says?
—I have taken notice of what you, Senator Faulkner and Senator Ray said yesterday and I have already asked the minister to return to the question.
—On a separate point of order, Mr President: could I ask that you also look at whether it is an abuse of parliamentary process for a question to debate an issue in the way that Senator Cook has. He was not quite clear on whether he was taking the debating point or the relevance point but, in either form, all he did was engage in a pretty low-level diatribe to distract attention from the embarrassment that the Labor Party obviously feel.
—We seem to be involving ourselves in a debate on points of order. I would ask you to return to the question.
—I will, with great enthusiasm. The fact is that the federal Labor Party are fundamentally at odds with their state colleagues on this issue of compulsory fees. Mr Carr said that you cannot put a tax on other members of the work force, and the state cannot require the collection of union fees from non-unionists. That is round 1. The Western Australian workplace relations minister, John Kobelke, said:
We think unions need to get out and provide services to their members and attract members on what they can offer.
We think that is right too. We agree entirely with him. In Victoria, Monica Gould—who I presume is a non-lawyer, so probably you would not kill her—says that there are legal difficulties with two parties agreeing to impose something on a third party. The fact is that part of the Labor Party—but it seems to be the state part—actually believes in performance and getting a reward. The other half does not; they think it is all about just raking in the dollars—from people who do not want to be raked in and do not want to contribute, because they do not think they are getting value for money—so that the unions can then have this wonderful closed circle where you end up shovelling people in here when they are past their use-by date. As Senator Cook clearly demonstrates today, even when you are well past it you are allowed to stay on. It really is a meal ticket for life on that side of the parliament. Let there be no doubt about it: we do not believe in coercion. We do not believe in forcing people. We believe in freedom of association and in people's rights to join organisations. We do not believe in this lazy method of collecting funds which can then be recycled back to the Labor Party at election time. Get serious about it.

Is it true that the notorious mobile squads who, amongst other things, are remembered for shooting four unarmed students at Port Moresby last year, are on hand, should a riot occur, to meet any emergency and are brought into play whenever a decision or a determination about the future of people on Manus Island is about to be announced?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Immigration: Border Protection</title>,Questions Without Notice,17,1,question

Has tear gas been involved in preparations? Are officers of the Australian Protective Service always in an official capacity on Manus Island as far as guard duties are concerned?

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-08-22,"—Senator Brown has raised a number of issues. The first is that of international criticism of our border management. I reject that totally. Internationally there has in fact been some following of our border management, and you need go no further than the governments of New Zealand and the United Kingdom, both Labour governments, following our policy on border management. Far from international criticism, there has been more international endorsement of our policy on border management. Indeed, at the people-smuggling conference in Indonesia this year, which I attended, it was recognised as appropriate that countries should look after their own sovereignty by way of border management and in relation to people-smuggling.
—Senator George Campbell should remember that Prime Minister Blair, a Labour Prime Minister, is following exactly the same path that we have adopted in Australia, as has the Labour Prime Minister in New Zealand. We have taken appropriate steps regarding our personnel at Manus Island in relation to local authorities and the authority they exercise. Not only at Manus Island but also at other institutions we exercise appropriate measures in maintaining order without resort to unnecessary force or the sorts of things that Senator Brown alluded to. In fact, we pay careful attention to the way we conduct the control of those institutions. If Senator Brown has any example of where we have allegedly overstepped the mark he should raise it, but I am not aware of any group being on stand-by at Port Moresby and I am not aware of any untoward action by the officers at Manus Island.

The response of the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts was somewhat incredible, and certainly he probably stretched credulity in his claims that he had no idea whether or not Mr Estens was a member of the National Party. The reality is that Mr Estens's own admission is that he was John Anderson's friend for over 10 years. Everybody knew he was a member of the National Party—he is in Mr Anderson's branch of the National Party! So I do not know where on earth Senator Alston has been, but it was common knowledge out there.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Could those members not participating in the debate move out of the chamber please.
—Senator Heffernan, you might take your conversation outside.
—At least Minister Alston had the courage, I suppose, to fess up that he knew who the other National Party member on this committee is and, of course, that is Mr Ray Braithwaite. He really had to say that because Mr Ray Braithwaite was in fact a member of the parliamentary National Party and a former National Party member for Dawson.
—And a very good one, too.
—Probably very good, but should he be on a so-called independent inquiry into telecommunications services in the regions? Why should it be a prerequisite that two out of the three members of a critical inquiry in relation to regional Australia be members of the National Party? How on earth the minister has got the hide to put out a press release that describes this inquiry as `independent' is, as I said before, unbelievable and incredible, and totally stretches credulity.
I want to make it very clear that the Labor Party is not saying that there should not be an independent inquiry into Telstra and what is going on. We have a major difficulty with this inquiry. First of all it is stacked. It is absolutely stacked. Two out of the three members are members of the National Party. How on earth can you hope to have anything like an independent outcome with regard to that? Secondly, we are not saying that this committee should not travel extensively around regional Australia. In fact, we would like to see this committee also have a look at some of the metropolitan areas as well. We would encourage this committee to travel widely. We just hoped that the members of the committee would be average members of the Australian community and not, as seems to be the prerequisite, paid-up members of the National Party. 
In relation to the view of the opposition, we would encourage the Estens inquiry to go to Cunningham and have a talk to the people of Cunningham about what they think in relation to Telstra and what they think in terms of the standards of behaviour. We will just see how serious this inquiry is. If it were serious it would go to Cunningham and it would talk to the people there in relation to Telstra so that they can make their own minds up when that by-election comes. Are they going to vote for any party in relation to the sale of Telstra, none of which are entirely signed up to not selling it, or are they going to vote for the only party in this chamber that has made its position absolutely clear in relation to the sale of Telstra, and that is the Labor Party? We are the only party in this chamber that has not flinched on the issue of the privatisation of Telstra. Every other party sitting in this room has made it very clear that they are prepared to deal, they are prepared to sell out or they are prepared to get a bucket of money. One of the Independents sitting in this chamber already has form in relation to this—a senator from my own state of Tasmania, Senator Harradine. Who knows how Senator Harradine is going to vote? We did not know until the last minute last time.
The reality is that this is a total political exercise. The reality is that in order to be a member of a so-called independent inquiry you first have to produce your National Party membership ticket and, if you want to be chair, you have to be a really good friend of John Anderson. The minister claims that he did not know these two facts—in John Anderson's branch? It is blatant. Couldn't you have even picked somebody who was not in John Anderson's branch—a semblance of independence?
I am sure the National Party is very happy with this, but the reality is that the outcome is predetermined. This committee will advise that Telstra is going to be sold. Otherwise, why would the time frame be 8 November? Let us get real here. Why didn't you push for a decent independent inquiry? Why didn't you have some guts in relation to trying to deal with the government? They have already ruled out the bucket of money. There is not going to be a bucket of money. Richard Alston confirmed that the other day. I think the National Party has yet again been sidelined and whitewashed.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Telstra: Regional Communications Inquiry</title>,Questions Without Notice,18,1,speech
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2002-08-22,"—Senator Mackay, the key thing about all three of these people is that they are regional people. They come from regional Australia, they understand regional Australia, and that is why all three of them have been appointed to this committee. They are from regional Australia. They are people involved in business. They live in regional Australia and they understand the needs of regional Australia. That is what we are trying to assess—the telecommunications needs of regional Australia.
—Of the National Party!
—No, of regional Australia. All three of them come from regional Australia. I will keep on repeating that for five minutes if necessary because that is the key criterion for their appointment. Let us have a look at their CVs. Dick Estens is a cotton farmer from Moree with a long history of involvement in community issues at local and national levels. While running his cotton business he has also been involved with the Moree Plains and Barwon Health Services, chaired the Gwydir Valley Cotton Growers Association and been involved in local Indigenous employment issues. He is a person very much involved in regional Australia.
Jane Bennett is the production manager and a director of Ashgrove Farm Cheese in Tasmania and was the ABC Radio Australian Rural Woman of the Year in 1997. In addition to her commercial experience, she has extensive public and community experience including as a member of the National Food Industry Council, the federal government's Trade Policy Advisory Council, the Tasmanian Together Progress Board and as Deputy Chair of the Food Industry Council of Tasmania. Tasmania, when it comes down to dairy farming, is very much regional Australia. So she is a good appointment too. Ray Braithwaite, who indeed was a member of the National Party in this parliament, comes from regional Australia—the area around Mackay in mid-North Queensland. 
—Where do you live? Metropolitan Perth?
—Senator Ray, the point is that Mr Braithwaite is somebody who comes from regional Australia. As far as my credentials go, I was born in the south-west, I grew up there and I lived for 25 years in the north-west, so I have pretty good regional credentials. Do not think you can make any progress in suggesting that I have other than excellent credentials for regional Australia.
Let us have a look at what the federal government has done in terms of assessing the needs of telecommunications in Australia. We set up the Besley inquiry in response to concerns that regional telecommunications were not up to scratch, that they were not equal to those provided in metropolitan areas. Indeed, that has proved to be the case. It has been shown that there were deficiencies in the level of services in regional Australia.
What have the government done since then? They have worked very hard and have spent a lot of money to improve telecommunication services in regional Australia. It follows, therefore, in a logical way, that it is quite reasonable to set up another inquiry to assess the level of progress and the improvements that have been made in telecommunications services to the regional parts of this country. It follows further that the logical and obvious people to put on that board of inquiry are people from regional Australia, and that is what we have done. We have put people on this board who have absolutely impeccable credentials as representatives of regional Australia. One could not ask for a better group of people. I am sure that they will very ably make an assessment of the improvements that have been made in telecommunications in regional Australia and also identify any areas which still need to be improved. The government will then be able to make a well reasoned decision about whether or not the improvements have met John Howard's commitment to not proceed with the further sale of Telstra until regional telecommunications levels have been satisfactorily met.

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2002-08-22,"—The government, again, are starting their softening up campaign on Telstra. When they first brought the bill into this chamber, they said, `We only want to sell one-third.' Then, within a week, they said, `Having sold one-third, it is untenable not to sell the other two-thirds because it is unfair to the people who have bought one-third of the Telstra shares.' That is the way the logic went.
The government have always had a little difficulty with their country cousins on this particular thing. The rednecks in the National Party have not always quite agreed with their city cousins on this. This has led to the making of certain promises to them. You do not want to actually go into an election campaign saying, `We're going to privatise Telstra.' That is too tough. What you do is you go into an election campaign saying, `We will hold an inquiry and, if the objective conditions are okay, we might then sell Telstra.' So, going into the last election, the coalition said, `We'll hold an inquiry.' They held an inquiry, but it did not come up trumps. So they are going to keep holding inquiries, and sooner or later they are going to get a jury that says, `You can sell Telstra,'—that is exactly what it is going to say—and they will sell Telstra.
We went into the last election, the election before that and the one before that saying, `We're not going to sell Telstra.' We gave our word that we would not sell Telstra, and we have been consistent on that. The absent ones from here, who are currently adding massively to Telstra's profits by ringing each other constantly, held a press conference and signed a pledge that they would not sell Telstra. They did it before the last election. The government was not the target; we were the target. They can be trusted, they said; because we had not actually gone before the cameras and signed off, we could not be trusted. We will put them to the test later this year when this report comes in, and we will see where they go. 
The argument put up by Senator Eggleston is quite farcical. He said, `On the committee you have to get people from rural areas, so what is wrong with two of them being members of the National Party?' This is supposed to be a genuine exercise. The fix is not supposed to go in at the start; it is supposed to go in at the finish. That is how the game is played. Being generous, 0.1 per cent of the Australian adult population are members of the National Party, yet on this inquiry two of the three members are members of the National Party. What a coincidence!
This minister has form. Remember when Mr David Barnett was appointed to the National Museum and he was asked how his name came forward. His answer was, `I think it was by osmosis.' We at least know on this occasion how the cotton-picker got onto the committee—he is a close mate of Mr John Anderson. Give Mr Anderson credit for thinking about a mate; none of us knock that. But we have to rely on that mate to suddenly chair this particular committee with objectivity. He may do so; that is possible. But we are at least a bit cynical that two out of three members of this committee are members of the National Party. The third one is most unlikely to be a National Party member because, as far as I know—and I might be corrected by colleagues in the chamber—there is not a National Party in Tasmania anymore. Poor old Julian went down there, tried to form a branch and about four people, half of whom work for his family, turned up. So we do not have a National Party in Tasmania. But do not worry about it; the Liberal Party is heading in the same direction, thanks to comrade Senator Eric Abetz.
If we had ever set up an inquiry into Telstra and put on it two Labor Party members out of three, the coalition party, if they were in opposition, would have gone absolutely berserk. They would have talked about the usual mantras of trade union mates. They would have whined and whinged, absolutely. They would have gone on and on. But, of course, the Liberal Party have clean hands; they have given the dirty work to the National Party. They are quite clever. They are not going to give it to their own. They will be able to say, `Two of your committee members have come back and said that we should sell Telstra.' So there is the moral sanction against you.
It is time the National Party representatives in this chamber looked after the interests of not only their own members but also their constituents. Selling out on Telstra without going to an election and getting a mandate on it—and you have never got a full mandate on the sale of Telstra—is wrong. To put up this sort of weak excuse: `We'll have an inquiry. We'll stack the inquiry and, by gosh, we'll accept its recommendations. If that doesn't work, we'll set up another inquiry a few months later,' is just not good enough. It is a really pathetic effort by the National Party of Australia.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Telstra: Regional Communications Inquiry</title>,Questions Without Notice,18,1,speech
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NP,2002-08-22,"—I can recall hearing exactly the same words in relation to the Besley inquiry: `Besley was a rort. Besley was stacked. Besley would bend over, kneel and bow at the altar of the coalition.' But what happened? Besley gave a very good and strong report which said that Telstra facilities were not up to scratch and which would not give a tick for the sale. We heard that. Now we are going to be challenged again because two people on an inquiry happen to be from the National Party. If you rule out people from rural Australia who are from the National Party, you would effectively rule out about 50 per cent of the farmers and other people connected with primary industry, because the National Party is part of primary industry and most farmers are. So, if the opposition are going to rule out people because they are in a political party, I would suggest that if they ever do get into government again they use their own mantra.
This is no more than a beat-up on the National Party. The Labor Party went to two elections—I can remember when we first came to government—and there were banners all around every polling booth, yards and yards of plastic banners encircling schools, saying, `We will not sell Telstra.' What did the electorate say? `We don't give a damn. We just don't want the Labor Party.' Bang, they were out. Never ones to learn from their mistakes, they did it again. What happened at the last election? Bang, they were out again. You never, ever learn from your mistakes, and that is why you will be over there in opposition for some time. Mr Braithwaite gave a report that telecommunications were not up to scratch. The National Party has been in the forefront of the coalition in getting $1 billion spent on rural telecommunications. Ninety-seven per cent of Queenslanders have access to a mobile phone. The ones who have not got access to a mobile phone can take a mobile that— 
—A satellite phone.
—Yes, they can use a satellite phone for access.
—Yeah, for about $2,000!
—That is subsidised. Everyone has Internet connection.
—What does it cost?
—It costs 83c a minute, and that is not much more than an ordinary telephone call. Of course, everyone has Internet access. What about untimed local calls? I have been in the National Party since 1974, and every time I went to a preselection meeting or a National Party meeting I said, `You've got to stop having timed local calls.' Everyone, whether you rang your next door neighbour or even another house on the same property, was charged the STD rate for their calls. All that has been removed—a billion dollars has gone into rural telecommunications. So do not say that the National Party has walked away from telecommunications in rural and regional Australia, because it is one of the great success stories of the National Party and the coalition in honouring a commitment to the bush. There is no better way to remove the tyranny of distance than by having a great telecommunications service. Rather than lie back in the traces and say, `Everything that has to be done has been done,' we are going to have another committee with Mr Estens on it. Mind you, Besley got the nod first. Besley was asked to do it even though he brought down a response that telecommunications services were not up to scratch. We did not say, `We don't like you, we don't like the answer you gave us; you're out.' We approached him again, but he said he did not want to do it. A person that I remotely know, Dick Estens, was suggested by John Anderson, not as a National Party person but as a person who had great standing in Moree. He is a very successful cotton grower. He is a person who got the community together on Aboriginal affairs and said, `Let us try to get these people decent, meaningful jobs,' and he put forward a program that was successful.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2002-08-22,"—The sham review of Telstra services is another example of how willing the National Party of Australia is to sell out its own constituency, and I want to develop that theme further. The first thing I want to talk about is some comments by Senator Ian Macdonald about exceptional circumstances applications where he said that some exceptional circumstances were questionable. I want him to come back to the chamber and tell the parliament just which exceptional circumstances lodged by state governments on behalf of drought affected communities are questionable. I would like him to do that today.
On the issue of the National Party, as I said, it is selling out its own constituency on Telstra. There is only one party in this chamber that is standing up for country people and their rights, particularly their right to have world-class telecommunications, and that is the Australian Labor Party. Increasingly, there is only one party in this parliament that actually asks country Australians what they think and then bothers to listen to the answer. The once great National Party, the defender of country Australia, is no more. There is no better example of this decline than the minister who holds the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry portfolio, Mr Warren Truss. This is a portfolio that the National Party used to take seriously. In fact, it is a position that the leader of the party used to claim as his own. When not occupied by the leader, the position was given to ministers of substance, but not anymore. Admittedly, the parliamentary National Party is not as big as it once was, but that is hardly an excuse. 
We now have a minister who is not up to the job in that portfolio, who has failed to give leadership to his department, who has failed to stand up and give rural industries a voice in cabinet, who has completely mucked up the administration of Australia's US beef quota, who has ignored the needs of the sugar industry, who has failed to negotiate with the states on reform of exceptional circumstance relief, despite the growing drought crisis in rural Australia, and who has failed to deliver a plan for Australian fisheries.
On the question of leadership, I have already informed the Senate this week of the crisis of confidence in the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. On Tuesday night, a senior departmental officer told a Senate inquiry that AFFA `does not have a view of quota arrangements that is of any relevance'. Either the minister has lost confidence in his department or the department has lost confidence in its minister. Either way, the minister must take responsibility when the Commonwealth department with responsibility for primary industries say that its views on quota administration are of no relevance.
A further example of the minister's failings is his inability to advance the interests of rural Australia and, by extension, the interests of rural Australia inside the cabinet room. If Minister Truss was doing his job, the federal Treasurer would not tell the financial press that drought had no relevance to the Australian economy. You did not hear comments like that from the Hawke and Keating governments, because primary industry ministers in those governments exercised their voices in cabinet and made sure that all ministers, from the Prime Minister down, knew what was happening in regional Australia and understood the nexus between regional Australia and overall economic wellbeing. Under this government the gulf between income and services in the country and those in the city has grown wider. It is in no small way the responsibility of National Party members who are unwilling or unable to stand up for their constituencies.
Perhaps the most spectacular example of Minister Truss's incompetence is his mishandling of the US beef quota crisis. A minister faced with the circumstances that Minister Truss was faced with a few months ago ought to have consulted widely and acted decisively. He failed to do both. A committee of this Senate is now doing the work that the minister should have done. It is no coincidence, I might say, that the Victorian Farmers Federation Pastoral Group passed a motion of no confidence in Minister Truss last month. On the question of sugar, yesterday during questions without notice in the other place the Prime Minister gave an answer that is instructive in this debate. When answering a question about the sugar industry, the Prime Minister made reference to the members of the government who are most concerned about this issue. There was a name missing from the list—that name is Minister Truss, the very minister responsible for this industry. It is no wonder that we have had two months of silence since the Hildebrand recommendations were handed down. I have touched on exceptional circumstances today. All senators will be aware of this issue. (Time expired)
—Mr Deputy President, I wish to respond to Senator O'Brien.
—You cannot, because you have participated in the debate.
—It is on another issue.
—You cannot—you have participated in the debate, Senator Boswell. I draw that to your attention.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Telstra: Regional Communications Inquiry</title>,Questions Without Notice,18,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-08-22,"—I present the government's response to the report of the Legal and Constitutional References Committee on its inquiry on the Human Rights (Mandatory Sentencing of Juvenile Offenders) Bill 1999, and I seek leave to incorporate the document in Hansard. 
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
Government Response to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee Report of the Inquiry into the Human Rights (Mandatory Sentencing of Juvenile Offenders) Bill 1999
The Government welcomes the report by the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee of its inquiry into the Human Rights (Mandatory Sentencing of Juvenile Offenders) Bill 1999. 
The Senate referred to the Committee the Bill and the following related matters:
(a)	the legal, social and other aspects of mandatory sentencing;
(b)	Australia's international human rights obligations in regard to mandatory sentencing laws in Australia;
(c)	the implications of mandatory sentencing for particular groups, including Australia's indigenous people and people with disabilities; and
(d)	the constitutional power of the Commonwealth Parliament to legislate with respect to existing laws affecting mandatory sentencing. 
Committee recommendation
The Committee recommended that the Bill be passed by the Parliament.
Government response
The Government does not accept the recommendation and notes that, in relation to the Northern Territory, the laws at which the recommendation was directed have been repealed by the Juvenile Justice Amendment Act (No.2) 2001 (NT), which repealed mandatory sentencing for juvenile offenders, and the Sentencing Amendment Act (No. 3) 2001 (NT), which repealed mandatory sentencing for property offences for adults, both effective from 22 October 2001.
Government Senators' recommendation
Interpreter services
Government Senators recommended that the Commonwealth Government support the Northern Territory with funding to assist the continuing development of an adequate interpreter service to ensure that young people who do not speak or understand English will not continue to be disadvantaged by the legal system.
Government response
The Government accepts the recommendation (see discussion below).
Government Senators also made a number of suggestions which are also discussed below. 
Discussion
As the report explains, the main issue with which the Committee was concerned was the application of mandatory sentencing laws to juveniles in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. The object of the Bill was to overturn those laws.
The Northern Territory
The report has been substantially overtaken by the repeal on 22 October 2001 by the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory of mandatory sentencing laws in relation to juvenile offenders and in relation to property offences. 
The Government welcomes this development.
Western Australia
The Criminal Code (WA) provides for mandatory detention for third home burglary offences. However, the practice in relation to juvenile offenders is that the courts have a choice between imprisonment or detention on the one hand and a supervisory order of some kind on the other.
A review of the mandatory sentencing provisions of the Code was tabled in the Western Australian Parliament on 15 November 2001.
The review did not recommend any changes to those provisions. It confirmed the existence of a judicial discretion to impose non-custodial sentences instead of detention. It also showed that only a small number of juvenile offenders (143) have been convicted under the mandatory sentencing laws since they were introduced in 1996, of whom 17 per cent were not sentenced to detention.
Commonwealth Government position
The Commonwealth Government recognises that the States and Territories have a difficult job in dealing with the impact of crime and the problem of repeat offenders and that in some circumstances they may consider it appropriate to introduce mandatory detention laws for some offences. The Commonwealth Government believes that the States and Territories are best placed to address the problems associated with repeat offending and detention through their own legislatures and court systems.
The Commonwealth is committed, however, to working with the States and Territories to prevent juveniles from entering the criminal justice system. This is demonstrated by the Agreement between the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory that was signed on 27 July 2000 and came into effect on 1 September 2000. 
Agreement with the Northern Territory
Under the Agreement, the Commonwealth is providing $20 million over 4 years for the following:
·	a range of new community-based diversionary programs in urban, rural and remote communities, including the establishment of community youth development units and drug and substance abuse diversionary programs;
·	the establishment of juvenile diversion units in the Northern Territory Police Service to oversee the diversion process and act as a source of information and expertise on juvenile offenders for police throughout the Territory;
·	a jointly funded Aboriginal Interpreter Service with offices in Darwin and Alice Springs; 
·	an on-site interpreter service at Royal Darwin Hospital and Alice Springs Hospital; and 
·	an additional $250,000 in the first year for training of interpreters (in addition to recurrent funding for training) and funding for the four Northern Territory Aboriginal Legal Services for the purchase of interpreter services.
The Agreement provides for different levels of response to juveniles apprehended, depending on the seriousness of the offence. These responses include verbal or written warnings, formal cautions, family and victim conferences and substantive community based programs. Under the terms of the Agreement, all juveniles who commit minor property offences are to be offered diversion, and diversion for more serious offences is at the discretion of the police.
Since the commencement of the Agreement, sound progress has been made. By 31 August 2001:
·	1215 juveniles had been offered diversion, mainly by way of verbal or written warnings; this equates to 79% of all juvenile apprehensions (1548 cases in total).
·	94 programs had been approved by the police as suitable for diversion, with programs registered in 23 predominantly Aboriginal communities outside the major centres of Darwin, Alice Springs, Katherine and Tennant Creek.
·	35 juveniles were referred to registered programs and 44 to informal programs. 
By 30 September 2001, the AIS had 242 interpreters covering 104 languages on its register. The AIS has advised that it has completed more than 1900 jobs. So far some 140 Aboriginal interpreters have undertaken training and 180 clients of the AIS have been trained in the effective use of interpreters. This includes members of the judiciary, police, health professionals, lawyers and legal staff.
The agencies that have used the AIS the most between April 2000 and 30 September 2001 are:
·	Territory Health Services and community service issues ( 633 jobs—33% of all agency jobs)
·	NT Police ( 317 jobs; 17% of all agency jobs)
·	Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (172 jobs—13% of all agency jobs)
·	North Australian Aboriginal Legal Aid Service (245—13% of all agency jobs)
·	Central Australian Aboriginal Legal Aid Service (271—14% of all agency jobs)
Under the Agreement, the Northern Territory is required to provide detailed performance information to the Commonwealth every 6 months. The first performance information report was provided in April 2001 and the second in November 2001. The Agreement requires annual audits of expenditure, a review of progress in achieving the purposes of the Agreement during the first 12 months and a review no less than 6 months prior to its expiration in 2004. The 12-month review of progress has been delayed due to the Northern Territory and Federal elections but is expected to be completed by April 2002. The review will include an assessment of the impact of the diversionary schemes on juveniles in the Northern Territory and a report of the review will be made public. 
Other interpreter services
The Northern Territory also has a general Interpreter and Translation Service that can provide interpreters in 39 languages. The services are provided free of charge when migrants access Northern Territory Government services. Additionally, the Commonwealth provides a national Translating and Interpreter's Service which offers a 24-hour, 7 day per week service covering switchboard, telephone interpreting, on-site interpreting and a translation service. Non-English speaking residents, migrants and refugees can access the service for free. Other agencies access the service on a user pays basis.
Government Senators' suggestions
Government Senators also suggested that the Commonwealth, in consultation with the Western Australian and Northern Territory Governments, address the following:
(a)	Undertake an audit and review of all available diversionary and other support programs for juvenile offenders: 
In addition to the review of progress in achieving the purposes of the Agreement between the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory, the Commonwealth is undertaking two important projects in this regard. The first project is to conduct a national audit of all diversionary programs in place for juvenile offenders to identify examples of good practice in diversion. These will be presented at a national forum to be held in September 2002. The second project involves a national profiling of Mentoring Youth At-Risk programs, which is also directed at identifying best practice. This is expected to be completed in 2002. 
(b)	Actively canvass and develop options for rehabilitating and deterring juveniles and young adults from repeat offending, as alternatives to mandatory sentencing:
While State and Territory Governments have primary responsibility for matters relating to juvenile offending and rehabilitation, the Commonwealth is strongly committed to a range of initiatives that contribute to the prevention of juvenile offending. These include early intervention in relation to such issues as suicide and drug abuse, early school leaving, unemployment and homelessness. The major strategies are the National Drug Strategic Framework, the National Illicit Drug Strategy, National Mental Health Strategy, the National Youth Suicide Prevention Strategy, the National Homelessness Strategy, the Youth Pathways Action Plan Taskforce, the Stronger Families and Communities Strategy, Partnerships Against Domestic Violence and the National Crime Prevention Program.
The Youth Pathways Action Plan Taskforce Report, Footprints to the Future, sets out a policy framework for supporting young people through school and from school to further education, training, work and active citizenship. The Commonwealth has welcomed the recommendations and has committed itself to continuing to expand young people's opportunities.
Programs that target young offenders include the Young Offenders' Pilot Program, the Job Placement, Education and Training Program and the Illicit Drug Diversion Initiative.
In addition, there are specific initiatives focussing on indigenous youth including the Indigenous Sport Program and employment and education initiatives, such as the School to Work Program.
Both the Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs and the Attorney-General's Department liaise closely with the Australasian Juvenile Justice Administrators' Group. The Group meets regularly to discuss standards, good practice and approaches to the diversion of juvenile offenders, and correctional services for juveniles. 
(c)	Consult with indigenous communities to resource and develop from within those communities alternative programs to deal with juvenile offenders: 
The Agreement with the Northern Territory recognises that consultation with key people within communities, particularly Aboriginal people, is imperative in the development and operation of community-based and driven diversionary programs. 
As of August 2001, more than 170 organisations, committees and groups, and more than 700 community members, had been briefed or consulted by the Northern Territory police on the diversion scheme. The police have been meeting with Aboriginal leaders across the Territory and conducting extensive consultations with a wide range of community groups and non-government organisations and service providers to identify existing programs suitable for the diversion of juveniles. Consultations are also designed to develop targeted responses to emerging needs in indigenous communities.
(d)	Monitor the impact of mandatory sentencing on juveniles and young adults, and publish the results at least annually:
The Western Australian review of its mandatory detention laws is referred to above. 
An examination of the impact of the juvenile pre-court diversion scheme in the Northern Territory is being undertaken as part of the review referred to above of progress in achieving the purposes of the Agreement in the first 12 months since its commencement. 
The Social Justice Report 2001 also contains a detailed review of the operation of the Criminal Code (WA) and the recent legislative developments in the Northern Territory.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2002-08-22,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I rise to take note of the government's response to the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee on the Human Rights (Mandatory Sentencing of Juvenile Offenders) Bill 1999. This report was completed in March 2000. The bill itself was introduced into the Senate on the motion of Senator Brown, Senator Bolkus and Senator Greig. It was read for the first and second time on 25 August 1999.
It is worth giving a bit of the background to the report so that we can put the response by the government in context. It was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee for inquiry and report by the first sitting day in 2000. The terms of the inquiry were: (a) the legal, social and other aspects of mandatory sentencing; (b) Australia's international human rights obligations in regard to mandatory sentencing laws in Australia; (c) the implications of mandatory sentencing for particular groups, including Australia's Indigenous people and people with disabilities; and (d) the constitutional power of the Commonwealth parliament to legislate with respect to existing laws affecting mandatory sentencing. The committee held four public hearings, in Alice Springs, Darwin, Perth and Canberra, in February 2000. To underscore the seriousness of the issue, a supervening event occurred which heightened public concern. A 15-year-old Aboriginal boy was found in his room at the Don Dale Detention Centre in Darwin in the Northern Territory on 9 February following what is believed to have been a suicide attempt. The boy, from Groote Eylandt, was serving his second detention term under mandatory sentencing and was due to be released on the following Monday. He died in Darwin Hospital on Thursday morning, 10 February.
The bill itself was to ensure that a Commonwealth, state or territory law must not require a court to sentence a person to imprisonment for an offence committed as a child—that is, when under the age of 18 years. It would make existing laws of no force or effect and require any child in prison or detention be brought back to the sentencing court within 28 days for reconsideration of the remainder of the sentence. The bill was developed to address a number of issues of concern over the introduction of mandatory sentencing for various property offences in both Western Australia and the Northern Territory. These concerns included whether the jailing of children was contrary to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and whether other international obligations were being breached, the lack of relationship between the type of crime and the severity of the punishment, the limited options available to replace detention, the apparent discriminatory effect on Indigenous people; and the concept of mandatory detention for juveniles representing a disturbing shift away from the traditional sentencing principles. The emphasis had previously been on rehabilitation rather than on the protection of the community through detention, thus legislation governing the sentencing of juveniles had generally restricted the kinds of sentencing options available in respect of juveniles. The clear preference had always been for non-custodial sentences.
In essence, the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee unanimously condemned the laws in both the Northern Territory and Western Australia and the majority supported the bill. The two Liberal senators, Senator Payne and Senator Coonan, gave the Northern Territory and Western Australian governments a chance to consider the report, although it is recognised that one senator was predisposed to support a Commonwealth override if the governments' responses were not positive.
The committee's preferred course was to allow the respective governments to take action. The committee was not, however, convinced that the Northern Territory and Western Australian governments would act on their own volition to resolve this issue. Therefore, the committee recommended that the bill be passed by parliament. The Senate did pass the bill. Surprisingly, a number of Liberal members in the House of Representatives at the time indicated support for the passage of the bill in the House. This support, however, did not materialise. The government's position on this was very disappointing.  
The arguments against mandatory sentencing can be summarised in the following way. In my view, they breach international laws, they are perceived to have a discriminatory effect on Indigenous persons and they are perceived as allowing parliament to interfere with and potentially undermine the independence and integrity of the judiciary. The government's response to date has been pathetic. When the bill was introduced, Ms Vale in the House of Representatives said she was willing to introduce into the House a similar bill, but failed to take that step. Mr John Howard promised a good old backbench committee to advise cabinet on measures to lessen the impact of the mandatory sentencing laws. Clearly, nothing of any substance came out of that. Nearly every living retired member of the High Court condemned mandatory sentencing laws. Many academics similarly condemned mandatory sentencing. In addition, a report of the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination condemned mandatory sentencing and Australia's treatment of Indigenous people. 
The Prime Minister attempted to persuade the then Northern Territory Chief Minister, Denis Burke, to change the law, but was singularly unsuccessful. However, by April 2000 the federal government struck a deal with the Northern Territory government to provide $5 million for additional diversionary programs. This of course failed to address the issue itself. At best, it was a face-saver for this government. However, it did not save the Northern Territory government. The date 22 October 2001 was an important one for those who are opposed to mandatory sentencing, because it signified the end of mandatory sentencing for property offences in the Northern Territory. The Labor Northern Territory government under Clare Martin should be congratulated for expunging from the record books a regime that imprisons children for minor offences. The application of the laws brought about unjust and inappropriate sentences which resulted in inconsistencies and discrimination and unfairness. It is hoped that the Western Australian government will heed the progress made in the Northern Territory and do likewise. Mandatory sentencing laws in the Northern Territory have been a lightning rod across Australia and amongst the international community because of their unjust nature. Dr Jonas, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, welcomed the repeal of the mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for property crimes committed by juveniles. Dr Jonas stated, and I agree with him:
A sense of justice has been restored to the Territory's legal system.
There is another area where the response fails and fails miserably. There was a call by the Liberal senators for improved interpreter services. The government's response focuses on the Indigenous interpreter services it is helping in the Northern Territory, yet does not mention the need for such funding in WA. There is no federal funding, as far as I am aware, for Indigenous interpreter services in WA. Since they set up about three years ago, I understand that the Kimberley Interpreting Service have been seeking funding to continue their operation of providing interpreter services to Aboriginal peoples and have managed on the basis of a grab bag of funds from different state departments and programs. They have not been able to access Commonwealth government funding. They have lobbied Senator Ellison and Minister Ruddock for about a year to receive funding from the government, but they have been singularly unsuccessful. I hope the government does take heed of that call and, if they are serious about providing a serious response to this report and they are serious about interpreter services, that they look at the obvious needs not only in the Northern Territory, where a deal was done with the previous government, but right across Australia, to ensure that interpreter services are provided. 
There is a clear need. Fourteen per cent of Indigenous people aged over 13 years speak an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Island language, and a further three per cent speak Aboriginal English. It is obvious that those Indigenous Australians coming into contact with the justice system need to have adequate interpreter services, particularly when they are juveniles. Funding for these services in the Northern Territory, as I have said, only arose out of a deal that they did with their mate the former Chief Minister Denis Burke not to overturn mandatory sentencing. The government must move to remedy this situation around the country, not just in the Northern Territory. The original committee recommended that the bill be passed by the parliament. The government's response said that the government does not accept the recommendation.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2002-08-22,"—Mr Deputy President, may I take this opportunity to congratulate you on your election to that high and responsible office.
—Thank you.
—In rising to take note of the government's response to the report of the Legal and Constitutional References Committee inquiry into the Human Rights (Mandatory Sentencing of Juvenile Offenders) Bill 1999 I would like to note that two of the senators who played a very significant role in the development of that report and in the continuing work of the committee in this area, former senator Barney Cooney and former senator Jim McKiernan, are no longer members of this chamber, but I am sure would have been very interested to see the material which is before us today. The government, in its response to the committee's report, welcomes the report and indicates that it contains matters which it has looked at very seriously. The government said at the time, and continues to say now, that it did not accept the committee's recommendation that the bill be passed by the parliament. As a member of the committee at the time, I also did not advocate the passing of the bill by the Senate at that stage—as Senator Ludwig has referred to. I indicated that my preference was to see the Northern Territory and Western Australian governments take action of their own volition to address the concerns which had been made very clear to the committee in this process.
Since that time—as Senator Ludwig has referred to in one manner; I will perhaps do so slightly less pejoratively—the nature of the legislation in the Northern Territory has been changed significantly by the introduction of the Northern Territory Juvenile Justice Amendment Act (No. 2) 2001 and the Northern Territory Sentencing Amendment Act (No. 3) 2001, which repealed mandatory sentencing for juvenile offenders and mandatory sentencing for property offences for adults respectively. Both took effect from 22 October 2001. I welcomed on a personal basis those actions of the new Northern Territory government last year. In the report, tabled in 2000, the government senators made a number of recommendations which, in this response, the government has acknowledged and in some cases supported. The first was that the Commonwealth should support the Northern Territory with funding to assist the development of an interpreter service to ensure that young people who could not speak or understand English would not continue to be disadvantaged by the legal system. The government has responded to that in a number of ways. The response also indicated, on a number of other recommendations that government senators made, that they would pursue some of those areas.
Let me first turn to the question of government assistance and the agreement that the government formed with the Northern Territory. The government agreed to provide $20 million over four years for a range of new community based diversionary programs which would operate in urban, rural and remote communities. They would include the establishment of community youth development units and drug and substance abuse diversionary programs. We supported the establishment of juvenile diversion units within the NT police service to oversee that diversion process and to act as a source of information and expertise on juvenile offenders for police throughout the territory. We supported a jointly funded Aboriginal interpreter service with offices in Darwin and Alice Springs and an on-site interpreter service at the Royal Darwin Hospital and the Alice Springs Hospital. We provided an additional $250,000 in the first year for the training of interpreters—in addition to recurrent funding for training—and funding for the four Northern Territory Aboriginal legal services for the purchase of interpreter services. 
The agreement formed between the Northern Territory and the Commonwealth also provided for different levels of response to juveniles who were apprehended, depending on the seriousness of the offence. The commencement of the agreement saw a pretty challenging environment, but since that time significant progress has been made. I understand from the government's response that, by 28 February this year, 1,606 juveniles out of the 2,142 cases of juvenile apprehensions—that is, three-quarters—were offered diversion, mostly by way of verbal or written warnings; 113 programs had been registered as suitable for diversion in 34 Northern Territory communities; 77 juveniles had been referred to registered diversionary programs; and 63 juveniles had been referred to informal programs.
The Aboriginal Interpreter Service offers a central booking service for both government and non-government agencies that require on-site Aboriginal language interpreters. By its second anniversary, in April 2002, it had 250 interpreters covering 104 languages on its register, and it had completed more than 2,400 jobs. The services that have used that Aboriginal Interpreter Service the most include the Territory health services, the Northern Territory Police, the Central Australian Aboriginal Legal Aid Service, the North Australian Aboriginal Legal Aid Service and the office of the DPP. That is an indication of how actively it has been taken up as an opportunity in the Northern Territory.
The agreement has been reviewed; I would describe it as one for which the NT government is highly accountable to the Commonwealth for the funds that it expends in terms of annual audits and reviews of progress when they have been conducted during that time. As Senator Ludwig would know, we also have the opportunity, through the estimates process of this parliament, to examine the Attorney-General's Department in relation to those services—and we do. Senators on both sides of the chamber ask for progress on the Northern Territory agreement, and we are advised regularly with updates on that.
In the report, the government senators made a couple of other responses to which the government has also responded in the document tabled today. We suggested that there be an audit and a review of all of the available diversionary and other support programs for juvenile offenders. The Commonwealth is now undertaking two projects in that regard. One of them is particularly important and it is very timely to refer to it today. The first is a project to conduct a national audit of all diversionary programs in place for juvenile offenders, for the purpose of identifying examples of good practice in diversion. They are then to be presented at a national forum to be held next month. That will be a very good opportunity to look at where similar programs in Australia are going, and what best practice actually is. The second is a national profiling of programs mentoring youth at risk, also aimed at identifying best practice and also expected to be completed this year. They are both very important initiatives that the Commonwealth has undertaken in that regard.
There are a number of programs in relation to young people which come broadly under the heading of the recommendation that the government senators made in this report about actively canvassing and developing options for rehabilitating and deterring juveniles and young adults from repeat offending as alternatives to mandatory sentencing. The government is committed to a range of initiatives which include early intervention in relation to suicide, drug abuse, early school leaving, unemployment and homelessness. A number of strategies have an overarching responsibility in that area; they would include the National Drug Strategic Framework, the National Drug Strategy, the National Mental Health Strategy and the National Youth Suicide Prevention Strategy.
One program with which I am particularly familiar is the National Youth Suicide Prevention Strategy. It is important for its capacity to look at innovative programs, and very often when we are talking about Indigenous juveniles that is extremely important. The one-size-fits-all approach is not the case in that regard. It is important within those strategies to be innovative, flexible and open to alternative suggestions, and I think that is what marks that particular strategy. The programs also include the National Homelessness Strategy, the Youth Pathways Action Plan Taskforce, Partnerships Against Domestic Violence and so on. Let me just identify the Youth Pathways Action Plan Taskforce report Footprints to the Future, which sets out a policy framework for supporting young people throughout their life—through school and from school to further education, to training and to work and active citizenship. Its recommendations have been welcomed by the Commonwealth and are being pursued. 
One of the important issues which the entire committee and government senators identified was the importance of consultation with Indigenous communities—to resource and develop from within those communities some of the solutions to the problems which we saw in our extremely intensive and extensive reporting process. The agreement that the Commonwealth has with the Northern Territory, to which I referred earlier, does recognise that consultation with key people within the communities, and particularly Indigenous leaders, is imperative in the development and operation of community based and community driven diversionary programs. I think these are all points which, as part of the government response to this report, should be noted by the Senate.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2002-08-22,"—Mr Deputy President, I, too, congratulate you on your recent election. I would also like to follow up from Senator Payne in paying tribute and commendation to retired Senators Cooney and McKiernan, who contributed so significantly not just to the references committee but to this particular inquiry.
The first thing that struck me about the Government Response to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee Report of the Inquiry into the Human Rights (Mandatory Sentencing of Juvenile Offenders) Bill 1999, which we have incorporated into the Hansard today, was the date of it, really. I think it is rather sad and telling that the Human Rights (Mandatory Sentencing of Juvenile Offenders) Bill 1999—a bill that was introduced and on which we began debate in 1999—is responded to only today, some three years later, by the government. My feeling and experiences are that there is much community anxiety about mandatory sentencing, and that is not reflected in the way in which the government has often responded to this issue.
As Senator Payne has said, the government's response at the time, which is being discussed here today, effectively advocated that the bill ought not be passed and that the states or the territories ought to do so themselves. Since that time, we have seen that that has in fact happened in the Northern Territory under the new government with Clare Martin. That has been roundly welcomed and her government has been congratulated by my party and others. I have had the opportunity to visit the Northern Territory in recent weeks to inquire into how some of that law reform is progressing, and there are certainly positive signs that things are working well. It is not brilliant but, as I have said previously, there are social problems—the underlying difficulties, often with broken families, of physical and sexual abuse and sometimes drug and alcohol abuse. Broken families fundamentally seem to be the strongest contributing cause, particularly of juvenile crime in the Northern Territory, amongst Indigenous populations. Fundamentally, that remains the Democrats' strong and vehement opposition to the whole notion of mandatory sentencing, given that we continue to argue that it must be left to the discretion of the courts—to the judges and the magistrates—to determine on a case-by-case basis what the sentencing for any particular crime ought to be, allowing them to take into consideration the extraordinary circumstances that many people, particularly young people, find themselves in.
It remains the case that, to its shame, my home state of Western Australia is now the only jurisdiction in the nation which maintains mandatory sentencing, introduced under the then Labor government of Dr Carmen Lawrence. To be fair, the mandatory sentencing regime in Western Australia is different from that which existed in the Northern Territory. It is a three-strikes policy rather than a first-strike policy and relates only to property offences. Nonetheless, it is still having a serious effect on Indigenous people, young Indigenous people in particular, and remains the topic of heated and controversial debate on the public airwaves and through the press in my home state. It remains a thorny issue, too, with the parliament which, under the premiership of Dr Geoff Gallop, has seen some exceptional and welcome social reform. There remains strident opposition from the government, shared by the coalition opposition, to maintain those laws in Western Australia—despite the alternative dynamic that now exists in the state's upper house. 
As an example, I would like to bring the attention of the chamber to a relatively recent case published in the West Australian, where some of these issues were being debated in relation to a young, I understand, Indigenous girl. The article said:
A 13-year-old Broome girl at the centre of a row over WA's mandatory sentencing laws was sent to detention for a year yesterday—
and this was published on 24 July this year—
for committing another string of home burglaries in the North-West last month.
The girl, who is not named because of her age, stole cash and personal possessions from seven houses in Broome not long after being given a final chance by Children's Court president Kate O'Brien. In May, the judge ignored prosecution calls to lock up the repeat offender and instead placed her on a 12-month conditional release order.
The child returned to Broome to live with her grandmother and siblings but began offending again on June 8 and was arrested by police two weeks later.
She pleaded guilty to seven counts of aggravated burglary in Broome Magistrate's Court on June 22 and was remanded in custody for sentencing.
She also admitted being part of a group of teenage girls who kicked and punched a 16-year-old girl before stealing her mobile phone in February.
And so it goes on. It became very clear that the significant and underlying social problems and social causes of this particular offender were such that the court could not take that into consideration, so the situation remains that judges and magistrates cannot exercise discretion in sentencing—a situation which continues to be criticised and condemned by WA's Chief Justice, Mr David Malcolm, who said:
Unless our community can settle on an alternative method of addressing crime and the rehabilitation of offenders, WA will continue to see an increase in the number of alcohol and other drug dependent offenders. Yet as a community we persist with such illusionary solutions as mandatory sentencing which is only a short term quick fix solution to impress constituents from one election to the next.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional References Committee</title>,Committees,19,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-08-22,"—This is a government response to the report of the Legal and Constitutional References Committee on the Human Rights (Mandatory Sentencing of Juvenile Offenders) Bill 1999, which I introduced into the Senate a bit more than two years ago. The dilatory nature of that response is remarkable, but it is a response that is written with hindsight. It effectively says that the Greens legislation—which was supported by this side of the Senate back there—was right, that the outcomes which that aimed at were correct and that the decision by Prime Minister Howard and the government at the outset to oppose that legislation was not right.
What has happened in the meantime is the result of a national furore over mandatory detention, which ensnared primarily Aboriginal children in the Northern Territory but also in Western Australia, to the effect that it was not conscionable in our country. It was effectively locking kids up, doing them no good, potentially leading them to come out of detention with a greater likelihood of relapsing into petty crime than before and making them feel estranged from the very system that should have been helping them.
As a result of that legislation—which I brought into parliament at the behest of Aboriginal communities and also the Northern Territory Greens at the time—the consequent committee findings got the support of the Senate, the Labor Party, the Democrats and the Independent senators at the time. It passed this place and went to the House of Representatives, where consideration of the legislation, and even debate of the legislation, was blocked by the government of the day. I must note that it was put forward there by then opposition leader Beazley and the Labor Party in the interests of improving this situation. 
Nevertheless, that then caused a serious break in the ranks of the government. The more humanitarian-minded people in the government said to the Prime Minister, `We have to do something about that.' It was in response to that that the Prime Minister then approached the Northern Territory government with considerable money and an agreement was made to vastly change the terrible situation that had existed up until then. Interpreters were to be brought into courts so that Aboriginal kids understood what was going on and there were diversionary opportunities created. Most kids have gone to those diversions. Instead of being locked up in effective juvenile jails, they are out learning things which are going to be helpful to them and the community in the long run.
In the consequence of that there was a change of government in the Northern Territory from the Country Liberal Party government to the Martin Labor government, which had the good sense to lead off by abolishing the mandatory sentencing legislation. It is a great outcome. I pay tribute to the Senate and its committee system and to those Indigenous organisations and the Greens in the Northern Territory, who first moved, with the legal community in Australia—not least in the Northern Territory—at the forefront, to put right a terrible wrong. There is still some road to go—we should abolish the sentencing in Western Australia. But the outcome has been great, and I thank all those who were involved. (Time expired)
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional References Committee</title>,Committees,19,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-08-22,"—I present the government's response to the report of the Legal and Constitutional References Committee on its inquiry on the Human Rights (Mandatory Sentencing of Juvenile Offenders) Bill 1999, and I seek leave to incorporate the document in Hansard. 
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
Government Response to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee Report of the Inquiry into the Human Rights (Mandatory Sentencing of Juvenile Offenders) Bill 1999
The Government welcomes the report by the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee of its inquiry into the Human Rights (Mandatory Sentencing of Juvenile Offenders) Bill 1999. 
The Senate referred to the Committee the Bill and the following related matters:
(a)	the legal, social and other aspects of mandatory sentencing;
(b)	Australia's international human rights obligations in regard to mandatory sentencing laws in Australia;
(c)	the implications of mandatory sentencing for particular groups, including Australia's indigenous people and people with disabilities; and
(d)	the constitutional power of the Commonwealth Parliament to legislate with respect to existing laws affecting mandatory sentencing. 
Committee recommendation
The Committee recommended that the Bill be passed by the Parliament.
Government response
The Government does not accept the recommendation and notes that, in relation to the Northern Territory, the laws at which the recommendation was directed have been repealed by the Juvenile Justice Amendment Act (No.2) 2001 (NT), which repealed mandatory sentencing for juvenile offenders, and the Sentencing Amendment Act (No. 3) 2001 (NT), which repealed mandatory sentencing for property offences for adults, both effective from 22 October 2001.
Government Senators' recommendation
Interpreter services
Government Senators recommended that the Commonwealth Government support the Northern Territory with funding to assist the continuing development of an adequate interpreter service to ensure that young people who do not speak or understand English will not continue to be disadvantaged by the legal system.
Government response
The Government accepts the recommendation (see discussion below).
Government Senators also made a number of suggestions which are also discussed below. 
Discussion
As the report explains, the main issue with which the Committee was concerned was the application of mandatory sentencing laws to juveniles in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. The object of the Bill was to overturn those laws.
The Northern Territory
The report has been substantially overtaken by the repeal on 22 October 2001 by the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory of mandatory sentencing laws in relation to juvenile offenders and in relation to property offences. 
The Government welcomes this development.
Western Australia
The Criminal Code (WA) provides for mandatory detention for third home burglary offences. However, the practice in relation to juvenile offenders is that the courts have a choice between imprisonment or detention on the one hand and a supervisory order of some kind on the other.
A review of the mandatory sentencing provisions of the Code was tabled in the Western Australian Parliament on 15 November 2001.
The review did not recommend any changes to those provisions. It confirmed the existence of a judicial discretion to impose non-custodial sentences instead of detention. It also showed that only a small number of juvenile offenders (143) have been convicted under the mandatory sentencing laws since they were introduced in 1996, of whom 17 per cent were not sentenced to detention.
Commonwealth Government position
The Commonwealth Government recognises that the States and Territories have a difficult job in dealing with the impact of crime and the problem of repeat offenders and that in some circumstances they may consider it appropriate to introduce mandatory detention laws for some offences. The Commonwealth Government believes that the States and Territories are best placed to address the problems associated with repeat offending and detention through their own legislatures and court systems.
The Commonwealth is committed, however, to working with the States and Territories to prevent juveniles from entering the criminal justice system. This is demonstrated by the Agreement between the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory that was signed on 27 July 2000 and came into effect on 1 September 2000. 
Agreement with the Northern Territory
Under the Agreement, the Commonwealth is providing $20 million over 4 years for the following:
·	a range of new community-based diversionary programs in urban, rural and remote communities, including the establishment of community youth development units and drug and substance abuse diversionary programs;
·	the establishment of juvenile diversion units in the Northern Territory Police Service to oversee the diversion process and act as a source of information and expertise on juvenile offenders for police throughout the Territory;
·	a jointly funded Aboriginal Interpreter Service with offices in Darwin and Alice Springs; 
·	an on-site interpreter service at Royal Darwin Hospital and Alice Springs Hospital; and 
·	an additional $250,000 in the first year for training of interpreters (in addition to recurrent funding for training) and funding for the four Northern Territory Aboriginal Legal Services for the purchase of interpreter services.
The Agreement provides for different levels of response to juveniles apprehended, depending on the seriousness of the offence. These responses include verbal or written warnings, formal cautions, family and victim conferences and substantive community based programs. Under the terms of the Agreement, all juveniles who commit minor property offences are to be offered diversion, and diversion for more serious offences is at the discretion of the police.
Since the commencement of the Agreement, sound progress has been made. By 31 August 2001:
·	1215 juveniles had been offered diversion, mainly by way of verbal or written warnings; this equates to 79% of all juvenile apprehensions (1548 cases in total).
·	94 programs had been approved by the police as suitable for diversion, with programs registered in 23 predominantly Aboriginal communities outside the major centres of Darwin, Alice Springs, Katherine and Tennant Creek.
·	35 juveniles were referred to registered programs and 44 to informal programs. 
By 30 September 2001, the AIS had 242 interpreters covering 104 languages on its register. The AIS has advised that it has completed more than 1900 jobs. So far some 140 Aboriginal interpreters have undertaken training and 180 clients of the AIS have been trained in the effective use of interpreters. This includes members of the judiciary, police, health professionals, lawyers and legal staff.
The agencies that have used the AIS the most between April 2000 and 30 September 2001 are:
·	Territory Health Services and community service issues ( 633 jobs—33% of all agency jobs)
·	NT Police ( 317 jobs; 17% of all agency jobs)
·	Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (172 jobs—13% of all agency jobs)
·	North Australian Aboriginal Legal Aid Service (245—13% of all agency jobs)
·	Central Australian Aboriginal Legal Aid Service (271—14% of all agency jobs)
Under the Agreement, the Northern Territory is required to provide detailed performance information to the Commonwealth every 6 months. The first performance information report was provided in April 2001 and the second in November 2001. The Agreement requires annual audits of expenditure, a review of progress in achieving the purposes of the Agreement during the first 12 months and a review no less than 6 months prior to its expiration in 2004. The 12-month review of progress has been delayed due to the Northern Territory and Federal elections but is expected to be completed by April 2002. The review will include an assessment of the impact of the diversionary schemes on juveniles in the Northern Territory and a report of the review will be made public. 
Other interpreter services
The Northern Territory also has a general Interpreter and Translation Service that can provide interpreters in 39 languages. The services are provided free of charge when migrants access Northern Territory Government services. Additionally, the Commonwealth provides a national Translating and Interpreter's Service which offers a 24-hour, 7 day per week service covering switchboard, telephone interpreting, on-site interpreting and a translation service. Non-English speaking residents, migrants and refugees can access the service for free. Other agencies access the service on a user pays basis.
Government Senators' suggestions
Government Senators also suggested that the Commonwealth, in consultation with the Western Australian and Northern Territory Governments, address the following:
(a)	Undertake an audit and review of all available diversionary and other support programs for juvenile offenders: 
In addition to the review of progress in achieving the purposes of the Agreement between the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory, the Commonwealth is undertaking two important projects in this regard. The first project is to conduct a national audit of all diversionary programs in place for juvenile offenders to identify examples of good practice in diversion. These will be presented at a national forum to be held in September 2002. The second project involves a national profiling of Mentoring Youth At-Risk programs, which is also directed at identifying best practice. This is expected to be completed in 2002. 
(b)	Actively canvass and develop options for rehabilitating and deterring juveniles and young adults from repeat offending, as alternatives to mandatory sentencing:
While State and Territory Governments have primary responsibility for matters relating to juvenile offending and rehabilitation, the Commonwealth is strongly committed to a range of initiatives that contribute to the prevention of juvenile offending. These include early intervention in relation to such issues as suicide and drug abuse, early school leaving, unemployment and homelessness. The major strategies are the National Drug Strategic Framework, the National Illicit Drug Strategy, National Mental Health Strategy, the National Youth Suicide Prevention Strategy, the National Homelessness Strategy, the Youth Pathways Action Plan Taskforce, the Stronger Families and Communities Strategy, Partnerships Against Domestic Violence and the National Crime Prevention Program.
The Youth Pathways Action Plan Taskforce Report, Footprints to the Future, sets out a policy framework for supporting young people through school and from school to further education, training, work and active citizenship. The Commonwealth has welcomed the recommendations and has committed itself to continuing to expand young people's opportunities.
Programs that target young offenders include the Young Offenders' Pilot Program, the Job Placement, Education and Training Program and the Illicit Drug Diversion Initiative.
In addition, there are specific initiatives focussing on indigenous youth including the Indigenous Sport Program and employment and education initiatives, such as the School to Work Program.
Both the Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs and the Attorney-General's Department liaise closely with the Australasian Juvenile Justice Administrators' Group. The Group meets regularly to discuss standards, good practice and approaches to the diversion of juvenile offenders, and correctional services for juveniles. 
(c)	Consult with indigenous communities to resource and develop from within those communities alternative programs to deal with juvenile offenders: 
The Agreement with the Northern Territory recognises that consultation with key people within communities, particularly Aboriginal people, is imperative in the development and operation of community-based and driven diversionary programs. 
As of August 2001, more than 170 organisations, committees and groups, and more than 700 community members, had been briefed or consulted by the Northern Territory police on the diversion scheme. The police have been meeting with Aboriginal leaders across the Territory and conducting extensive consultations with a wide range of community groups and non-government organisations and service providers to identify existing programs suitable for the diversion of juveniles. Consultations are also designed to develop targeted responses to emerging needs in indigenous communities.
(d)	Monitor the impact of mandatory sentencing on juveniles and young adults, and publish the results at least annually:
The Western Australian review of its mandatory detention laws is referred to above. 
An examination of the impact of the juvenile pre-court diversion scheme in the Northern Territory is being undertaken as part of the review referred to above of progress in achieving the purposes of the Agreement in the first 12 months since its commencement. 
The Social Justice Report 2001 also contains a detailed review of the operation of the Criminal Code (WA) and the recent legislative developments in the Northern Territory.

That the Senate take note of the report.
I rise to take note of the government's response to the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee on the Human Rights (Mandatory Sentencing of Juvenile Offenders) Bill 1999. This report was completed in March 2000. The bill itself was introduced into the Senate on the motion of Senator Brown, Senator Bolkus and Senator Greig. It was read for the first and second time on 25 August 1999.
It is worth giving a bit of the background to the report so that we can put the response by the government in context. It was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee for inquiry and report by the first sitting day in 2000. The terms of the inquiry were: (a) the legal, social and other aspects of mandatory sentencing; (b) Australia's international human rights obligations in regard to mandatory sentencing laws in Australia; (c) the implications of mandatory sentencing for particular groups, including Australia's Indigenous people and people with disabilities; and (d) the constitutional power of the Commonwealth parliament to legislate with respect to existing laws affecting mandatory sentencing. The committee held four public hearings, in Alice Springs, Darwin, Perth and Canberra, in February 2000. To underscore the seriousness of the issue, a supervening event occurred which heightened public concern. A 15-year-old Aboriginal boy was found in his room at the Don Dale Detention Centre in Darwin in the Northern Territory on 9 February following what is believed to have been a suicide attempt. The boy, from Groote Eylandt, was serving his second detention term under mandatory sentencing and was due to be released on the following Monday. He died in Darwin Hospital on Thursday morning, 10 February.
The bill itself was to ensure that a Commonwealth, state or territory law must not require a court to sentence a person to imprisonment for an offence committed as a child—that is, when under the age of 18 years. It would make existing laws of no force or effect and require any child in prison or detention be brought back to the sentencing court within 28 days for reconsideration of the remainder of the sentence. The bill was developed to address a number of issues of concern over the introduction of mandatory sentencing for various property offences in both Western Australia and the Northern Territory. These concerns included whether the jailing of children was contrary to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and whether other international obligations were being breached, the lack of relationship between the type of crime and the severity of the punishment, the limited options available to replace detention, the apparent discriminatory effect on Indigenous people; and the concept of mandatory detention for juveniles representing a disturbing shift away from the traditional sentencing principles. The emphasis had previously been on rehabilitation rather than on the protection of the community through detention, thus legislation governing the sentencing of juveniles had generally restricted the kinds of sentencing options available in respect of juveniles. The clear preference had always been for non-custodial sentences.
In essence, the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee unanimously condemned the laws in both the Northern Territory and Western Australia and the majority supported the bill. The two Liberal senators, Senator Payne and Senator Coonan, gave the Northern Territory and Western Australian governments a chance to consider the report, although it is recognised that one senator was predisposed to support a Commonwealth override if the governments' responses were not positive.
The committee's preferred course was to allow the respective governments to take action. The committee was not, however, convinced that the Northern Territory and Western Australian governments would act on their own volition to resolve this issue. Therefore, the committee recommended that the bill be passed by parliament. The Senate did pass the bill. Surprisingly, a number of Liberal members in the House of Representatives at the time indicated support for the passage of the bill in the House. This support, however, did not materialise. The government's position on this was very disappointing.  
The arguments against mandatory sentencing can be summarised in the following way. In my view, they breach international laws, they are perceived to have a discriminatory effect on Indigenous persons and they are perceived as allowing parliament to interfere with and potentially undermine the independence and integrity of the judiciary. The government's response to date has been pathetic. When the bill was introduced, Ms Vale in the House of Representatives said she was willing to introduce into the House a similar bill, but failed to take that step. Mr John Howard promised a good old backbench committee to advise cabinet on measures to lessen the impact of the mandatory sentencing laws. Clearly, nothing of any substance came out of that. Nearly every living retired member of the High Court condemned mandatory sentencing laws. Many academics similarly condemned mandatory sentencing. In addition, a report of the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination condemned mandatory sentencing and Australia's treatment of Indigenous people. 
The Prime Minister attempted to persuade the then Northern Territory Chief Minister, Denis Burke, to change the law, but was singularly unsuccessful. However, by April 2000 the federal government struck a deal with the Northern Territory government to provide $5 million for additional diversionary programs. This of course failed to address the issue itself. At best, it was a face-saver for this government. However, it did not save the Northern Territory government. The date 22 October 2001 was an important one for those who are opposed to mandatory sentencing, because it signified the end of mandatory sentencing for property offences in the Northern Territory. The Labor Northern Territory government under Clare Martin should be congratulated for expunging from the record books a regime that imprisons children for minor offences. The application of the laws brought about unjust and inappropriate sentences which resulted in inconsistencies and discrimination and unfairness. It is hoped that the Western Australian government will heed the progress made in the Northern Territory and do likewise. Mandatory sentencing laws in the Northern Territory have been a lightning rod across Australia and amongst the international community because of their unjust nature. Dr Jonas, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, welcomed the repeal of the mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for property crimes committed by juveniles. Dr Jonas stated, and I agree with him:
A sense of justice has been restored to the Territory's legal system.
There is another area where the response fails and fails miserably. There was a call by the Liberal senators for improved interpreter services. The government's response focuses on the Indigenous interpreter services it is helping in the Northern Territory, yet does not mention the need for such funding in WA. There is no federal funding, as far as I am aware, for Indigenous interpreter services in WA. Since they set up about three years ago, I understand that the Kimberley Interpreting Service have been seeking funding to continue their operation of providing interpreter services to Aboriginal peoples and have managed on the basis of a grab bag of funds from different state departments and programs. They have not been able to access Commonwealth government funding. They have lobbied Senator Ellison and Minister Ruddock for about a year to receive funding from the government, but they have been singularly unsuccessful. I hope the government does take heed of that call and, if they are serious about providing a serious response to this report and they are serious about interpreter services, that they look at the obvious needs not only in the Northern Territory, where a deal was done with the previous government, but right across Australia, to ensure that interpreter services are provided. 
There is a clear need. Fourteen per cent of Indigenous people aged over 13 years speak an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Island language, and a further three per cent speak Aboriginal English. It is obvious that those Indigenous Australians coming into contact with the justice system need to have adequate interpreter services, particularly when they are juveniles. Funding for these services in the Northern Territory, as I have said, only arose out of a deal that they did with their mate the former Chief Minister Denis Burke not to overturn mandatory sentencing. The government must move to remedy this situation around the country, not just in the Northern Territory. The original committee recommended that the bill be passed by the parliament. The government's response said that the government does not accept the recommendation.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2002-08-22,"—Mr Deputy President, may I take this opportunity to congratulate you on your election to that high and responsible office.
—Thank you.
—In rising to take note of the government's response to the report of the Legal and Constitutional References Committee inquiry into the Human Rights (Mandatory Sentencing of Juvenile Offenders) Bill 1999 I would like to note that two of the senators who played a very significant role in the development of that report and in the continuing work of the committee in this area, former senator Barney Cooney and former senator Jim McKiernan, are no longer members of this chamber, but I am sure would have been very interested to see the material which is before us today. The government, in its response to the committee's report, welcomes the report and indicates that it contains matters which it has looked at very seriously. The government said at the time, and continues to say now, that it did not accept the committee's recommendation that the bill be passed by the parliament. As a member of the committee at the time, I also did not advocate the passing of the bill by the Senate at that stage—as Senator Ludwig has referred to. I indicated that my preference was to see the Northern Territory and Western Australian governments take action of their own volition to address the concerns which had been made very clear to the committee in this process.
Since that time—as Senator Ludwig has referred to in one manner; I will perhaps do so slightly less pejoratively—the nature of the legislation in the Northern Territory has been changed significantly by the introduction of the Northern Territory Juvenile Justice Amendment Act (No. 2) 2001 and the Northern Territory Sentencing Amendment Act (No. 3) 2001, which repealed mandatory sentencing for juvenile offenders and mandatory sentencing for property offences for adults respectively. Both took effect from 22 October 2001. I welcomed on a personal basis those actions of the new Northern Territory government last year. In the report, tabled in 2000, the government senators made a number of recommendations which, in this response, the government has acknowledged and in some cases supported. The first was that the Commonwealth should support the Northern Territory with funding to assist the development of an interpreter service to ensure that young people who could not speak or understand English would not continue to be disadvantaged by the legal system. The government has responded to that in a number of ways. The response also indicated, on a number of other recommendations that government senators made, that they would pursue some of those areas.
Let me first turn to the question of government assistance and the agreement that the government formed with the Northern Territory. The government agreed to provide $20 million over four years for a range of new community based diversionary programs which would operate in urban, rural and remote communities. They would include the establishment of community youth development units and drug and substance abuse diversionary programs. We supported the establishment of juvenile diversion units within the NT police service to oversee that diversion process and to act as a source of information and expertise on juvenile offenders for police throughout the territory. We supported a jointly funded Aboriginal interpreter service with offices in Darwin and Alice Springs and an on-site interpreter service at the Royal Darwin Hospital and the Alice Springs Hospital. We provided an additional $250,000 in the first year for the training of interpreters—in addition to recurrent funding for training—and funding for the four Northern Territory Aboriginal legal services for the purchase of interpreter services. 
The agreement formed between the Northern Territory and the Commonwealth also provided for different levels of response to juveniles who were apprehended, depending on the seriousness of the offence. The commencement of the agreement saw a pretty challenging environment, but since that time significant progress has been made. I understand from the government's response that, by 28 February this year, 1,606 juveniles out of the 2,142 cases of juvenile apprehensions—that is, three-quarters—were offered diversion, mostly by way of verbal or written warnings; 113 programs had been registered as suitable for diversion in 34 Northern Territory communities; 77 juveniles had been referred to registered diversionary programs; and 63 juveniles had been referred to informal programs.
The Aboriginal Interpreter Service offers a central booking service for both government and non-government agencies that require on-site Aboriginal language interpreters. By its second anniversary, in April 2002, it had 250 interpreters covering 104 languages on its register, and it had completed more than 2,400 jobs. The services that have used that Aboriginal Interpreter Service the most include the Territory health services, the Northern Territory Police, the Central Australian Aboriginal Legal Aid Service, the North Australian Aboriginal Legal Aid Service and the office of the DPP. That is an indication of how actively it has been taken up as an opportunity in the Northern Territory.
The agreement has been reviewed; I would describe it as one for which the NT government is highly accountable to the Commonwealth for the funds that it expends in terms of annual audits and reviews of progress when they have been conducted during that time. As Senator Ludwig would know, we also have the opportunity, through the estimates process of this parliament, to examine the Attorney-General's Department in relation to those services—and we do. Senators on both sides of the chamber ask for progress on the Northern Territory agreement, and we are advised regularly with updates on that.
In the report, the government senators made a couple of other responses to which the government has also responded in the document tabled today. We suggested that there be an audit and a review of all of the available diversionary and other support programs for juvenile offenders. The Commonwealth is now undertaking two projects in that regard. One of them is particularly important and it is very timely to refer to it today. The first is a project to conduct a national audit of all diversionary programs in place for juvenile offenders, for the purpose of identifying examples of good practice in diversion. They are then to be presented at a national forum to be held next month. That will be a very good opportunity to look at where similar programs in Australia are going, and what best practice actually is. The second is a national profiling of programs mentoring youth at risk, also aimed at identifying best practice and also expected to be completed this year. They are both very important initiatives that the Commonwealth has undertaken in that regard.
There are a number of programs in relation to young people which come broadly under the heading of the recommendation that the government senators made in this report about actively canvassing and developing options for rehabilitating and deterring juveniles and young adults from repeat offending as alternatives to mandatory sentencing. The government is committed to a range of initiatives which include early intervention in relation to suicide, drug abuse, early school leaving, unemployment and homelessness. A number of strategies have an overarching responsibility in that area; they would include the National Drug Strategic Framework, the National Drug Strategy, the National Mental Health Strategy and the National Youth Suicide Prevention Strategy.
One program with which I am particularly familiar is the National Youth Suicide Prevention Strategy. It is important for its capacity to look at innovative programs, and very often when we are talking about Indigenous juveniles that is extremely important. The one-size-fits-all approach is not the case in that regard. It is important within those strategies to be innovative, flexible and open to alternative suggestions, and I think that is what marks that particular strategy. The programs also include the National Homelessness Strategy, the Youth Pathways Action Plan Taskforce, Partnerships Against Domestic Violence and so on. Let me just identify the Youth Pathways Action Plan Taskforce report Footprints to the Future, which sets out a policy framework for supporting young people throughout their life—through school and from school to further education, to training and to work and active citizenship. Its recommendations have been welcomed by the Commonwealth and are being pursued. 
One of the important issues which the entire committee and government senators identified was the importance of consultation with Indigenous communities—to resource and develop from within those communities some of the solutions to the problems which we saw in our extremely intensive and extensive reporting process. The agreement that the Commonwealth has with the Northern Territory, to which I referred earlier, does recognise that consultation with key people within the communities, and particularly Indigenous leaders, is imperative in the development and operation of community based and community driven diversionary programs. I think these are all points which, as part of the government response to this report, should be noted by the Senate.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2002-08-22,"—Mr Deputy President, I, too, congratulate you on your recent election. I would also like to follow up from Senator Payne in paying tribute and commendation to retired Senators Cooney and McKiernan, who contributed so significantly not just to the references committee but to this particular inquiry.
The first thing that struck me about the Government Response to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee Report of the Inquiry into the Human Rights (Mandatory Sentencing of Juvenile Offenders) Bill 1999, which we have incorporated into the Hansard today, was the date of it, really. I think it is rather sad and telling that the Human Rights (Mandatory Sentencing of Juvenile Offenders) Bill 1999—a bill that was introduced and on which we began debate in 1999—is responded to only today, some three years later, by the government. My feeling and experiences are that there is much community anxiety about mandatory sentencing, and that is not reflected in the way in which the government has often responded to this issue.
As Senator Payne has said, the government's response at the time, which is being discussed here today, effectively advocated that the bill ought not be passed and that the states or the territories ought to do so themselves. Since that time, we have seen that that has in fact happened in the Northern Territory under the new government with Clare Martin. That has been roundly welcomed and her government has been congratulated by my party and others. I have had the opportunity to visit the Northern Territory in recent weeks to inquire into how some of that law reform is progressing, and there are certainly positive signs that things are working well. It is not brilliant but, as I have said previously, there are social problems—the underlying difficulties, often with broken families, of physical and sexual abuse and sometimes drug and alcohol abuse. Broken families fundamentally seem to be the strongest contributing cause, particularly of juvenile crime in the Northern Territory, amongst Indigenous populations. Fundamentally, that remains the Democrats' strong and vehement opposition to the whole notion of mandatory sentencing, given that we continue to argue that it must be left to the discretion of the courts—to the judges and the magistrates—to determine on a case-by-case basis what the sentencing for any particular crime ought to be, allowing them to take into consideration the extraordinary circumstances that many people, particularly young people, find themselves in.
It remains the case that, to its shame, my home state of Western Australia is now the only jurisdiction in the nation which maintains mandatory sentencing, introduced under the then Labor government of Dr Carmen Lawrence. To be fair, the mandatory sentencing regime in Western Australia is different from that which existed in the Northern Territory. It is a three-strikes policy rather than a first-strike policy and relates only to property offences. Nonetheless, it is still having a serious effect on Indigenous people, young Indigenous people in particular, and remains the topic of heated and controversial debate on the public airwaves and through the press in my home state. It remains a thorny issue, too, with the parliament which, under the premiership of Dr Geoff Gallop, has seen some exceptional and welcome social reform. There remains strident opposition from the government, shared by the coalition opposition, to maintain those laws in Western Australia—despite the alternative dynamic that now exists in the state's upper house. 
As an example, I would like to bring the attention of the chamber to a relatively recent case published in the West Australian, where some of these issues were being debated in relation to a young, I understand, Indigenous girl. The article said:
A 13-year-old Broome girl at the centre of a row over WA's mandatory sentencing laws was sent to detention for a year yesterday—
and this was published on 24 July this year—
for committing another string of home burglaries in the North-West last month.
The girl, who is not named because of her age, stole cash and personal possessions from seven houses in Broome not long after being given a final chance by Children's Court president Kate O'Brien. In May, the judge ignored prosecution calls to lock up the repeat offender and instead placed her on a 12-month conditional release order.
The child returned to Broome to live with her grandmother and siblings but began offending again on June 8 and was arrested by police two weeks later.
She pleaded guilty to seven counts of aggravated burglary in Broome Magistrate's Court on June 22 and was remanded in custody for sentencing.
She also admitted being part of a group of teenage girls who kicked and punched a 16-year-old girl before stealing her mobile phone in February.
And so it goes on. It became very clear that the significant and underlying social problems and social causes of this particular offender were such that the court could not take that into consideration, so the situation remains that judges and magistrates cannot exercise discretion in sentencing—a situation which continues to be criticised and condemned by WA's Chief Justice, Mr David Malcolm, who said:
Unless our community can settle on an alternative method of addressing crime and the rehabilitation of offenders, WA will continue to see an increase in the number of alcohol and other drug dependent offenders. Yet as a community we persist with such illusionary solutions as mandatory sentencing which is only a short term quick fix solution to impress constituents from one election to the next.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,Committees,19,2,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-08-22,"—This is a government response to the report of the Legal and Constitutional References Committee on the Human Rights (Mandatory Sentencing of Juvenile Offenders) Bill 1999, which I introduced into the Senate a bit more than two years ago. The dilatory nature of that response is remarkable, but it is a response that is written with hindsight. It effectively says that the Greens legislation—which was supported by this side of the Senate back there—was right, that the outcomes which that aimed at were correct and that the decision by Prime Minister Howard and the government at the outset to oppose that legislation was not right.
What has happened in the meantime is the result of a national furore over mandatory detention, which ensnared primarily Aboriginal children in the Northern Territory but also in Western Australia, to the effect that it was not conscionable in our country. It was effectively locking kids up, doing them no good, potentially leading them to come out of detention with a greater likelihood of relapsing into petty crime than before and making them feel estranged from the very system that should have been helping them.
As a result of that legislation—which I brought into parliament at the behest of Aboriginal communities and also the Northern Territory Greens at the time—the consequent committee findings got the support of the Senate, the Labor Party, the Democrats and the Independent senators at the time. It passed this place and went to the House of Representatives, where consideration of the legislation, and even debate of the legislation, was blocked by the government of the day. I must note that it was put forward there by then opposition leader Beazley and the Labor Party in the interests of improving this situation. 
Nevertheless, that then caused a serious break in the ranks of the government. The more humanitarian-minded people in the government said to the Prime Minister, `We have to do something about that.' It was in response to that that the Prime Minister then approached the Northern Territory government with considerable money and an agreement was made to vastly change the terrible situation that had existed up until then. Interpreters were to be brought into courts so that Aboriginal kids understood what was going on and there were diversionary opportunities created. Most kids have gone to those diversions. Instead of being locked up in effective juvenile jails, they are out learning things which are going to be helpful to them and the community in the long run.
In the consequence of that there was a change of government in the Northern Territory from the Country Liberal Party government to the Martin Labor government, which had the good sense to lead off by abolishing the mandatory sentencing legislation. It is a great outcome. I pay tribute to the Senate and its committee system and to those Indigenous organisations and the Greens in the Northern Territory, who first moved, with the legal community in Australia—not least in the Northern Territory—at the forefront, to put right a terrible wrong. There is still some road to go—we should abolish the sentencing in Western Australia. But the outcome has been great, and I thank all those who were involved. (Time expired)
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,Committees,19,2,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2002-08-22,"—Last evening it was asserted by an honourable senator that a picture in a brochure—incidentally, mailed out only to Liberal Party members in the electorate of Denison—had `brought considerable pain' to someone living in Far North Queensland. The honourable senator who raised the matter last evening raised the person's name publicly in this place on an evening that, as the senator would have been aware, the Senate was being broadcast, thus ensuring that any pain suffered by the lady who was in the photograph would be multiplied a hundred times over.
The fact that it was raised more than two months after the event and after the total brochure was publicised by another left-wing Labor MP raises the issue of credibility. That is especially the case when one notes this: if the honourable senator were genuinely aggrieved, why on earth would the honourable senator seek to publicise the matter and trawl the person's name across the airwaves and provide exposure of that person's name to tens of thousands of her fellow Australians? The damage from that stunt will, of course, be far greater than a very small mail-out in the second most southern electorate of Australia about someone residing in the northernmost electorate in Australia. The honourable senator who raised the matter has, unfortunately, an unenviable reputation amongst other left-wing MPs for being patronising of our Indigenous community.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I believe Senator Abetz is casting some aspersions on a sitting member of the Senate and I think he should withdraw those comments.
 (Senator McLucas)—I think that, given the circumstances, there is no point of order. 
—The crocodile tears that were shed yesterday highlight this. Why broadcast and multiply the alleged hurt hundreds of times over and to thousands of people and thus occasion, allegedly, even more hurt? A genuine approach would have been to approach me—the author of the brochure—to ascertain the extent of its distribution and then indicate a particular course of action. But why the senator would trawl the name through on a broadcast day as a political stunt months after the brochure was published is beyond me. I think it exposes the speech last night as being not genuine but a stunt. As the senator indicated, the brochure did have a photo on the back page. I will read the back page of the brochure into the Hansard. It said:
As a former chairman of the Joint Statutory Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund, I have often been asked my view on Rabbit Proof Fence. I viewed the film with great interest. Unfortunately, I came away feeling that in an effort to sensationalise an already incredible story truth was the first thing to go. It would seem that the movie's subject, Molly Craig, feels the same way. When shown a special screening of the movie she stated, `That's not my story.' The facts of Australia's shared past can often be hard and unpalatable to address but untruths and exaggerations only complicate the matter. Someone once said that if you add to the truth you subtract from it.
Yours truly, Eric Abetz, Special Minister of State and Liberal Senator for Tasmania.
We can go into the ins and outs of this situation. I was honoured to be able to meet this particular person in Far North Queensland in the circumstances outlined by the honourable senator in her speech to the Senate last night. The person who was named—and I have no intention of naming the person this evening—is a renowned artist. When I first came to this place eight years ago I spotted a piece of her artwork in the parliamentary collection and have had it displayed in my office ever since, never having known or met the artist—I simply liked the piece of artwork. Whilst I was with this person in Far North Queensland, photographs were taken. As always, I indicated that the photographs may be used in conjunction with my work as a senator and a member of the joint native title committee et cetera, and there was no problem with that, as expressed to me.
—She didn't ever say that to you.
—I know the discussion that I had and I also know that the aim of my work with the native title committee has always been to try to get the best possible result for our Indigenous community. The brochure was entitled A rabbit proof fence full of holes. It did detail that Molly Craig said, `That's not my story.' The brochure contained an article by a former distinguished minister for Aboriginal affairs, Peter Howson, and by Des Moore from the Institute of Public Affairs. I believe it is a sound and reasoned article.
—Nobody else does.
—I hear the interjection: `Nobody else does.' I can assure you that I do, and I can assure you that a lot of other people do. The actual person, Molly Craig, after a special screening of the film, was quoted in the media as saying, `That's not my story.'
—You are quoting her out of context.
—The Sun Herald, on 17 February 2002, is also guilty of that. That means, therefore, that a few people, other than just those two people, were of that particular view. What we have seen from the senator in question is the pulling of a stunt. If it were a genuine matter, private contact would have been made with me to ascertain the extent of the distribution and dialogue would have been entered into. Instead we had the shameless stunt of naming this person publicly—to tens of thousands of Australians, no doubt—courtesy of the Labor senator. It highlights the lack of credibility of the honourable senator in raising it. As I said, it was a little brochure that had very limited circulation in the second most southern electorate in Australia.
—How is that relevant?
—Order! Continued interjections and comments from the left invite answers from my right and I do not believe that is in order. I ask the minister to ignore the interjections and address his remarks through the chair. Interjections on my left are not acceptable either. 
—Thank you, Mr President. Anybody who knows me will be fully aware that I—
—That you are cunning and sly and use Aboriginal people for your own advantage.
—Order! I would ask you to withdraw those remarks please.
—That is very offensive, Senator Crossin.
—I withdraw.
—Thank you.
—Thank you for withdrawing that. Those people who know of my service on the native title committee would be aware of my commitment for practical reconciliation for our Indigenous community. My service on that committee was something that I took very seriously, because I am one of those people who believes that our Indigenous community is without doubt the most disadvantaged group within our community and needs the assistance of all parliamentarians in this place. Trying to use them as political footballs is patronising, manipulative and demeaning. To broadcast the person's name publicly as a political stunt to tens of thousands of Australians via the airwaves, as the senator did, shows that what she was on about was nothing but a cheap stunt. It lacks credibility and I do not think it does the cause of our Indigenous community any benefit.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-08-22,"—The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
(1)	The price paid for Roebuck Plains Station land; infrastructure; plant and equipment; and cattle in May 1999 was $8 million subject to adjustments for cattle numbers after completion of the muster required under the contract.
(2)	I am advised by the ILC that it has no direct knowledge of the price paid by the vendors, however it understands that the total price paid by them on 30 December 1997 was $6.35 million but included less cattle numbers than acquired by the ILC.
(3)	I am advised by the ILC that part of the increase in price may be reflected in an increase in cattle numbers. In addition, the two sales were in fact 17 months apart (not 12 months as suggested in the question).
(4)	I am advised by the ILC that the ILC did commission an independent valuation, and the price paid for the land was within the recommended range.
(5)	Yes.
(6)	The ILC considered the acquisition of Roebuck Plains Station to be strategically important and unique. A number of groups had clearly enunciated their interest in Roebuck Plains Station. The ILC is not limited to acquiring land if, and only if, there is a registration of land need or an application although this is the more usual course.
 (7)	At the time of the acquisition decision the ILC Board was of the view that the purchase of Roebuck Plains Station met the National Indigenous Land Strategy.
(8)	I am advised by the ILC that a considerable number of officers and employees of the ILC were involved in the purchase of Roebuck Plains Station including negotiating the purchase price. They included the then Chairman, Mr David Ross; Mr Peter Yu; Mr Murray Chapman (then General Manager); Mr John Wilson, Dr Stuart Phillpot; and Ms Sally Skyring.
The Board's decision to acquire the property was executed by Chairman Ross and Director Djerkurra.
(9)	I am advised by the ILC that it does not exclusively use the services of any service provider.
(10)	No. However, I am advised by the ILC that it was a condition of the purchase that a muster take place after completion and appropriate adjustments to cattle numbers and the final price made. Part of the purchase price was withheld for this purpose.
(11)	I am advised by the ILC that it entered into a 15-year management agreement for Roebuck Plains Station, consistent with commercial advice it received at the time. It is not correct to state that the management agreement “effectively locked Aboriginal people out of the arrangement”, as that agreement allowed for rights of occupation and use of the land by Traditional Owners.
(12)	The matters referred to in the question have been the subject of an examination and the ILC is awaiting the outcome.
(13)	I am advised by the ILC that the continuing Directors and the new Board were extremely dissatisfied with the terms of the management agreement. In addition, there were disputes in relation to the terms and conditions and the performance thereof. The ILC Board resolved to take full control of the property and after legal advice, termination was negotiated.
(14)	The management agreement was negotiated primarily by Chairman Ross and John Wilson.
(15)	I am advised by the ILC that it paid no such commission or commissions.
(16)	(a) I am advised by the ILC that it understands the Directors at the relevant time were Mr John Vereker, Mr Peter McCoy and Mr Rodney Illingworth. (b) I have no knowledge of their backgrounds.
(17)	I have no knowledge of this matter. 
(18)	I am not aware of any such relationship.
(19)	I am not aware of any such relationship.
(20)	I am not aware of any such relationship.
(21)	The ILC advises me there has been no such activities.
(22)	The ILC advises me it is not aware of this.
(23)	The matters referred to in the question have been the subject of an examination and the ILC is awaiting the outcome.
(24)	The ILC advises me it is not aware of this.
(25)	The ILC advises me it is not aware of such a proposal by the Great Northern Pastoral Company.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Indigenous Land Corporation: Roebuck Plains Cattle Station</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,28,1,answer
