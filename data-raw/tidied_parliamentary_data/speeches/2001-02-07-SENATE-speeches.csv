"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-02-07,"—I wish to continue the comments I was making yesterday in relation to the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust Bill 2000, the motion moved by Senator Hill and the issue as a whole. It is important to emphasise the importance of the role that the Senate has played. Indeed, I was a bit surprised, given how much the Senate amendments have been taken on board by the government, that other non-government speakers have not been paying a lot of attention to the significant benefits and improvements that have been made as a result of the Senate's work. Slightly over 100 amendments that were made to this bill by the Democrats and the ALP back in the middle of last year, in what I thought was a good example of cooperation, have resulted in significant improvements.
For some reason, when the Democrats and the ALP put amendments together and vote together it is fine, upstanding cooperation and when the Democrats vote with the government it is outrageous, dirty, backroom secret dealing. That is political rhetoric for you. You do not get much more open and public than debating, explaining and outlining amendments in the Senate chamber. That is what the Democrats are doing as part of this legislation. It is important to emphasise that this bill—as significantly amended in line with the Democrat and Labor amendments from last year—ensures that the Defence Force land surrounding the Sydney Harbour foreshores will not, indeed cannot, be sold by this government or any future federal or state government.
It is a one-off opportunity to protect those lands and in the process put them in the context of developing a cohesive plan for the future in terms of public access, preserving heritage and maintaining useableness and workability. The amendments that have been put in place make an enormous difference in terms of ensuring the long-term protection of those lands for future generations. Contrary to the misunderstandings that were put forward in this chamber yesterday when we started debating this legislation—in the position that the Democrats were taking, anyway—the aim is to vote to ensure that Sydney Harbour lands will not be sold and that they will be protected for future generations.
The concern the Democrats have is that, if the government were able to walk away from this legislation—as they quite easily could do—and kill or dump the bill, then that one-off opportunity would pass. Voting to kill the bill would be voting to leave all those Defence Force lands at risk of being sold either by this government or by a future government. As was pointed out yesterday, at one stage it was a position of the ALP, when they were in government, to sell a lot of these lands. That position has changed since then, and that is a good thing. It highlights the point that any future government, if there is no legislative protection put in place, can sell significant parts of these Defence Force lands. As anybody who has visited the various sites would agree, they are incredibly significant, in some cases not just in terms of bushland but also in terms of heritage, indigenous and cultural values. There is a lot of history there.
Sydney Harbour is an issue not just for the people of Sydney, although they obviously have an important stake in it; it is an issue for the people of Australia, because it is an Australian icon. Of all the people partaking in this debate, none are from Sydney or New South Wales. It is a significant gateway to Australia, and it is of interest to all Australians to ensure that its future is protected. As is often the case with legislation that the Senate has to consider, the Senate has to choose between insisting on an absolutely perfect outcome or accepting an outcome which is a significant advance in the status quo. 
We have already heard some political rhetoric on this, and I am sure we will have to endure some more political rhetoric before this debate is out. From the Democrats point of view, if it is a matter of protecting the environment and heritage, we will certainly put that first every time—before politics, political rhetoric and supposed short-term political advantage. That is a record the Democrats have in relation to a whole range of environmental issues. The reason we have a strong record on environmental issues is that we will put the environment first, before knee-jerk politics, and that is what we are doing in relation to this legislation.
The only piece of land that may—and it is important to emphasise `may'—be developed is basically a suburban cul-de-sac of 1960s government houses—not exactly an endangered species, unless people think that 1960s red brick houses are an endangered species. It would be developed only after a comprehensive management plan in consultation with the community, local councils and state and federal governments and only after the development was deemed to be consistent with the future direction of the land. There are important issues in relation to ensuring that that land is not used for a high-rise or any building that is of greater height than is there now, because it would damage the visual aspect of the harbour if a building went up over the ridge line. But it is not a heritage site; it is basically some housing in a suburban street. It is an area I have been to and examined, as I have examined all the other Defence Force lands.
I think it is important to emphasise that that is the only piece of land that has any prospect of being sold under the legislation as it now stands. The significantly amended bill, as it now stands, ensures that all the other Defence Force lands listed—and there are some very significant and magnificent sites amongst them—will be protected from sale in the future. Taking a vote to knock off this legislation would prevent those lands from being protected. The Democrats position is that we are not going to leave those lands unprotected and at risk of future sale.
Given the number of amendments we have and the length of the running sheet, I will not speak further at this point. There will no doubt be further misunderstandings put forward during this debate, and we may need to correct those to ensure the public is not misinformed about the purpose of this legislation and the effect of it as amended. There are some other amendments which we will speak to as we go through the rest of the legislation. Many of those that the opposition has put forward have a lot of merit. When they are put forward, I think it is important for the government to give its explanation of why they are not acceptable or why they are problematic.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-02-07,"—I rise to speak on the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust Bill 2000. Firstly, I want to speak about the specific amendment in which the government wants to change the objects of the act by changing the pivotal word from `preserve' to `enhance'—that is, the aim of the act would be to enhance the Sydney Harbour foreshore instead of preserve it. This gives a direct bead on at least some of the government's intentions. When you go to the Macquarie Dictionary, you find that the word `preserve' is entirely appropriate to the sentiments most people are expressing about the aim of this legislation. It says:
1. to keep alive or in existence; make lasting. 2. to keep safe from harm or injury; save. 3. to keep up; maintain. 4. to keep possession of; retain ...
When you go to `enhance', you find a very different meaning. `Enhance' means:
1. to raise to a higher degree; intensify; magnify ... 2. to raise the value or price of ...
So my question to the minister is: why do you want to change this word? Why has the government's object gone from being one of preserving these lands to one of building up or increasing the value or the price of these lands? In the second reading speech, the minister himself began by saying:
The Commonwealth Government, in its 1998 election commitment, Protecting the Sydney Harbour Foreshore, stated that it was committed to preserving the Sydney Harbour foreshore for future generations.
He went on to say:
As the cradle of European settlement and the focus of Australia's most populous city, the Harbour is the quintessential image of our nation abroad. It will be the centre of international attention during the 2000 Olympic Games.
For the people of Sydney, the Harbour provides an avenue for commerce and the transport of people. The Harbour and its foreshores are a focus of city living and of recreational pursuits. 
For these reasons the Government is committed to preserving the Harbour and its foreshore for future generations.
He goes on to use the word `preserve' a third time in the second reading speech. I think that is an entirely appropriate word. The object of this bill is to preserve these lands. So I ask the minister: why has `preserve' been changed to `enhance' since he wrote the second reading speech, dwelt on that word and emphasised that that word came from the Prime Minister himself? What is the significance, as the government sees it, of the word `enhancement' which makes it more appropriate than the word `preservation'? Unless there is a good explanation, I will be opposing this amendment. I believe the bill as it stands—using the word `preserve'—is entirely appropriate.
That being said, I want to respond to Senator Bartlett, who spent much of his contribution talking about those of us who have a different point of view wanting to misrepresent or in some way or other give a false analysis of what the Democrats position is. Let him defend their position, but we have every right to put forward a different one—a stronger one and one which is indeed aimed at preserving the foreshore lands, not just enhancing or increasing the value of the foreshore lands as the government's new aim would have it.
Senator Bartlett said a number of times that the Democrats have moved to compromise in these amendments because they did not want the government walking away from this legislation. This shows the weakness of the Democrats position. The Democrats want to be at the prime ministerial table and involved in making the big decisions but, time and time again, they are found to be, effectively, doing nothing of the sort. They are found to be simply paving the way for the government to get unsatisfactory legislation through the Senate, which should be the watchdog of the people's interest. There is no way that the government is going to back down on this transfer of land. The government sees it as a centrepiece of its forthcoming election platform, particularly for the people in the marginal seats in Sydney, who are going to be very keen on seeing the transfer of these lands to the trust and the protection of these foreshore lands as an enormous heirloom for the city of Sydney and the people of Australia in the future.
The government also sees some commercial opportunities for some of the lands—for example, Markham Close, which has been valued, I understand, at $15 million; I am talking about the red brick houses in Mosman that Senator Bartlett was just referring to—coming down the line. So it has opened up the way for the privatisation and the sale of some of these lands, all of which should be kept in the public domain and protected in the future as public amenity. I will be asking the minister for the government valuation of Markham Close and other lands that has so far not been forthcoming. That aside, I wanted to say to Senator Bartlett, through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, and to the Democrats that the position they have taken is facilitating the strategy of the government. It is not facilitating the interests of the people of Sydney. They have gone to the table from the weak position of wanting to be seen to be the fixers and, instead, they end up being the people who allow the government to come up with second-best legislation which is inevitably going to include the privatisation of some very important components of what should be the future Sydney Harbour National Park.
There is no need for this. If the Democrats were standing strong with the Labor Party and the Greens, this legislation would be going through in the way that those people in the community in Sydney who have been fighting for the best outcome would have it, with these lands protected, with their integrity assured and with the hovering possibility—I would say probability—of the real estate values making some of the lands fall prey to future so-called development—that is, moneymaking—by sectional interests, by people who can get their hands on it, eliminated.
Because of the Democrats amendments, that possibility is going to be there. We have the possibility of the future transfer of lands into schedule 2 and then on to purchase, with no real backstop except ministerial authority. A tick from the minister of the day here in Canberra is all that is required for the sale of those lands, and that is not satisfactory. I say to Senator Bartlett: you protest too much. You have proven to be the weak link in the defence of the lands. You have not learnt from the GST debacle. You have not learnt from the environment bill debacle, where the Democrats effectively gave the woodchippers what they wanted through the regional forest agreement components of that legislation. 
Now we have, with this important legislation, a second-best outcome, because the Democrats have not held firm. We will get into detail as this debate unfolds. It is another matter of great importance that, through this deal with the government, we are going to see certain important environment and planning laws in New South Wales not applying under certain circumstances to the protection of these Sydney Harbour foreshore lands. And the question is: why not? That is a question that the Democrats are going to have to answer.
We have another Meg Lees-John Howard get-together to come up with a solution which is one the Prime Minister wanted, not one the people wanted. It has pulled the rug from under those people who saw the real opportunity of this being a totally good outcome for the Sydney Harbour foreshore lands. So there it is. I congratulate the Labor Party for its stand on this future Sydney Harbour National Park. We are going to get an outcome here today. It is going to be a Democrats-Howard government outcome. No doubt, it is going to be a centrepiece of Mr Howard's election campaign in Sydney. But those who know the issue are going to be regretful that, because of the Democrats, it is second best and it does leave a lingering threat that there will be future privatisation of parts of what should be a completely safe Sydney Harbour National Park for the future.
The attraction for, and the pressure from, developers of this land is going to be huge. When you leave the way open for that, that way will be taken. So instead of people planning the future of this great national park with security, there is going to be ongoing anguish as pressure comes from those people who can see themselves making a profit at the public expense through the future sale of components of this land. There should be one absolutely certain outcome here: none of this land can be sold into the private domain. This is public land; this is the people's land. It always has been, and it should not be changed now as we move towards the creation of one of the world's great urban national park systems on the foreshores of Sydney Harbour.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-02-07,"—by leave—I move opposition amendments Nos 1 to 3:
(1)	Amendment (1), Preamble, first paragraph, omit ""to conserve and preserve"", substitute ""to conserve, preserve and enhance"".
 (2)	Amendment (1), Preamble, first paragraph, omit ""Suitable land with significant environmental and heritage values"", substitute ""The land"".
 (3)	Amendment (1), Preamble, second paragraph, omit "". The Trust will transfer suitable land"".
These amendments go to the purport of the House of Representatives amendment No. 1—that is, to the preamble of this legislation. As I said last night, this legislation, as it is going to go through today, represents a missed opportunity in a number of respects, and one of those respects is being able to state in the preamble quite clearly and with a degree of vision what this land is all about and what preserving it is all about. We do not do that. We have missed this opportunity to recognise that what we are talking about here is land with significant natural heritage, historic, indigenous and cultural aspects. We also missed the opportunity to talk about the necessity to rehabilitate and restore these lands for future use in public trust. There is no vision in this legislation. It is a vision that you would expect from a 1950s, Sydney suburban solicitor—that is, John Howard. 
Unfortunately, as Senator Brown quite rightly said this morning and as we said last night, the Australian Democrats have also missed the chance to be part of moulding some fairly important legislation here. They have chosen the approach of being the third arm of government yet again when it comes to environment matters. Over the break, there was promise after promise, indication after indication, that Meg Lees now wanted the Democrats to be seen as an alternative to the major parties. As I said last night, not only have the Democrats sold out; they have devalued the currency of trading and doing deals in this place. They sold out early, and they sold out in the basest of ways when they did not have to. This government needs this legislation to go through, because it tries to represent a promise made by the Prime Minister before the last election, a promise which, in the passages of this legislation and the way it has been dealt with by the Democrats and the government, is breached; that promise is broken. The promise was a commitment to keep all the land in public trust and to hand over that land to New South Wales to be subject to its environmental and heritage laws. This preamble does not even accept that as well.
We challenge the Democrats again. We are moving amendments, such as those I have just moved conjointly. Those amendments will enhance the value of the preamble. They will enhance the language of the preamble to recognise the inherent values of this land, to recognise that all trust land should remain in public ownership and to ensure that the trust land is transferred to the national parks and reserves system of New South Wales, as promised by the Prime Minister. This was an opportunity for the Australian Democrats to kick off this year with a new start. As I said last night, they have come from the party of claiming for themselves a role of keeping the bastards honest to the party now under Meg Lees who are being seen in their deals and counter-deals with the government as, in a sense you could call them, `Meg the cheap'. They are for sale, they are for sale at fire sale prices, and this is an indication of that.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-02-07,"—I will not correct every distortion that everyone makes in this debate or we will be here until Christmas, but I think it is appropriate to respond on behalf of the Democrats to some of the comments that have been made. Firstly, following on from Senator Bolkus's comments, I think the only thing cheap that is happening here is the cheap shots that he is choosing to take. I guess that is understandable because there is not much else there. If they just want to make political postures and ignore the environmental opportunities, then that is fine, but as I said before the Democrats will put environmental opportunities first.
I will not talk about the fabulous performance of the ALP in terms of protecting public ownership of things. One could mention the sale of the Commonwealth Bank, Qantas, the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, our airports and pipelines—the list goes on and on. Indeed, as I said previously, the ALP, when they were in government, proposed selling off some of the lands that we are now going to lock in permanently in public ownership as a result of this legislation. So I think for them to come in and talk about needing to protect a few blocks of suburban housing as though it is the holy grail of protecting public ownership is fairly ironic, to put it mildly.
Then there is this idea of devaluing the currency of dealing or, to use Senator Brown's phrase, the idea that this is somehow or other about wanting to sit at the Prime Minister's table. I must say that I have never been in the Prime Minister's office, and I do not particularly have any desire to be, one way or the other. I have not even been to the Lodge, actually. What I am focusing on as a legislator is delivering positive legislative outcomes for the people of Australia. From the Democrats point of view, that particularly involves putting the environment first. That is what we are going to do. We are not going to put politics first.
Senator Brown said that we need to maintain public amenity. That is what this bill as amended does. It ensures a maximised public amenity on all of this Sydney Harbour foreshore land. How he could call some suburban housing public amenity is a bit beyond me. Markham Close is almost identical to Defence houses in any other place. For example, Long Tan Place at Scheyville, about 35 kilometres to the north-west, is almost identical in terms of 1960 designed red brick houses, but nobody is suggesting that they should be kept and preserved for all time as part of the need to maintain public amenity. The only difference is that Markham Close is located on the edge of the suburb of Mosman. It is important that development controls are maintained over that land, that it is not misused and that inappropriate development does not occur on it, but that is separate to the issue of ownership. That is why there are all the other protections in the legislation.
It is worth emphasising that, in the absence of legislation, the federal government can do whatever it wants. Indeed, it is doing whatever it wants now. The interim trust is operating without legislative oversight, constraints and protection. By enabling something to be put in place, we are preventing governments from changing their minds and switching to something else, whether that is selling the land off or allowing inappropriate development.
I do not know whether Senator Brown has been to Markham Close or how many meetings he has had with the many community groups that have put great effort into protecting these lands over the years. I do not know how many meetings he has had with local councils and the trust director or how much of a look he has had around all the other various sites. I do not know whether he has spoken with the planners and architects who are in place now in the interim trust, who have an incredibly passionate commitment to protecting these lands into the future. I would be interested to know if he has done all those things and got that perspective on what is being done now and what the potential and opportunities are rather than simply going on about somehow incorporating some suburban housing into Sydney Harbour National Park. Suburban housing would make an interesting national park addition. Basically, what is being suggested is that we should throw away this opportunity to prevent the Sydney Harbour foreshore lands from being sold for some ideal of putting suburban housing into a national park. That is the logical extension of what is being said.
The Democrats believe that there are some extra benefits and improvements that could be made to this legislation. I think it is quite clear that the government do not have to proceed with it. I do not see any reason why they would not withdraw this legislation and go ahead and do something different in an election year. It would be quite easy for them to put that forward as some sort of stunt that required no legislative backing, approval or protection whatsoever. This is a one-off opportunity to protect and preserve these lands for future generations. That is why the Democrats will not pass up the opportunity for the sake of some political point scoring. 
It is important to note all of the gains that have been made by the Democrats and the Labor Party. I would have thought they would be claiming these as gains they have achieved rather than trashing them as being of no worth whatsoever. One of the significant concerns and problems in place in the original legislation was a significant requirement that a sustainable financial base be part of the functions of the trust. That is no longer there as a result of the amendments. The risk of inappropriate commercial development is, and has always been, the main danger with the future of these lands. Indeed, Sydney Harbour as a whole has any number of examples of inappropriate and unfortunate commercial development—much of it a consequence of actions of the state government—as well as development on previous Commonwealth lands. That highlights how dangerous it is to leave these lands unregulated. 
We have specific individual properties that are now named in the preamble, and the boundaries are listed. All of the land in schedule 1—which is all of the lands except for Markham Close, the suburban housing—is required to remain in public ownership. Even that suburban housing can only be sold where the approved plan has identified sale as the preferred option and the land has not been identified as having significant environmental heritage values. The government can put future lands into schedule 2 and be in a position to sell them off, that is true. But the government also does not have to put any lands into schedule 2 at all. If it wants to sell other land off, it can just do it. To suggest that, somehow or other, not having a cast-iron protection against the sale of Markham Close leaves all of the foreshore lands open to being flogged off is simply wrong. 
The trust is not able to even give security over any land that is mentioned in schedule 1, which is all of the lands that are listed except for those suburban housing blocks. Long leases are disallowable instruments. We have expanded the membership of the trust and allowed and ensured direct representation of an elected member of local government. I think the role of local governments is important here. I acknowledge the work that the local councils have put in, as well as the work that many people in the community organisations have put in, because it has resulted in significant gains.
At the end of all the shouting and finger pointing that passes for debate in this place occasionally, you have to look at whether you are moving forward and making some gains or whether you are not doing so. Clearly, being able to ensure that all of these lands on the foreshores are protected from future sale is a significant advance over where we would otherwise be and where we will be if the government chooses to walk away from the legislation. There have also been significant changes in terms of increased public and community participation and transparency and openness of meetings, minutes, plans, public notices and the like. I think that is an important part of it and will be a significant change from what has occurred with most Sydney Harbour lands in the past, whether you are talking about Commonwealth or state lands. Basically, these lands have been open to deals between developers, governments and councils. That would no longer be possible if this legislation were to pass. If it were to fall over, through the government walking away from it, those deals would still be possible. That is an outcome that the Democrats do not want to see happen and do not want to facilitate happening.
So it is not a matter of trying to facilitate the government. If anything, the Senate as a whole has been a pain in the neck for the government in this issue because we have dragged it out over months and months and months. We have required them to take on board significant amounts of concerns of the community, of the Senate and of local councils, and the fact that they have done that to a fair degree, I think, would be more a matter of the government facilitating the demands and wishes of the community and of the Senate rather than the other way around. I do not particularly care who is in government in relation to legislation that is put forward, and the Democrats never have. What we are concerned about is getting positive advances for the environment for the community. We certainly do not want to throw those away for the sake of some political posturing, because we will, as we always have, put the environment first.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-02-07,—I ask the minister to explain why this amendment is being made and just how it changes the direction of the act.,SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2001-02-07,"—This is the amendment that I think Senator Brown referred to earlier in relation to the objects, to omit the word `preserving' and substitute the word `enhancing'. Senator Brown suspected that there was some sort of evil intent attached to this. I gather that the interim trustees had a long debate on this subject of the distinctions between preserving and enhancing. Whilst in the preamble we had not included the word `enhancing', it was considered desirable to put it in the objects as it relates to ensuring that the management of trust land contributes to enhancing—at the moment it is preserving but would become enhancing—the amenity of the Sydney Harbour region. 
As I understand it, the reason for doing that was that they were concerned that, say, in relation to Cockatoo Island, if it simply said `preserving', they might be obliged to preserve what is there now in its current form, whereas in some circumstances it could be enhanced and improved; and they wanted to make clear that that was within the objectives that were their charter. I would not seek to read as much into it as Senator Brown has. I personally do not think that there is a great distinction between preserving and enhancing in this circumstance. In relation to the way in which the trustees are going to meet their obligations, I do not think there is a great difference either.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-02-07,"—There is some confusion here because the aim, ultimately, of this legislation must be to preserve the natural amenity of the Sydney Harbour foreshores. What is happening here is that when it gets to the objects, the driving component of this legislation, that aim of preservation suddenly gives way to enhancing, which does have the very clear motivation of human improvement, as we perceive it, built upon it. So it does not sit well with the natural values. Suddenly the built values that Senator Hill referred to come to the forefront and the others get left behind. The Labor amendment is to preserve, conserve and enhance. It at least retains that need for preservation of the natural values to be at the forefront of the design of management plans for the future. If you simply give to managers the direction that they are to enhance what they have there, you open the door to the wrong direction being taken. I think the word `preserve' or the phrase `preservation of the natural values' needs to be built into this. I think it is a mistake to allow that to slip out and to allow concentration on what to do with the built values in these lands to become pre-eminent. Pre-eminent in the minds of Sydneysiders and everybody who knows Sydney is going to be the preservation of the natural values which make these lands so important.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2001-02-07,"—If I respond every time we will be here until Christmas, but I draw to the attention of Senator Brown the second object, which is to protect, conserve and interpret the environmental values. I agree with what he says in relation to protection and preservation of the natural values, but these lands are more complex. They have a rich and colourful military, commercial and industrial history. I gave the example of Cockatoo Island because, as I understand it, that was one that the trust focused upon when they, in turn, debated the wording we were suggesting in this legislation. Cockatoo Island was a major industrial site. It has had a rich industrial history. It is in a bad state of decay at the moment. There is major pollution. A lot of work needs to be done. There is a huge debate going on as to how that work should be carried and what can be achieved from that work. In the circumstance of Cockatoo Island, it seemed to the trust—and I accept their argument—that the word `enhance' was a more appropriate word to use than the word `preserve'. It is the fact that we are looking at lands here that are not simply being conserved for natural values that adds this element of complexity.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-02-07,"—I think Senator Brown does have a point and Senator Hill, in referring to the diversity of the land complexity, may be onto something as well. I would suggest to the minister that maybe one way we can pick this up is to change the proposed clause 6(a) to read `contributes to preserving and enhancing the amenity of the Sydney Harbour region'. Conserving and enhancing are two different functions, and including both objects into 6(a) would meet the trust's and the government's need to recognise moving forward with the land. At the same time, keeping the word `preserving' does retain some recognition of the need to move forward but to move forward in preserving the amenity of the land we are talking about. I would ask the minister to consider that while I flag at this stage that, once these amendments are dealt with, I will be moving opposition amendments (4) to (7), which basically go to the same issue. I flag now that we are seeking a commitment to restore, protect, conserve and interpret the environmental heritage values to ensure ongoing public ownership of trust land; to ensure ongoing public ownership of trust land; to establish and manage trust land on behalf of the Commonwealth as a transitional arrangement before transfer to New South Wales; and to cooperate with New South Wales, affected councils and the community in furthering the objects of the act as they are finally defined by the Senate. I think those four amendments are important additions to what the government is trying to do. I also ask the minister during the course of the debate on this particular clause to see whether he can pick up those amendments and to try to explain why he will not if he does not.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2001-02-07,"—I do not think it is necessary. As I have pointed out, the objects do include a requirement to protect, conserve and interpret the environmental values of the land. So what Senator Bolkus is seeking to have incorporated within another subclause is adequately covered already in the objects that are before the chamber.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-02-07,"—by leave—I move opposition amendments (4) to (7):
(4)	Amendment (4), clause 6, omit paragraph (b), substitute:
	(b)	to restore, protect, conserve and interpret the environmental and heritage values of Trust land;
(5)	Amendment (4), clause 6, after paragraph (b), insert:

I have just spoken to these amendments, so I do not need to speak again other than to ask the minister if he is in a position to accept them and, if he is going to be difficult about it, to explain to the Senate why. ",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-02-07,"—I reinforce the question that Senator Bolkus has asked. There are four different amendments that have been moved together and possibly a couple of them are redundant. For example, inserting `to ensure ongoing public ownership of Trust land' is fairly redundant. We have ensured that by putting those lands into schedule 1. In that sense I suppose it does not hurt to have things in there that are redundant. But, in particular, I think amendment No. 7, which modifies clause 6(f) slightly by having an object of cooperating not just with New South Wales—I presume the New South Wales government will have a say in it—and affected councils but also with the community. I think plenty of other components are now in the bill, because it has been significantly amended, that require a lot of community input anyway. It would seem unnecessarily churlish not to accept an object of cooperating with the community in furthering objects. I would be interested in any explanation the minister has as to why that would be a problem either for the government or for the trust. I know that the interim trust, which has already been operating for a while, has examined in detail the initial amendments that were passed through the House towards the end of last year. They may have some views on those but I have not heard them expressed when I have spoken with them in the intervening period. I think that amendment No. 7, in particular, which includes the role of the community, is crucial to the long-term success of the trust. I would be interested to hear any reason why that could not be part of the objects in 6(f).",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2001-02-07,"—Leaving aside amendment No. 7 for the moment, which is the only one that seems to add new elements, firstly, I do not think that the first few changes are necessary because they are already covered in the bill. Secondly, in the form in which they have been written there is some element of inconsistency of structure in that, out of the long process of negotiation that has taken place in preparation of the original bill and then subsequent to the passage of that bill in this place very heavily amended, the issue of public ownership has been dealt with through splitting the land into two schedules. Thus, to now include a new object to ensure ongoing public ownership of the trust land expressed in such terms is somewhat confusing. So either because of the confusion or because it simply duplicates what is already there in substance in the bill—more than simply objects—I do not think those changes are necessary.
In relation to amendment No. 7, which is the object to cooperate with New South Wales, affected councils and the community in furthering the above objectives, obviously we want the trust to cooperate with all stakeholders. The state government is a clear stakeholder and, similarly, the councils are and the community, as such, is. Again, we have structured the bill in that sense. That is why the community gets a real and meaningful role in relation to advising on each of the plans as they are developed and so forth. I do not know of any other piece of legislation that has gone through this place that actually, in effect, sets out in a detailed form community roles in the way that we have in this particular bill. We have accepted the wish of councils, for example, that an elected office-bearer, an elected councillor, be included as a member of the trust.
I have no problem with the spirit of this amendment. On the other hand, I have some concern about actually including it in the legislation. My fear is simply how it might be interpreted. I give you the example of New South Wales. We have bent over backwards to cooperate with New South Wales in relation to the process so far—the process of identifying the values, the planning process and discussions for the future—and in return we have received no cooperation at all. In such a circumstance it would seem odd to me that we would then want to write into legislation an obligation on the trust, at least through an objects clause, that the trust should then cooperate with the New South Wales government. I think it could lead to confusion in relation to New South Wales planning laws. Does cooperating with New South Wales in any way provide an obligation in relation to their planning laws, which we are certainly not prepared to accept?
Fortunately, the councils—certainly the councils that have written to me—now want this legislation passed, for the reasons that Senator Bartlett said, I suspect; that is, they are suspicious that future governments might do otherwise with this land. They might dispose of it for other purposes than the purpose of this trust. They see a unique security in this legislation in relation to this land so they want it passed. They are witnessing a spirit of cooperation with the trust, and therefore it seems to me that it does not add value and it potentially might lead to future disputes as to what it means in terms of an application in practice. In those circumstances, I would oppose the inclusion of it as an objects clause.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-02-07,"—I think you have got a point. Maybe the minister can help the Senate on this. He has just spoken about the problems in having an imperative in the legislation for the Commonwealth to cooperate with New South Wales, and he raised a number of issues of concern to him. He has indicated that, as a consequence, he is not prepared to accept opposition amendment No. 7. My understanding is that opposition amendment No. 7 merely adds an obligation to cooperate with the community, and your legislation already imposes an obligation on the trust to cooperate with New South Wales. Are you trying to tell us that you are also going to amend objects clause 6(f) to delete any obligation on the trust to cooperate with New South Wales, or don't you understand your legislation?",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2001-02-07,"—No, I am not going to do that. I will accept what is already there. In relation to New South Wales, I remind the Senate that from day one we invited New South Wales to come in as a partner in this process, to appoint nominees to the interim trust, to join us in a meaningful way to work for the conservation and preservation of these wonderful natural and cultural assets—and the response to date has been disinterest.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech

But I ask you: with respect to Senator Bartlett's inquiry as to why you would not be able to accept amendment No. 7, doesn't amendment No. 7 merely add an obligation to cooperate with the community? With respect to your rhetoric about New South Wales standards being meaningless, given that your clause already imposes an obligation to cooperate with New South Wales, why can't you accept opposition amendment No. 7 when it does not add an obligation to cooperate with New South Wales; it only adds an obligation to cooperate with the community? Why not?",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-02-07,"—Senator Bolkus is quite right. The committee can see that the government's own words are that the objects of the trust are, amongst other things, to cooperate with New South Wales—that is the government's clause, the minister's clause—and affected councils in furthering the preservation and protection of the Sydney Harbour region. The ALP amendment extends that to say that the trust should cooperate with New South Wales and the affected councils, as the government's amendment would have it, and the community in furthering those objects. So Senator Bolkus is right. I think the minister may have argued against his own government's position in saying that New South Wales should not be included there.
I would also like to get some understanding of the Democrats point of view. I ask whether or not the Democrats are in favour of the sale of parts of these lands in the future—a sale which would be excluded by these ALP amendments—and whether or not, Markham Close in Mosman, which is the housing component that Senator Bartlett has been talking about, is the end of it. Would the bill, as designed by the government and the Democrats, exclude any further potential sale down the line of any other properties besides these Mosman properties which Labor and the Greens are opposed to putting on the market? If not, I would like to know where the process ends.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-02-07,"—To respond briefly to Senator Brown's comment, I have stated a number of times that the Democrats are keen to ensure that the Sydney Harbour foreshore lands remain in public ownership, and that is why we do not want to see this opportunity lost by effectively killing the bill. That would leave all those lands open to being sold off. We are strongly in favour of the foreshore lands remaining in public ownership. 
In terms of any other Commonwealth Defence lands that are not included in this bill, as I stated before—and I have seen no amendments from anybody, including Senator Brown, proposing to add other Commonwealth Defence lands that have not been detailed in the amendments and legislation—that is obviously Commonwealth land and currently they can do with it what they want. If they want to sell it, they will just sell it. They will not bother putting it into the management of the trust. Obviously, because it is not land that is dealt with in this legislation, there is nothing any of us can do whether we support the bill or not. There is nothing we can do to ensure the ongoing public ownership of lands that we are not dealing with. Obviously, if we are not dealing with those lands we cannot guarantee what will happen with them. The reason why the Democrats are keen not to see this legislation fail is that it will ensure the permanent public ownership of the very significant parts of Defence lands that are listed in schedule 1.
I would like to return to the issue of opposition amendment No. 7. I think that it is in some ways a symbolic one, but I think it is an important one. The minister, in outlining his problems with it, talked about the attitude of the New South Wales government. I do not necessarily disagree with the description he gave but, despite problems that may or may not have occurred with the lack of cooperation between the New South Wales and federal governments about the future of these lands, there is still, as the government's own wording says, a requirement to cooperate with New South Wales. Perhaps the minister might wish there was a requirement for New South Wales to cooperate with the Commonwealth, but obviously we cannot impose that on them. I think it is important, even if it is symbolic, because it sends an important signal for the community to be in there, as in this amendment, partly because of the history of these lands over many years and also because of the history of this bill and the trust. 
Given past records of governments of all political persuasions at state and federal level, there is—not unreasonably—a degree of apprehension about what may happen. I think it is due only to the work of community groups that mistakes at council or government level have been avoided. There is still apprehension out there, and that is why some in the community groups want the Senate to insist on further amendments. They want to lock in the trust in every way possible because of that apprehension—a lack of trust in the trust, if you like. I think it is very important that there be a clear requirement on the trust to cooperate. Thanks to all the amendments that have been put through—Democrat and Labor amendments from last year, the majority of which have been accepted—there is a requirement for a lot of public participation. That might create some legal difficulty for the trust in having an objective of cooperating with the community, but I certainly did not pick that up from any of the minister's explanations. I think it would send an important signal to the community groups that they are equal partners in the future of these lands. Unless the minister categorically assures the Senate that the government will walk away from the entire legislation and let it sink to the bottom of the harbour rather than to proceed with it if the word `community' is added, the Democrats would be keen to support amendments. We would not want to jeopardise the protection of all of the lands that will be protected under this legislation as amended if the government were to insist on walking away from the whole thing as a result of the addition of the word `community'. In the absence of such an insistence from the government, we do believe that amendment No. 7 is an important one, even if it is, in a sense, symbolic.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-02-07,"—I want to pursue a little further the pivotal matter of the potential sale of components of the proposed Sydney Harbour National Park lands. Schedule 2 shows that Markham Close in Mosman is not just available but earmarked for that under the government's arrangement with the Democrats. I ask both Senator Bartlett and the minister to look at the House of Representatives amendment to Part 4—Trust Land, page 10, clause 24 `Transfer of Trust land'. It says:
(1) The Trust must not sell or otherwise transfer the freehold interest of:
(a)	any land mentioned in Schedule 1—
the ones that Senator Bartlett assures us are protected—
or
(b)	land identified in a plan as having significant environmental and heritage values;
other than to the Commonwealth, New South Wales or an affected council.
Does this mean that the trust could transfer the freehold of land in schedule 1 to a council? If so, is there to be discovered in this legislation a means whereby the council would be prevented from on-selling that land to private owners?",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-02-07,"—Before I seek leave to disengage the clauses, I ask Senator Bartlett, with respect to proposed opposition amendment No. 6—which basically embodies an obligation on the Commonwealth to set up a transitional arrangement before the transfer of the land to New South Wales—why he would not support that amendment. Does he not support the Prime Minister's commitment—the long-held policy of his party and the Labor Party—that what we are involved in is a transitional trust arrangement and that what we want at the end of it is a transfer to New South Wales? Does he still stick to that commitment? If so, would he support amendment No. 6?",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-02-07,"—I will respond to that and to the minister's statement by way of being cooperative—although it does not sound terribly cooperative to refuse the very straightforward amendment No. 7. I must say that I find it fairly extraordinary that the government is willing to walk away from this entire package of legislation simply on that ground. I think that shows the bind that the Senate is in.
—Did he say that?
—That is what he said—that he would trash the whole bill rather than support amendment No. 7.
—I understood that he said that he would not.
—Did he? I beg your pardon. I must not have been listening. In that case, that is very cooperative. Thank you; I am glad to hear it. I take it all back. In relation to the other part of Senator Bolkus's question, and the previous statements as well, clearly we do have a situation whereby, if the legislation fails, there is no guarantee that any of the land will remain in public ownership. The passage of the bill will ensure that all of those schedule 1 lands remain in public ownership. To respond to Senator Brown's question, there is a condition that, if land is transferred to a state government or a local council, it cannot be on-transferred to private ownership. It can only be on-transferred back to the federal government—I do not imagine anyone would want to do that, but they may—or between state governments and councils. So that protection is there.
In relation to all the focus around the housing in Markham Close, it is worth emphasising that that can be sold only when the approved plan, which is to be developed over a long period of time with significant input from community and all stakeholders, has identified sale as the preferred option and that there are no significant environmental heritage values. I think to suggest that it is earmarked now for sale is wrong—certainly from people in the trust that I have spoken to; I do not know whom in the trust that Senator Brown or others have spoken to. But there is certainly a belief at this stage, before exploring all the options in detail—as has been indicated before there has not been a costing done yet—that it may well be that leasing out these houses would provide a better ongoing income stream for the trust than sales. So I think it is wrong to suggest that they are earmarked for sale and the `for sale' signs will go up tomorrow, as soon as the bill goes through.
It certainly appears to me and to others that I have spoken to that the most likely long-term option would be some form of lease arrangement, but either way I am not sure what the vision is that other senators have for Markham Close as part of the grand Sydney Harbour National Park ideal that is spoken about. I do not see how that fairly nondescript—although obviously all housing is important—suburban housing is crucial to the future of the Sydney Harbour National Park in terms of it remaining in its existing form. I do not see why the ongoing long-term preservation of these important lands should be jeopardised through a fixation on those houses. There are a lot of other safeguards in place that relate to the future of those lands. I am sure the local council—and I note the presence in the gallery of the Mayor of Mosman Council, the relevant council, Councillor Harvey—would fight and oppose very strongly and prevent any inappropriate development of those lands, whether or not they are sold or remain in Commonwealth ownership. There is the requirement of the development of a plan first.
So I do not think we should fixate specifically on some housing there, unless other senators are suggesting that they should be an integral part of a public housing strategy of New South Wales or something, which I have not heard suggested. Indeed, I have not heard anything suggested about what the future purpose or use of these suburban houses should be. And there is no reason why the Senate should determine that; that is the role of the development of the plan. That is why the processes have been put in place as they have through this legislation, as amendedto ensure comprehensive input from all stakeholders in the development of plans for all the various lands before decisions are made on the best uses for all of these lands, including suburban housing, and including the suburban housing that exists in Markham Close. So to somehow try to focus on the future of those suburban houses and turn that into a suggestion that that jeopardises the future public ownership of all of these lands is a distortion. There are mechanisms in the bill which prevent the future transfer of all the other important foreshore lands, and that is why the Democrats will do what we can to ensure that that protection is provided.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-02-07,"—I point out to Senator Bartlett that we do accept the good faith of people who are involved in the future management of these important lands on behalf of the people of Sydney, but that is not something that you can write into law. Councils change, governments change, people change, and it is very important that the law is written to give consistent assurance against a changing mood by those who can interpret the law to the disadvantage of the public. So we are not here doubting the bona fides of anybody who is currently looking at this issue, but we have to take into account changes in the future. That is why I ask Senator Bartlett just where there is written into this law the prevention of any future sale of lands, other than those in schedule  2, under the mechanism I pointed out. He said it is here in the act, so I ask him to point out specifically where that is.
I also just want to come back to the valuation of the Mosman lands. The minister has told the committee that there has not been a valuation. I point out that in the Sydney Morning Herald under the by-line of Deborah Cameron on 1 September 1999, it was stated, `It is understood that an official valuation has been carried out for the defence department, but this has not been made public.' I ask the minister: is that report wrong?",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2001-02-07,"—I do not know. I understand the trust has not sought a valuation. Senator Brown is now asking if the defence department previously valued the land. I do not know the answer to that, but we will make some inquiries. If they had, I do not know how long ago. The Labor Party wanted to sell this land off, and the defence department at that time, which was the proponent, may well have valued it as part of that process. If Senator Brown thinks that that matter is of issue, I will make inquiries. It might take some time to find the answer, but I will let him know.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-02-07,"—The opposition opposes the government's proposal. It is curious to note that when we suggested a trust of seven just a few months ago the minister was very loud in his opposition to it, claiming that it was going to be too unwieldy and too big. I am sure the public can find all that rhetoric in the Senate Hansard of the time. It was basically going to mean that the whole system was going to be unworkable. Now the government is proposing a committee of seven. Senator Hill, you have come a little way over the Christmas break but unfortunately I do not think that you have come far enough. What is important, we believe, in terms of the membership of the trust is that there be some equality of representation between New South Wales and the government in terms of the actual committee members. We recognise that the chair could be and is a separate person to that, so we, in the amendments that we will be moving after these amendments, would like to restore the position that is in the bill that went to the House of Representatives, that is, to have a seven member trust, with the chair to be appointed by the Commonwealth; for New South Wales and Commonwealth to appoint three each; and to ensure, for instance, that there is a real and defensible process for selecting the indigenous representative.  
We are proposing that the New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council nominate a representative. The government, in their tired and old paternalistic way, want to do it themselves. We are also keen to ensure that there is a transparent process to elect a community representative and we also in our formula propose that a local government representative also be included—as do the Commonwealth, but we differ from them in terms of where the position is drawn from. Basically we are talking about here a real conflict between both sides as to the balance of composition and the selection process. We do not support the government's amendments Nos 2 to 5 as proposed by the minister and I indicate that I will be moving amendment No. 8 once these issues are determined.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-02-07,"—My understanding is that the amendment that Senator Bolkus has foreshadowed is in conflict with the minister's ones so, if they were to go through, he would be moving an amendment in conflict with what would have been agreed. Clearly, the government's amendment is an advance on what was there previously and, if they have taken partly on board the concerns that the Democrats, the ALP and others expressed about the composition of the trust, that is to be noted and welcomed. But I think it would be worth hearing from the minister, I guess in a foreshadowed sense, as to what his problems are with the foreshadowed amendment No. 8 of the ALP. Obviously, it contains one other member but, particularly in terms of the aspect of the invitation to the New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council to recommend a person, what is the government's opposition to the proposal? As part of that, I think it would be important to get an indication from the minister as to whether the government's opposition is sufficiently entrenched and strong that it would mean that the bill as a whole would not be proceeded with if the opposition amendment were to pass.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-02-07,"—Let me say to Senator Bartlett that if he supports this amendment he will find that the government is not going to collapse over that. But if he puts it to the government by way of saying, `Will you?' then the government is going to say yes. It is a very weak negotiating position. Here is an opportunity for this matter of indigenous representation to be one for the Aboriginal people as against the government's position of having a minister appoint someone who in his or her opinion represents the indigenous point of view—paternalistic, as Senator Bolkus put it.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2001-02-07,"—Dealing with the government's amendments and the Labor Party's alternative, as even Senator Bolkus conceded, we have expanded the composition of the board, specifically including an elected council representative and also an indigenous representative. We do not see any argument, particularly in the circumstances of what I said was disinterest of the New South Wales government; I could almost have said obstruction of the New South Wales government, but, anyway, their unhelpful attitude to this whole wonderful opportunity, particularly as they are not putting in any money, they are not putting in any land and, in all likelihood, in the end they are going to end up with all of the assets. In those circumstances, their attitude has been really very disappointing. For Senator Bolkus to now come in and suggest that they should get an extra representative is quite odd.
In relation to the indigenous person, it is the view of the government that the indigenous person, as in the case of the elected council member, should be an appointment and choice of the government. Certainly the government should consult widely in making that choice. Obviously, a relevant party to consult would be the body the New South Wales Land Council has referred to in the Labor Party's amendment, but there may well be other indigenous representative bodies that should be consulted as well. That would seem to me to be sensible, and certainly whilst I am minister I would also seek the advice of ATSIC.
—You always seek it but you never take it.
—That is not correct. I quite often take it, actually.
—Look at the heritage legislation!
—With the heritage legislation, as you remember, ATSIC actually recommended that we include an indigenous advisory body, and we accepted that advice. We amended our bill in accordance with that advice, Senator Bolkus. There is an aspect that the minister has to attempt to put together a trust of people who he thinks can work together constructively; and the more that you seek to remove that responsibility by actually identifying third parties to make the appointment, the less likely that that is to occur. So the government would be opposed to the amendment suggested by the Labor Party. But certainly I am prepared to give an undertaking that, in the selection of this person, we would seek the advice of the New South Wales Land Council as well as the advice of other indigenous organisations.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2001-02-07,"—We have never made a commitment that all of the land would be held by the New South Wales government. In fact, I can recall mentioning, in the previous debate, that there has been an argument that some of the land—one piece, Woolwich, was being referred to from time to time—might be more appropriately held in local government ownership. That decision obviously has not been made; the plan is still not even out for public consultation. We wanted to leave open which level of government might be the most appropriate, until the proper consideration has been given to that particular issue.
The important thing is that it will be held in public ownership. Let us take the hypothetical that New South Wales refuses to accept transfer. For example, taking into account the attitude of the New South Wales government so far, it would not amaze me if they indicated that they would only accept transfer of this land if it came with a very substantial financial package. In those circumstances, it might be that the Commonwealth would have to continue holding the land for the benefit of the public. It would remain in public ownership. That is the assurance that the Senate wanted on the last occasion and the assurance that it has now got in this bill.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-02-07,"—The opposition do not support amendments Nos 1 and 2 on sheet EB251, and we do have concerns with House amendment No. 8. It has been a very important objective, particularly of the community groups involved in this debate, to ensure a public process for the trust and to ensure public meetings. We have recognised in our amendments that that principle should be embodied in the legislation. We have also recognised that from time to time there may be a need to have a private meeting. But, as was passed by the Senate before Christmas and as we are moving now in our amendments, we believe that the interests of transparency are met by including the reasons for the private meeting in the minutes of the public meeting.
In the proposal adopted by the Senate before Christmas, the proposal that we are pursuing, we want to maximise the number of public meetings, put a real stop on the number of private meetings and have some transparency with respect to them. The government's proposal does completely the opposite. If you look at amendments Nos 1 and 2 on sheet EB251, you basically have the government saying that at least one meeting every six months will be open to the public. But, as for the rest of the meetings, there is no such obligation at all. It throws the balance around the other way. The government's proposal will basically give the yellow light to a trust running in private as opposed to a trust running in public. For that basic reason, we do not support amendments Nos 1 and 2 on sheet EB251, as proposed by the government.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2001-02-07,"—As I said a while ago, this bill really does set out quite a comprehensive role for community participation—much more so than is generally the case. I think that is a good thing. This is an exciting venture, but it is complex, and the community can bring to bear a great deal of knowledge of these sites. They demonstrate that from their long involvement in and commitment to these issues. On the other hand, you have to permit the trust to do its job and do it in an environment in which it is not unduly inhibited by the responsibility of others or the participation of others. This trust is not like a local council, where you have people who have put themselves up for election in circumstances that they know. All the meetings are public, and they accept that as part of the process. These are individuals who have been selected, because of particular expertise, to carry out an important role for the public through government. Their role and their capacity are set out in great detail in this legislation. The role of the community in relation to the development of the plans is set out.
It seems to me that to be fair to all parties, the broader community and the trust, it is desirable to find a form of balance in relation to public participation during the actual meetings of the trust. The balance that I believe is reasonable, and therefore have included in the amendments before the Senate today, is that the trust is obliged to meet at least four times a year, that at least two of those meetings must be public and that there must be at least one in the first six months of the year and at least one in the second six months of the year. So, on at least two six-monthly occasions, the meetings will be open to the direct scrutiny of the public. As I said, I think that is a fair compromise, and I commend it to the Senate on that basis.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-02-07,"—As anybody listening would know, that simply means the scheduling of the meeting can be such that those matters the trust wants to deal with out of the public domain are put on the scheduling of the private meetings. I ask the minister: why has the government changed its mind about having the trust meetings open to the public, unless it can be established that it is in the public interest to meet in private? Why is it now the situation that the trust can effectively discuss in private anything it wants to on this most public of all matters? Could the minister give an example of a matter which the trust will need to discuss in private and which the public ought not to have access to?",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2001-02-07,"—Senator Brown might not understand this, but I do appreciate the argument that these are not elected officials. They are people who have been requested, because of their particular expertise, whether it is planning or whatever, to perform a service for us and they may feel somewhat intimidated by a public presence at all of their meetings. That argument has been put to me, that case has been put to me, and I think it is reasonable, particularly bearing in mind the degree of participation by the community that is guaranteed by other provisions of this legislation.
I have not gone the whole way, however. For public confidence, for the public to have direct access to at least one meeting every six months might be useful as well. In relation to the question of why not rely on the formal provision—that is, that it be in public unless they determine it is a matter that should not be in public—that not only places a particular onus on the trust members but also, no doubt, raises suspicions. We are trying to build confidence with the community in relation to dealing with the assets, not undermine that confidence. I would prefer it to be structured, therefore, so that the trust does not have to make that decision to take the meeting out of public into private.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-02-07,"—The government is going totally the wrong way about building confidence in the performance of the trust, and I think it is doing the trust a great disservice. It had a formula before which said that if it were in the public interest to have a private meeting—and that can be established—then the matter could be private. We are not talking about a private enterprise here; we are talking about very important public lands which are going to be managed in the public interest. The argument that these are not elected representatives simply does not hold water. These are representatives appointed by the minister, who is elected.
These meetings ought to be open to the public gaze. That is what is going to build confidence. The appointees of the minister ought to have that confidence in the public or I do not believe they ought to be on the trust. This is a simple matter of democracy and transparency. There will be far greater confidence in the trust and it will be good for the trust if it abides by that ultimate vote of confidence in the public and if it takes them into account in all it does. Otherwise, you do raise suspicions. Otherwise, you do get report and innuendo. Otherwise, you do break down the public's trust. The minister should think about this again. The Democrats ought to be opposing this move by the government to put a veil of secrecy over the performance of the trust through closing out the public from being able to witness its meetings.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-02-07,"—In discussing these amendments, it is important to look at the context of the debate, which relates to meetings of the trust. It is worth noting that, as a consequence of Democrats amendments, the requirement is currently there for meetings to be public. As Senator Bolkus said, a loophole was put in where meetings could be in private if the trust determined it was in the public interest. I am not sure if this is the rationale of the government, but one of the aspects of the new government amendment that has been circulated today is that it closes that loophole to a certain extent. Under the amendments as they stand, a trust could determine it was in the public interest to hold every single meeting in private. I am not suggesting it would do that, but that is open to it. Given that we have debated in this place many times before exactly what the term `in the public interest' means, a mechanism and a loophole is open to the trust to hold every single meeting in private by saying that it is in the public interest. That is not an approach the Democrats would support and that is not something I suggest that the trust would say.
In relation to comments about what would best assist the operations of the trust, my understanding is that these additional amendments have come as a consequence of the views of people on the trust. I have had a number of conversations with people involved in the existing interim trust. I do not know how many meeting others in the committee have had with them. It is important that their views be taken into account as well. The government's new amendment is attractive to the Democrats but not because of the government's intent in putting forward that amendment. Nonetheless, the effect will be that it absolutely guarantees that at least two, and potentially more than two, of those meetings will be held in public each year.
There will be no opportunity for the veil of secrecy that has been described to be drawn down absolutely exclusively. The potential for that is in the amendments as they exist at the moment. That is an important point that needs to be made. The new amendment partially closes the loophole that was specifically left there by Labor and the Democrats in recognition that there may be times when meetings that are open to the public are not appropriate for a body such as this. This new amendment just circulated by the government will ensure that at least half of the required meetings are open to the public. It leaves no loophole for the trust to keep those private even if it should wish to do so. That is a benefit of what the government is proposing here, if not the government's actual intent.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-02-07,"—I will put to Senator Bartlett the same question I put to Senator Hill, through you, Temporary Chairman—that is, what are the matters that should not be discussed at a public meeting? I am astounded by what Senator Bartlett just said, which is that he is happy that half of the meetings will be open and half of them will be closed and that that gives the public some guarantee of openness. It does nothing of the sort. It simply means that, if there is a contentious matter that comes up down the line, that contentious matter, which will be of heightened public interest, will be dealt with by the trust behind closed doors; that is guaranteed under these amendments. I cannot see any reason why this trust would ever meet in private. We are talking about public lands here and we are talking about the public interest totally. The excuse that Senator Bartlett puts forward—that this will guarantee that some meetings will be open—is totally lame. As Senator Bartlett is back in the chamber, I ask him to give the chamber the Democrats' considered opinion on which matters should be dealt with by the trust in private and out of the public view.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-02-07,"—I have already answered that question.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-02-07,"—It is not a matter for the trust. We are making the law here in the Senate. When you support an amendment, you are obliged to know why you are doing it, particularly when you are supporting an amendment which is against the public interest—that is, to enable a trust dealing with public lands on Sydney Harbour to meet in private. Senator Bartlett has not been able to do that, and that goes against long held principles of the Democrats that there should be transparency. It is up to us to legislate for that transparency to be there and not to support a government amendment to close down that transparency. The failure of Senator Bartlett to be able to give even a lead to the sorts of matters that might be discussed in private undermines the position that he has on this.
We are all aware that we are dealing with a very valuable property and that this trust is going to have a very great obligation on behalf of the people of Sydney and Australia. I think it is unfair to the trust that a potential for the public to feel that it is being shut out from deliberations about an asset that it owns can be written into this legislation. It is bad legislation. This is a particularly undemocratic clause that the government is now inserting here, and I am very, very surprised that the Democrats are supporting it.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-02-07,"—I know I said earlier that, if I wished to correct every misrepresentation, I would draw the debate out, but I really cannot allow not only the distortion of what I have said but the complete misrepresentation of Democrat principles. In the amendments that were passed last year, there is scope for meetings to be held in private. When that amendment was passed last time, I do not recall Senator Brown voting against it or requiring some strange concept that the Senate should outline what sorts of matters might be required to be held in private, and I do not see what has changed since then.
The reason there is scope for public attendance at meetings is as a consequence of the Democrats. It is the Democrats' principles that have been reflected in amendments that have been passed. There are provisions in the bill that have enabled and required public attendance at meetings of the trust. Senator Brown suggested that it is unfair for the trust, but I would again ask him how many conversations he has had with people involved in the trust to get their views on this issue. In suggesting that every committee that deals with every single piece of publicly owned property or that every meeting of every government department that deals with public housing should always be open to the public, I think he is trying to extend a principle beyond the remnants of practicality and is again putting politics before the public interest.
The requirement for publicly open meetings provisions are ones that are in place not solely because of the Democrats, I should say, but because of the views expressed by many people, including some people I have spoken to who are involved with the trust, and so I think it is strange to suggest that it is somehow unfair for the trust, when the provisions that have already been put in place are ones that the trust were supportive of—or, at least, some members of the trust were: I would not want to be seen to be reflecting an official position of the trust as a whole; but it certainly reflects the comments made to me. Maybe Senator Brown, in his extensive consultations with members of the trust, and others may have had different feedback, in which case I would be interested to hear it.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-02-07,"—This is my last contribution, because Senator Bartlett has nowhere to go on this. I will certainly support any move to tighten up the previous provision, which would have allowed the trust to meet if it could show that it was in the public interest to meet in private—because I do not believe there are any circumstances in which that would be the case. Senator Hill has failed to give the committee an example of that, and Senator Bartlett has failed to give the committee an example of that. So I think it is totally against the public interest that we now have, prescribed by this legislation, closed meetings by the trust. The Democrats ought to be against that. As we have heard, and as everybody who has taken an interest in this has heard, Senator Bartlett and Senator Hill, combined, have not been able to put before the committee one item or issue so far as the lands we are dealing with are concerned which ought to be debated out of the public domain. But so be it. As you will have heard, Mr Temporary Chairman, I object very strenuously to this, and that is on the public record. The Democrats have made this arrangement with the government, they have the numbers, and the legislation is going to be read in that way.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech

	(2)	A decision to meet in private must be recorded in the minutes together with the reasons for so deciding.
Amendment No. 14 is one which goes to the issue that we have been discussing, and is an amendment which provides that, in those circumstances where there is a private meeting, it must be recorded in the minutes of the meeting that a decision was taken and the reasons for so deciding. It is a pretty clear amendment. It is one that Senator Bartlett has indicated that he is attracted to. I hope he is attracted sufficiently to support it. It is, in a sense, the second-best option: we would like to have seen the balance the other way, in terms of the transparency of the process and the imperative that more meetings be held in public; but we have just been rolled on that and so this is second-best. But it is important that, where a decision is taken to hold a meeting in private, the reasons for so deciding are recorded.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-02-07,"—To elaborate slightly further, as I said before in my comments, the running sheet states that this is in conflict with the clause we have just removed. I am not sure why, unless it is just a matter of terminology in terms of `private meeting' versus `meeting not open to the public'—in which case, that amendment could be made to Senator Bolkus's amendment. I note the comments have been made previously in the debate that it may be helpful to the effective operation of the trust for some meetings not to be open to the public. I do not see why it would be problematic for the reasons for that decision to be recorded in the minutes of the meetings of the trust.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-02-07,"—by leave—I move opposition amendments Nos 16 to 19 on sheet 2109:
 (16)	Amendment (13), subclause 63 (2), omit paragraph (a) and ""or"".
 (17)	Amendment (13), paragraph 64(1)(b), omit ""for a period that ends after the end of 10 years from the commencement of this Act"".

 (19)	Amendment (13), subclause 64A(1), omit ""for a period of longer than 25 years"", substitute ""for a period that ends after the end of 10 years from the commencement of this Act"".
Amendments Nos 16 to 19 basically pursue the line that the opposition and the community would like to have pursued, which is consistent with our opposition to the sale of these lands into private hands. These amendments also deal with the question of granting security over the subject lands. The trust should not be able to give security over the trust lands. It should not be able to enter lease arrangements beyond the life of the trust without the approval of parliament. We recognise that there will be circumstances in which long-term leases may be required to make investments in some sites financially viable. We oppose—and this amendment embodies that opposition—leases going beyond the life of the trust without such leases being disallowable instruments in the parliament.
This is basically a mechanism to ensure scrutiny over the trust in instances where the trust may decide to enter into a lease arrangement. We do not want a capacity in this legislation for anybody to be able to do through a back door what we do not want them to do through a front door—that is, to give long-term leases that may be seen to be, in essence, a transfer of property; say, a 99-year lease or something like that. This is a set of amendments which allow ongoing parliamentary scrutiny, to ensure that we do not finish up with bodgie lease arrangements that defeat the purpose of public ownership.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2001-02-07,"—As Senator Bolkus conceded, there may be circumstances in which a long-term lease is desirable in meeting the objects of the trust. Again, one might think particularly of Cockatoo Island and maybe of Woolwich. Where you have assets that are significantly degraded and going to need substantial capital infusion, it may be difficult to attract that sort of capital if the trust is able to offer only a short-term tenure. In those circumstances, we are putting before the chamber a compromise: if the lease is less than 10 years, the trust—or whatever expression we will use for it—can do that without a reference to any other party. It seems that they should not need to go beyond their own judgment—remembering, of course, that particular property would have been subject to this detailed planning process and, no doubt, this recommendation would have come out of that plan. 
There has been very considerable public consultation and participation in the development of that plan. Where it goes beyond 10 years, we believe that it should only be with the approval of the minister, and we have included that requirement. We have accepted—although we are not enthusiastic about it—that beyond 25 years it should be subject to disallowance of the parliament. We are not enthusiastic because it seems somewhat odd—having given a responsibility to these people and set out the objects which are the public purpose of the land—to then bring it back to this parliament. To bring their tenure decisions back to this parliament for further consideration seems somewhat odd to us.
However, we can see that some would say that a lease over 25 years can be argued as having some similar characteristics to a salealthough I would have thought that that argument would have been stronger in respect of a lease of something like 99 years. But, anyway, if it is argued that 25 years is so long that it might be interpreted in that way, that could be inconsistent with the original purpose of the legislation and, therefore, it should come back for a disallowance process. We have nevertheless accepted that argument, so I put to the Senate that compromise. The trust can deal with it as it believes correct, up to 10 years. Beyond a 10-year lease, the trust would need the minister's approval. Beyond 25 years it would be subject to disallowance by the federal parliament, and I think that is a reasonable compromise.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-02-07,"—Most of Senator Bolkus's amendments go to what is a crucial area of the legislation. Certainly amendments Nos 17 through to 19, which relate to leases, are the ones that I have specifically addressed. I think amendment No. 16 is a slightly different matter in terms of security over non-schedule 1 lands. I think we have done the schedule 1 and schedule 2 debate, but leases are important to the community and to the local councils. Without seeking to be a mouthpiece for anybody, I think it is fair to say that all of the affected local councils are now of the view that, if there is a chance of the legislation not proceeding, as has been put forward by the government, it is something that should be accepted so that things can move forward. That is not to say that they or the Democrats do not believe that there are still further improvements that could be made—and oversight of leases is an area that is important.
As senators will note, amendments Nos 4 and 5 have been circulated by the Democrats, which are in intent, as I read them, the same as Senator Bolkus's. They are certainly different in form. I am not quite sure why there are two different forms, because certainly the intent of the Democrats amendments is to ensure that leases over 10 years would be disallowable instruments, rather than over 25 years. I note the minister's comments that he is not enthusiastic about the ongoing parliamentary oversight of leases over 25 years but, nonetheless, he has agreed to it. I think that is an example of the beneficial conditions that the Democrats and Labor have managed to achieve with this bill already. I think there is a valid argument for winding that 25-year period back to 10 years, not because it is equated to some form of pseudo sale but more because of ongoing oversight of the operation of the trust in two areas.
Firstly, as the legislation now stands, as amended, the trust is basically meant to operate for only 10 years, and to bind future titleholders, whether they be state or local councils, to leases for potentially another 15 years is problematic. Possibly more important than that is one of the underlying concerns that remains about the potential future operations of the trust—that is, the financial pressures they will work within in trying to operate, improve and enhance the amenity, the lands and those things that we have all put into this legislation to improve public access. There is a lot of restoration and remedial work that needs to be done. Indeed, that is another reason why there is a risk in allowing this legislation to fall over: there is work on hold until certainty is established. Some of that is restorative work to prevent further degradation. Whether it is important buildings, or bushland or decontamination, it is all extremely expensive. Certainly I know that, to some extent, those important activities are being held up and ongoing degradation can continue to occur if this falls over.
There is ongoing financial pressure. The government has not outlined what long-term financial contributions it is going to make to the operations of the trust. I am not necessarily saying that it should, but it has not, and it obviously cannot bind the hands of a future government in relation to what level of public funds they may put in. When this plan was initially put forward by the Prime Minister, the suggestion was that all of the funds for the trust's work may come from use of the lands, whether that is renting out buildings or leasing out properties, and that quite rightly generated extreme concern in the community and among the local councils. It is quite clear that the trust itself cannot raise enough funds from commercial operations to self-fund. That is why, among other things, it is pleasing that the bill no longer has a requirement that a sustainable financial base be developed.
There is no doubt that there will still be financial pressures, and clearly long-term leases is one of those areas where opportunities may be seen for deriving funds. When financial pressures are strong, then, clearly, that risk is there, whether it be for the trust now or for future trusts. This is about maintaining the opportunity for ongoing oversight of the operations of the trust by the parliament. I can see that, in an operative sense, it is a bit clumsy to have that extra requirement of potential disallowance but I think that, given the risk not just of this government but of future governments for the next 10 years not adequately funding the operation of the trust and undue commercial pressures coming into play, there is a need for ongoing parliamentary oversight. It is an important safeguard against the future activities of the trust in what is a sensitive area. This area of their activities is likely to be among the most sensitive. Nobody is going to argue about restoring buildings or remediating degraded bushland, but people are going to be concerned about commercial leases on some of those lands and what those leases will contain.
There are safeguards in terms of the development of the management plan. In that sense, the minister possibly should be grateful that there is not a requirement that the plans be a disallowable instrument. Certainly there are other parliamentary precedents where plans that have been developed over many years—I am thinking particularly of fishery plans—are still liable to disallowance by the parliament. That is obviously an irritation for the departments and bodies that have to do that final check, but it is put in place deliberately by the parliament. Without going too far off the track, we have debated disallowances, within the last 12 months or so, of the Northern Prawn Fishery plan, which was developed over many years and with lots of heartache and angst. The disallowance was not successful but there was that potential because of parliamentary concern that, despite all the work, the plan was going in the wrong direction. 
We do not have that requirement in this legislation with management plans, although there are plenty of other opportunities for public input and comment through the development of those plans. But in the absence of that, whilst I note the government's reluctance, I think there is a strong argument for ongoing parliamentary oversight for leases for a shorter period than the government is suggesting. Given that the life of the trust is 10 years, I think that is an appropriate length of time. In speaking about the benefits of that, from the Democrats's point of view, we expect that there will be circumstances where leases of longer than 10 years and possibly longer than 25 years may be quite appropriate. It would be quite reasonable in some circumstances, for example, if someone were to set up a maritime museum at Woolwich—or something else that would improve public amenity on some of the other lands—for them to have some security over their investment, if that is the path that the trust chooses to go down. I am in no way foreshadowing that that is what they may do; that is just hypothetical. 
The Democrats do not have any intense ideological objection to long-term leases. We are likely to be very supportive of ones that are able to be demonstrated to be of long-term benefit in the use of the lands, but we do think it is appropriate for the parliament to be able to make that assessment on a case by case basis. I believe that this goes to the heart of the major ongoing public concern: that the lands will be inappropriately used and inappropriately commercialised. That is why the Democrats are keen to ensure that there is protection so that the lands cannot be sold off to private sources, as has been threatened in the past. Obviously even when lands are in government hands they still can be put to inappropriate uses—and have been in the past. For that reason, we believe that there is a lot of merit to having that disallowable component over leases longer than 10 years.
As I said before, I am not sure what the legal difference is between Senator Bolkus's amendments and the ones the Democrats have circulated. They go to the same intent and Senator Bolkus's seem a lot neater—in effect, just crossing out 25 and putting in 10. Either way, the thrust of the amendments is important and essential in the ongoing oversight of the operations of the trust.

	(5)	The Minister must ensure that all Trust land is transferred to New South Wales before the repeal time.
We had this discussion earlier. This is a debate that goes to the core of the government's commitment and to the way that this land is to be handled. It is interesting that, in an earlier debate with respect to land—under the broader debate of native title—it was the government's long and consistently stated position that land management was in the province of the states. That is an argument they used there. But, when it comes to this particular bundle of land, despite a commitment by the Prime Minister before the last election and despite explicit statements that land management is very much in the province of the states, not only is there no commitment to transfer the trust land at the termination of the trust but also—as we find in government House of Representatives amendment No. 15, which we will come to in due course—there is no commitment by the government to ensure that state environment and planning legislation will operate with respect to this land.
For a long time, and consistently, we heard the rhetoric from the government—from this minister, from Senator Minchin and from the Prime Minister—that land management is a responsibility of the states. When it comes to this particular land—despite what we believed to be a core commitment—this legislation falls very far short of meeting that commitment and of meeting the government's rhetoric on the dissection of powers—state and Commonwealth—in this Federation. I make those points now and indicate that opposition amendment No. 20 to House of Representatives amendment No. 14 will ensure that the land is transferred to New South Wales.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2001-02-07,"—I do not want to waste time, because I said it earlier, but I will repeat my comments as we are on this specific issue. We have accepted the obligation of public ownership but, without the proper planning taking place and all considerations being given as to which level of public ownership is most appropriate in all circumstances in relation to each property, we think it would be wrong to limit it in the way that Senator Bolkus wishes. I think there will be a fair chance that all the land will ultimately be found to be most appropriately held by New South Wales. I am not quite as confident that that will be the view of the New South Wales government. This is something that will evolve in the years ahead, but to seek to limit us in the way that Senator Bolkus is doing at this time would be most unwise.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-02-07,"—House amendment No. 15 triggers opposition amendment No. 21 on sheet 2109. Therefore, I move:
(21)	Amendment (15), clause 71, question to be divided in respect of clause 71 to enable the House of Representatives amendment in respect of clause 71 to be rejected and clause 71, as originally passed by the Senate, to stand.
We find it unacceptable that the government's legislation ensures that these sites will not be subject to state environmental protection and planning legislation. We believe that there might be a role for the Commonwealth to place additional requirements on the management of the land. Given the behaviour and nature of state governments, that is probably something that needs to be addressed. These conditions would need to be over and above the state regime and would need to ensure ongoing protection of the land that we are talking about.
We do believe that the state planning framework should be followed as a minimum requirement. Exemption from state legislation, curiously enough, is in direct conflict with attachment 3 of the 1997 Heads of Agreement on Commonwealth-State Roles and Responsibilities for the Environment. This legislation has no embodiment—no reflection—of state environmental and planning legislation. In taking this approach, the government is in direct conflict with the agreement on the environment that it signed up to with the states in 1997. We believe that management plans developed by the trust should be consistent with SEPP 56, state regional planning and Sydney Harbour National Park management practices to ensure a smooth transition in ownership. We find that that has not been picked up either.
This land will be subject to state law once it has been transferred to New South Wales. In the lead-up to that, we believe it is essential that future management development plans be consistent with state planning provisions. The government has probably done what it does best—that is, it has avoided making decisions. In avoiding the making of decisions, it has left an enormous gap in terms of the state's capacity to protect the land and to make it subject to environmental and planning regimes. It has also left an enormous gap by not meeting the requirements of SEPP 56. It is inadequate legislation. Opposition amendment No. 21 seeks to address one of the inadequacies.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2001-02-07,"—I was surprised to hear Senator Bolkus describe it as avoiding taking a decision because I thought his argument was that he objected to the decision that we have taken, which is that the trust should not be limited by state planning laws in the same way that the Commonwealth is not limited. This is Commonwealth land. The Commonwealth is not limited by state planning laws. The trust will hold this land for the Commonwealth while it carries out a planning process that is in the best interests of the people of Australia as a whole. To be held to ransom by the New South Wales government—particularly a New South Wales government that has been so unhelpful in relation to this project—would be foolish in the extreme. 
I think there are very few—apart from the ALP, for obvious reasons—advocating that the trust should be beholden to Mr Carr and his state government. Looking at the record of that Labor government in New South Wales in relation to important foreshore lands, one can understand why the public would be most concerned to give back to New South Wales a power to obstruct this trust in taking decisions that are in the best interests of all Australians. So the government very strongly opposes the Labor Party's attempt to limit the freedom of the trust in this way—in effect, to pass control during the interim period, the 10-year period, to the New South Wales government—and argues that, in the same way as the Commonwealth is not bound by state planning laws now, neither should the trust which is holding the land on behalf of the Commonwealth.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech

I cannot say what those responsibilities are because the planning process has not been completed; it is only in its early stages. The draft plans are being prepared at the moment. As I said yesterday, I expect they are going to be put on public display in March, which is an occasion that many people are looking forward to. They may or may not include recommended actions that would require, if it was land within the New South Wales jurisdiction, consents and approvals of New South Wales government authorities. We believe that that capacity to obstruct should not be entered into and we should not give the New South Wales government that capacity.

So the objective is that it cannot be transferred to another party—another party not being a government party.,SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-02-07,—Will that be done through covenanting or through state or federal enactment?

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2001-02-07,"—Some of us would like to think that when a government takes land on a specific condition it would abide by that condition. For those who are particularly suspicious, there are other mechanisms to further guarantee that. I do not know that they have been developed in relation to this particular instance. I am no expert on New South Wales property law, but Senator Bolkus would tell you that under South Australian property law you could do it by a caveat.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-02-07,"—I am very interested in that because I have seen cases in states where land that has been, for example, willed to the people by private benefactors in the past under law—under state acts—has simply reverted to public ownership through a consequent action. I am reasonable enough to know that you cannot bind future parliaments in what they do. The Greens are in favour of this land being kept together and transferred down the line in toto into the greater Sydney Harbour National Park. But, that not being the case, there is under this plan the potential for this land either to revert to Commonwealth ownership or to go to local government ownership. If that is going to happen, the stipulations for it remaining in the public domain need to be maximised.
I ask the minister: is it possible for lands which are on schedule 1—that is the majority of these lands; well, it is all of them except for those at Middle Head and Georges Heights—to end up on schedule 2? Is there a mechanism for transfer of lands on schedule 1 which are to remain in public ownership to be transferred across at some future time under the direction of the trust and with ministerial acquiescence, or, if not permission, promotion, to schedule 2, and therefore to become available for public sale?",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2001-02-07,"—As I understand it, there is not the capacity to do that. That is certainly not the object. If that was the desire, it would require legislative change. We are of course planning to include additional pieces of land, and we have made announcements, subsequent to the primary announcement by the Prime Minister, to include the Macquarie Lightstation and also Snapper Island. So decisions in the years ahead—and we have our eye on some other land in the vicinity as well—will have to be made at that time as to which schedule new pieces of land are put on, but, in relation to the land that this act applies to now, the trust cannot simply transfer it from one schedule to another.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-02-07,"—I am speaking probably as much to Senator Bolkus's foreshadowed amendments (22) and (23)—they are basically what the debate has been about. Firstly, just to clarify, I presume, in relation to amendment (23), it is the Markham Close houses that are being proposed to transfer to schedule 1. I think, again, we have traversed this a fair bit already in the debate, but it is important to emphasise that the Democrats' preferred option is for this area to remain in public ownership, but it is very much—a hundred times more—our preferred option that the legislative opportunity to lock in permanent public ownership of all the other lands not be missed because of the government's insistence on retaining a schedule 2 for Markham Close.
It is a bit perplexing to me to hear suggestions that these fairly unremarkable suburban houses should be a part of a national park, but I am sure there is a range of views as to the use these lands could be put to. In terms of the development of the plans by the trust in consultation with the community and all the other stakeholders over the period of time, I think the various options that can be explored there are many and varied. I would not have thought that putting the houses in a national park was top of the list, but you never can tell. We will see what the process unfolds.
In terms of the possibility of other lands being privatised through the back door because they are listed on schedule 2, as I have stated a number of times already, if the government have any lands that they already own that they want to sell—and that is all they are focused on—then they are hardly going to bother transferring it to the trust if they are simply wanting to sell it. So the existence of a schedule 2 is fairly irrelevant in terms of the risk of inappropriate sales of other Commonwealth lands. If the government, or if any future government, want to inappropriately sell other lands, then unfortunately there is not a lot we can do about it through this legislation. So it is clear, from the Democrats' point of view, that the significant benefits of being able to ensure and lock in public ownership and lock in a process for proper management of the very significant lands that are now listed on schedule 1 is an opportunity that should not be lost and would be lost if the Senate insisted on these bits of suburban housing being put in schedule 1, as is proposed.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-02-07,"—I think this is consequential on previous amendments that were passed. Though we opposed what the government were doing in terms of composition, they were successful in getting their composition of the trust up. This is consequential to that.

Motion (by Senator Hill) proposed:
That the committee agrees to amendment No. 6 made by the House of Representatives to the bill.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-02-07,"—Amendment No. 6 basically reflects the tardy manner in which the government have approached this issue. Not only have they got it wrong but they are still dragging their feet.
—What!
—Minister, what you are trying to do through House of Representatives amendment No. 6 is to give yourselves four years during which to decide when the Department of Defence is to transfer the land to the trust—not four years during which the land is transferred to the trust, but four years during which you make a decision. You are giving yourselves four years to decide what to do with this land and when to hand it over. I would have thought that, no matter how slow moving your government was and no matter how hard you found it to make decisions, you would be able to make a decision pretty quickly as to the timetable. I would not have thought that even you, Minister, with the gridlock you find yourself in with all your other ministerial colleagues, would need four years to issue schedules as to when the land would be vested. We are trying to help you a bit with our amendment No. 9. Our amendment No. 9 basically says that the land should be handed over from Defence to the trust within a four-year period. That is the distinction here. I move opposition amendment No. 9 to House of Representatives amendment No. 6:
(9)	Amendment (6), clause 21, omit subclause (1), substitute:
(1)	The Minister administering the Naval Defence Act 1910 must, by notice or notices published in the Gazette, specify that each Trust land site mentioned in Schedules 1 and 2 that is a Commonwealth place is to vest in the Trust in accordance with section 22 on a specified day that is within 4 years of this Act commencing. A notice may deal with a part only of a Trust land site.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-02-07,"—On the arguments put forward to date by the minister and Senator Bolkus, I do not foresee a problem with Senator Bolkus's amendment. It just provides a bit more certainty to ensure the land does get placed in the hands of the trust. It still has the four-year time frame but, as I read it, it just requires a specified day within that four years rather than four years to decide when it will be handed over, which could then be in another four years. Given that we are looking at setting up the trust now—and the trust will be operating for a while yet in an interim capacity—four years is long enough for all the lands to be transferred, unless the minister has other cogent arguments as to why that is a problem.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2001-02-07,"—Some land has been vacated, other land has not been vacated and some is still needed for various defence purposes. This provides some flexibility in relation to the actual time of transfer. It means that they have to make the decision on the transfer within four years. We are hopeful that, within the four years, the land will all have been transferred. It just provides the flexibility they desire. I cannot see any downside to it. It also is consistent with the spirit in which the original arrangement was made with Defence, which was basically that the land would be gradually taken over by the trust as it was found to be no longer necessary for defence purposes. It is unwise for the parliament to now impose something more prescriptive than that. I think it may well lead to a debate on when the new act should be brought into effect, which is something I do not particularly want to have. I prefer to have this extra small bit of flexibility written in, in the terms we have included in these amendments.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-02-07,"—I have two responses to that. I can see a downside. The downside I can see is that the Department of Defence—and I presume the defence minister is likely to be the minister administering the Naval Defence Act—can, in four years time, specify that the site may be vested in the trust for four years later again. That is a decision that will be in the hands of the defence minister rather than the trust or the environment minister. That seems to me to be a downside, unless I am misreading the amendment as it stands. We are leaving it potentially in the hands of future defence ministers to hang on to the juicy bits. There are some nice bits there; there are one or two bits that Defence are a bit sad they might have to move out of. I think leaving the defence minister with the discretion to hang on to one or two juicy bits would not help the operation of the trust in the long term, unless I am misreading the clause 21(1) as it now stands.
The other concern I have with the minister's comments is his suggestion that, were this amendment to go through, there would then be some struggle within the government that might delay the assent to this legislation. He seemed to be inferring that the operation of the trust in a fully-fledged way may be delayed because the four-year clock would start ticking as soon as the act came into force. I just want to clarify that he was actually saying that this amendment may cause a potentially significant delay—as opposed to maybe one of a month or two—due to arm wrestling within the government about when the act would come into force.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2001-02-07,"—The answer is that I am not sure. We have brought in here a provision which we think is consistent with the spirit of what was agreed with Defence sometime ago. If the Senate decides to enact a provision today that provides an obligation on them to have actually transferred within four years then I am going to have to go back and discuss that with the relevant parties to see whether the government is prepared to agree to it. It is not the government's desired position. I am not saying—to use the language that we used earlier—that it would necessarily scuttle the bill but it is something that I could not give any commitment on that this time.

24  Transfer of Trust land
	(1)	The Trust must not sell or otherwise transfer the freehold interest of any Trust land other than to New South Wales and on the condition that the land remain in public ownership.
	(2)	If the Trust agrees to transfer the freehold interest of any Trust land to New South Wales, then the Trust must seek the Minister's approval, in writing, of the terms and conditions of the agreement.
This goes to the previously canvassed issue of what happens to the land. There was a prime ministerial commitment before the last election. The Prime Minister personally promised that the sites would be handed back to the New South Wales government for inclusion in the national parks and reserves system. We believe that this legislation should reflect that. The government is seeking to allow for itself the flexibility of transferring lands not only to the New South Wales government but also to the Commonwealth or to local government. It is not his commitment; it is not the best way to handle the land. As we canvassed earlier in this debate today, we believe that the Prime Minister's commitment should be met and, as a consequence, our amendment No. 10 reflects that. It is a challenge for Senator Hill to stand by his Prime Minister.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2001-02-07,"—Senator Bolkus has misrepresented the Prime Minister on this matter a number of times today. The commitment was that the land would be held for the people of Australia in perpetuity. As I said earlier in the debate, the most appropriate party to hold the land with that objective is yet to be determined. In all likelihood, most of the land, if not all, will ultimately end up with the state government of New South Wales but it is premature to prejudge the planning process that still lies ahead in the form that Senator Bolkus is requiring.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-02-07,"—That leaves it up in the air—that is the problem—and that is why I support Senator Bolkus's amendment. I would have thought that the government would want to make it clear, notwithstanding its difficulties with the New South Wales government—and no doubt there is politics in that on both sides. But I would have thought that the government would want it on the record that these lands are going to be part of the Greater Sydney Harbour National Park. That is what rings true.
—Woolwich?
—Yes. There is not a clear demarcation in national parks between the natural and the built. We have blurred those demarcations in the past. The best way to ensure that all these lands are used in an integrated fashion is to ensure that they go into the Greater Sydney Harbour National Park. The word `enhancing' is now in here because of the government and I would think that the enhancement process we should be aiming for is, wherever possible, some return to naturalness as a public amenity even to the most damaged parts of these very precious lands. But even if there are exceptions the intent of the government to have the lands it has in mind going into the Greater Sydney Harbour National Park ought to be spelled out in this legislation. Unless the Commonwealth has it in mind that this would be a Commonwealth national park, as distinct from a national park under the aegis of the New South Wales government, then I think it should support this amendment. Clearly, that is the way it is going; that is the way people will want it to be. There will be a very heavy onus on the New South Wales government of the day when it arrives there to preserve and protect this land as a national park and we should have that ethos written into this legislation.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-02-07,"—This debate will not get anywhere, but let me point out, because it is this minister dealing with it, that the current logging—which involves the destruction of the world's tallest hardwood forests, their ecosystems and wildlife through logging, firebombing and poisoning with 1080—is classified as ecologically sustainable development under the Howard government. The same applies to the logging of the forests in Western Australia and, indeed, in certain circumstances, the clearing of native vegetation, such as that which we are seeing in Queensland.
It is an appalling abuse of language. It ought not to be put into legislation unless there is a very tight definition of it. It is dishonest to use this terminology with such an appalling outcome possible. I have no doubt that, as far as the Sydney Harbour foreshores are concerned, the intent is that the ecology be looked after at this point. But the government should have a very tight definition of `ecologically sustainable'. That means `not damaging to the environment'. Earlier in this debate, when `preserving' these values was changed to `enhancing' them, the alarm bells started ringing. I do not know what the trust's advice to the minister has been on this, but it is all about having room to move, should there be some part of the management further down the line that is inimical to the natural values of what is left of the Sydney Harbour foreshore lands.
I object to the use of this terminology when it does not mean anything and when, as the minister says, there are a number of definitions of it and essentially you can take your pick. It ought to be spelled out in the legislation. There ought to be a definition up-front. I thought the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, of all people, would have ensured that that was the case in an important piece of legislation like this, where you dealing with the potential transfer of ownership in the future and you are establishing a trust, which has a very important duty, to look after the natural values of the Sydney foreshores. Under these specific amendments, the trust is being asked to ensure that the plans accord with the principles of ecologically sustainable development, but it gets no direction from the government, the writers of this legislation, as to what that term means.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2001-02-07,"—I wish to speak about a most important issue that has come before this parliament. This is the issue that strikes at the heart of humankind, and I refer to the cloning of human beings. Honourable senators recall the debate on the Gene Technology Bill that occurred in this chamber in November-December last year. I do not want to reflect on that particular debate but I do want to indicate that documents which were tabled from the National Health and Medical Research Council should not have been taken, as they were, on face value. One of the problems the government faced was that its advising organisation the National Health and Medical Research Council had incorrectly stated the view of the Australian Health Ethics Committee, a view which the National Health and Medical Research Council must observe under the statute.
In a document tabled in this place during that debate was a briefing note by Dr Clive Morris of the Centre for Health Advice, Policy and Ethics, Office of the National Health and Medical Research Council that was dated 1 November 2000. It included background information on the decision by health ministers to ban the cloning of `whole' human beings. The background information includes a report about the Australian Health Ethics Committee 1998 advice to the Minister for Health and Aged Care on human cloning. Dr Morris's report states that the Australian Health Ethics Committee identified a distinction between the cloning of whole human beings and therapeutic cloning.
I have in my hand a document which I obtained through the Australian Parliamentary Library entitled Australian Health Ethics Committee—National Health and Medical Research Council: position on cloning and related technologies and dated 15 December 2000. I seek leave to have that document incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
Australian Health Ethics Committee
National Health and Medical Research Council:
Position on Cloning and Related Technologies
15 December 2000
1 Clarification
The NHRMC's position on the use of cloning and stem cell technologies was inadvertently mis-stated in Appendix 1 (Background Information) of the invitation from the NHMRC to the Head of each State and Territory Health Authority, dated 1 November 2000, to the 15 December 2000 meeting to be held in Melbourne. That appendix incorrectly stated that, in its report entitled Scientific, Ethical and Regulatory Considerations Relevant to Cloning of Human Beings (1998) (Cloning Report), AHEC had identified a number of key issues which included the need to draw a basic distinction between the cloning of whole human beings and therapeutic cloning. In fact, in the Cloning Report AHEC specifically rejected the distinction between so-called `therapeutic' and so-called `reproductive' cloning.
At 3.3 of the Cloning Report, AHEC pointed out that, although the objective for the sake of which cloning is conducted is ethically-significant, other things (including whether or not cloning technologies would involve destructive research on human embryos) are also ethically-significant. At 3.22 - 3.27 these points are elaborated. AHEC's Cloning Paper restated its position on experimentation on human embryos as set out in the NHMRC Ethical Guidelines on Assisted Reproductive Technology (1996) (Ethical Guidelines). In so doing it rejected the position subsequently advanced by the Australian Academy of Science in its Position Statement of February 1999 (which employed the distinction between so-called therapeutic and so-called reproductive cloning).
2 Re-statement
The NHMRC policy on cloning and related technologies is summarized in the following extracts from the Ethical Guidelines:
Section 6 Research on embryos
6.1	Research on human embryos must take place within the limits prescribed by the law. In those States and Territories where there is no relevant legislation such research may only take place according to these Guidelines (see also Guideline 1.2).
6.2	Embryo experimentation should normally be limited to therapeutic procedures which leave the embryo, or embryos, with an expectation of implantation and development.
6.3	Non-therapeutic research which does not harm the embryo may be approved by an IEC.
6.4	Non-therapeutic research which involves the destruction of the embryo, or which may otherwise not leave it in an implantable condition, should only be approved by an IEC in exceptional circumstances. Approval requires:
•	a likelihood of significant advance in knowledge or improvement in technologies for treatment as a result of the proposed research;
•	that the research involves a restricted number of embryos; and
•	the gamete providers, and their spouses or partners, to have consented to the specific form of research (see Guideline 3.2.5).
6.5	Protocols for ART in any clinic should take account of the success rates of fertilization typically achieved in that clinic and, on that basis, seek to avoid the likelihood of production of embryos in excess of the needs of the couple. Techniques and procedures which create embryos surplus to the needs of the infertility treatment should be discouraged.
Section 11 Prohibited/unacceptable practices:
11. 1	Developing embryos for purposes other than for their use in an approved ART treatment program.
11.2	Culturing of an embryo in vitro for more than 14 days.
11.3	Experimentation with the intent to produce two or more genetically identical individuals, including development of human embryonal stem cell lines with the aim of producing a clone of individuals.
11.4	Using fetal games for fertilisation.
11.5	Mixing of human and animal gametes to produce hybrid embryos.
11.6	Mixing of gametes or embryos of different parental origin so as to confuse the biological parentage of the conceptus.
11.6	Placing an embryo in a body cavity other than in the human female reproductive tract.
11.8	Embryo flushing.
11.9	Commercial trading in gametes or embryos.
11. 10	Paying donors of gametes or embryos beyond reasonable expenses.
11. 11	The use in ART treatment programs of gametes or embryos harvested from cadavers.
3 Explanation
In Appendix 1 to the invitation from the NHMRC to State and Territory Health Authorities, the term ""therapeutic cloning"" was used mistakenly in summarising AHEC's policy.
The origin of this mis-statement follows: In the Ethical Guidelines, AHEC reaffirmed and applied the well-accepted distinction between (a) therapeutic research and (b) non-therapeutic research. Therapeutic interventions are interventions directed towards the wellbeing of the individual embryo involved and non-therapeutic interventions are interventions that are not directed towards the benefit of the individual embryo but rather towards improving scientific knowledge or technical application. Non-therapeutic experimentation includes both non-destructive procedures (which include observation) and destructive procedures.
The Ethical Guidelines, and in particular the section on research on embryos (section 6) and the list of prohibited/unacceptable practices (section 11), rely upon and apply this distinction between therapeutic and non-therapeutic research. The more-recently-coined term `therapeutic cloning' collapses both (a) the distinction between therapeutic and non-therapeutic research on embryos and (b) the distinction between destructive and non-destructive experimentation on embryos. The creation of embryos specifically for research purposes, experimentation on those embryos and their subsequent destruction, etc. all fall under this term. It was because of the lack of transparency of the term `therapeutic cloning', because the term concealed rather than revealed these ethically-significant differences, that AHEC rejected its use. AHEC said that, in the matter of cloning and related technologies, the fundamental distinction was between the production by cloning of whole human entities (such as human embryos) and the production by cloning of the component parts of those entities (such as cells, DNA, etc).  AHEC held that, whereas the latter has been an accepted part of medical and scientific research for over fifty years, the former should take place only in exceptional circumstances .
4 AHEC's current plan
The Commonwealth Minister for Health referred AHEC's Cloning Report to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The Standing Committee is currently conducting its enquiry into the matters raised in the Cloning Report. At its meeting of 11th and 12th September, 2000, AHEC decided to await the report of this Committee before undertaking any further work on this subject.
However, a working party of AHEC is now undertaking, on behalf of the NHMRC, the necessary follow up of the enactment of the Gene Technology Bill 2000 and the 15 December meeting to develop a national ban on the cloning of human beings.
Dr Kerry Breen
Chairperson
Australian Health Ethics Committee
15 December 2000
—That document—and I will quote only briefly from it—makes this clarification:
The NHRMC's position on the use of cloning and stem cell technologies was inadvertently mis-stated in Appendix 1 (Background Information) of the invitation from the NHMRC to the Head of each State and Territory Health Authority, dated 1 November 2000, to the 15 December 2000 meeting to be held in Melbourne. That appendix incorrectly stated that, in its report entitled Scientific, Ethical and Regulatory Considerations Relevant to Cloning of Human Beings (1998) (Cloning Report), AHEC had identified a number of key issues which included the need to draw a basic distinction between the cloning of whole human beings and therapeutic cloning. In fact, in the Cloning Report AHEC specifically rejected the distinction between so-called `therapeutic' and so-called `reproductive' cloning.
That is very important, I interpolate. The document continues:
At 3.3 of the Cloning Report, AHEC pointed out that, although the objective for the sake of which cloning is conducted is ethically-significant, other things (including whether or not cloning technologies would involve destructive research on human embryos) are also ethically-significant.
I might also quote from page 3 of the document from the Australian Health Ethics Committee:
The more-recently-coined term `therapeutic cloning' collapses both (a) the distinction between therapeutic and non-therapeutic research on embryos and (b) the distinction between destructive and non-destructive experimentation on embryos. The creation of embryos specifically for research purposes, experimentation on those embryos and their subsequent destruction, etc. all fall under this term. It was because of the lack of transparency of the term `therapeutic cloning', because the term concealed rather than revealed these ethically-significant differences, that AHEC rejected its use. AHEC said that, in the matter of cloning and related technologies, the fundamental distinction was between the production by cloning of whole human entities (such as human embryos) and the production by cloning of the component parts of those entities (such as cells, DNA, etc.).
The latter document goes on to say:
... has been an accepted part of medical and scientific research for over fifty years ...
In 1998, the chairman of the Australian Health Ethics Committee, Professor Don Chalmers, advised the minister in a letter as follows:
In responding to your request AHEC advises that a distinction must be drawn between the cloning of human beings, which is ethically unacceptable and legally prohibited in three states, and the cloning of such parts as DNA and cells. Cloning of DNA and cells is currently undertaken as part of routine laboratory research. 
This report—
that is, the Australian Health Ethics Committee report—
recommends that you urge remaining States and Territories ... which have not legislated in this area to introduce legislation prohibiting the application of techniques to clone a new human individual. This legislation should not, however, interfere with those cloning techniques which do not involve human embryos. 
It is very clear, yet I am afraid that the officers of the various states have been misled by the National Health and Medical Research Council. That has been made perfectly clear now by this document from the Australian Health Ethics Committee. I remind the Senate that the National Health and Medical Research Council is obliged, under the law that we passed through this parliament, to observe the ethical guidelines set down by the Australian Health Ethics Committee. Unless it does, as a very minimum—and I think the Australian Health Ethics Committee guidelines are the very minimum—we are going to come back here later and find a disgraceful situation whereby human beings are cloned in Australia.
As honourable senators will recall, this parliament at least amended the legislation, not in the way that I would have liked but in a way that the government thought was appropriate, to ban the cloning of whole human beings. In the debate, I was trying to find out what was meant by `whole human being'. I had considerable concerns about that. I think it is important for the minister to observe, and to alert the National Health and Medical Research Council and any other organisations involved, what Dr Peter McCullagh MD, DPhil, MRCP of the Developmental Physiology Group, Division of Molecular Medicine from ANU's John Curtin School of Medical Research said: 
Reference is made to several points in the Senate Hansard of Monday, 4 December 2000 to a ""whole human being"". It appears that the intent of the Bill before the chamber is to use this term in an exclusion sense, namely that the procedure under discussion (cloning) shall not be undertaken to produce a ""whole human being"" but may be undertaken to produce other entities that cannot be so described.
In the absence of any definition of what is intended by a ""whole human being"" the reasonable, and I believe the only semantically logical construction, that can be placed on the phrase is that permissibility may extend to parts (of a human being) but that production of the whole is proscribed. This interpretation would be consistent with the terminology adopted in the AHEC report of 16 December, 1998. The distinction was drawn in the opening paragraph (1.1) of that report as follows: ""There is an international consensus that a distinction should be drawn between two categories of cloning: cloning of a human being and copying (cloning) of human component parts ... such as DNA and cells"" ...
When the issue before the chamber is presented as a definition of what may be permissible rather than that of what is prohibited, the answer must be procedures undertaken on parts, the semantic distinction intended by AHEC. As ""whole"" and ""part"" are antonyms, there is no scope for having entities which are in between, or neither whole nor part. It will be ridiculous, both semantically and biologically to classify an embryo, irrespective of whether it is a single cell zygote or late blastocyst of hundreds of cells, as a part.
If clarity is sought in the drafting of this legislation, it is necessary to acknowledge that the meaning of ""whole human being"" is in accord with the international consensus referred to by AHEC rather than having some idiosyncratic meaning peculiar to this legislation.
Because of the very important nature of this issue, which goes to the heart of individual human beings and our society as a whole, I believe it is incumbent upon the minister for health to acknowledge what has been stated by AHEC in the document that I have incorporated and also in the comments I have made on this matter, and to follow the urgings of the Australian Health Ethics Committee to get the states to act, because in New South Wales anything goes. There are three states in that situation, and there are three that are not. I think it is incumbent upon the minister, supported by this parliament, to get all the states to act on the basis I have outlined.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Human Cloning</title>,Matters of Public Interest,1,1,speech

Can the minister inform the Senate of the circumstances surrounding the discovery of high levels of legionella bacteria in the cooling towers of the Commonwealth Department of Health and Aged Care offices in Woden, ACT? Can the minister confirm that, in addition to original high levels in December, high levels of legionella were again found just yesterday, despite building management assurances that full cleaning of the towers had taken place? Is the minister aware that the department proposes replacing the cooling towers entirely? Have the delays in communicating this potentially serious health issue to staff arisen because the ownership and management of these buildings no longer lies with the federal government itself and don't these most recent legionella scares mean that the Howard government should rethink its proposed watering down of statutory occupational health and safety protections for its own staff?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Legionella Bacteria: Department of Health and Aged Care</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,question

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2001-02-07,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the minister's response.
The minister begins by saying he does not know whether his office has been notified. Can I make it plain to the minister that I have extended to him exactly the same courtesies that he extended to me yesterday when he came into this chamber and replied to a return to order motion that I had moved. He is being treated with exactly the same courtesy as he extended to me. If his level of courtesy continues to remain as it was yesterday, he can expect that response from our side to remain as well. If the minister wants to banish the exercise of proper parliamentary courtesy, he cannot continue to expect that we will remain courteous in the face of that arrogant and insulting behaviour.
It is also of considerable concern to the opposition that the minister has not provided answers to these questions. Thirty-six of them were lodged on 16 October, and they go to a matter which is not of insubstantial consequence to Australians. Those 36 questions, which have now waited almost four months for an answer and which, under the rules of this place, are required to be answered within three months and thus are almost a month overdue, are about a matter of major public controversy. The government's failure or, as one deeply suspects, refusal to answer these questions at all amounts to a snub of this parliament and a cover-up of the information that Australians are entitled to.
The questions relate to the tax windfall gain the government has received from higher petrol prices. How much is it? This is a matter of widespread public controversy. Let me enlarge on the point. Because we apply a GST, which is a 10 per cent tax on the final price, to petrol prices and because prices rose in October and continue to remain high because of higher oil prices, the amount of tax rake-off this government has achieved is significantly higher than it budgeted for in the 2000-01 budget brought down in May 2000. We want to know how much more money the government received than it expected to. If these questions were answered, we would know and Australia would know how much extra tax revenue has been paid into the public coffers by petrol and fuel users in this country because of the Australian government's tax regime.
That is one leg of this question. The other leg of this question is that Australia is 97 per cent self-sufficient in oil, and in this country we apply a resource rental tax which is adjusted to world parity prices for oil. If the world price of oil goes up, so the amount of yield from the resource rental tax increases to mirror the value of global petrol prices. If these 36 questions had been answered, we would know, because of the impact of higher oil prices due to OPEC decisions in October, how much extra revenue the government of Australia has received as a result of the adjustment with world parity pricing and we would know the answer to those questions.
These are not insubstantial questions. The fact that they are now being covered up amounts to a refusal by the government to let the taxpayers of this nation know how much tax they pay, and that goes directly to the government's own legislation. When the government came to power, it brandished the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill, in which it said that the obligation on political parties in this country was to accurately declare their expenditure in relation to the budget. The purpose of the bill was to catch out any political party that wanted to give promises greater in cost than there was funding to cover. The Charter of Budget Honesty Bill ought to be applied to the government on the basis that a charter of budget honesty goes to the extent of honestly telling Australian taxpayers how much tax they have paid to the bottom line of the budget. These 36 questions on notice would enable taxpayers to find that out.
These questions are not insubstantial for another reason—that the Prime Minister says that he has provided a roads program which amounts to a handing back of the extra tax revenue that the government has received from higher petrol prices. The value of that roads program is $1.6 billion over four years. If we know how much extra revenue the government has got, we can test the honesty of the Prime Minister's assertion that he has genuinely handed back that money in an extra roads building program for Australia. At the moment, we have only the industry organisation that represents Australian motorists, the Australian Automobile Association. That is the body that represents the NRMA, the RACV, the RACQ, the RAA and the RAC, the ordinary motorist organisations in Australia. They say that the value is $1.34 billion a year. The Prime Minister's promise on roads is $1.6 billion over four years. The Automobile Association, an independent, non-political, non-partisan organisation, says that the revenue gain is $1.34 billion a year. So, if the Prime Minister were to hand back the true revenue—if it has been accurately figured out by the Australian Automobile Association—the roads program would be in excess of $5 billion, not $1.6 billion over four years. There lies the gaping hole in the Prime Minister's assertion that he has indeed handed it back through road funding. It leads to the suspicion: if he will not tell us what the revenue gain is, how can we test his allegation that he has handed it back? If the government does not answer these 36 questions, it is covering up the facts.
There is a third reason why answers to these questions are imperative. On television the Prime Minister said that, if we cut the excise increase that the government allowed to go through on 1 February, which increased the price of unleaded petrol for Australian motorists by 1.72c a litre at the pump, Australians will not want 1.72c a litre. He said it is too small and it does not matter. That flies in the face of what the motorists themselves have said. In a survey by the AAA, over 75 per cent of Australian motorists said that they want cheaper prices for petrol and that, even if the prices were cheaper by only a few cents a litre, that would be appreciated. The price of petrol went up by 1.72c a litre on 1 February because of a tax hike. That amounts to a revenue gain for this government of $500 million a year—an extra soaking of Australians through the petrol pump, which goes through taxes to the government, that is undeclared. We have to stop this secrecy. We have to stop this cover-up. The proper way to do this is for responsible senators to ask the government questions in the parliament.
I did that on 16 October: I asked 36 questions. By order of the Senate—after a proposition made and voted for unanimously by the coalition, who were then the opposition—ministers are required to answer any questions put on notice within 30 days. It has now been nearly four months since October. This minister, who voted to impose the 30-day rule, is flouting the 30-day rule in covering up essential information that Australian taxpayers are entitled to know. That is why answers to these 36 questions are necessary.
Fourthly and importantly, petrol prices are hurting Australians but they are hurting country Australians more than they are hurting urban Australians, because the GST is a 10 per cent tax. Petrol prices in the country are higher than petrol prices in the city because of the in-built transport cost. The GST is imposed on top of the final price. Country Australians are paying more petrol tax than urban Australians. I repeat: country Australians are paying more tax than city Australians. I do not want to massage country-city rivalries, but that is a plain fact. People in regional Australia are hurting most of all. Country people fill their petrol tanks more often, they travel further and they cannot resort to public transport as an alternative to family cars as city Australians can, and they pay more tax as a consequence. If the 36 questions placed on notice by me nearly four months ago are answered by the government, we will know how much more they are paying. If the government does not answer those questions, it should be charged with a cover-up and a denial of information about the tax differential between petrol prices in country and metropolitan Australia.
I want to make a fifth point. I will make it in a quiet and restrained tone but let me make it with absolute passion. A fundamental right of taxpayers is to know how much tax they pay and a fundamental right of a government in levying tax is to let taxpayers know how much tax they are up for. In the budget of May 2000, we heard the government projections for its revenue haul through tax. We know that those projections were based on an assumption that the international barrel price for oil would be $US20 a barrel. We know that the projection was also based on an assumption that the exchange rate of the Australian dollar to the US dollar would be around 60c to the dollar.
We know that in October the world barrel price went to $US37 a barrel and the exchange rate plummeted to A50.7c to the US dollar, making the price of a barrel of oil in Australian dollars so much more. I have not computed the figure but it is between $A70 and $A80. Because of international parity pricing and the way in which the resource rental tax works, that meant that government revenue increased as well. It was a silent increase in tax. Because the higher the price the more you pay under the GST. It also meant that the GST generated more income for the government than the government had anticipated—and it has not gone to the states just yet, Mr Howard. Why can't the government, the tax levying authority in this case, tell us how much more? Why do we have to wait so long to get an answer?
This is the Senate. This is the states house and this is a house of review. I do not often make the following point—and this point is frequently made cheaply—but it is important to note that the premiers of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia and Tasmania have all, at one time or another, called on the government to hand back excise on petrol or to do something about petrol taxes. In this federation of ours, we are obliged—in this chamber, at least—to give considerable weight to what the states ask of the Commonwealth. Where there is a consistency of views among the states, we are obliged to reflect that view, to some extent, in this chamber. We are not bound hand and foot by what the state premiers say but we are obliged to pay attention to it.
No-one can say that the high price of petrol in Australia and, more importantly, the high level of tax on petrol in Australia are not burning issues. That is exemplified by the fact that the premiers raised these questions with the Commonwealth. So it is not surprising that it should be this chamber, knowing the forms and obligations that are upon it, that asks the government these 36 questions which remain unanswered. This is the place where you would expect that to occur. This is the place where the government would expect it occur. This is the place, under the constitutional forms, where the government is answerable not just to us as the Senate but through the Senate to the states as well.
I do not want to dwell on this point and I do not want to draw too long a bow about it. I point to the weight of obligation that there is here, and I return fundamentally to my dismay and absolute disappointment that these questions remain unanswered. On 16 October I dutifully and appropriately placed 36 questions on notice which, if the Assistant Treasurer had answered them, would have enabled Australians to know how much extra tax they have paid on petrol because of higher petrol prices. It would have been useful to know that before 1 February when the tax on unleaded petrol went up by 1.72c a litre. It would have been useful to know for the public debate how much more tax had been gathered and why, in the face of the extra tax that had been gathered, the government was exacting more tax from petrol.
It would have been useful to know too because the Australian Automobile Association issued a press statement just this week headed `Prime Minister should check his figures'. I have asked the government how much extra tax we have paid, and the Australian Automobile Association have calculated how much extra tax they think it is. They think we have paid $1.34 billion extra tax per year because of higher petrol prices. If the government refuses to answer in a responsible public debate, that is the figure that becomes accepted, because the Australian Automobile Association are a reputable, nonpartisan, non-political organisation. They have no axe to grind, but they want to get their facts right. They have chastised the Prime Minister that the road funding does not compensate, and that it in fact undercompensates by over $3½ billion. The Australian Automobile Association have uncharacteristically—because they do not like getting in the political domain—chastised directly the Prime Minister and said that he has got it wrong.
If the figure which the Treasury boffins know, the Treasurer knows and the Assistant Treasurer knows was less than $1.34 billion—which the Australian Automobile Association said was too much—the first thing this government would do is rush out and correct them and say, `They are overstating it. They are trying to excite disapproval and unhappiness by overstating it. Here is the true figure,' and they would then surprise us with a tax haul that was less. But the fact that they give us no figure and cover up can lead to a conclusion that the figure may be more and that the conservative organisation, the Australian Automobile Association, in order not to be caught out has in fact understated it. Therefore, this cover-up is to provide a defence from the true figure which would shock us even more than the Australian Automobile Association's figure. I do not know whether that is true, but it is a possible interpretation of the government's refusal to tell us how much extra tax we are paying. So that is why the government's refusal to answer these 36 questions and the minister's response are disappointing. The minister has not remained in the chamber and done us the courtesy of listening to these points. I hope he does answer those questions. (Time expired)

That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (7) of standing order 111 not apply to the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill 2001, allowing it to be considered during this period of sittings.
I also table a statement of reasons justifying the need for the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill to be considered during these sittings and seek leave to have the statement incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
STATEMENT OF REASONS FOR INTRODUCTION AND PASSAGE IN THE 2001 AUTUMN SITTINGS
AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 2001
Purpose of the Bill
This Bill will amend the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Act 1991 to:
·	implement those aspects of the food regulatory model developed in response to the Food Regulation Review (Blair) Report, that were agreed to by COAG and that require legislative change, including:
-	establishing the proposed Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) statutory authority to replace the Australia New Zealand Food Authority;
-	enabling FSANZ to develop all food standards relating to food production that are to be adopted nationally; and
-	amending the current standards development process to reflect the role of the proposed Australia and New Zealand Food Regulation Ministerial Council, including the development by FSANZ of standards that comply with policy guidelines developed by the Ministerial Council.
Reasons for Urgency
States and Territories will expect the Commonwealth to make the legislative changes necessary to implement the proposed new food regulatory system agreed to by COAG as soon as possible.
Introduction and passage of the Bill in one sittings will enable the whole of the proposed new system, including FSANZ, to commence operation within three years of the publication of the Report of the Food Regulation (Blair) Review.
Failure to pass this Bill in the Autumn sittings would result in continuation of the complex and partial transitional arrangements specified in the related Inter-Governmental Agreement on Food Regulation until FSANZ is established.
Under the transitional arrangements ANZFA would continue to develop and recommend to the new Ministerial Council for adoption those types of food standards it currently recommends to the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Council.
The new Ministerial Council will also have responsibility for the development of all domestic food regulatory policy, and policy guidelines for the development of all domestic food standards that are adopted nationally, but it will not yet have the related power to seek a review of such standards. Early passage of the Bill will enable FSANZ to develop all such standards in accordance with policy developed by the new Ministerial Council as soon as possible.

I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a short summary of the committee's concerns with these instruments.
Leave granted.
The summary read as follows—
Civil Aviation Amendment Regulations 2000 (No.8), Statutory Rules 2000 No.295
The Regulations remove the requirement for flying training to be carried out in a designated ""flying training area"", and simplifies the definition of that term.
The Explanatory Statement notes that, prior to these amendments, Airservices Australia had not designated any flying training areas, and that as a consequence all flying training conducted in such areas was being performed illegally. The Explanatory Statement goes on to note that this ""has obvious legal ramifications for both the aviation industry and CASA as well as implications for insurance coverage"". The Committee has written to the Minister for advice on this matter. 
Exemption No.CASA EX43/2000
The instrument exempts operators of single-engine craft with a maximum take-off weight exceeding 5,700 kilograms that are employed in aerial work operations from compliance with regulation 217 of the Regulations.
The Explanatory Statement notes that ""CASA considers that a formal training and checking organisation is not appropriate and imposes an unnecessary burden on the operators"" of aerial work operations. It is not clear from this statement whether operators of aircraft in the designated class used in aerial work have previously been required to provide a training and checking organisation, or whether there have been any previous arrangements to exempt operators from this requirement. The Committee has written to the Minister for advice.
Senator Brown to move, on the next day of sitting:
That the Senate—

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-02-07,"—Pursuant to contingent notice, I move:
That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Brown moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to general business notice of motion No. 802.
The motion reads:
That the Senate endorses the comments of the Western Australian Opposition Leader (Dr Gallop) that: `The time has come to move away from old-growth logging. I think our aspirations, our expectations as a community have changed and we now understand that the conservation of these remarkable assets is more important than their destruction, both in terms of our conservation values but also in terms of the jobs. The future lies in protecting our wilderness and our old-growth forests and that's where the jobs will be in the future.'
I would have expected that the opposition, at least, would have wanted that to go to the vote as a formal motion. But it is the Labor opposition, I note, that has refused formality. So the option available to me is to move this motion so that we can have a general debate on my general business notice of motion No. 802 and have it supported by the Senate. 
The sentiments being expressed by the Western Australian Labor Party and the opposition leader are the sentiments held by the vast majority of Western Australians and, indeed, held by people right across this country. If the Labor Party supports it in Western Australia—and it does—it ought to support it also in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and, of course, in my home state of Tasmania, where the same logic for protecting old-growth forests is endorsed by the majority of voters. 
I am totally behind the sentiments that Dr Gallop has expressed. Frankly, on the basis of saving the forests—or 99 per cent of them, as he has put it, some 350,000 hectares—with a very generous program for the realignment of the industry to give it a secure future, which it does not have as it erodes into the logging of old-growth forests and jobs in the future, I would think and hope that the majority of Western Australian voters could see their way clear to endorse this positive new sentiment which, for the first time, is being expressed by a senior member of one of the `old parties'. Of course, the Greens and the Democrats have been strong on these policies for many years. We want to see an end to the logging of old-growth forests, the destruction and the loss of jobs—hundreds of jobs have gone west since the Prime Minister signed the death warrant in recent years on these forests around Australia—to ensure that future job alternatives of presenting and giving recreation to Australians for generations to come in these forests will be looked after.
We recognise, as Dr Gallop does, that there is already a mature plantation establishment around the country that can meet all our job needs, with downstream processing which will increase jobs in the industry. The problem is, of course, that the woodchip industry has inordinately bent the policy direction. The CFMEU and, where relevant, the AWU have been involved with the woodchip companies in bending policy against the public interest. Dr Gallop stood up against that and the Greens endorse that. We have fought for forests around Australia for 20 or 30 years, since our inception, and we are going to vigorously support these policies in the Western Australian election. I might add that it is because of Christine Sharp and her two colleagues in the upper house in Western Australia bringing parliamentary pressure to bear in the public debate—complementing the enormous public feeling for saving for forests in Western Australia—that has led to this outstanding policy from Geoff Gallop. The Labor Party should support it, and it should support it right across the country. It is an important election issue in Western Australia. It represents the public sentiment and we should be endorsing this policy here today as a matter of urgency because we will not get the opportunity to do so in such circumstances at future sittings.",SENATE,<title>FORESTS: OLD GROWTH</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,9,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2001-02-07,"—The government does not support suspension of standing orders. Forest conservation is an important issue and there is an appropriate time for debate of that. If any individual senator believes that a debate is necessary on the subject, that time is during general business tomorrow afternoon. To suspend the business before the Senate at the moment would mean that important government legislation will not be reached—
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. The minister knows quite well that I cannot debate this tomorrow afternoon. Debating time tomorrow afternoon is in the hands of the Labor Party.
—There is no point of order, Senator Brown.
—I want to make that clear so that people are not hoodwinked by what Senator Hill just said. 
—There is no point of order.
—I presume the practice of the past still occurs, and that is to share the general business around, but if it gets to Senator Brown's turn and there is some other subject that he thinks is more important, there is a message in that in itself. Basically, the government has before the Senate today the very important piece of legislation to protect the Sydney Harbour foreshore, the Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation Contributions) Bill 2000, the Australian Research Council Bill 2000, the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill 2000, the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2000, the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 4) 2000—and I could go on. And that is the point. That is the business that should be transacted by this chamber today; not something that Senator Brown simply thinks is relevant to his Green candidates in the forthcoming Western Australian election. It is a stunt. Senator Brown knows that this is the way, under standing orders, that he can get five minutes in which to mention the names of his candidates—
—And broadcast them.
—I am sure there are a lot of Western Australians sitting on the edges of their chairs, writing these names down. That is what this about; it is not a genuine attempt to debate the issue. The reason I know it is not a genuine attempt is that otherwise, in his five minutes, he would have acknowledged that the cooperative regional forest agreement process, which was designed to provide a comprehensive, adequate and representative conservation reserve system across Australia while at the same time supporting sustainable forest industries—both economically and ecologically sustainable—has in fact resulted, from the conservation perspective, in another 2.51 million hectares being added to reserves. This brings the total forest conservation reserves in Australia to 8.99 million hectares, an increase of 39 per cent compared with the pre-RFA situation. 
On old growth, Senator Brown would have acknowledged that the process increased reserves by 42 per cent, to 2.83 million hectares, representing some 67 per cent of the total area of old growth forests. And he would have acknowledged that some 260,000 hectares of high quality wilderness was added to the reserves, leaving the post-RFA wilderness reserve at 2.523 million hectares, or just over 89 per cent of existing wilderness areas. He would have acknowledged the structural adjustment, the money that the Commonwealth put in, to enable such reserves to be created without undue pain by the forest industries—a sum of $328 million. He would have applauded that and said that that outcome from a reserve point of view, in the space of just a few years, is tremendous. He would have also acknowledged that it provided the basis for sustainable forest industries and jobs in that sector as well.
Finally, Senator Brown would have acknowledged that what we have seen in the south-west of Western Australia—around Margaret River, Augusta and other places—is that tourism and the forest industry can coexist. Tourism is booming, jobs within tourism are booming, and the forest industry has the chance for a sustainable future as well. If he had acknowledged all that, we would not have had the stunt and we would not be wasting half an hour this afternoon.",SENATE,<title>FORESTS: OLD GROWTH</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,9,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-02-07,"—I think it is appropriate, as the Democrats environment spokesperson, to put on the record the Democrats' support for both the substantive motion and the original motion quoting the comments of Dr Gallop. It is an important issue and it is significant obviously and very immediate to the people and electors of Western Australia, but I think it is an issue of concern to people around the country. The idea that only people in Western Australia are concerned about old growth forests in Western Australia is one that I think is false. I think people all around the country are concerned about the future of those forests, and it is pleasing to see the broader acceptance across most of the political spectrum for greater protection for old growth forests. It is appropriate, with the Western Australian election coming up this weekend, to note the strong contribution of the Democrats to increasing public awareness and support for the protection of old growth forests in WA. Particularly in the upper house, I think it is worth praising the Democrats MPs there. I will say their names so that people listening can write them down, as Senator Hill suggested: Helen Hodgson and, in particular, Norm Kelly—
—We've got 50 candidates to name—
—Yes, I could go through our other 50 candidates, as my deputy suggests, but I do have only five minutes, and I think there is no need to name all the candidates because they would all universally support the need to protect these very precious forests not just for their aesthetic value but of course for the immense biodiversity that they contain and also for the economic benefits that protecting these forests will bring to future generations in Western Australia and Australia. I think one of the positive aspects of the quote of Dr Gallop's that has been highlighted is that it is not just about protecting the forests because saving the environment is a nice thing but also about recognising that the future for jobs lies in protecting our wilderness areas and native forests.
I think that is partly why the position of parties such as the Democrats and the Greens, who have both fought for many years to ensure greater protection of our native forests, is starting to be taken on board by some parts of other parties, and I think it needs to be noted and welcomed when that happens. Indeed, I think I remember correctly last year that a leading figure in the National Party in Western Australia made similar comments about the need to have greater protection of our forests. Obviously there is a significant proportion of people who either are or were members of, or are supportive of, the Liberal Party in Western Australia who have taken on the label of Liberals for Forests and who want to express their views and their concerns about the need to protect the forests in Western Australia and in other parts of the country. So it is important in that regard.
I think the work of political parties when they do take on board positive environmental policies needs to be acknowledged and supported. I think it is appropriate for the Senate to send a message not just to the voters but to political parties and contestants in the WA election that we support this policy direction that more and more people in politics in Western Australia are taking. It is important to give encouragement to people that engage in the democratic process. It is not something that a lot of people in the community are keen to do, but certainly the Democrats would encourage them, whether for our party or for any party, to get engaged and involved in the debate and to promote positive policies. We are now seeing the situation, thankfully, in Western Australia where people in most parts of the political spectrum are promoting positive policies in relation to forests. Certainly the Democrats both during this election campaign and in our role in the upper house in the last four years—and after this election, hopefully, with an increased number of Democrat candidates—will continue to put pressure and priority on this issue. It is one thing, as we all know, unfortunately, for leaders of major political parties to make statements, but it is another thing to force them to honour their commitments after the election, and one of the reasons why there needs to be a strong role for parties such as the Democrats in the upper house in Western Australia is to keep leaders—whether it is Dr Gallop or anybody else—to their promises to get greater protection for our native forests in Western Australia.",SENATE,<title>FORESTS: OLD GROWTH</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,9,1,speech
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2001-02-07,"—It is gratifying to note that both the Greens and the Democrats in Western Australia will be supporting Mr Gallop on the weekend. I take it that that means there will be a strong flow of preferences to Labor candidates on the weekend, apparently because of this policy. It is important to note that, under the RFA approach, which the Labor Party is responsible for creating, each of the states has the responsibility for managing its own forest areas.
But rather than debate this matter, as Senator Brown suggests, it is our view that we came here this week not in a self-indulgent way to deal with the issues arising in the state elections in Western Australia and Queensland over the coming two weekends but rather to deal with the business that was on the Notice Paper and for which people are prepared. It would have been open to the Labor Party to lay down a series of motions in a self-indulgent way promoting the candidacy of the candidates in various areas of the country and to debate those and to take the time of the Senate to deal with those, but we made the decision at the beginning of the week that we would not do that. We decided that we would come to the Senate to deal with the business of the Senate this week, and that is what we are doing.
So we are not going to support dealing with this motion. It would take a deal of time. We would be proposing certain amendments to the document, as Senator Brown full well knows, in relation to recognising the reality that, as I said, under our RFA approach different states have the ability to make their own decisions about the management of their forestry resources. So we will not be supporting the suspension today, but, as the Leader of the Government said, it is open to Senator Brown to bring this matter up when next he has an opportunity in general business—and he has had some opportunities. It is incorrect of him to say that he does not have opportunities. He has had some, and he has used some. And, no doubt, he will have some in the future. But, in relation to this matter, we are not prepared, beyond the time that Senator Brown has taken to debate this suspension, to interrupt the business of the Senate—the important matters which are before the Senate—because, frankly, this is just another stunt that Senator Brown has pursued. He has used his five minutes; he is very good at doing that. He has made the points that he sought to make, but we make the point that we are here to deal with the business of the Senate, which has been on the Notice Paper for some time, and we are not going to get involved in the sort of political stunt that this motion is intended to create.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-02-07,"—I apologise to the committee for missing the last 30 seconds of this debate before lunchtime. We might have had a chance to get a vote on these. Amendment No. 11 provides that the trust, by public notice, inform the public about any application they may make and the reasons for that application if they are wanting to extend the time on a plan. I think that is a minor extra administrative requirement that would assist if the trust are feeling that they need to have longer than two years to prepare a particular draft plan and apply to the minister to extend that time. I do not see, on the surface anyway, any reason why it should be problematic for that to be required to be publicly notified to the community, along with some reasons.
In relation to amendments Nos 12 and 13, with No. 12 on developing a timetable, I would be surprised if any plan did not contain some form of timetable for implementation in relation to the transfer of the site to New South Wales. We have had that debate in relation to a few other amendments and they have not been ones that the Democrats have felt we should support this time around. On the disallowable plan, particularly if the government accepts leases greater than 10 years being disallowable, it is my expectation that an ability for the Senate to disallow every plan that is put forward would not be acceptable to the government, although the government can say whether that is the case or not. In that circumstance, we would not want to jeopardise the whole legislation and all the protection that it provides for that extra safeguard, beneficial though it may be. 
I also mention that in the reasonably extensive consultations that I have conducted over a fair while with community groups on this bill, and in recent weeks as well, there were a few key issues they put forward that they were keen to have pursued. One, relating to leases greater than 10 years, the Senate has agreed to, which I am pleased about. I hope the government will accept that. This was not one that was particularly put forward as crucial to the future operations of the trust. In summary, subject to any comment the minister may make about amendment (11), I would be attracted to supporting that one and I ask that it be put separately.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2001-02-07,"—I had said, in the 40 seconds Senator Bartlett was out of the chamber before lunch, that I opposed all three. I have to concede that the one that causes me least concern of the three is (11). My objection there is simply that it is cumbersome. The trust is already subject to a very detailed regime in relation to the development of these plans under this particular provision; it is just another step, if necessary, which includes further public advertising and the like. It has been a view of the government that the line ought to be drawn somewhere and that the package that has come back from the House of Representatives with the government's amendments has been sufficient. But, again, I do not think it is the end of the world, and I hear what Senator Bartlett has said. The second one, (12), does relate to the whole issue of New South Wales, which we oppose and which has been dealt with under other clauses. We certainly strongly oppose that the plans become disallowable instruments as well, which is (13).",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,17,1,speech

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2001-02-07,"—The Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation Contributions) Bill 2000 represents belated action on the part of the government to close down one of the most massive tax avoidance schemes since the bottom-of-the-harbour scheme: the multibillion dollar abuse of employee benefit arrangements, known as Costello's bottom-of-the-harbour scheme. The main purpose of the bill is to close down prospectively—and I stress it is prospectively—only two of the three forms of EBA abuse, with effect from 1 July 2000. The two forms of EBA abuse which this bill tackles are controlling interest superannuation and noncomplying superannuation funds. It is noteworthy that the government has taken no action to stem the abuse of employee benefit trusts as part of its belated EBA crackdown. This government is more about letting its mates out of paying tax.
We know from evidence provided by the ATO that a minimum of $1.5 billion of superannuation contributions have been put into EBAs. However, the Senate inquiry into this bill was told that one promoter alone channelled $2 billion through noncomplying superannuation schemes. This puts the ATO's estimate at the lower end of the scale, and we believe that many more billions of dollars have been channelled into EBA schemes in order to avoid tax.
The bill itself essentially has three main parts. The first part of the bill clarifies the purposes for which an employer can gain a tax deduction for superannuation contributions for an employee. From 1 July 2000, an employer will be prevented from making a deduction for an employee where the employee is an associate of the employer. The second part of the bill seeks to stop contributions to noncomplying superannuation funds being deductible for tax purposes. The third part of the bill will impose fringe benefits tax on superannuation contributions where those contributions are made for the benefit of an associate of the employer. Labor support this belated and reluctant government crackdown on the abuse of some EBAs. However, we will be moving an amendment to ensure that the bill achieves the objective of closing down the abused employee benefit arrangements first flagged by the ATO. I will discuss that amendment later.
The Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation Contributions) Bill 2000 was referred to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services for examination. The committee held public hearings on 27, 29 and 30 November in Canberra and reported back to the Senate on Monday, 4 December. Unfortunately, due to the government's insistence and its fear that its complicity in allowing these schemes to flourish would be exposed, the examination of the bill was as brief as possible. This meant in particular that the Senate committee was unable to question the promoters of these schemes—something which no doubt would have shed some light on the government's nod and a wink approval of these tax abuse schemes through secret meetings with the government, such as those held in 1996 between RPC Pty Ltd and the then Assistant Treasurer, Senator Short.
In addition, Labor senators were concerned that the ATO consistently did not make available the witnesses specifically requested by Labor in order to properly ascertain the ATO's, and therefore the government's, approach to the abuse of EBAs. This meant that many of the Labor senators' questions were not able to be answered by officials from the Australian Taxation Office. In effect, they sought, no doubt under government direction, to stonewall Labor's questions. I know that my colleague Senator Sherry, who will contribute to this debate, was many times forced to try to take on a stonewall as tax office and government officials sought to avoid scrutiny and sought to avoid answering questions on this sensitive area. They used a variety of means—I will come to some of the best furphies that they performed later—and it was very difficult to get to the truth of the need for this bill.
In spite of this, Labor will continue to pursue this issue with vigour. The purpose of this bill is to close only prospectively some loopholes in the taxation of employee benefit arrangements. Under employee benefit arrangement schemes, high income earners in particular avoided paying the superannuation surcharge tax, FBT and the additional Medicare levy where applicable. This is akin to the big welfare crackdown when the government started hunting out welfare recipients and throwing them off the pension when at the same time it has sat back and allowed rich, high wealth Australians to access welfare benefits, in some cases, as well as to avoid paying straightforward things like the Medicare levy. This is one of the most shameful episodes in taxation history. There are a lot of them, so that is a pretty big call.
In some circumstances, offshore funds were used for no other reason than to launder superannuation contributions, which eventually returned to Australia via round robin transactions in what amounted to a total tax wipe-out—to coin an ATO phrase. Evidence from the ATO confirmed that these illegitimate schemes grew in popularity from 1997 onwards. Isn't this date telling? Just one year after the election of the Howard government, the most massive tax avoidance scam since the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes of the late 1970s began to flourish—the abuse of EBAs.
Just as Mr Howard as Treasurer did nothing to stem the abuse of bottom-of-the-harbour schemes in the late seventies, he as Prime Minister is now presiding over Costello's bottom-of-the-harbour schemes of the nineties and into 2000. We finally saw some action being taken with regard to these abusive schemes when, on 28 October 1998, the ATO produced a draft public ruling which sought to clamp down on the abuse of employee benefit arrangements. However, the EBA schemes continued to be promoted after this date. Evidence was presented to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services—one that Acting Deputy President Watson is very familiar with—that schemes continued to be effective after 28 October 1998 and until 30 June 2000. Mr Trevor Thomas, Assistant Commissioner of the ATO, told the Senate inquiry:
Looking at the marketing of offshore superannuation arrangements, when the government announced these changes, it indicated that it is amending the law because of the continued marketing of these arrangements by some promoters despite clear public advice from the ATO that they fail both at law and in their implementation... In our view, these offshore superannuation arrangements are a blatant abuse of tax laws and an attack on the integrity of the tax system and the retirement income system.
It is obvious that EBA schemes are not available to the vast majority of taxpayers on low or middle incomes. They are available only to relatively few very high income earners. Indeed, the ATO revealed that the number of participants they have discovered so far was relatively small. There were 2,400 participants in controlling interest superannuation schemes and 220 participants in offshore noncomplying funds. We are talking about a mere 2,500 Australian taxpayers and we are talking figures of between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, to give you some indication of the type of individual who has been rorting the tax system and not paying their fair share.
That is what this bill is about and that is what this debate is about: making Australians who are seeking to avoid their obligations pay their fair share. Despite the small number of participants, the ATO has estimated—and the Labor opposition believes this to be at the lower end of the scale—that around $1.5 billion has been claimed in deductions and that up to $600 million may have been forgone in taxation revenue. Most ordinary Australians could not fathom the extent of this rort—$600 million for fewer than 2,500 Australians ripping the system off while the government was persecuting welfare recipients in the last five years. The ATO has also admitted to the inquiry that the figure of $1.5 billion represents an estimate and that this figure was produced in April 1999 and has not been updated since. This is as red hot as it gets.
—They haven't finished counting yet.
—It is so big they cannot count it all. That is right, Senator Sherry: they have not finished counting it. But what is going on with the tax office? They were able to produce a figure in 1999, but when we later sat down with them on three separate occasions they were unable to give us an updated figure. They have the biggest tax avoidance scheme going on in 20 years and they are not even able to make a guess at the true figure in the year 2000, going into 2001.
It beggars belief that the tax office continue to refuse to supply the committee and the parliament with this information. Why hasn't it been updated since, one may ask. Doesn't the government want to know how much revenue has been lost under Costello's bottom-of-the-harbour scheme? Obviously not, because it would be too embarrassing for the true extent of the abuse under the government's nod and wink approval of these schemes to be exposed—just too embarrassing. Of equal concern is the disturbing revelation from Second Commissioner Mike D'Ascenzo that the ATO still has not raised any assessments for around half of the revenue from participants in employee benefit arrangements identified so far by the ATO. When asked why, Second Commissioner D'Ascenzo replied:
Internally, we are trying to shift more resources in what is a very labour intensive exercise of trying to gather the facts and raise assessments.
This is the biggest tax scam since the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes of the seventies and only now are the ATO directing resources to the problem. Labor does not blame the ATO. This is the responsibility of the government. We know that, when it is a choice between stamping out tax abuse and protecting Liberal mates who profit from such schemes, Liberal mates will win each and every time at the expense of every other honest taxpayer.
How much money has been spent trying to convince ordinary Australians that that mongrel of a tax system designed by the Democrats and the government is worth while? It is failing, as we all know. Ordinary Australians are waking up to that. How many billions of dollars have been wasted on this change to try and make Australians pay extra tax on clothes, food and all those other things that have now been hit? The Democrats will say, `We got a couple of exemptions,' but they did it to us. How much money has been wasted in this situation? How many high roller exemptions have we got? Here is another form of a high roller exemption. Senator Allison knows that, when it comes to high roller exemptions, it might be a new year but we do not forget.
—That is right, Senator Allison. We are prepared to stand up and put a tax on high rollers at casinos. You were not, so don't come out with hypocrisy about Kerry Packer making a donation. We wanted to take $10 million from him, his family and the rest of the casino operators in this country. That is the amendment you knocked back. Don't try to talk about influence. Who phoned your office? Who leaned on the Democrats? We know Packer was on the phone to you.
—What?
—Good try.
—Absolutely. Don't sit there and ask: what? Why don't you ask the rest of your colleagues who Jamie Packer phoned? Then you will find out. You went belly up under a bit of pressure from the Packer family. Don't talk to us about a $100,000 donation in Victoria; we wanted to tax them $10 million, and that is where you let us down. And don't you start, Senator McGauran. You voted against it as well.
The ultimate responsibility to ensure that there are adequate resources to clamp down on tax avoidance schemes rests with this government, and this government has been willingly and wantonly neglecting its duty to close down Costello's bottom-of-the-harbour scheme. Labor believes that the final figure on contributions to these employee benefit schemes is considerably higher than the ATO estimates. While there is no doubt the ATO does know what the true figure is, the government will ensure that this figure is never made public. 
Despite this, there are estimates of the scale of the problem, such as that provided by Mr Michael Laurence in his Business Review Weekly article of 2 June last year. He suggested that $2 billion has been pumped into New Zealand superannuation, $500 million has been pumped into controlling shareholder superannuation and a further $500 million has gone into employee benefit trusts. Trusts is the magic word. Taxing trusts is like a wooden stake to a vampire. You have seen the National Party. You have seen the backbenchers out there trying to shaft their own deal, which they did with the Labor Party, to try to improve the taxation system, but taxing trusts is like a stake to a vampire to a National Party member and other members of this government. The $2 billion figure for New Zealand superannuation was also the figure used by tax expert Mr Hank Wamstecker on an investigation by Channel 9's Sunday program into the abuse of the EBAs. If these figures are correct, it is obvious that the total amount of superannuation contributions claimed as deductions through these schemes is around $3 billion. Given that it has been claimed that one promoter alone had channelled $2 billion through noncomplying superannuation schemes, the mind boggles at what the actual figure may be. Up to $5 billion is not inconceivable.
Labor is concerned that, with potentially $5 billion in contributions at stake and with acknowledgments that the employee benefit arrangement schemes were operating after 28 October 1998, the bill only proposes to change the law prospectively from 1 July 2000. Labor is therefore proposing to amend the bill so that it operates retrospectively to ensure the collection of the massive amount of tax that would otherwise have been paid if it were not for this government's wilful neglect in order to protect its mates. It is proposed that retrospectivity apply from 28 October 1998, the date that the ATO first released a draft public ruling which sought to clamp down on the abuse of employee benefit arrangements. This draft ruling was a clear statement by the ATO that this was how they believed the law applied to EBAs, bearing in mind that the ultimate arbiter of the application of the laws is the courts. The extent, though, and the degree of government complicity in the promotion of these schemes provide solid grounds for justifying retrospective application of this legislation which will go part of the way to closing down Costello's bottom-of-the-harbour scheme. 
The government and the ATO have consistently claimed that these schemes were always contrary to the law as it stands. It is just that they took no action to enforce their view. Given this, and if this claim is correct, there can be no harm from retrospective legislation. It is merely clarifying the position that both the ATO and the government have already claimed is the case. If the government opposes retrospectivity, then it is effectively saying that every EBA rort from the day it was elected until 30 June 2000 has had government approval. In other words, it is saying to its mates, `You've had your good four years of plundering the tax system, but unfortunately we have to be seen to be doing something even though we would prefer not to.'
Let me turn to the Australian Taxation Office system of private binding rulings. The Australian Taxation Office has around 1,750 officers who are able to give private binding rulings, yet it would appear that in the past there have been conflicting rulings and there has been no workable tracking system for these rulings. This has not only put the revenue base at risk but also resulted in taxpayers being treated inconsistently. Evidence to the Senate committee was that private binding rulings on employee benefit arrangement schemes were provided to taxpayers and promoters in which the ATO conceded the legality of these arrangements, yet simultaneously the ATO claimed in public evidence that it believed these arrangements were always contrary to the law. Talk about confusion. The ATO's left hand did not know what its right hand was doing. Mr Kevin Fitzpatrick from the tax office advised the Senate committee:
... we have certainly issued what we believe to be some incorrect advices, particularly over 1998 and 1999, in relation to controlling industry regulation arrangements. 
He continued his comments stating that these advices were `in our view contrary to the existing law'. They may have been contrary to the law, but it did not stop the tax office continuing to issue numerous favourable PBRs and advance opinions. Then we have in the ATO's own annual report the claim that these EBA schemes were `not effective under the existing law'. It is just a damn shame that the ATO have not taken one promoter or taxpayer to court to test this view. Why would they, when they were handing out favourable PBRs approving these schemes hand over fist? As stated previously, in October 1998 the tax office issued draft taxation ruling TR98/D12 which indicated their intention to apply fringe benefits tax to some forms of EBAs. These were said to include controlling interest superannuation schemes, offshore superannuation schemes, employee benefit trusts and employee benefit share plans. I move the following second reading amendment on behalf of the opposition:
At the end of the motion, add:
	""but the Senate condemns the Treasurer for not fulfilling his duty to clamp down on tax avoidance through the abuse of employee benefit arrangements and other tax avoidance schemes"".
(Time expired)",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTIONS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2001-02-07,"—The Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation Contributions) Bill 2000 is an anti-avoidance bill which has three key objectives. First, the bill clarifies the definition of eligible employee. This amendment puts beyond doubt the issues that an employing taxpayer and an eligible employee cannot be the same person and that no tax deduction would be possible. Second, the bill amends the tax act to deny deductions for employer superannuation contributions knowingly made to noncomplying superannuation funds. This particularly affects offshore funds. Third, the bill amends the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act to ensure that the exclusion of payments to superannuation funds from the term `fringe benefits' would apply only to payments made for the employee, not associates of the employee.
The first point clarifies the existing common law. The ATO is confident that it can defeat schemes in court, although the ALP says its record is puny with just $100 million in tax recovered from these schemes. The second point also clarifies the law and reinforces a ruling that the ATO made in 1999, but it goes further by absolutely prohibiting such payments. Some offshore funds had received private rulings supporting them because the ATO ruled that the payments were for retirement purposes, and this law will overturn those rulings. The third point is new policy to deal with schemes being marketed in the public and nonprofit sector. The bill is an attempt to address aggressive marketing of employee benefit arrangements. Tax commissioner Michael Carmody reported in November last year:
Variations of employee benefit arrangements continue to be developed and promoted despite the fact that we made it abundantly clear that we would tackle this sort of activity, including by using the general anti-avoidance provisions.
The tax office has advised the Democrats that they are confident that they could win any court challenge to defend any of these aggressively marketed employee benefit schemes, but this bill would make it clear for the future that such schemes simply cannot work.
Labor senators have argued that this bill is effectively needed to cover up the mess the ATO has made of giving private rulings to declare these schemes to be legal. They have moved to make the first leg of the bill, the change to the definition of `eligible employee', retrospective to October 1998 when the ATO issued a draft ruling on this topic. This, they say, would give the ATO legal protection in any court cases that arise out of aggressive marketing over the past two years. The government and the ATO are saying that this protection is unnecessary and that the amendment might hurt some funds which legally and validly utilise the existing law. The Democrats have always been very loath to support retrospective legislation. Such legislation may be supportable to combat clear tax avoidance where the law is unclear; however, we believe that retrospectivity should be supported only back to a clear statement of principle of what the law is intended to be.
In October 1998 the ATO released a draft ruling on the definition of `eligible employee' and other matters. However, the draft ruling did not necessarily deal directly with the issue dealt with in this bill, dealing primarily with the associate provisions of FBT law. A final ruling was issued on 19 May 1999. The tax commissioner also took the opportunity on that date to put out a detailed statement making it clear that the tax office, following a review of aggressively marketed employee benefit arrangements, had concluded that they were a clear attempt to frustrate the law, and would be defeated. Tax commissioner Michael Carmody said in that statement:
A Tax Office review of aggressively marketed employee benefit arrangements has found that many of these schemes are contrived arrangements that intend to frustrate the clear policy intent of the law. In our view these arrangements fail both at law and in their implementation.
	...	...	...
Far from securing the claimed benefits, it is the Tax Office's view that in their contrivance participants are exposing themselves to possible multiple taxing points and penalties.
That statement, in our view, provides a clear statement by the tax office of what its intentions were in terms of this area of law. It is a reasonable point at which this law should take effect. To take it back to a draft ruling on a related topic is simply, in our view, too uncertain. For that reason, when we come to the committee stage I will be moving to make the clarifying of the term `eligible employee' retrospective to 19 May 1999 rather than 30 June 2000. That will make it clear that, from the date the tax office announced the results of the review of these schemes and stated its clear view of the law, the law should stand. It will provide the element of legal protection that is appropriate, whilst also ensuring that retrospective legislation is used only to defend a clearly stated anti-avoidance stance.
The Democrats will not be supporting Labor's amendment making the law retrospective to 19 October 1998, as I have said. We are concerned about the abuse of employee benefit arrangements by aggressive tax planning marketeers. Such schemes and the need to address them brings the tax concessions for superannuation into disrepute. The Democrats will continue to support tax office efforts to stamp out tax evasion using contrived superannuation arrangements, whilst also defending legitimate use of tax concessions for retirement savings purposes.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTIONS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-02-07,"—We are dealing with the Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation Contributions) Bill 2000. On 30 June 2000 the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, announced legislation relating to superannuation and fringe benefits tax. This was designed to stop tax planners exploiting existing tax structures to maximise their clients' tax deductions through aggressively marketed employee benefit arrangements. When announcing the amendments contained in the bill, the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, explained the reasons for the government's actions:
This move is necessary following Tax Office advice that these arrangements are still being actively promoted. The arrangements have continued despite the Taxation Commissioner's clear advice that the schemes are ineffective under existing law.
We might well ask: why is the Senate dealing with changes to the law with respect to this area when the tax office says that they are, in fact, illegal? But more of that a little later.
As outlined in the explanatory memorandum to the bill and in the second reading speech, the intention of the bill is to achieve three main objectives: firstly, to defeat the abuse of controlling interest superannuation schemes by clarifying the definition of `eligible employee'; secondly, to defeat the abuse of offshore superannuation schemes by removing deductions for employer contributions knowingly made to non-complying superannuation funds, including non-resident superannuation funds; and, thirdly, to ensure that only superannuation contributions made on behalf of an employee, not an associate of an employee, are excluded from fringe benefits tax. In his speech, my colleague Senator Conroy pointed out in his usual incisive and enthusiastic manner that we are in fact dealing with legislation that represents a crackdown on one of the most significant tax avoidance schemes in the last decade. We are dealing here with a possible revenue size of $1½ billion up. As Senator Conroy said, the tax office has not finished counting.
In terms of clarifying the definition of `eligible employee', schedule 1 of the bill amends section 82AAA of the Income Tax Assessment Act to clarify the definition. Under the current legislation, `eligible employee' includes an individual who is an employee of a company in which a taxpayer, including an individual tax holder, holds a controlling interest. Currently, a taxpayer who holds a controlling interest in a company can claim a deduction for a contribution to a superannuation fund for an employee of the company, subject to certain limits which are varied over time. The intention of the amendment is to put beyond doubt that a taxpayer and an eligible employee cannot be the same person. Clearly, it would be absurd if this were allowable.
The second area, `Contributions to noncomplying superannuation funds' in schedule 1 of the bill, amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to deny deductions for employer superannuation contributions knowingly made to noncomplying superannuation funds. This includes funds that do not meet the government's criteria for concessional taxation treatment and nonresident superannuation funds. The Labor opposition has bipartisan agreement that this is an absolute abuse of noncomplying superannuation funds. To qualify as a complying superannuation fund, current legislation directs that the central management and control of the fund must be in Australia. The fund must also have at least one active member, and resident active members must hold 50 per cent of its accumulated entitlements.
Under the current law, contributions to noncomplying superannuation funds—both resident and nonresident—are deductible to employers and subject to FBT. The intention of this law is to ensure that these funds are not attractive in comparison to complying funds, which is the government and Labor opposition's preferred vehicle for retirement savings. Evidence suggests that some of the noncomplying funds domiciled overseas escape a number of tax obligations, including the contributions tax on superannuation and the so-called superannuation surcharge tax. When these funds are returned to Australia, the contributors pay no income tax. In other words, these noncomplying offshore superannuation funds are being used as a massive area for laundering money to avoid paying any tax whatsoever. This is clearly not the intention of either the government or the Labor opposition in respect to its retirement incomes policy and its retirement incomes framework.
It is very clear from the evidence presented to the committee that those taking advantage of these schemes are, overwhelmingly, higher income earners. The average lower to middle income earning Australian is not involved in the schemes. Legally, it is very difficult for them to even participate. To date, however, some tax planners have been marketing schemes as a complete tax wipe-out, using existing tax planning structures to maximise deductions while claiming that the FBT does not apply. This is a truly appalling situation. The amendment aims to ensure that superannuation contributions could be deductible only if made to a complying superannuation fund from 30 June 2000. This is because noncomplying funds have been judged as not having been used for retirement income purposes and not subject to prudential regulation.
In regard to the fringe benefit exemption for employee section, part 3 of schedule 1 of the bill amends the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 to ensure that the exclusion of payments to superannuation funds and retirement savings accounts from the term `fringe benefits' would apply only to payments made for the employee, not for associates of the employee. Clearly, it would be utterly absurd for associates of the employee to attract an exemption in this fringe benefit area when, in fact, the payments are being made on behalf of the employee. The government has claimed that business should slightly benefit from these measures by some reduction in ongoing compliance costs by virtue of greater simplicity and clarity. The Labor opposition is very sceptical of this claim. Everything the government has done with respect to superannuation—measure after measure—has made the tax system and the tax issues relating to superannuation more complex, not simpler.
As I mentioned earlier, this bill was introduced in an attempt to address aggressive marketing of employee benefit arrangements. On 20 June 2000, when announcing the amendments contained in the bill, the Assistant Treasurer explained the reasons for the government's actions in relation to the aggressively marketed employee benefit arrangements. This statement from Senator Kemp made it very clear that tax office advice was that these arrangements were being promoted. They are still being actively promoted; the arrangements have continued, despite the taxation commissioner's clear advice that the schemes are ineffective under existing law. In other words, the tax office and Senator Kemp claim that the schemes we are cracking down on in respect to this legislation are, in fact, illegal. It begs the question: why are we dealing with legislation to change the law when in fact the schemes are illegal anyway according to the tax office and Senator Kemp?
On 15 November 2000 in his speech to the Taxation Institute of Australia in Melbourne, the Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Michael Carmody, stated:
 variations of employee benefit arrangements continued to be developed and promoted, despite the fact we made it abundantly clear that we would tackle this sort of activity, including by using the general anti-avoidance provisions.
In May 1999 the first public ruling was issued. This appears to be consistent with the ATO's position as stated in its October 1998 draft ruling. In addition, the May 1999 ruling covers mass marketing of aggressive tax planning schemes. It also provides for exemptions for taxpayers who have received a private ruling. The draft ruling and the final ruling are somewhat different. They are available for senators to peruse in the Senate committee's report on this legislation.
In the statement that I referred to earlier, Commissioner Carmody asserted:
Our advice to Government to confirm the law relating to controlling interest superannuation arrangements was at least in part motivated by our desire to protect people to whom these arrangements continued to be aggressively marketed notwithstanding our clear position on them. The resulting proposed legislation is not a new anti-avoidance measure. It is confirmation of our view of the existing law, supported by counsel, that an employer and an employee cannot be the same person for the purposes of obtaining a deduction for superannuation purposes.
I pose the question again, as we have never had this satisfactorily answered: if it is an existing law, why are we changing the existing law if the existing law prevents this tax laundering from going on? We would like an answer from Senator Kemp with respect to that central point.
The committee held hearings and we had evidence presented to us by the Australian Taxation Office. The total contributions by clients to promoters of employee benefit arrangements was around $1.5 billion, with about $500 million claimed in relation to superannuation arrangements. Of these, $100 million was related to offshore funds. These are amounts identified so far, with some auditing still to be completed. We heard evidence from the Australian Transactions Reports and Analysis Centre, AUSTRAC, which provides a data analysis platform to the Australian Taxation Office. It confirmed that the number of international fund transactions increases every year—obviously, many of those legitimate. AUSTRAC's submission records that the number and value of international fund transfer instructions reported to AUSTRAC have increased by more than 30 per cent over the last five years. There would appear to be a potential for a continued and growing incidence of revenue loss by a deliberate abuse of the system if the law is not clarified.
The Labor Party does have some concerns about this legislation and about the policy process leading up to the introduction of this bill. We have concerns about the explanation and the evidence provided by the government and the ATO concerning aspects of the bill, the lack of cooperation with the committee by promoters of these schemes, the claimed financial impact of the legislation, the prospective operation of the legislation and the lack of legislative action by the government against other employee benefit arrangements which involve massive tax avoidance. Firstly, in respect of the reporting date, this legislation was urgent. The Labor Party believes it is urgent and should be passed as quickly as possible. We could not get to it late last year, but the Senate committee was presented with an extremely tight deadline. We held three hearings over, I think, three days, including six hours of questioning to the tax office. A very unrealistic reporting date was forced on the committee by the government. There were limited opportunities to examine witnesses on the issues covered by the bill, and this has raised serious questions regarding the widespread tax avoidance practices and the inactivity of the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, and the government, in particular, in curbing these practices. 
In addition, we are concerned that the ATO has consistently not made available the witnesses requested by the Labor Party. The result is that there are some unanswered questions by the ATO that we will be pursuing at another time. In addition, material in the possession of the Labor opposition appears to conflict with the evidence provided by some ATO witnesses. As I said earlier, hopefully we will be holding some further examination on some of these issues. The evasive behaviour practised on some occasions before the committee is consistent with the recent practice of the government and the ATO regarding tax avoidance. We do not blame the ATO or the public servants; we blame the minister fair and square. The Assistant Treasurer is responsible for tax administration and it is his responsibility, not the ATO's. 
At least one new issue emerged, and that was the lack of adequate resources and the pretence that the government makes that it has allocated sufficient resources to deal with the enforcement of the existing law. One example of this is the extraordinary and disturbing claim made by Second Commissioner D'Ascenzo that the ATO has still not raised assessments for around half of the revenue from participants in employee benefit arrangements identified so far by the ATO. Indeed, of approximately half of the identified revenue that have had assessments issued, less than half of the money has been raised—that is, less than one-quarter of the outstanding revenue identified has been collected. Many of these arrangements relate to schemes dating back several years. Labor senators find this practice of not collecting tax, which the ATO claims is clearly payable under the current law, very disturbing. This is an obvious indication of this government's and, in particular, this minister's total lack of commitment to providing the ATO with the necessary resources to collect moneys that should be collected on behalf of the Australian community.
The position of the government contains fundamental contradictions. It claims that the two major tax avoidance schemes covered by this bill that we are considering today—namely, controller superannuation schemes and non-complying superannuation schemes—are not legal, they are ineffective in law. Despite this claim, the bill amends the law to make it consistent with the intention of parliament. Claiming that there is no revenue flowing from this bill is simply not credible and is rejected by the Labor Party. Why are we changing the existing law if it is sound and if, in fact, the schemes we are considering are illegal? It is a fundamental contradiction. What is even more alarming is that the Australian Taxation Office has given numerous rulings, including to tax scheme promoters, that clearly indicate an ATO policy on matters covered in the bill that are a direct contradiction of the ATO's current claims. The tax office has been issuing private binding rulings which are contrary to the existing law. Mr Kevin Fitzpatrick said:
We acknowledge we have made some incorrect advices over a period of time, in our view contrary to existing law. 
Mr Kevin Fitzpatrick, First Assistant Commissioner, admitted that the tax office has made private binding rulings in contradiction of the existing law when we have at risk at least $1½ billion of revenue. If these arrangements are illegal, if they are not in accordance with the intention of superannuation law and retirement income practices, a bipartisan policy of both the Liberal government and the Labor opposition, it begs the question of why these changes that are being considered today are not being made retrospective until at least the date at which the tax office made its preliminary ruling on this matter. 
The Labor Party amendment that we will be dealing with during the committee stage will make these changes retrospective to that date. After all, these are schemes that are apparently illegal. These are schemes that should never have existed in the first place. Therefore, Labor strongly believes—and this is only on rare occasions—that these changes to the law should be made retrospective. After all, why should a relatively small number, a couple of thousand, of high income earners manage to avoid all tax on noncomplying offshore superannuation payments? Why should this relatively small number of high wealth Australians not pay superannuation contributions tax, the so-called superannuation surcharge tax? They transfer it offshore, and then they bring it back and do not pay income tax. This is an absolutely appalling situation that I do not think 99 per cent of Australians would even think of doing, let alone be able to access. Why should this be allowed to be legal for the last couple of years? Why shouldn't this be made retrospective so that this money could be collected? It is only fair and equitable that this should occur.
We are concerned about the ATO evidence, because we believe that the stated figures of $1½ billion may in fact understate the real level of funds involved. Indeed, one witness estimated that one individual firm is known to have put $2 billion into offshore New Zealand superannuation funds. So, in conclusion, the government has a number of questions to answer with respect to this legislation.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2001-02-07,"—I rise to speak on the Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation Contributions) Bill 2000. To put it in context, the issue at hand really comes to a fine point with the amendment moved by Senator Cook on behalf of the opposition in relation to this bill, which reads:
But the Senate condemns the Treasurer for not fulfilling his duty to clamp down on tax avoidance through the abuse of employee benefit arrangements and other tax avoidance schemes.
As we have heard from Senator Sherry, we could perhaps add the Assistant Treasurer to that list as well. The bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. It also amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 and the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986. We are told that it is designed not to fix, but to clarify, the definition of `eligible employee', to deny deductions for employer superannuation contributions knowingly made to noncomplying superannuation funds and to ensure that only those contributions made on behalf of an employee are excluded from fringe benefits tax. It is interesting to note that it also includes those that are knowingly made. Of course, with the use of the word `knowingly' there is an intention to circumscribe those people who are caught within this circle. We will come to why we say that retrospectivity in this instance should be adopted shortly.
This area in relation to the Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation Contributions) Bill 2000 is generally referred to as employee benefit arrangements, or EBAs. This particular measure, although highlighted as a clarifying bill, is really much more than this. The Assistant Treasurer announced this bill on 30 June 2000. It was announced as an amendment to address aggressively marketed employee benefit arrangements. The bill will remove, as stated in the press release, the deductibility for contributions to noncomplying superannuation funds, including offshore arrangements. As it seems clear now, these schemes were not used for retirement income purposes. We are told that the bill also clarifies the law so as to make clear that, for the purposes of obtaining a deduction for superannuation contributions, an employer and an employee cannot be the same person. The critical issue in this press release by the Assistant Treasurer, not the Treasurer, is that it operates from 4 p.m. on 30 June 2000. In addition, the press release also highlights further work. It says:
Senator Kemp has asked the Tax Office to review the interaction of the income tax and fringe benefits tax laws to ensure that employee benefit trusts and employee share plans are taxed appropriately.
There are, of course, more than just superannuation issues in the EBAs; there are also benefit trusts and share plans. However, the government believes, as we understand it, that the schemes are nothing short of tax avoidance arrangements, as it seems is claimed in the Assistant Treasurer's press release. The press release itself states that these arrangements, however, are still being actively promoted. The government seems to be short on doing something about that. The arrangements have continued, despite the taxation commissioner's advice that the schemes are ineffective under existing law.
Perhaps that partly comes to the difficulty I have. When you read the Assistant Treasurer's press release, it talks about a clarifying amendment. The explanatory memorandum also stresses that it is a clarifying bill. However, it does so in a way which seems contradictory, because it says `despite the Commissioner's clear advice that the schemes are ineffective under existing law'. If the schemes are ineffective under existing law, we would expect the Commissioner of Taxation to do something about it other than just seeking clarifying legislation. So with much fanfare, once shown the problem, this government moves to close it—but does it do this quickly, effectively and fairly? I think not. 
Probably the most difficult part of the whole issue is: what about taxation avoidance prior to 4 p.m. on 30 June 2000? Is the Commissioner of Taxation going to pursue these under the current legislation, without the benefit of `clarifying amendments'? This government can do something to prevent tax avoidance. It can seek to backdate the bill to a date when the matter was first identified by the commissioner, Mr Carmody, as needing to be addressed. As I said earlier, the bill also seeks to stop contributions to noncomplying superannuation funds from being deducted for tax purposes. The unanswered question is: why is there no retrospectivity in this area? 
The third area that the bill amends will impose fringe benefits tax on the superannuation contributions made for a taxpayer's associate. Labor supports these measures, given that they are designed to close tax avoiders down. However, it appears to be too little, too late. The measures—and perhaps some more—should have been introduced years ago, given the tale that has unfolded during the course of the second reading debate. It seems that, conservatively, the Australian Taxation Office had advice at least in September 1998 that these marketed schemes were not only about but also in need of a legislative response to close off tax avoidance schemes in this area. 
A fair question might be: how much revenue has been potentially forgone since that time and as at 30 June 2000? It may be excusable for the government not to act if the amounts were trivial; however, evidence suggests that this is not the case. The figure is, as I understand it, on the conservative side of $1.5 billion—and, as we have heard from Senator Sherry, there could be an additional $2 billion. These are weighty figures indeed. This would seem to be, at least in my view, worth pursuing. Why has the government failed to act? That is the question that needs to be asked. One could ask whether they are defending the big end of town. We could wait for their response as to whether or not that is a legitimate reason. They might say, `These marketing schemes are for the big end of town and we are happy for it to profit from them.' Perhaps the schemes were for shop assistants or mechanics, but it seems very doubtful that they participated in these schemes.
Senator Kemp's press release also states that the tax office would conduct a review of the interaction of the income tax and fringe benefits tax files to ensure that employee benefits trusts and employee share plans are taxed appropriately. What has happened since 30 June 2000? This is a question we certainly will be pursuing during the committee stage of this bill. If there are other mass marketed schemes which are nothing short of tax avoidance schemes existing in employee share plans or employee benefit trusts, what does this government intend to do about it? Do we wait and wait and then find we have prospective legislation after we have waited for a significant amount of time, once again letting, by mere conjecture, billions slip into the back pocket of the big end of town? And then do we end up with the same position again where we have to seek amendments to the legislation so that it can be made retrospective? Perhaps Senator Kemp can provide an answer as to what is being done in relation to not only superannuation contributions, tax avoiders and these aggressively marketed schemes, but also share plans and employee benefit trusts. I am unconvinced that the answer will stand up to close scrutiny. If this is the case, why isn't Mr Carmody announcing wide ranging action against marketers and users of these schemes now? 
It seems that the Australian Taxation Office has claimed back $100 million, and it claims that another $140 million is still outstanding. However, the evidence suggests that this figure should be a little higher. It seems that the tax commissioner may need a 100 per cent increase in output. The tax office draft ruling of 28 October 1998 should have put everyone on notice. Clearly, it only caused a stampede. However, it seems the government is not ready to round them up yet. It has caught a few stragglers. It has caught $100 million, but there is a large amount not caught within the net. Labor's foreshadowed amendment seeks to bring that net a little wider to ensure that the tax avoiders are thrown in. 
Presently, the House has only one aspect of the generic title of employee benefit arrangements, or EBAs, before it. There are, as I said earlier, four main areas associated with EBAs: two types of superannuation, employee share schemes and employee benefit trusts. The government has clearly been aware for some time of the operation of these types of schemes. It has been aware that strategies have been employed to put such schemes in the marketplace. As stated earlier, a lot of these practices should have been subject to an enormous amount of scrutiny from at least the time of the draft ruling. 
EBA is not an acronym I like to use, because I think it hides how evil these schemes are. In truth, their main purpose—or at least, it seems, one of their objectives—is to increase the remuneration for people who conduct their financial interests through their control. It is not for the run-of-the-mill worker; it seems to be only for the wealthy—those people who can control their financial assets and pour it into themselves. For example, a taxpayer may control or own a company. The company diverts money to a taxpayer who is also an employee of the company. In some instances, it could be the same person. The taxpayer, or the employee, then makes a contribution to a superannuation fund and claims a deduction for the contribution. It can also be made to either a complying or a noncomplying fund, to add a double twist. It may not sit there and accumulate for retirement. All the time the objective—as can be seen from the transactions above—is to transfer money from the company to the benefit of the employee of the company whilst avoiding any tax that would accrue to it. The run-of-the-mill employee does not have this available to them.
The purpose of schemes that are marketed in this fashion, or derivatives of them, seems to be to avoid any tax liability for the employee or FBT liability for the employer. On the plus side, if you can call it a plus side, it generates a tax deduction for the contributor. So there is a double whammy in there for the company by giving it a leg-up. The underlying question is: why is this allowed to continue? It is only after many years that this government is trying to clarify the legislation rather than bringing in legislation that not only will be retrospective but also will fix the area.
The validity and the promotion of such schemes have grown around the private binding rulings. It is quite a strange area. As I understand it, through a complicated set of circumstances—but not so complicated that marketeers of the schemes could not work their way through it—the private binding rulings, once favoured by the ATO in relation to these EBAs, are now out of favour. I can only suggest that they were perhaps a little too complicated for the ATO, but it would be remiss of me to say that. The real problem that arises is that, if companies or marketed schemes hold a private binding ruling advising that a certain arrangement is fine in respect of the ATO, it can be used as a template to create many more, which can also be mass marketed and used to continue these aggressively marketed schemes.
Private binding rulings take precedence over draft and final public rulings. On 19 May 1999, as earlier stated, the draft ruling was replaced by a final ruling. The crux of the problem is that the tax office over time—who knows: perhaps under work pressures or time pressures—has shifted its position from agreeing to the schemes under the concept of a private binding ruling to a position where it has a serious problem with these schemes. This raises the ugly problem of what to do about it. The ATO and the Assistant Treasurer need to face up to their responsibilities. The legislation that allowed marketed schemes to be done aggressively—and for purposes which seem plain to me—should be fixed retrospectively. In this instance, the government is not trying to close the loophole; it is merely trying to ensure that it does not get any bigger. One wonders whether or not it is succeeding even on that issue.
In the short time I have available, there two matters in respect of the report on the Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation Contributions) Bill 2000 by the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services which the government can address. The government should look at the recommendations of the committee and the recommendations in the Labor senators' minority report. On the first page of the minority report, serious concerns were identified. Without going into them in great detail, the report states concerns about the policy process leading up to the introduction of the bill. There were concerns about the explanation of evidence provided by the government and the ATO on aspects of the bill. There were concerns about the lack of cooperation with the committee by promoters of these schemes. There were problems with the claimed financial impact of the legislation. We have been told that the claimed financial impact of the legislation is negligible, which does not sit well with the $1.5 billion that has been uncovered. 
We looked at the other areas that were highlighted. The report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Workplace Relations, Shared endeavours: the inquiry into employee share ownership in Australian enterprises, also uncovered problems with this aspect. The Labor members recommended—and the opposition will press the government to pick up their recommendations and run with them—that the ATO be required to provide updated estimates of the revenue involved in the abuse of employee benefit arrangements by company executives. The minority report also recommended that legislation against these schemes be implemented without further delay. That is the crux of the matter.

"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2001-02-07,"—I rise in this debate this afternoon on the Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation Contributions) Bill 2000 to support the second reading amendment moved by Labor and of course to support the bill. Labor has clearly indicated the need to support the bill because of the revelations that have come about as a result of the minister's press release of 30 June and because of the investigations made by the ATO. I will refer just briefly to the minister's statement of 30 June because I then want to examine the context of the process of what has happened, because I think that is terribly important in this particular matter. Whilst it was alluded to by you, Mr Acting Deputy President Sherry, when you made your contribution, I think it is something that needs to be trawled over just for a short time because there is a problem that seems to be emerging not just in this committee but in other committees of this parliament, and that is the amount of time that committees have available to them to consider very important issues and very crucial issues indeed.
If you look at the minister's statement of 30 June, when announcing amendments to the bill, according to the report of the committee, the Assistant Treasurer explained the reasons for the government's action in relation to the aggressively marketed employee benefit arrangements and stated:
The move is necessary following Tax Office advice that these arrangements are still being actively promoted.
While this has been quoted here earlier in this debate this afternoon, that is a very key phrase by the Assistant Treasurer. The schemes were `still being actively promoted'—not just promoted but `actively promoted'. In other words, there was a very determined effort on the part of the promoters out there to keep these schemes going, in spite of what the Australian Taxation Office had been saying and in spite of other statements that had been made in the circles around the business community. 
The statement went on to say:
The arrangements have continued despite the Taxation Commissioner's clear advice that the schemes are ineffective under existing law.
That was made, rightly, by the Assistant Treasurer on 30 June. The next thing we know, the government have taken action and presented a bill to the House of Representatives on 7 September. I did not exactly trace the progress of the bill, but the bill was then finally referred in the Senate to a committee on 1 November for report by 4 December. That was a fairly constrained timetable indeed. Really, for an issue which was of great importance to both the government and the opposition to pursue so as to discover the underlying problems associated with this particular rort that was being pulled, one found there was a very tight schedule indeed given to the committee for it to be able to consider the vital issues that were at stake.
As you, Mr Acting Deputy President Sherry, said in your contribution, the committee did meet on Monday, 27 November. You did not actually list the dates of the meetings, but you mentioned it met three times. But the committee found on that occasion that it ran out of time to pursue the issue, particularly with officers of the Australian Taxation Office. That should not in any way be construed as a criticism of the ATO officers because I think they were very cooperative in the whole process. But what became apparent was that there was more time needed, and more time was sought at a time when the Senate itself was sitting.
So we had the select committee meeting on a further two occasions: on Wednesday, 29 November and on Thursday, 30 November. But, because of the tight time frame involved in the process, there were a number of people or organisations who declined to appear before the committee. I think that is unfortunate in itself, and also it was not possible to get the main players in this particular scene before the committee—that is, the promoters. There was no opportunity to get the promoters to come before the committee so that the committee could gain greater evidence on this. At the end of the day, the committee—and Labor—acknowledged the importance of the urgency of this, and the committee did bring down its report in December. I am sure the committee reported by the appropriate date, which was 4 December. But even then, at the end of that reporting period, the legislation itself was not dealt with in that week. That is not a criticism, but it would have been nice if the committee had had that extra time to pursue some matters that were of interest to it to further clarify its report.
The net result is that there are still outstanding issues—which the committee will not pursue, of course, as part of a reference of this Senate because the reference has now closed—but the committee may have available to it the opportunity for private briefings and so on, which is good in itself. On important issues such as this—and there was a degree of urgency, and still is, and that is the reason for Labor's cooperation in this process—I ask the government to give real consideration to the amount of time that is available for committees to consider the propositions that are being referred to them by this Senate. I think that is very important indeed, particularly when one considers that the Assistant Treasurer made his statement on 30 June and that the legislation—and I understand there is a process of preparing the legislation—was presented in the House of Representatives on 7 September but was not referred to the appropriate Senate committee until 1 November.
It might suit some people to have an accelerated timetable and process in these things. It is not just a criticism of what happened in this instance; it is a concern that has been growing for me where a number of committees find themselves having in a very truncated process to consider some very detailed matters before them. Without belabouring the point, I think there is a need for that to be considered in the future when these matters come before this chamber.
The importance of this issue is signified in the address in the report of the committee at paragraph 1.3.5 where it was noted that on 15 November in his speech to the Taxation Institute of Australia in Melbourne the Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Michael Carmody, stated:
Variations of employee benefit arrangements continue to be developed and promoted, despite the fact we made it abundantly clear that we would tackle this sort of activity, including by using the general anti-avoidance provisions.
As late as 15 November, the Taxation Commissioner—in spite of the statement of the Assistant Treasurer on 30 June—was still having these protestations about the use that, unfortunately, was being made of these schemes for the advantage of the few and not the benefit of the many. That has been the whole thing about these schemes. They have promoted benefit for the few, as has been pointed out by my colleagues Senator Sherry, Senator Conroy and Senator Ludwig in their contributions. 
Superannuation is a very important issue for me and it is one that I highlighted in my very first speech in this chamber. It delivers security in retirement to people. These schemes that have been a part of the employee benefit arrangements have done nothing more than deliver extra remuneration, as noted in the report, for people who are able to establish arrangements through their control or association with various corporate entities. That was the problem with this particular set of arrangements under the employee benefit arrangements. The people were using it to get a benefit for themselves. They were at the same time bringing into disrepute what is probably one of the most important entitlements that employees and workers have gained over the last 50 years. That is, they gained the right to universal superannuation through the three per cent award superannuation and then through the superannuation guarantee. These schemes have detracted from the importance of superannuation for people in retirement and have led to the piece of legislation that appears before us today.
The amendment in the name of Senator Cook hits the nail right on the head because it goes to the abuse that has been made of these employee benefit arrangements in avoiding taxation. Limiting people's liability to pay tax only shifts the burden onto those who do not have the capacity to rearrange their financial affairs. The amendment by Senator Cook, moved by Senator Conroy, is worthy of support in that it highlights the problem that employee benefit arrangements have caused for this government. The fact that we are supporting this legislation today highlights our design to get rid of the rort that now is in place.
In saying that, I just want to turn also to the submissions made by the Australian Taxation Office in appearing before the committee. I think the opening statement by the ATO, tabled on 27 November before the committee, really sums up the problems that existed that we needed to get rid of. The statement talks of offshore marketing arrangements in particular. It said:
...when the Government announced these changes, it indicated that it is amending the law because of the continued marketing of these arrangements by some promoters despite clear, public advice from the ATO that they failed both at law and in their implementation.
I think that gets to the point that Senator Sherry raised: if that was the view, then why are we amending the legislation? Given the spirit of what we are trying to do, and the need to do it, we are supporting the legislation. The statement goes on:
Normal practice is that, once the ATO states its view on the law, the promotion of aggressive tax planning arrangements generally ceases.
This did not occur in this instance and some promotion activity continued.
It is interesting that in the minority report which Senator Sherry signed on behalf of the Labor senators—that is, Senator Conroy and me—it was noted at page 27 that evidence by the ATO revealed that relatively few people or entities were involved in this. There were 2,400 participants in controlling interest superannuation schemes and 220 participants in offshore noncomplying funds. We are not looking at a large number of participants and yet, in spite of the statement by Senator Kemp and the warnings by the Australian Taxation Office, we still had aggressive marketing by the promoters of these schemes. This was a tragedy indeed. It therefore gets to the heart of why we should go back to 28 October 1998 when the draft ruling of the ATO first came out on this matter that the legislation should be retrospective. 
We are not looking at a large group of people; we are looking at a limited range of people who participated in both the controlling interest superannuation schemes and in the offshore noncomplying funds. If this legislation is designed to tighten up the loopholes and to tighten up the tax avoidance that has taken place, then I urge both the Democrats—and I heard Senator Allison's contribution to this—and the government to look seriously at the proposal that has been circulated in this chamber that Senator Conroy will move, I understand, when we go into committee. I think that that will show these people once and for all the seriousness of dealing with these sorts of attempts to rort the system. 
The ATO went on to say in their opening statement:
... because of this continued marketing we advised the government in June 2000 that the legislative changes would be appropriate ...
They also went on to say:
... the arrangements being promoted, it seems to us, were more to do with seeking tax benefits than any retirement income purpose.
That is why I made the point about the need for superannuation to be viewed specifically as something to give people security in their retirement. I think that we would be deluding ourselves to believe that these people were not in it for any other reason than to make a quick buck for themselves, to use whatever was available to them by way of financial schemes to feather their own financial nests. 
At the end of the day, we now have this legislation before us. I think that the recommendation made in the Labor senators' minority report to backdate the operation of this legislation, whilst drastic, is important. If people do not understand that they cannot get away with these schemes, of course they will try again on any occasion that comes before them to pervert the laws of this nation. Given the special nature and importance of superannuation for people in their retirement, when most people do not have available to them the means and mechanism to utilise the employee benefit arrangements that these people have obviously used, I think a clear message has to be sent home to the people who have abused the system on this occasion.
In conclusion—and I see my time is almost up—I would like to go back to the point I made at the very outset. The process in this was important. I commend the government for what they have done but I do not believe that, when the committee had this matter referred to it, there really was sufficient time to successfully consider all the matters that it needed to consider. I commend the second reading amendment and also Senator Conroy's further amendment that will be made in the committee stage of this bill.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTIONS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2001-02-07,"—I rise to conclude the second reading debate on this important bill. I listened, as I always do, with some interest to the contributions that were made and, as usual, they varied considerably in quality. On this side of the chamber we regard you, Senator Hogg, as a serious contributor, as someone who thinks about issues. I do not say that you are the only one but there are perishing few, I have to say, who think about issues to the extent that one is able, in a highly politicised context, to seek to work through issues. 
In relation to a number of other individuals who made speeches during the second reading debate—Senator Sherry and Senator Conroy—I could not make that comment in all honesty. I fear I would be struck down if I suggested that. I think I am well known for not seeking to score cheap political points—
—No, no!
—Thank you, Senator. I listened with interest to your concerns about proper scrutiny of a bill. You recognise the importance of this bill and that we need to get this bill through—and that is all correct. The committee, I understand, had some three days of hearings, which for many bills is quite a long period of time—
—They were not days—
—On three occasions—I correct myself.
—and there were difficulties.
—I understand that. Thank you, Senator. You did have a chance to make a contribution, and I did say I listened to you. It is not atypical. There is always some pressure on committees. When I was in opposition, the government was very keen to make sure its legislation got through. We were often confined—typically, I suspect—to one day at the most. There was a so-called Friday committee where we would consider these matters. Frankly, I think a committee that is able to meet on three occasions has been given a chance to examine the bill.
But, Senator Hogg, the point I would make is that the problem with the committee hearings was that a number of senators did not want to consider matters which were relevant to the bill. They ranged far and wide in their considerations. So when I listen to you and you plead for more time and proper consideration, my response is that the trouble is that your colleagues Senator Sherry and Senator Conroy were more interested in scoring political points than examining the content of the bill. In conclusion, I would say that you should help cast the mote from the Labor Party eye on this. You will then find that the committee hearings are more relevant and we can deal with aspects of the bill. But I do not think you can expect the government to have huge sympathy for you when they see the committee system being stretched unreasonably to cover issues which are not particular to the bill. I think I am fair in saying that this is precisely what occurred in the committee hearings.
The measures are being introduced to stop the continued promotion of tax planning arrangements which seek to obtain tax benefits far greater than those intended by the parliament. To summarise, the bill comprises three measures: the clarification of the meaning of `eligible employee', the removal of deductions for contributions to noncompliant superannuation funds and the exclusion of superannuation contributions from fringe benefits tax only when they are made for employees.
When I announced these measures, I indicated that the law required amendment because of the continued marketing of these arrangements by some promoters. This was despite clear public advice from the ATO that they fail both in law and in their implementation. The first measure puts it beyond doubt that a taxpayer cannot be an employee of themselves. This has long been a position in common law. In relation to the second measure, by denying deductions to noncompliant superannuation funds, their attractiveness as a tax avoidance vehicle is removed. This is the most effective way to stop the promotion of these schemes. By allowing deductions only for contributions to complying superannuation funds, the community can have certainty that the tax concessions will be used to provide a retirement income. The third measure ensures that only contributions on behalf of employees are exempt from fringe benefits tax. This ensures that a select group of the community cannot unreasonably reduce their income tax obligations. Arguments have been raised that the legislation should apply retrospectively. The government's view is that retrospective law should be used only as a last resort. That is the position which this government holds and I suspect is one that is held generally around the chamber.
Let me make it clear that the government are advised that the ATO believes the law operates in a way that is effective in dealing with abusive arrangements. This view is supported by a senior counsel and other expert opinions and exposes some participants to multiple taxing points. The second and third measures in the bill involve an adjustment to policy. Accordingly, making those measures retrospective would impact on genuine arrangements which were entered into consistent with the law as it then applied. For these reasons, the government do not believe that a compelling argument has been made for retrospectivity. Clearly, this has been considered by the government. Clearly, we have been mindful of the advice that the Taxation Office has received, and this is the reason why the government have proceeded in this direction.
Employee benefit arrangements identified by the ATO to date involve contributions of some $1.3 billion. The ATO is continuing to identify participants in these arrangements. It was on this basis, I understand, that an estimate of $1.5 billion in contributions—and I stress `contributions'—in such schemes was calculated. I am advised that the ATO has no reliable basis on which to revise this estimate. The final figure will of course depend on the cases ultimately identified. There was some discussion about the sums involved in this matter.
The ATO's estimate of revenue—and this is important, because I think this figure has been quite seriously misused on a number of occasions; one suspects it was for political motives but, for whatever motives, it has been misused—in respect of the estimated $1.5 billion in contributions is in the order of $600 million. Recovery of tax is not solely dependent on the outcome of court cases, and I stress this. The ATO expects that the majority of participants in these arrangements will accept the ATO's position or otherwise settle. The ATO therefore expects to recover most of the tax involved.
We have dealt with Senator Hogg's view that this legislation was rushed through. I pointed out to Senator Hogg that there was plenty of time for consideration of the bill and that Labor senators wandered far and wide. I think that was a pity. From the government's point of view, it was somewhat ironic that the Labor Party continued to demand that we take action. We brought the bill in, wanted to have it passed last session and, as a result of Labor Party pressure, were not able to get that through.
—No, that is not true. We have been very cooperative. You are endangering the cooperative spirit.
—Oh dear. If that is called cooperation, I would be interested to know how we define `obstruction'. It was a pity that we did not get this bill through in the last session, and we could easily have had time to do it. There was an implication in some of the second reading contributions that the government have been soft on tax avoidance. This is something we totally reject. As Senator Sherry knows, some of the Labor Party are now supporting the GST and will undoubtedly be telling us how effective it is in combating the black economy.
—Do you like our roll-back?
—Senator Sherry, I am not sure you are allowed to use the word `roll-back'.
—Yes, roll-back of tax.
—I see. We are changing the word `roll-back', are we? There we are. There was a ban on `roll-back' on your side.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—Order!
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I did hear Senator Sherry out in absolute silence. I defy anyone to say that when Senator Sherry was speaking I interjected in any way.
—You invited comment!
—Order, Senator Sherry. I have not invited comment. That is all you need to worry about.
—If Senator Sherry were aware of it, he would also point out that I was not in the chamber then. I mentioned one area. Even before tax reform, the government were taking substantial action to combat tax avoidance. As early as July 1996, just months after coming into government, we acted to end the abuse of R&D syndication arrangements. Senator Sherry can correct me if I am wrong: I think the Labor Party opposed our closing down that rort. Later that year, we closed down a loophole in the cap on deductions for depreciation on luxury cars. That was an issue Senator Sherry and I debated at some length.
The revenue cost of the R&D syndication and other 1996 R&D schemes was estimated at some $2 billion over four years. That throws into context some of the concerns that people had at that time. There is not the time to list in this debate all the anti-avoidance measures introduced in 1997 but I could mention the closure of the infrastructure bond scheme, the extension of the anti-avoidance provisions of tax order withholding tax and the tightening of the thin capitalisation rules. Without action on the infrastructure bonds—which, Senator Sherry, you would agree was an initiative of the former government—I am advised that the potential revenue cost would have been up to $4 billion or more over three years. What a dramatic sum from schemes closed down by this government! In 1998-99, the government moved against trust losses, non-commercial loans to shareholders and artificially created capital losses and introduced the final package of measures to prevent trading in franking credits and dividend streaming.
The solution to tax avoidance is not always more legislation. The government has funded various anti-avoidance programs in the tax office, such as the High Wealth Individuals Program, and has agreed to appropriations—this is of some interest in the light of the comments that Senator Ludwig made—which cover other anti-avoidance programs such as the engagement of special counsel to try tax avoidance cases. The record shows that the government has moved very firmly on tax avoidance schemes—not always, I regret to say, with the cooperation of the Labor Party. That is a pity. Sometimes, as Senator Sherry knows, the Labor Party in this chamber has acted in a different way on these issues to the Labor Party in the other chamber. That has caused concern in the wider community. But we are in blazing agreement that this bill should go through.
In the light of my comments, it would be pretty obvious that the government will not be accepting the second reading amendment to the bill. We will not be accepting the other amendments to the bill for the retrospectivity reasons which I proposed. Nonetheless, let me just point out that the amendment proposed by the Democrats is perhaps less offensive to good principles than the measure being moved by the Labor Party. I hope we can now speed the journey, have this bill finally passed by this chamber and give a clear message to people who seek to rort our tax system.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTIONS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2001-02-07,"—by leave—I was not aware that there was a second reading amendment at the time I made my contribution in the debate on the second reading. I would like to indicate that the Democrats will not be supporting the ALP second reading amendment. It is disingenuous and, indeed, hypocritical of the ALP to suggest this amendment. To condemn the government for not clamping down on tax avoidance in a tax avoidance bill, for one thing, seems to me to be rather ludicrous. If it had been something the ALP had been calling for themselves for some time then perhaps I could understand it but, looking at the history of this issue, it is clear that these tax avoidance schemes were around in the late eighties. In fact, the ATO put out rulings in favour of these arrangements in 1992. If this amendment were amended to include the Treasurer of the previous government then perhaps we would be inclined to support it. On the whole, I think it is unnecessary and a bit irrelevant. The Democrats will not be supporting it.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2001-02-07,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I wish to speak to the Anglo-Australian Observatory Annual Report 1999-2000, including the Auditor-General's report—section 19 of the Anglo-Australian Telescope Agreement Act 1970. Just briefly, I cannot agree more with the statement on page 5 of this report, in the second chapter, which says:
Astronomy excites the imagination of scientist and layperson alike and, although it gives no immediate tangible return, it provides an important framework for many of the major ideas that underpin our society.
I think that probably sums up science and technological advances in general. There is no doubt that certainly this government and other governments hold firm as a central plank of their economic platforms the notion that science and technological discoveries will bring with them increased income, better lifestyles, wealth, prosperity and certainly solutions to those problems of today and tomorrow, be they environmental or any other. Certainly astronomy may not seem to give a tangible result, as referred to in the report, but it is an exciting pursuit and one that Australia has a fine record in. If people look at this report in more detail, they will see reflections on some of the highlights of the Anglo-Australian Observatory over the past year, such as looking into telescope operations, research, instrumentation, AAO resources and, of course, their external communications.
Not only do these discoveries underpin our lifestyle and our society, as referred to in the report; but I think they also cause us to reflect on some announcements that have been made by the government in the last week or so. I refer specifically to the announcement by the Prime Minister of the government's response to the Innovation Summit's working group. The Prime Minister's innovation statement took into account some, not all, of the recommendations contained in the Miles review and the Batterham review, and they all said the same thing: we must ensure adequate resourcing of science, research and development and ICT industries. Of course, underpinning all of this is education and training. 
So you can imagine the concern, shock and horror of the Australian Democrats on discovering that, while the government has talked about an R&D increase of 175 per cent for some areas—that is, additional research by some industries—perhaps 90 per cent of currently eligible projects may no longer be eligible under the new criteria. That is because the criteria include a need to satisfy not only innovation but also high technical risk. If we are going to recognise some of the features which this report refers to as underpinning our society—that is, one that is educated, enlightened and hopefully sustainable—and the worth and importance of science and technology, we are going to have to ensure that our research and development is adequately resourced. Still, the 125 per cent R&D tax concession—cut, I might add, from 150 per cent back in 1996-97—is far from adequate.
I put on record tonight a plea for additional resources for science. We welcome the fact that the innovation statement contains funding for some education places, for some research and development, for certain industries including biotechnology and for ICT sectors. Unfortunately, that funding does not make up for the cuts that we have seen in education, particularly the higher education sector, and in research and development generally. Of course, those tax concession changes, or reductions, have also led to a reduction in private investment in research and development.
—Don't forget the $2.9 billion.
—I will take that interjection. Senator Tierney should know not to provoke me on this issue. Let us look at how much was cut out of higher education: $1.8 billion back in 1996-97. 
—That is a lie. In my adjournment speech I will lay out that lie.
—That is taking into account not only operating grants but also increases in fees and charges that make education prohibitively expensive for some of the scientists and astronomers of tomorrow who could be, like me, quite excited about the report that we have before us. If this government is committed to science—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, to Senator Tierney—they will remove the differential HECS rate for science courses so that our graduates can undertake science courses and careers without the financial and psychological disincentive that we know fees and charges are. If we want an enlightened society, the kind referred to in the report, we will remove fees and charges for education. (Time expired)
Question resolved in the affirmative.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Anglo-Australian Observatory</title>,Documents,20,1,speech
"Tierney, Sen John",LP,2001-02-07,"—I rise tonight to speak on the very important innovation statement which was released by the Prime Minister two weeks ago. This statement, Backing Australia's Ability, is a major re-engineering of research and development in Australia to equip Australia for the information age. Before examining this breathtaking initiative—and I intend to do this over two speeches in the Senate—I want to hit on the head the ALP criticism of this approach. Their pithy little response to all of this is, `Oh, yes, you are injecting $2.9 billion over five years into R&D but you withdrew $5 billion.' In this speech tonight I want to expose this lie. It is a great pity that, in her earlier contribution tonight, Senator Stott Despoja from the Democrats chose to perpetuate a Labor lie. Where is this so-called $5 billion that Labor claim has been removed? That is what I want to examine—this so-called, mythical $5 billion. It was never real and it was never committed in any budget. The ALP did not spend this money. Two billion dollars of it was forward estimates of expenditure. If, God help Australia, Labor had stayed in power from 1996 to 2001, they claim that over that five-year period they might have spent another $2 billion on it. So it never did really exist. 
The other $3 billion is made up of the research and development blow-out that would have occurred over the same period. To refresh people's memories, back in 1994, Paul Keating, the then Prime Minister, brought in a research and development scheme which was a tax concession scheme for business. This scheme was widely rorted by unscrupulous people. As we got into government, this rorting was leading to a great blow-out, and that great blow-out would have continued to the extent of about $3 billion. So there is the other $3 billion. They were actually going to give that away. This tax concession scheme was wound back very rapidly and rightly by this current government. If the scheme had continued, it is very unlikely that very much of that $3 billion would have ever found its way into real research and development.
Since that time—besides criticising what this current government has done with its Backing Australia's Ability policy and the expenditure of $2.9 million—what alternative has been put up by the current Labor opposition? What has this policy-lazy opposition come back with? It is one idea which was released by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, just after everyone came back from the Christmas break. This is his way of introducing a knowledge nation. He came up with an online or Internet university for 100,000 students. Let us look at the fine print. When are the 100,000 students going to get their places? Over 10 years, according to Mr Beazley. So that is not much use to current students. What else is in the fine print? It is all subject to the Labor budgets year by year. We know what will happen to that: it will just whittle away and disappear. We know from 13 years of the last Labor government that they mismanage the economy and they keep sending things into deficit. As a result, you find that programs that start out with great expectations and high hopes get whittled away. So this Clayton's university is probably not going to happen. 
It is certainly not going to happen if we go on the track record of Mr Beazley when he was last the education minister. He came into the job after 10 years of Labor government. Let me just refresh the memory of the Senate as to what was happening in the field of higher education at that point in time, and I am talking about 1992. At that time the Labor government's policies after 10 years had resulted in them turning away 50,000 students every year from the gates of the universities. This was creating great public angst because of the bleak future it created for our young people. I would remind the Senate that that year, 1992, was the depth of Keating's recession we had to have. That had created 11 per cent unemployment and over 30 per cent youth unemployment and we had 50,000 being turned away from the university gates. So in the 1992 budget, standing in the shadow of the 1993 election, Labor was desperate and had to come up with some magic, cut-through policy. What was Kim Beazley's solution at that time? His solution was to create an institution called Open Learning Australia. This was a low-tech version of his current proposals. It was even included in the main part of the budget speech in 1992 that `all Australians with a TV set and a letterbox will be able to have a university education'. That was the claim in the 1992 budget speech of the Keating government. What a joke! What a sick joke! 
How is this brilliant idea of distance education created by Mr Beazley going nine years on? The institution he created to administer this open learning approach was the Open Learning Agency of Australia. They had an ad in the paper recently. They run a small number of courses. Of the 38 universities of Australia, only seven now participate in the scheme, and the last time I looked there were only 8,000 students involved. This is nine years on. This was a scheme that was supposed to solve the problem of 50,000 students being turned away from university. What a great Beazley education policy success that was. This is the man who is going to create the knowledge nation. We should not hold our breath if we go on the nineties track record. He cannot even come up with an original policy slogan. Do you know where the knowledge nation slogan comes from? It comes from Bill Clinton. He was the first one to come up with knowledge nation. The next one to borrow it was Tony Blair, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Then Kim Beazley picks it up as well—a third-hand rose.
Nine years on and they come up with a rehash of that old idea through the Opening Learning Agency, and this time it is an online university. It is going to be delivered by a completely new institution which will have 100,000 students. What is the reaction to this bright idea out there in the academic community? Incredibly lukewarm would be an understatement. And why? Let me tell you why: it is because the academics and the people out there understand something that Mr Beazley obviously does not understand. Online education, or Internet education, already exists in the universities of this country. You would be hard-pressed to find a university out of the 38 that is not delivering some of its courses online. If you are going to have that policy approach—and I have nothing against online education; it is a very powerful tool—you should expand options in the current courses at the current universities. That would be the sensible policy approach to take, not to create some pie in the sky cyberuniversity. So it is back to the drawing board again for Mr Beazley on this one. His great launch of Knowledge Nation has just fallen totally flat, and we look forward eagerly to hearing the next instalment.
In the meantime, this government has created a real policy and it is called Backing Australia's Ability. We are putting real money—not mythical money—behind it. We are putting $2.9 billion behind it, and this will go towards supporting real research and development in our universities and innovative institutions. My time is nearly expired, but what I want to do tomorrow night—and Senator Schacht will be here eagerly waiting to hear this—is to explain the way in which this $2.9 billion is going to expand some very vital areas in research and development in this country and what this will mean for Australia in the new information age.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Innovation Statement: Backing Australia's Ability</title>,Adjournment,21,1,speech
