Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (09:01):  Madam Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to move a motion.


Leave not granted.




Mr HOCKEY:
  That is a little disappointing. I move:


That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for North Sydney from moving the following motion forthwith—That the resolution of the House of Representatives of 8 May 2012, regarding the management of proceedings in respect of Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2012-2013, Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2012-2013, Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2012-2013, Appropriation Bill (No. 5) 2011-2012 and Appropriation Bill (No. 6) 2011-2012, be rescinded to allow the House to properly consider the proposal contained in Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2012-2013, to increase the Commonwealth debt ceiling from $250 billion to $300 billion.


Stop covering up! Have a proper debate!




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  Order! The member for North Sydney will resume his seat.




Mr Albanese:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I would ask that the member withdraw that last comment.



Honourable members interjecting—




Mr Albanese:
  What am I covering up?



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The Leader of the House will resume his seat.




Mr HOCKEY:
  No. I don't withdraw!



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for North Sydney does not have the call. He will resume his seat. I call the Leader of the House.




Mr Albanese:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, the shadow Treasurer is alleging that the budget papers are somehow not transparent; they are!



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr Albanese:
  I read in the Australian that he, indeed, said he supported this measure!

The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke

In division—





The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  No! Lock the doors; too late—no way; not on. Out!




Mr Hockey:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, you just called him back in.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I did actually call him back in, because the doors had locked.




Mr Hockey:
  The Government Whip—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The Government Whip does not have the authority. I actually said he should return to the chamber because the doors had been locked and he was actually in the chamber when I said, 'Lock the doors.' In accordance with the rules, I had asked him to stay in the chamber, as the doors had been locked. I think that is the right way to proceed.




Mr Hockey:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. Just to clarify: as we said that we would not accept the vote of the member for Dobell, when we realised—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for North Sydney does not have the call. Member for North Sydney, it is not for the opposition or the government to accept a member's vote. We need to clarify this: it is for the parliament to accept a member's vote. The member for North Sydney.




Mr Hockey:
  The coalition has said it would not accept the vote of the member for Dobell and, if the member for Dobell entered the House and voted with us, we would have someone leave the chamber. To provide clarity: we became aware that the member for Dobell was sitting on our side, and that is why the Leader of the Opposition and the Manager of Opposition Business attempted to leave the House, on that note. The member, obviously—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for North Sydney has made his point. We are in the middle of a division. The issue still remains that, when the call for the doors to be locked has been made, those in the chamber must be counted in the vote. I understand the point the member for North Sydney is making, but there is no ability for the parliament to exclude a member's vote. The member for Groom is seeking the call. I would like to now, before that, put the question. The question is that the member be no longer heard.




Mr Ian Macfarlane:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: you are classed as outside the chamber if you are past the advisers' box.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The Leader of the Opposition was on the floor at the time—that is the chamber. We will now proceed with the vote. The question is that the member be no longer heard.

Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein) (09:19):  I second the motion. This Treasurer is addicted to debt.



Opposition members:  Hear, hear!




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  The member for Goldstein will refer to the motion before the chair.




Mr ROBB:
  I am, Madam Deputy Speaker. 'Debt' is a dirty word for this government, a word never to be mentioned—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Goldstein will refer to the motion before the chair.




Mr ROBB:
  We need to suspend standing orders, Madam Deputy Speaker, because this government is ashamed and embarrassed with the cover-up that is taking place with this debt.




Mr Albanese:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The member must argue why standing orders should be suspended. That is the motion that is before the chair and that is what the member for Goldstein must refer to.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The Leader of the House will resume his seat. The member for Goldstein must refer to the motion before the chair.




Mr ROBB:
  The reason that standing orders must be suspended, the very important reason that they must be suspended, is that this government knows that a proper debate about debt would expose the extent of its profligacy. The government has gagged debate. We have seen it again already. The way this government has gagged debate about debt exposes both its shame and its shamelessness. It is ashamed because it does not want the public to know and it is shameless because it does not care. It does not care about the dead weight of debt that this government is putting—




Mr Albanese:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: the member is going to the substance of the motion that he is attempting to suspend standing orders for. The member must stick to the suspension of standing orders that is before the chair.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The Leader of the House will resume his seat. The member for Goldstein has the call.




Mr ROBB:
  The need to suspend standing orders is quite clear when you look at the problem that we are addressing with this motion. This is a government quite incapable of living within its means. It is still borrowing $100 million a day and this is why—

"Bradbury, David, MP",ALP,2012-05-30,"



Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (10:05):  I am pleased to bring the second reading debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2012-2013 to a close. I thank those members who have made a contribution. Despite the impacts of a sovereign debt crisis in Europe and unprecedented natural disasters here in Australia, Australia's economic prospects remain strong. We have one of the lowest unemployment rates in the developed world and our economic growth is expected to be stronger than every single major advanced economy over the coming two years. We will confirm our position by returning the budget to surplus in 2013 and growing that surplus over the forward estimates.


In this budget we are returning to surplus while ensuring that families and small businesses are sharing in the benefits of the resources boom. This budget provides a $1.8 billion increase in family tax benefit part A for all eligible families from 1 July 2013. It also provides a further $1.1 billion for a new supplementary allowance for the unemployed, students and parents with young children on income support, with the first payment commencing on March 2013. The government is also providing an extra $2.1 billion over five years for a new schoolkids bonus paid directly to eligible recipients, despite opposition from those on the other side of the chamber. From 1 July 2012 we are more than tripling the tax-free threshold from $6,000 to $18,200 which will free up to one million Australians from the need to lodge a tax return. We will invest $1 billion over four years in the first stage of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. This is a very important Labor reform which will see around 10,000 people start to benefit from mid-2013 and expand to cover 20,000 people from mid-2014.


This budget will also help businesses to invest. We have announced a new initiative to allow businesses to carry back their losses to offset past profits and to get a refund of tax previously paid on that profit. From 1 July 2012 companies will be able to carry back up to $1 million worth of losses to get a refund of tax paid in the previous year, and from 1 July 2013 companies will be able to carry back up to $1 million worth of losses against tax paid up to two years earlier. We are also delivering tax breaks which will significantly help small business from 1 July 2012, such as the increase to the instant asset write-off threshold to $6½ thousand.


A number of comments have been made by members as part of this debate concerning the amendments to the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act 1911. While I note that similar amendments were included in Appropriation Bill (No. 2) of last year, I will spend a little bit of time explaining, particularly to those opposite, the rationale behind these amendments. I state upfront that the Commonwealth government securities on issue, subject to the current legislative limit, are projected to be below $250 billion at the end of each financial year across the forward estimates. However, fluctuations in cash requirements that result during the financial year are a normal feature of the Commonwealth's annual financing task.


The number of Commonwealth government securities on issue during any part of the financial year varies in order to adequately manage any mismatches in the timing of revenue collection and expenditure outlays. Being able to manage these fluctuations in an efficient manner is critical. The Australian Office of Financial Management should not be affected by short-term borrowing constraints, as these have a negative impact upon the AOFM's ability to operate its normal cash management functions in the current financial climate. The increase in the legislative limit on borrowing from a total of $250 billion to $300 billion will allow the AOFM to most efficiently manage within-year mismatches. It will also provide the flexibility to maintain a liquid and efficient government bond market in the years to come.


Australia looks toward the future from a position of strength—strength in our economy, strength in our people and strength in our policies. This government is focused on prioritising spending to provide lasting gains to convert an increasingly productive economy into a fairer community for all Australians.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  The question is that the amendment be agreed to.

I wrote to her on 27 April about a very serious issue centred around a drug that was not on the PBS, and to her credit she showed the compassion that we should all show to our constituents in this place and did something to make sure that that lady did not have to pay the amount of money that was needed to get the drug. I thank her most sincerely on behalf of my constituent and I thank her most sincerely for doing what needs to be done in this House from time to time—wonderful things done in a bipartisan way.

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:00):  On indulgence—for more than a year now the Assad regime has been at war with its own people and the world has watched with a growing sense of horror and, I would have to say, with a growing sense of anger too. On Friday, the village of Houla was witness to scenes of unspeakable brutality. More than 100 people were massacred, among them, according to the United Nations, 49 children and 34 women. Some were killed by government artillery and tank shelling of a residential neighbourhood. Many were executed at close range by armed men. Eyewitnesses have told of a brutal intent to murder. Victims were shot in their own home and there were young children with their throats cut. 'They had no mercy,' one told the BBC. 'They went into people's houses and opened fire and killed them all,' another said. We grieve with the families of the dead.


Yesterday, Australia expressed its revulsion by expelling the Syrian Charge d'Affaires and another Syrian diplomat from this country. Around the world, other nations are taking a similar approach.


We understand all too painfully that such actions pale against the measure of the lives lost in Houla. But we will not have any further official engagement with the Assad regime until it abides by the ceasefire proposed by the special envoy Kofi Annan appointed for this purpose. Mr Annan has again visited Syria. Now is the moment to end this violence. We call on Syria to immediately honour its commitments under the Annan peace plan to get the military out of civilian areas, to end the use of heavy weapons and to begin a political process that will bring peace.


Australia will maintain our robust unilateral sanctions against this regime. We will maintain our humanitarian assistance and we will not stop our pressure until this violence comes to an end.

 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (14:02):  I rise to support the remarks of the Prime Minister and to support, on behalf of the coalition, the decision by Western governments including Australia's to expel Syrian diplomats. It is clear that the Syrian regime is waging war on its own people and there is absolutely no excuse ever for the indiscriminate slaughter of unarmed civilians. Our objective must be to secure a democratic government in Syria that respects the rights of all its citizens and lives in peace with all its neighbours.

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (14:03):  My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer her to today's report of the Minerals Council and to recent comments from the chairman of BHP both indicating that the proposed investment at Olympic Dam in South Australia is at risk because of higher taxes, higher energy costs and greater uncertainty. Will the Prime Minister apologise to the people of South Australia for jeopardising investment and jobs by breaking her solemn pledge that there will be no carbon tax under the government she leads?

",HoR,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Olympic Dam</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,4,1,question
"Gillard, Julia, MP",ALP,2012-05-30,"



Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:04):  The Leader of the Opposition in his question refers to a Minerals Council report that was reported in today's newspapers and has been the subject of some discussion since. I think it is worth noting that that article, which was in the pages of the Australian and the Financial Review today, was written by Angus Taylor. That name may be familiar to some because he has just been preselected as the Liberal candidate for the seat of Hume at the next election—a very important point.


Is it of any surprise to me that a man who is presenting for election as a candidate for the Liberal Party at the next election is talking the economy down? That is of no surprise to me whatsoever. Is it of any surprise to me that someone preselected as a Liberal candidate for the next election is making absurd claims about carbon pricing? Well, no, that is of no surprise to me either. It is not of any surprise to me that he is actually a very vocal and proud supporter of Work Choices? Apparently he has not got the memo yet that tells members of the opposition to not be truthful about their support for Work Choices.


What the Leader of the Opposition ought to be acknowledging in this parliament are the following facts: our economy is strong—




Mr Pyne:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. This is the largest mine expansion in the world. It is a very serious issue and the Prime Minister should answer the question, not make light of it.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat. The Prime Minister has the call.




Ms GILLARD:
  It is a serious issue. It is too serious for the petty politics of the opposition, far too serious for that. Running the economy is a serious issue. Making sure our economy is the envy of the world has required serious work. Making sure that there are $500 million of investments in the pipeline has required serious work. And at every step of the way, this government has worked with the government of South Australia because we want this Olympic Dam project to go ahead. We worked hard with the government of South Australia to achieve that result. What will not help the achievement of that result is a reckless negativity, talking the economy down and making false claims about carbon pricing. Those things are calculated to destroy jobs and opportunity in South Australia and right around the country.

Ms VAMVAKINOU
 (Calwell) (14:16):  My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, what are the facts about the effect of the carbon price and the extra assistance that the government has provided through the budget to help families?

",HoR,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Budget</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,6,1,question
"Gillard, Julia, MP",ALP,2012-05-30,"



Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:17):  I thank the member for Calwell for the question. I know that she in her electorate is working hard to ensure that people are getting the right information about the assistance that they will receive available through our clean energy future package. I do note too that she was proudly in this parliament to support the schoolkids bonus against the opposition from those members of the Liberal-National Party who thought working families did not deserve a break and should not get any money to assist them with the costs of getting the kids to school.


The member for Calwell asked me about how Australians will experience carbon pricing from 1 July and what assistance is available to help people make ends meet. I do understand that working families struggle to pay the bills, and that is why we have made sure that in creating a carbon pricing scheme we will be giving families around the nation, on average, assistance of $10.10 per week, and that will be more than the impact that they will experience from carbon pricing. Six out of 10 households will receive assistance that fully matches or exceeds these costs. Three point two million pensioners are already seeing advance payments of $250 per single pensioner and $380 for pensioner couples, and then in March they will see more assistance and it will be ongoing. Our economy will also see the benefits of investments in a clean energy future.


From 1 July Australians will be able to experience this, they will be able to live it and they will be able to make up their own minds. That ability to make up their own minds will be a very sharp contrast to the relentlessly negative and destructive fear campaign that has been run by the Leader of the Opposition. They will be able to make up their own minds about his claim that price rises will be unimaginable. They will be able to see whether or not whole towns have been wiped off the map. They will be able to see whether or not their fuel bill or their electricity bill goes up by 30 per cent. And they will be able to see that the mainstays of our manufacturing sector are here and stay strong.


From 1 July, Liberal MPs who have joined the Leader of the Opposition in this negative campaign will then be left to wonder whether their relentless negativity has left them at the point of no return—where they will be given the Leader of the Opposition's systematic misleading of the Australian community, on the coal industry, on the cement industry, on jobs, on the cost of living and on electricity prices. We know from this morning that the Leader of the Opposition can run, but come 1 July he will not be able to hide from these claims being revealed to be wholly untrue.

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (15:23):  by leave—For the benefit of members on both sides, I wish to briefly update the House on matters concerning the Hastie Group. The Hastie Group is made up of approximately 44 separate companies, and that number is on latest advice. It employs about 4,000 people across mechanical engineering and electrical plumbing work on construction sites and also services such as refrigeration and mechanical operations.


I have had the opportunity to speak directly with Mr Peter Anderson from McGrathNicol and Mr Craig Crosbie from PPB, who are the appointed receiver and administrator for Hastie. I am advised that a number of the subsidiary organised companies will or may be sold as going concerns, and as such it is hoped that quite a lot of the jobs for electricians, plumbers and metal tradespeople will continue. The Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Electrical Trade Union, the Plumbers Union and others have been in touch with me to ensure that their members' interests are represented.


In terms of the services part of the Hastie Group, I am advised that the 1,300 staff employed in that part of the businesses are likely to retain their jobs. In addition, I am advised that 500 workers in the two refrigeration businesses are likely to retain their jobs. I will continue to talk with the administrator and others during the remainder of this week. I am aware that the CEPU electricians and PPB reached arrangements yesterday that allow redundancy certificates to be issued. That will mean that some employees will be able to gain access to entitlements in a more speedy fashion. I am aware that the plumbers division of the CEPU are in constructive talks to ensure that the plumbing jobs are maintained going forward.


All workers will remain eligible for support through JSA and Centrelink, and the government are doing everything we can to support people. In the event that liquidation is confirmed, employees may be eligible for the GIS scheme. If the administrators believe that they are going to have to liquidate particular operations, we look forward to them informing us at the earliest possible time; thus allowing me to use a discretion. In the event that they are not then we are keen to see who is going to buy the businesses and what will happen to the jobs this week.


The aim of the government is to make sure that people do not remain in uncertainty for days and weeks. The situation is moving very fast, and we know that there are a lot of people trying to work on this issue. At the end of the day, in relation to the subcontractors, the small businesses and the employees who are caught up in circumstances beyond their control, I appreciate that the jobs that they perform will still be necessary in many cases for the construction projects to get completed.


According to initial reports—and I stress 'initial reports'—it is apparent that this unfortunate situation has arisen out of mismanagement, including a multimillion-dollar irregularity in the Hastie Group's accounts. ASIC are investigating the matter and making the appropriate inquiries of directors, administrators and auditors. The government, at the appropriate stage, will consider any policy options arising out of these inquiries, including whether or not mandatory rotation of auditors after a set number of years is required in the future. Members of parliament with any questions should feel free to contact my office.

",HoR,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Hastie Group</title>,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,11,1,speech
"Ley, Sussan, MP",LP,2012-05-30,"



Ms LEY
 (Farrer) (15:26):  by leave—I appreciate the update from the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. The circumstances of the collapse of the Hastie Group are now unfortunately becoming all too well known: 2,700 workers have been stood down without pay for 28 days. Job losses and business closures are shocking when they happen.


What I would say is that, while the opposition makes no political comment about a government to blame for this, as we do see more and more company closures, the creeping loss of confidence across the economy is doing nothing to encourage small and medium businesses—especially in the regional towns affected by Hastie; namely, Albury, Shepparton, Bendigo, Mildura and Geelong—to actually take a risk and recruit a recently retrenched worker.


The government has failed to provide the right economic policy settings that would give sufficiently robust local and regional job opportunities to enable these workers to easily find a job. In my own home town of Albury, Watters Electrical had 80 workers stood down on Monday in the car park outside the office. The process of standing them down means they cannot apply for Centrelink or redundancy payments. I appreciate the minister's efforts in encouraging that official retrenchment action take place so that Centrelink and the GIS can step in to assist these workers. For those workers who do lose their jobs as a result of the collapse of the Hastie Group, we need to ensure they are assisted with prompt and appropriate support. So I echo that commitment from the minister to ensure that workers are not left in doubt for longer than 28 days as to whether they have a job or not.


The government needs to work with the administrators to ensure that where some of the subsidiaries can remain in business they are given every assistance to do so. I appreciate the minister mentioning that he has received advice from relevant unions who represent these workers, but I also seek his assurance that those workers or subcontractors affected who are not members of unions also receive the same level of support.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
) (15:28):  Mr Speaker has asked me to inform the House of the appointment of the inaugural Parliamentary Budget Officer, who will head the new Parliamentary Budget Office. Under sections 64X and 64XA of the Parliamentary Service Act 1999, the Presiding Officers have the responsibility to appoint the Parliamentary Budget Officer, subject to the approval of the proposed appointment by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit.


I am pleased to inform the House that on 23 May 2012, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit gave unanimous approval to the appointment of Mr Phil Bowen as the inaugural Parliamentary Budget Officer. Mr Bowen is a highly experienced individual who is ideally suited to this new and important role. Since 2007, Mr Bowen has been an executive director on the board of the Asian Development Bank, representing Australia and a number of countries in our region.


Prior to this, Mr Bowen was a senior Commonwealth public servant who held various senior executive positions, including as a long-serving deputy secretary of Budget Group in the former Department of Finance and Administration between 2001 and 2007. Prior to this, Mr Bowen was a deputy secretary of the Property Group of Finance and has also held senior positions in the former Department of Transport and Communications and the Civil Aviation Authority.


In recognition of Mr Bowen's contributions, he was awarded a Public Service Medal on Australia Day 2006 'for outstanding public service in the development, delivery and implementation of enhanced whole-of-government budget processes'. Mr Bowen will commence on 23 July 2012. I congratulate Mr Bowen on his appointment and, on behalf of all members, I wish him well in establishing this new and important office.

Mr OAKESHOTT
 (Lyne) (15:30):  by leave—On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I am pleased to also advise the House of the committee's decision to approve the proposed appointment of Mr Phil Bowen as Parliamentary Budget Officer, as referred to the committee by Presiding Officers. The committee welcomes today's announcement by the Presiding Officers confirming the appointment of Mr Bowen as the inaugural Parliamentary Budget Officer.


Mr Bowen's first task will be to establish a fourth parliamentary department—that of the Parliamentary Budget Office. This office will improve the transparency of Australia's fiscal and budgetary frameworks and will help level the playing field by giving all senators and members access to independent policy costings and additional support to scrutinise the budget.


The appointment of the right person to establish and lead the PBO was of the utmost importance to the committee. The committee considered that the appointment process undertaken by the Parliamentary Service Commissioner at the request of the Presiding Officers was thorough and transparent. After meeting with both the Parliamentary Service Commissioner and Mr Bowen, the committee did unanimously agree to the appointment. The committee was impressed by Mr Bowen's strong finance related background and also considered his diversity as a real asset. Following our meeting with Mr Bowen, we were all confident that he brings the whole package: knowledge, skills, experience and ability to communicate all of this in his no-nonsense style.


Since 2007 Mr Bowen has been the Australian director on the board of the Australian Development Bank. In this role he represented the constituency of 11 ADB members as well as worked to continuously improve the bank's operations. Following criticism of the ADB's operations evaluation department, which is responsible for monitoring the billions of dollars of loans made by the bank to Asian nations, Mr Bowen led a review that made significant recommendations to improve the independence and effectiveness of the office. Prior to this international appointment, Mr Bowen held a range of senior positions within the then Department of Finance and Administration directly relevant to the role of Parliamentary Budget Officer, including five years as head of the Budget Group. During this time, as you mentioned, Deputy Speaker, Mr Bowen was awarded an Australian Public Service Medal for his work in developing and implementing enhanced whole-of-government budget processes.


Mr Bowen has held senior positions in the former Department of Transport and Communications and in the Civil Aviation Authority. He has served on a number of boards and advisory committees, including the Australian Public Sector Accounting Standards Board. In addition to qualifications in agricultural science, economics and accounting, Mr Bowen is a fellow of CPA Australia and an alumni of the Harvard Business School's Advanced Management Program.


We only get one chance to get this important new Parliamentary Budget Office right. The establishment of a credible, independent and strong PBO is a unique opportunity for this parliament, and all parliamentarians, I hope, will be working together to ensure we make the most of it.


Along with the selection of the best person to head the Parliamentary Budget Office, the committee considers that decisions made about the location of the office to be fundamental to its success. While ultimately a decision for the newly appointed Parliamentary Budget Officer, the committee is a strong view that it is an absolute priority that the Parliamentary Budget Officer and his key staff have an office located within Parliament House to ensure ready access for senators and members. The committee welcomes its new role as the oversight committee for the Parliamentary Budget Office and looks forward to working with Mr Bowen, as prescribed in the Parliamentary Services Act 1999, upon his commencement on 23 July 2012.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
) (15:34):  Mr Speaker has received letters from the honourable member for Chifley and the honourable member for Cook proposing that definite matters of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion today. As required by standing order 46, Mr Speaker has selected the matter which, in his opinion, is the most urgent and important; that is, that proposed by the honourable member for Chifley, namely:


The urgent need to provide households with financial relief based on facts surrounding the introduction of a carbon price on July 1.


I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2012-05-30,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley—Government Whip) (15:35):  I am pleased the House can consider this matter of public importance. I am also looking forward to the contributions from the member for Moreton and the member for Robertson on this critical issue because we are in the process of taking action on an issue that has been dodged by federal parliaments for successive decades: action on climate change and meeting our international commitment.


It is worth noting that this is an existing bipartisan commitment to meet a medium-term target of reducing emissions by five to 15 per cent on 2000 levels by 2020. Both sides of the House committed to reducing emissions. In doing so, we have sought to do this in a way that will cut pollution and drive investment in clean energy. To ensure that we target this action to those that are contributing most to pollution, all the money that is raised by bringing in a price on carbon will go to jobs, will go to clean energy, will go to households. We recognise too that a lot of other parts of the world are acting on this critical issue. As much as we structure our plans in a specific way, it is important to note as well that, under the proposals put forward by those opposite, families would actually be worse off and would be required to pay more.


In introducing this price on carbon, I would reinforce the point that, in tackling pollution we are targeting the top 500 polluters. But, along the way, we have admitted and have acknowledged that there will be price impacts. We asked Treasury to model that impact—not to do so on hunches or to work off guesswork but to rely on facts and reality. It was a significant body of work in terms of the modelling that was undertaken by Treasury and, in addition, it was then tested further and refined to ensure that this work, which would form the bedrock of work in relation to other initiatives, would be solid. As I said, this modelling forms the bedrock of our plans to provide thorough household assistance as we transition to a cleaner energy future. It is used to shape the type of assistance that is also provided through our Jobs and Competitiveness Program to help industry in the transition process too. Both measures are vitally important for the people that I am proud to represent and champion in this place—and I will come back to that later.


Let me go back to the modelling. On that modelling alone, it is indicated that the impact on prices and the cost of living will be 0.7 per cent. If you contrast that to other major initiatives—for example, when those opposite were in government and introduced the goods and services tax—bear in mind that we predict prices will move 0.7 per cent as a result of a price on carbon, and when the GST was introduced there was a 2.5 per cent lift in prices.


The 500 polluters that are being targeted are the only ones targeted, which again is worth noting. The myths peddled by those opposite suggest that all businesses will pay—every single small business and all businesses in the country will pay. We have 500 of the biggest polluters targeted and, unlike the imposition of the GST—which effectively turned every small business into a small taxation office—ours will only target 500 of the biggest polluters. Again, prices are predicted to go up 0.7 per cent, and it is worth putting it into context. That is less than a cent for every dollar spent. We have estimated, as a result of that modelling, that the overall impact will be $9.90 per week on average, and the assistance we are providing is $10.10 per week to cover that $9.90 per week impact.


All sorts of claims have been made about what impact putting a price on carbon would have on everyday goods and services. I think it is important, as the matter of public importance suggests, that we base this on fact. It is worth noting and bringing to the House's attention some of the movements. In terms of electricity we have had all sorts of claims made as to what impact this would have. Electricity will be up on average 10 per cent, or $3.30 per week. Gas will be up nine per cent, or $1.50 per week. For fruit and vegetables the average price impact is 10c—that is a 0.4 per cent impact. Rents are the same—a 40c increase, or 0.6 per cent. I have already gone through utilities. Pharmaceuticals will go up less than 10c, or 0.3 per cent. In terms of urban transport we have all sorts of claims about what impact that will have in terms of fuel and prices of urban transport. For urban transport there will be less than a 10c impact. Again, we have all sorts of claims made about the impact on airlines and travel—and I want to come back to that further in this contribution—but the impact is about 30c as a result of putting a price on carbon. So again it is important to get the facts on the record. These are the facts and these are the figures, and we have built our household assistance around these figures.


In terms of that household assistance, families who are receiving family tax benefit part A receive an extra $110 per child, and families on family tax benefit part B receive an extra $69. From July 2013, regular fortnightly or quarterly payments will receive a permanent boost. Pensioners receive an upfront lump sum payment over the next few weeks to help now and over the coming months. Again, it is a fact that single pensioners are receiving about $250 and it is a fact that pensioner couples will receive about $380 combined. We will deliver another permanent boost to regular pension payments from March next year. So, overall, singles will get about $338 a year and couples an extra $510. That is on top of the increases we have already delivered. For example, a single pensioner on the maximum rate is now $4,000 a year better off because of what we are doing.


For workers, from July everyone earning less than $80,000 will receive a tax cut, and for most people that tax cut is worth about $300 a year. We are also—and this is a tremendous boost for a lot of workers—tripling the tax-free threshold to $18,200. So, if you are a part-time worker earning $25,000, you are going to have an extra $500 in your pocket every year, and if you earn less than $18,200 a year you will not be paying any tax at all—none, zip, nothing. Self-funded retirees who hold a Commonwealth Seniors Health Card receive an upfront lump sum payment in June to help now and over the coming months. Those are just some of the impacts.


There are around 65,000 taxpayers who live in Chifley—in the suburbs of Mount Druitt, Rooty Hill, Blacktown and Marsden Park—and around 58,000 will receive a tax cut. Out of those 58,000, 49,000 receive a tax cut of at least $300. In total, more than 52,700 people in the electorate I am proud to represent in this place will receive household assistance through income support payments. More than 19,000 will receive extra cash through their family assistance payments. This means, for example, that a typical family with a household income of about $75,000 a year, with two kids in school—and with a price impact of about $549 a year as a result of a carbon price—will, through what we are doing on family tax payments and tax cuts, receive an extra $1,179 a year. They will be $630 better off.


These are facts. This is reality. That is what we are doing: lifting payments, cutting taxes, boosting pensions and lifting the tax-free threshold. The response of those opposite is: extra payments gone; taxes back up; pensions reduced; and the tax-free threshold lowered. A million people will benefit from our lowering of the tax-free threshold—60 per cent of them women. Hundreds of thousands of young people will benefit from that move. As I reflected in the House last week, imagine a political party going to those young people and saying, 'We will actually make you pay more tax so we can cut tax for the wealthiest in this country. 'It is a ridiculous proposition, but it is actually reality because that is what those opposite are saying. This is fact. This is what they said they would do. And what else have they done? Not only have they said they would take away the things we support or we are proposing to do, they are also out there pumping mistruths, peddling myths and relying on fear. Sure, fear gets you someplace fast, but it does not get you very far. At some point, once you have scared people, you have to come up with a solution. And if you are going to meet that bipartisan target that both sides committed to, the solution cannot be the biggest tree-planting program in the country. They have told whoppers—no-one can accuse them of a lack of imagination! We have had the Leader of the Opposition saying that the price rise and the effects of the carbon price will be unimaginable, but he himself has been quite imaginative in making up all sorts of myths about its impact. At some point, he has to stop the self-delusion and get with the reality—not say, again, that the price rises will be unimaginable. Listen to some of the things that the Leader of the Opposition has said:


This will destroy the steel industry, the cement industry, the aluminium industry, the motor industry. It will be, over time, the death of heavy manufacturing in Australia.


Anthony Abbott has morphed into Anthony Robbins, the biggest and greatest motivator of people in this country! Anything that he touches—anything that he turns up to—dies! Apparently, he can go to Whyalla and say, 'We had the AWU in South Australia just today predict Whyalla and Port Pirie would be wiped off the map'. This is what the Leader of the Opposition said: wiped off the map. How does he propose to be the leader of this country and go around the country saying to people that their town will be wiped off the map? It sounds more like a disaster movie—




Mr Fitzgibbon:
  We'll all be rooned!




Mr HUSIC:


 Exactly, rooned indeed. Thank you, Chief Government Whip. It is worth noting some of the other myths. I said before that one result of the price on carbon will be to add 0.7 per cent to the costs of living. State-based regulators have confirmed key aspects of that forecast. The Treasury analysis said that electricity prices will be up by 10 per cent. The New South Wales pricing regulator, IPART, confirmed that electricity prices would rise by $3.30 per week. IPART also said the impact on council rates would be 0.4 per cent less than under Treasury modelling. Those opposite have been saying all sorts of things about what the impact would be. It is quite astounding, when you match the reality against the myth, to see what will really be the case.


We have had all sorts of claims made about what effect the carbon price will have on councils. IPART and the New South Wales Minister for Local Government confirm that council rates will rise 0.4 per cent as a result of the carbon price. For average households, how much does that add per week? When it is applied to council rates, 0.4 per cent is just six cents a week—that is all that it will lead to. This has been an incredible attempt to spread fear about the carbon price. The New South Wales government has now confirmed the Treasury forecast, and after all that modelling and all the work that we have done, we are in a position to be able to provide facts instead of the fear that has been provided by those opposite. 


What about some of the other claims that we have had? We have had the member for Wide Bay, who at some point is actually going to ask the member for Grayndler a portfolio related question—



Mr Jenkins interjecting—




Mr HUSIC:
  You are right, Member for Scullin, it is highly unlikely, but we live in hope. Let us look at the impact on flights. Virgin, for example, has announced that on most flights it will only add $1.50. We had a scare campaign yesterday by those opposite, who said that aviation would be doomed—and rooned—yet we have had Rex put out a release for their 2011 full year results which quotes its Executive Chairman, Lim Kim Hai, as saying:


I am actually more optimistic and confident of the outlook and potential of the Rex Group than I have ever been for the past nine years.


And what about the claims in relation to Brindabella where—and I have never seen this before—we had the shadow Treasurer going to table a document, then folding the document in half, tearing it and handing up the convenient part but leaving out the inconvenient part. These are improvements to the House practice that I have been happy to see as a new member!


It is important, as the MPI states, to rely on fact instead of fiction. It is incumbent on those opposite to not only demonstrate exactly what they intend to do but also, importantly, to represent properly what impact this will have. As well as rate rises, they have talked about the cost of landfills and how that would be affected. The biggest move in relation to increases in landfill costs has come as a result of the waste management levies in New South Wales, not as a result of anything to do with the carbon price.


We have taken action on an issue affecting the nation. In the past, we have had delay—governments have delayed, deferred action on this and put it in the too-hard basket. We have acted. Those opposite agree that we need to act. It is a bipartisan target. It is time to get to work, instead of wilting under the pressure.

"Andrews, Kevin, MP",LP,2012-05-30,"



Mr ANDREWS
 (Menzies) (15:50):  'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' Those 11 words—'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead'—will haunt this Prime Minister for the rest of this year, for the rest of this parliament and for the rest of her term while she remains in this place. That is because there has been no more blatant refusal to confront the truth than her reversal of this promise that she made to the Australian people prior to the last election: 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.'


This Prime Minister—and her Treasurer—on more than one occasion went to the Australian people prior to the last election and made a solemn promise to every Australian that there would be no carbon tax under the government she leads. And why did she do that? She knew then that the polls were so close and that the carbon tax was so on the nose with the Australian people that she had to come forth and say on national television and to the national media—to be beamed into every lounge room in Australia—that there would be 'no carbon tax under a government I lead'. That is the promise that this Prime Minister made to the Australian people. And that is the promise that she ripped up in doing a deal to maintain her seat in The Lodge and to maintain her seat here at the despatch box in this parliament. In other words, in order to retain her position as the Prime Minister of Australia, she ripped up a solemn promise that she made on a number of occasions to the people of Australia. What would the government have us believe? Let us nail the lie at the heart of this issue. The government and the honourable member for Chifley, who is not such a bad bloke although he is part of this dysfunctional government—he has not been here that long, so I suppose he cannot be blamed for all of their ills—in this motion before the House speak of the 'urgent need to provide households with financial relief'. Why is there an urgent need to provide Australian households with financial relief? Because the government have been saying, if you listen to them, day after day, hour after hour—we heard it again in question time today—that this tax will only be imposed on 500 companies, the 500 biggest polluters in Australia. The government has been saying that ad nauseam. Hardly anybody in this country would not have heard the government's claim that this tax will only be imposed on the 500 biggest emitters—the 500 biggest companies, to put it in other words. If that is the case, if only the 500 biggest emitters are going to have the imposition of this carbon tax upon them, if only those companies are going to be met with the cost, why is there an urgent need to provide households with financial relief? This nails the lie at the heart of this government's campaign.




Ms Marino:
  Bells the cat.




Mr ANDREWS:
  This bells the cat, as my honourable colleague says. The reality is that urgent relief is being provided because of the carbon tax. If you have been listening to the radio or watching the television you could hardly not have noticed the ads about the household assistance package. Let me read the transcript: 'Soon millions of Australians receiving government payments will get additional help with their everyday expenses. An initial payment will automatically appear on your bank account from May 2012. It is the first part of the Australian government's household assistance package. This extra assistance will become a regular part of your government payment between March next year and early 2014. For more information …' Why is this required? If the imposition of this tax is only on 500 companies, why is urgent assistance needed for Australian families? If that were the case, it would not be needed. As I said, this is the lie at the heart of this policy proposal.


Everybody knows that when a tax is imposed upon a company, that company will seek to pass on that tax to the purchasers of goods and services from that company. Where they can do it, they will pass on that tax. Where they cannot do it, they will have to try and downsize or cut their costs in other ways. One of the consequences of that would be a loss of jobs in this country, and we are seeing that already. Where those companies are in an internationally competitive position, competing with other companies producing goods or services in overseas countries that do not have this tax, then something has to give so far as the companies are concerned. Anyone with a modicum of knowledge about business, anybody who knows the faintest thing about how taxation works, anybody who has had to balance their own family books, let alone the books of a small business, knows that when there is an additional imposition by way of an additional cost for the business—which this tax is—that has to be passed on in some way, otherwise something has to give within the business. 


Do you think that this government will come out and honesty admit to that truth? No, they will not. This increasingly dysfunctional government, led by the chaotic Prime Minister and her office, will not come clean with the Australian people. If they honestly believe that they need a carbon tax, they should say, 'Yes, we need a carbon tax and it is going to cost you.' Why don't they have the guts, the courage, to come forward to the Australian people and say that to them? No, they will not. They want to walk both sides of the street: on the one hand this is a tax applied only to 500 companies and on the other hand we need urgent financial assistance for every family in Australia. The reality is those two things do not add up, and anybody who spends a moment thinking about it can see, as I have described it, the lie at the heart of this policy. Yet day after day after day we get the Prime Minister in here pretending that somehow these realities do not work. 


Not only that, this tax is so toxic that they cannot mention it in the advertisements on television and on radio. In Senate estimates it was revealed that the focus groups put together to test the best lines in order to present this to the Australian people found that the toxicity of the carbon tax was such that they did not even bother to put it to the focus groups, knowing what the reaction would be. We know that because of reports coming from government backbenchers, they are afraid to doorknock in their own electorates because people will tell them directly what they think about this carbon tax. If my experience is true, they will also say that they want to get rid of this government as quickly as they can. That is the reality so far as this matter is concerned.


We have two worlds here. We have this unreal world of Treasury modelling—we had the honourable member for Chifley telling us about Treasury modelling and the impact of prices—and then we have the real world in which ordinary Australians live. Let me tell you something about the real world in which Australians live. From the December quarter of 2007 to the December quarter of 2011, four years, what has happened in the real world of Australians? Their electricity prices have gone up by 61per cent. That is even without a carbon tax.




Ms O'Neill:
  That's right!




Mr ANDREWS:
  You're saying that's fine and you want to do something about the cost-of-living pressures. This is the unreal world that this government lives in. 'That's fine,' interjects the honourable member opposite—a 61 per cent increase in electricity prices. But that is not all. Gas prices have gone up by—




Ms O'Neill:
  On a point of order, Deputy Speaker, I think that the honourable member misheard my comment which was, 'That is right; that is correct.' He is attempting to mislead the parliament with that misrepresentation.



Mr Andrews interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Mitchell
):  I am happy to let you have the call when I give you the call, but until then it is probably better to be silent. The honourable member for Menzies in continuation.




Mr ANDREWS:
  Electricity prices have gone up by 61 per cent. Gas prices over four years have increased on average across Australia by 37 per cent. Water and sewerage rates across Australia have increased by 58 per cent. Petrol prices across Australia are up by eight per cent. Health costs have increased by 20 percent. If you go to the doctor or you need some medical attention, health costs have gone up by 20 per cent across Australia in this government's term. The price of bread has gone up by nine per cent across Australia and the price of food on average has gone up by 13 per cent across Australia in four years. Fruit and vegetables have gone up by 20 per cent and rent, where people do not own their homes, has increased by 25 per cent over the last four years.


We have these two worlds: this totally unreal world that the honourable members opposite are trying to pretend we live in—as if things just go according to whatever Treasury has modelled—and the real world of people who are going to the supermarket, the people who are going to the service station to fill up their car, the people paying for their rent, the people using public transport, the people driving on the freeways—the millions of ordinary Australians and their world. The great English statesman, Benjamin Disraeli, said 150 or so years ago that between two nations there was no connection. At that time he was talking about the rich and the poor. There are two nations here between which there is no connection—between the government and the real people of Australia, because these costs are going up and we have not even got to the carbon tax. 


What is the carbon tax going to do to Australians? Just today in question time we had an example of transport. What the government expects of their fuel excise over the next forward estimates is a $920 million increase in revenue. That $920 million is going to get passed on by every transport company that is transporting goods around this country. If we are talking about transport, consider the service station owner who has just tendered out for his electricity under this competitive arrangement and in the tender documents that came back there was a carbon tax component of $13,141. That represented just over 18 per cent on his annual bill, and yet we are being told that it will have only a few dollars impact. This one service station is faced with an 18 per cent increase on what is being projected for the carbon tax.


The City of Sydney will have to collect an additional $921,000 in rates and the cities of Wollongong and Blacktown will need to collect almost half a million dollars extra in rates. If anyone wants to check this, I make this suggestion: ring up your local council and ask them how much are they factoring in for the carbon tax in terms of their expenditure in the next year. I have spoken to my local councils and they are factoring in a very significant amount for what they will have to find. In other words, how much will rates go up because of this carbon tax?


I have mentioned just two things. One is transport costs for every good that is supplied and provided around this country, which flows through to food prices. It flows through to the goods that we buy from the shelves of shops which are usually trucked in from somewhere else around the country, often overnight. The other is the councils. When the street lights are turned on, when the waste is disposed of—all of that attracts a carbon tax. Somehow, these people come in here and pretend that this is not going to have an impact. But, as I said, you cannot be saying it impacts upon only 500 companies in this country and yet come in here with a motion which says there is an urgent need to talk about financial assistance to families—and they are spending $36 million on media advertising to sell this particular proposal—the one in which the carbon tax does not speak its name. It is hidden away in the budget as a nice little line item under the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. That is on top of the $70 million this government is already spending on advertising. It is estimated that this government is spending something like $270,000 per day of Australian taxpayers' money in order to advertise this urgent need to provide financial assistance for something they tell us is not going to affect us. 


This is a joke. It comes from a government that is not even a joke. This is a government that is dysfunctional and a Prime Minister who evades questions she is asked here in question time. This is a  Prime Minister who told the unionists she was furious about a labour agreement and yet turned around and said she knew nothing about it. This is a totally dysfunctional government. I hope that some of the backbenchers in the Labor Party do go doorknocking, because what they will hear is that Australian people are totally fed up with this government, with the lies, with the dissembling and with the dysfunction. They want some security. It is about time we delivered hope and reward and opportunity to people of Australia and that will only come by having an election.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2012-05-30,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (16:05):  It pains me in a way to follow the member for Menzies, who I used to share a corridor with and had quite a bit of time for. I was pained because I thought he had actually stolen my speech. When he was talking about the rise in electricity prices of 61 per cent, of water and sewerage by 50 per cent, of gas over the last four years of 37 per cent, I thought he had stolen my speech. It is difficult for me to use exactly the same information in my speech, talking about why we need to provide some relief for families. It is important that we do that in the context of putting in a carbon price on 1 July, because as the member for Menzies—I was going to say passionately—so vociferously put it—




Mr Andrews:
  Eloquently.




Mr PERRETT:
  I won't take that interjection! There are a lot of families in my electorate and in the member for Menzies's electorate who are doing it tough. In fact, that is why we have been putting money into the member for Menzies's electorate. In Menzies 6,000 families have received extra money over the last few weeks—more than $1 million for his families going into his communities that can then be spent as his electors see fit. There are 17,000 pensioners in Menzies who are receiving more than $3½ million that will then circulate through those communities, through those community organisations, through those clubs, through the business, all because of the Gillard government's commitment to look after those people who are doing it a bit tough. So if the member for Menzies wants to tell his 6,000 families that he wants to vote no to that money, if he wants to tell those 17,000 pensioners in his own electorate that they do not deserve this extra support in that context of rising electricity prices, he will have some explaining to do. My understanding is that the Commonwealth government does not actually own any power stations and it does not actually deliver any power to people. That is the business of state governments and private enterprises. We do not own any gas-fired power stations delivering electricity, or even any water plants.


But I do understand that when I go around my electorate, when I doorknock, when I talk to people at community functions about the mining boom and how great things are, the people in my electorate say, 'There might be a mining boom on but I am not experiencing it. There might be a guy down the street who works in the mining industry who is getting a new back deck and a new car, but I am not experiencing that.' You talk to builders and they say, 'If you do renovations and you are not building for someone in the mining sector, you are not building.' It is as simple as that. The reality is that it is a two-speed economy. If you are working in the tourism sector in Queensland, you know how tough it is. You go to places like Cairns where there is unemployment north of 14 per cent and you understand that there are households throughout Australia particularly in the patchy parts that need support.


But let us go back a bit and put the overall context for Australia. Let us remember the underlying facts here. We have a triple-A rating from all ratings agencies for the first time in Australia's history. Forget the doom and gloom, the jeremiah ads and the Hanrahans opposite; the reality is that we have got a triple-A rating. The rest of the world, the IMF and the World Bank included, say, 'Australia you are doing great!' It is admitted by those opposite when they are overseas. When they are overseas they say, 'Yes, we have got serious bragging rights. We have got a healthy economy. Things are going well.' 


Imagine that conversation with the Spaniards where they have got youth unemployment nudging 50 per cent. Our overall unemployment has got a four in front of it—4.9 per cent. Sure, our cash rate compared to the rest of the world is a little bit different—we have still got a lot of room to manoeuvre—but it is significantly better at 3.75 per cent now than the 6.75 per cent it was one we came to power. The average family with a mortgage is $3,000 better off. The member for North Sydney, with his mortgage, a loan that he forgot to declare—and I think I have some information on his mortgage here; it was written up in the paper as $710,000—is about $7,000 better off per year, thanks to the policies of the Gillard Labor government.


We have got great investment pipelines of half a trillion dollars—and that is a term that you do not see used very often—of development and manufacturing and the like, particularly in mining, coming towards Australia. Retail sales figures came out today—and obviously things could be a bit better there. The balance of trade is the best it has ever been in the history of Australia. There is a bit more work to be done in productivity, but hopefully with some innovations and post the Queensland floods we will see productivity start to head in the right direction, particularly with the NBN. Obviously, that will be an advance in the future, with jobs of the future being via the NBN.


That puts the overall context of what Australia is like, but obviously we do need to do a lot to help households. So how are we doing it? For a start, we say yes to giving money to parents who have school kids, the 1.7 million Australians who have kids in school. There are people in the chamber who have children at school and they know how much this would be appreciated—not that they will be receiving this money. For primary school students it will be $410 each and for secondary students it will be $820 each. If you are a normal family with two or three kids, right now receiving that money will be of great benefit.


For families, if you are receiving family tax benefit part A, there will be $110 extra per child. What did the Leader of the Opposition say? He said no. Families receiving family tax benefit part B get $69 extra. What did the Leader of the Opposition say? No. The 3.2 million pensioners will receive upfront lump-sum payments—a lot of them right now and over the coming months in my electorate will receive the money. If they are singles, they will receive $250; if they are couples, they will receive $380 combined. Again, in March next year there will be a permanent boost to their pension payments. So, overall, the singles will receive $338 extra a year, and couples $510 extra a year. What did the Leader of the Opposition say? He said, 'We will claw that back. We will take that back.' He said no. So a single pensioner on the maximum rate is now $4,000 better off because of this Labor government.


Let us not forget the workers, the seven million Australians who in 31 days time will receive a tax cut. Everyone earning less than $80,000 will receive a tax cut. For most people it will be $300 a year—not to be sneezed at—but, if you are one of the lower-paid people, we are going to triple the tax-free threshold. It is a great thing to do. I thought the party of Menzies and the like would be in favour of tax cuts, but instead the Leader of the Opposition said no.


As for part-time workers, if they are earning $25,000, they will have an extra $500 in their pocket every year, and they will have that in the first week or so of July. When they go to the shops they will have more money in their pocket, more money in their wallet, from the very first pay packet. And, remember, if they earn less than $18,200, they will pay no tax at all.


Self-funded retirees—a very vocal group in my community who make sure that I know their concerns—who receive the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card, will also receive an upfront lump-sum payment in June to help over the coming time, because, as we do admit, the pricing signals associated with this pricing pollution will have an impact on people. We are trying to change behaviour. That is why there will be an impact. But they too will receive $250 as part of the seniors supplement. Obviously, the low-income households on $30,000 a year or a couple earning less than $45,000 a year could be eligible for a yearly lump-sum payment of $300.


In question time today, mention was made of an article in the West Australian by one of the Leader of the Opposition's colleagues, questioning his negativity, his ability to say no, no, no all the time. There was even a suggestion that some of his colleagues want to rehabilitate him in terms of his inclination to say no. Obviously that would be a very big project and obviously they have started that process. They tried to make him go to rehab but he said, 'No, no, no.' That is what he said. He was not even able to say yes to the pensioners in his electorate, yes to the families in his electorate, yes to the people in the low-income households in his electorate, or yes to the pensioners who need this $250 to $380 to help them with cost-of-living pressures. Instead, he relies on no.

"Tudge, Alan, MP",LP,2012-05-30,"



Mr TUDGE
 (Aston) (16:15):  I rise to also speak on this matter of public importance. It asks us to discuss the facts about the carbon tax. We on this side of the House are very happy about the facts about the carbon tax. In fact, we will talk about them day in, day out right up until the next election and beyond. The first fact we should know about the carbon tax is that it was introduced based on a lie. Every single one of us in this House, with the exception of the few Independents, went to the election in 2010 saying that we would not introduce a carbon tax if we were elected to this parliament. That was every single member on this side of the House and every member on that side of the House.


The Prime Minister famously said a few days before the last election that, if she was elected Prime Minister, there would be no carbon tax under a government that she led. It will be a statement that will follow her until the end of her political time in this parliament because that is the basis of the lie. This is the first fact that we need to discuss whenever we discuss the facts about the carbon tax.


The second fact that we should be discussing about the carbon tax is that it will have enormous economic pain on this nation at a time when we can least afford it. It will have pain in at least two ways. It will have pain by putting upward pressure on the cost of living and it will cause pain with job losses across the community. Let me address that first one about putting upward pressure on the cost of living for everyday families. You just have to look at the government's own figures. They have tabled the modelling to which the member for Chifley referred, and that modelling itself says that the carbon tax will cause electricity prices to increase by 10 per cent in the first year alone. That modelling says that it will cause gas prices to increase by nine per cent in the first year alone.


There is modelling from other independent agencies that say it will cause Australian made motor vehicles to increase in price by $400. There is modelling by the Master Builders Association that says that it will increase the cost of a newly built house in Australia by $5,000. We know of other modelling that says that rates will go up by at least one to 1½ per cent. In my own electorate, which covers most of the Knox municipality, they have already made the decision to increase rates by $1½ million for the residents of Knox due to the carbon tax. That is a 1½ per cent increase on the rates for every single residence across my electorate.


These price increases are when the carbon tax is at $23 per tonne in the first year. But we know that the carbon tax is legislated to increase to $29 per tonne by 2016 and that it is forecast to go up to $37 per tonne by 2020 and then up to an incredible $350 per tonne by 2050. We talk about the price impact today on electricity, on gas, on rates, on house prices and on motor vehicles, but what about when it gets to $29 or $37 or up to $350? The prices will just continue to go up and up and up and up. The previous speaker, the member for Moreton, said the whole point of this was to put up prices. That is the whole point of the carbon tax regime. It is actually to put up prices. At least the Prime Minister had the honesty to admit this when, back at the beginning of 2011, she said:


I want to be very clear with Australians about what pricing carbon does. It has price impacts, it's meant to—that's the whole point.


That is exactly right. It is the whole point that it puts prices up and these prices will go up across the board and they will continue to go up as the carbon tax goes up from $23 per tonne right up to $350 per tonne by 2050. 


I mentioned the impact on jobs. We have also had some economic modelling done by the Treasury departments in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and elsewhere. In Queensland, under Anna Bligh's premiership, they did some modelling and said that the carbon tax would cost Queensland 21,000 jobs. In Victoria it would be 23,000 jobs according to the Victorian Treasury modelling. In New South Wales it would be 31,000 jobs.


Let us have a look at the government's own modelling and the aluminium industry figures in the government's package, which says that the impact of the carbon tax will halve the aluminium industry. But, in the government's own figures, perhaps the most astounding number of them all—and the government does not like to talk about this—is that between now and 2050 the carbon tax will decrease our GDP by $1 trillion between now and 2050. To put that into context, that is the equivalent of a whole year's worth of economic output between now and 2050. So, for every single Australian between now and 2050, one of your year's of work will just disappear because of the impact of the carbon tax. To suggest that it will not have any impact on jobs to lose a year's worth of output is, frankly, preposterous. But it is right there in the government's numbers.


Let me go to the third fact. I have pointed out the first fact about it being based on a lie and I have discussed the second fact about it having a tremendous economic impact in relation to cost-of-living pressures and jobs. The third fact in relation to the carbon tax is that the compensation will be insufficient for the carbon tax impact in very many cases. It will certainly be insufficient for all of the other price impacts which this government are having through their various other policies.


We know, for example, that, in their own words, at least 40 per cent of Australians will be worse off as a result of this carbon tax package. That includes, for example, a person who might be earning $90,000 as an electrician and who is married to somebody who is earning $30,000 as a part-time retail assistant. A family with those incomes would receive $306 in compensation, according to the government, but would be hit by $681 by the carbon tax—that is, they would be $375 worse off each and every year. And this, of course, is reliant upon the government modelling being accurate, when we know that in previous years the government's forecasts have been far from accurate. Two years ago they said that this year's deficit was going to be $12 billion and, of course, it has ended up being $45 billion. So we question whether that modelling will be correct.


There are, of course, an array of other areas where the government is putting upward pressure on prices. It is putting upward pressure on prices through the 22 other taxes which it has introduced in the last four or five years. It has been putting upward pressure on families' cost of living by reducing family tax benefits and eliminating the entrepreneurs tax offset. It is also changing the policy settings in child care, in the private health insurance rebate and in shipping reforms, which makes things more expensive. And, of course, in its macro settings it is making the economy less productive overall. The carbon tax, though, is the worst of it all. To address cost-of-living pressures we must get rid of the carbon tax and we must change this government.

"O'Neill, Deb, MP",ALP,2012-05-30,"



Ms O'NEILL
 (Robertson) (16:25):  I just want to put on the record that, while the member for Aston has spoken against the assistance that is going to families, for my part, in the seat of Robertson, I actually believe that my families really do want this money. I know that those who have already received it are extremely appreciative of the support from the federal government.


The member for Aston, opposite, has actually just made a speech against 9,000 families in his own electorate. That is 9,000 families that the member for Aston says do not need assistance with the cost of living. Now, I did hear some facts—a few facts—in the speech we have just heard about the real pressure that there is on families. We do acknowledge that there are cost-of-living pressures. That is why we are actually doing something about it and practically helping those people—even the 9,000 families in the member for Aston's seat, whom he seems not to want to help in any way.


Yesterday we started delivering extra money to more than 16,000 pensioners from that same electorate. I am sure that those pensioners will be very, very happy to receive that assistance to help them with cost-of-living pressures. I would like to make a comment about the small businesses in the seat of Aston, which could find that the pressure being taken off local families and off local pensioners actually does something—dare I hope for this—to inspire a little confidence and put a little positivity back into the public place instead of the carping, mindless negativity and the permanent nay-saying—the no, no, no, no—that we get day-in and day-out in this place from the Leader of the Opposition.


So let us get the facts straight—because this is a debate about facts, not hysteria. The member for Aston is telling 9,000 families and 16,000 pensioners in his electorate that they do not deserve extra support to make ends meet. He is telling them that if the coalition parties actually get into government that he and the Leader of the Opposition will rip off them every single cent that they have seen in their accounts this week. That is the fact. There is a very, very big difference between those on the other side—the take-it-away Tories—and the Labor Party, who are actually supporting people who live real lives in real seats like yours and mine, Mr Deputy Speaker.


I am delighted to speak today on the urgent need to provide households with financial relief based on facts surrounding the introduction of a carbon price on 1 July, and I very much thank the member for Chifley for putting this matter of public importance on the record. The Gillard government is building a strong economy for all Australians. We are making tough decisions that have to be made when you are in government. Sometimes in my role as a parent I do not always want to make tough decisions but, in the long term, there are moments where you have to make a choice. And we have made decisions that will ensure that we remain the strongest-performing economy in the world.


The facts are that unemployment is very low, inflation is very low and official interest rates are very low. In fact, for the first time in 40 years all of those indicators are under five per cent. That is a definite sign of a very strong economy, an economy in which Australians should have confidence and hope. But, while they are having a bit of trouble with managing the cost of living, we are going to help them—and we are going to do this despite the whimpering, the whining and the wrecking of those opposite. The thing that marks us out as so different from those opposite is that we actually do understand that families and pensioners are feeling the pinch. We understand that the relentless negativity campaign has only served to benefit the few—those on the opposite side who want to whinge day in, day out—while it has hurt business and consumer confidence. There is nothing good about that for businesses in my electorate and there is nothing good about that for ordinary families, pensioners and self-funded retirees in my electorate.


I am very proud to be a member of the Labor Party and the Labor government committed to helping Australians with the reality of cost of living pressures. We stand in stark contrast to those opposite, who assail the public with the same platitudes and negative comments, trash-talking the economy day in and day out. We understand that, by putting a price on carbon, 500 polluters are basically going to pay to put out the trash. That is the sort of trash that we should be paying attention to, not the trash-talking of the opposition. They are polluting, so they are going to pay—500 of them.


We know that businesses do pass on costs. That affects prices. The Treasury has made it very clear that there will be a 0.7 per cent price impact. Let's get this fact straight: we are making polluters pay. Let's get this fact straight: we are helping families in electorates right across this country, even if the members who represent them do not want them to have that money. We know for a fact that families in Robertson, my electorate, and all across the country deserve support. They do not appreciate all these hollow media stunts. We are giving the support—that is a fact. Another fact: how many households are we going to help? Under our clean energy future package, we are actually going to help six million households, who will get their expected average cost increases fully covered by tax cuts or increased payments, or both. The fact is that there will be changes to tax. So, if anybody is listening to this, remember that you will be benefiting from the tripling of the tax-free threshold. That means that one million people will not have to lodge a tax return after 1 July. Eighteen thousand two hundred dollars is what you will be able to earn before you have to pay one cent of tax. Imagine that. Imagine one million Australians not having to fill in a tax return. This is going to improve their lives, not just because, I am sure, they will be happy to not have to undertake that paperwork but because they will have more money in their pay packets every single week.


Let's get another fact on the record. Because of the Labor government's commitment to put a price on carbon, you get to keep every cent you earn up to $18,200. Another fact: in Robertson I have about 56,000 people who pay tax and about 47,000 of those taxpayers in my electorate are going to receive a tax cut. Of that 47,000, at least 38,000 will receive a tax cut of at least $300. I know that right now probably some mums and dads are on the Central Coast driving around, taking kids to sport—to soccer or AFL, with the Tigers at West Gosford—or maybe they are going to dancing lessons at Erina. One of the things that they will be thinking about is how they are going to make ends meet. They can be assured. The fact is that money is going into their accounts to assist them with the cost of living. Mums and dads who are returning to part-time work after the birth of a child and people who might be semi-retired and still want to work are going to have the factual advantage of money in their pocket because of the changes that we are bringing in.


More than 10,600 families in Robertson are going to receive extra cash through their family assistance payments. This will absolutely make sure that families on the Central Coast will be able to manage their family budgets. We want to take a bit of pressure off the family. We want to give families the best chance to get a good start in life. So we are helping them. That is a fact. Right across the country we are helping them. One point six million families are going to get assistance because of the price on carbon. If families get family tax benefit A, they will get $110 per child. If they get family tax benefit B, they will get $69 per child. In fact, most of the families in my electorate have already received that.


What have we heard from the Leader of the Opposition? He is going to get rid of the carbon price. He says that loudly, but do you know what? We do not hear that, when he does that, he is going to put his hand into the pockets of these millions of families and take away all of the assistance that we are giving them. We are going to see a massive impact if that comes to be, not only through a lack of vision for our country but through a real, practical, negative impact on people in the electorate of Robertson and right around this country.


We know that a price on carbon is the right thing to do. It is a tough thing to do, but it builds a future for this nation that gives us a strong economic base. We absolutely understand, as the member for Chifley stated in his matter of public importance today, that we need to deal in fact, and the fact is: families need assistance with the cost of living and we are delivering that. The fact is in their bank balances right now.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2012-05-30,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (16:35):  There is a word which must never be spoken in this place whenever Labor refers to carbon pricing. It is the word 'tax'. I call on those opposite to just once call this insidious policy what it is: a tax. A tax is a tax is a tax. In the days after the 2010 election, Julia Gillard gleefully shrilled, 'Let's draw back the curtains and let the sun shine in.' She was talking about the openness of government and the importance of Australians being fully informed about the decisions of their parliament and the government of the day. She said Labor was a party of truth tellers. If this rhetoric—this hyperbole, as she would probably call it—applies to anything, it should include the impact of the decision by the Prime Minister to introduce a carbon tax. Just five days out from the election, she said, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' The Prime Minister has already broken that 16 August promise, that there would be no carbon tax, but this is no reason for us not to let the sun shine in by ensuring that all Australians understand the full impact of the carbon tax.


I point out the very wording of this matter of public importance. It talks about 'the urgent need to provide households with financial relief based on facts surrounding the introduction of a carbon tax on July 1'—a carbon price, sorry. I have used the word 'tax'. The member for Chifley would not use the word 'tax', but that is what it is. If there is such an urgent need to provide households with financial relief, why bring it in in the first place? Why burden families, farmers, businesses—ordinary, everyday hardworking Australians—with a tax the Prime Minister said, five days before the election, that she would not introduce?


But we all know that this government likes to tax. The regulator in New South Wales has confirmed that, thanks largely to the carbon tax, families and businesses will pay an average 16 per cent more on their electricity bills, adding between $182 and $381 to the average household bill. The federal government knows businesses will pass these extra costs on to their customers—you, me and all other Australians. The government claims to be compensating Australians with additional compensation but even its own modelling shows that millions of households will be worse off. The best way for citizens to know whether or not they are getting enough compensation is to ensure transparency—a word those opposite probably do not know the meaning of—in the price rises the people of Australia are going to be hit with. But there is nothing transparent about this government.


Their latest compensation for the carbon tax is nothing but a con. This is a carbon tax Australians did not vote for. Hardly anybody in this place voted for it. The member for Melbourne certainly came to the election with a view that a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme—call it what you like—was necessary. I often hear the member for Lyne grumbling behind me and saying, 'It's not just the member for Melbourne.' Maybe he too was in support of it. That is two out of 150 representatives in this place. The rest of us were against it. The rest of us went to the people at the election saying that there would not be a carbon tax under the government we were in. The regional independents have sold out their constituencies by siding with Labor and the Greens and propped up the government. On 24 February 2011 we had that awful press conference where Senator Bob Brown, the Greens leader and quasi-Prime Minister at the time, almost shouldered Prime Minister Gillard out of the way and proudly announced that there was going to be a price on carbon—a tax.


Labor can try to make itself feel better about the burden it is placing on Australia through the introduction of this tax but it should not. Every Labor member—members who claim to represent the disadvantaged members of society and some who even claim to represent regional areas—should be ashamed of the cost they are lumping on everyday, ordinary Australians. They are making people disadvantaged. The best way—in fact, the only way—to ensure that Australians are not crippled by this terrible, insidious tax is to scrap it. The claim that this compensation will assist Australians with the financial pressure they will feel under a carbon tax is sheer nonsense. It is a ridiculous money-go-round. It is wealth redistribution by any other name. Many dual-income families will be worse off once they reach the typical income of a school teacher and a shop assistant or that of a policeman and a part-time nurse. Self-funded retirees who do not qualify for a Commonwealth Seniors Health Card, including all those under the age of 65, will receive nothing. For what? It is not going to reduce the sea levels or change the shoreline by so much as a millimetre. It is not going to drop global temperatures by so much as a degree. It is just a nonsense. The longer this tax is in place, the worse the consequences will be for the economy, jobs, families and, certainly, regional Australia. The compensation simply will not be enough to outweigh the extra costs Australians will be hit with.


Australia will pay the carbon tax through higher electricity prices. The member for Robertson talked about people who would be driving their kids to sport—and they would be. In her electorate of Robertson they would also be driving them to dancing practice and those sorts of things. The member for Robertson represents an area which is under 1,000 square kilometres. My area, the Riverina, is over 60,000 square kilometres and I know that people in my area are going to be paying this carbon tax through the petrol bowser, as will the people in the member for Robertson's electorate. When people travel for sport, dancing classes and all those sorts of things in the Riverina it is not just a little drive down the road. Sometimes it takes hours to get from point A to point B to have a game of footy for the kids or dancing competitions for those young ones who enjoy it. Unfortunately, those young ones who enjoy their footy and their dancing may well not be able to do that, because for some families the cost pressures will be too high.


This carbon tax is going to be paid for by everybody: through the power point, the bowser and—certainly in Wagga Wagga, Coolamon shire and Griffith—through their rates, because their rubbish tips are deemed to be over that threshold limit of 25,000 tonnes. Following this year's deferment by the Treasurer, they are eventually going to be forced to pay a carbon tax through their rates. That is just totally ridiculous. I could do no better than to quote an article from the Daily Advertiser, Wagga's local newspaper. They have called for heavy polluters to be punished, not everyone. As the Daily Advertiser quite rightly pointed out, it is just a load of rot that the local ratepayers are going to be forced to pay a carbon tax because they have to take rubbish to their tip. Wagga Wagga City Council is now going to be put right up there with Orica, BHP Billiton, Xstrata and the rest as one of Australia's biggest polluters. When you think about it, those companies that I mentioned are not 'biggest polluters'—they are job creators. They are taking jobs to the people, taking resources out of the ground and creating wealth for this country, and they are being hammered by the government over there which is only interested in creating class warfare that is not needed.


Recently, Wagga's annual emissions were reduced to 28,000 tonnes per year. This is good news for Wagga because, instead of having to pay over a million dollars in proposed carbon tax payments, they are only going to have to pay $660,000 in the year after next. That is $660,000 that will not be spent on fixing potholes, on children's playground equipment or on libraries. That is ridiculous. As Tim Blair pointed out on Monday, 14 May in the Daily Telegraph:


One tonne of rubbish, according to the government, generates one tonne of carbon tax windfall gas. You might want to ask your own council how many tonnes of rubbish it's piling up every year. If the amount is close to the 25,000 tonne tax threshold, you'd actually be doing the council a favour by throwing your old mattresses and televisions in the river. Dump car bodies in the scrub and save the town library.


Is that what we want from this government which purports to be so environmentally friendly? Is that what we want from this government which is cobbled together by the Greens here in the lower house and definitely in the upper house, where they are led by the nose by Christine Milne and all the rest, and Adam Bandt? It is a disgrace that we have to have a carbon tax when the Prime Minister said five days out from the election that there would be no carbon tax under the government she led. It is an absolute con. It is a disgrace, and those members opposite know it.

"Griggs, Natasha, MP",CLP,2012-05-30,"



Mrs GRIGGS
 (Solomon) (16:45):  I rise to talk on this matter of public importance because I think the public does have a right to know exactly what is going on here. What we know is that this government is being very coy with the facts. Let us remember it was this Prime Minister who said, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead'—a solemn promise that she made to all Australians at the last election. Here we have less than a month until we have a carbon tax. This is a government that is spending $270,000 a day—$36 million—on advertisements about the carbon tax. It talks about the cash bribes but does not actually mention what they are about, but the public knows it is all about the world's biggest carbon tax, Labor's toxic carbon tax.


Everyone knows that Labor's toxic carbon tax will cascade right through the economy, and that is why Labor are desperately out there spending up and calling it compensation. Despite Labor's lie that only the big emitters will pay the price, the cost of virtually everything will go up and up and up. We know it is not just the big emitters; it is everyday Australians who will pay the price for the carbon tax. Like many Australians, I am very concerned about the increases in electricity, petrol prices and the council rate increases that Territorians and, indeed, all Australians will face from 1 July because of the Gillard Labor government's carbon tax, which will cause us to have the world's highest electricity prices.


Australian household electricity prices have already increased by 40 per cent since 2007 and are predicted to go up by at least another 10 per cent in the first year of the carbon tax. Fact No. 1: Territorians will be slugged more for electricity because Power and Water, our only electricity provider, was included on the carbon tax hit list. It is considered one of Australia's biggest polluters, providing electricity to 200,000 plus people. From 1 July Territory families will be slugged on average an extra $2.61 a week for electricity under the carbon tax. Territorians will clearly be worse off under the carbon tax, and the carbon tax compensation being handed out will not be enough for many families.


The government's own figures indicate that thousands of Territorian households will be worse off under the carbon tax. Their own figures indicate that 40 per cent of Australians will not receive compensation. Let me share some examples with you. Tiffany V, a constituent of mine, last week told my staff she received a text message to say that she has had $69.35 paid into her account as part of the household assistance payment. This is her quote: 'Honestly, Labor Party, that tiny amount going in to help with your carbon tax? Stop kidding yourselves.' She then went on to say that her latest power bill jumped by $250, her most expensive bill yet—and the carbon tax is not even there.


We all know that the carbon tax will act as the wrecking ball across the Territory economy and Territorians will be paying for it through increased prices, higher energy bills and pressure on local businesses that are already experiencing high cost of living pressures.


I have spoken in this place many times about petrol and how this carbon tax is a tax on remoteness. Everything in the Northern Territory is freighted in. We are completely and utterly dependent on freight and freight companies. Everything from fruit, veg and general groceries to building materials is transported into the Territory by road, rail or air. There is a lot of this freight that comes in by diesel road trains, and we all know that that will be affected by the carbon tax. This toxic tax is definitely a tax on remoteness.


Do not take my word for it. I have a letter here from Toll, which is putting Territorian customers on notice that freight costs are likely to go up because of the carbon tax. This is not going to be a good thing for Territorians. Our cost of living is already high, and Territorians tell me every day that they do not support a carbon tax. They tell me that a carbon tax will not do anything for the environment. It will only push up cost of living pressures—something that Territorians are already struggling with.


Lyn, another constituent of mine, says she is worried about the electricity and whether she will be able to afford the increase of $2.61 a week under the carbon tax. She is married with no children and will not receive any compensation. I have also heard from Palmerston residents Megan and Scott Smith, who have three children, a mortgage and a dog. They have done the figures, and the carbon tax compensation that they get will not cover their costs. They tell me they already forgo meat on a regular basis because it is too expensive, so any further cost increases will be detrimental to them. Then there are John and Sarah, who are a single-income family with two children under five from the northern suburbs. They have worked out that the compensation simply will not be enough to outweigh the extra costs that they will be hit with. Their household salary is $85,000. Or there is northern suburbs construction worker Clint and his public servant wife. They have one son, a mortgage and two dogs, and they are a typical family. Combined income for them is $130,000 a year, so they are not eligible for any carbon tax compensation. Fishing is their favourite family pastime, but they fear that it may be jeopardised because of the carbon tax and the extra increases in fuel. They do not consider themselves rich; they consider themselves average, hardworking Territorians who want a fair go, and they want to be properly compensated by this government. They do not want a carbon tax.


Every day I am told how people in my electorate are worried about meeting their home loan repayments and that the Gillard Labor government is now making people pay more for energy, fuel and food because of the Prime Minister's carbon tax lie. Hardworking families are already doing it tough. How are they going to budget for another few hundred dollars in their spending?


What about small business? Small business is, as we know, the engine room of our economy. The Territory's small business operators are worried that this toxic carbon tax will spell the end for them. Small businesses will receive no compensation for the carbon tax, and they are in the firing line with average weekly cost increases of $15.80 from the carbon price and $13.38 through an increase in power and water charges. Of course, small businesses will be forced to pass on these added expenses to the consumer, and the business owners tell me that they are burdened by a drop in consumer spending.


This government does not understand that, if businesses are hit by the carbon tax, of course they will have to pass it on, and that that means everyday Territorians will be paying extra for electricity, food and fuel under a carbon tax. I have spoken to private airline operators, builders, building equipment suppliers, fish-and-chip shop owners, grocers, butchers, florists and market stall owners, and they have all told me the same thing: this tax will make their costs go up and they will have to pass on these costs to everyday Territorians.


I was very concerned to hear that this tax will be the final nail in the coffin of some businesses. A few weeks ago, a local business operator who employs 13 people and who earns around $85,000 a year wrote to me saying that Julia Gillard's 'lie' will hurt his business. He is 59 years old, and his wife is 70. She cannot receive a pension because he works, yet, like most Territorian families, they still have a mortgage. He wanted to know why he was not eligible for the welfare gift, and he is angry that Julia Gillard and Wayne Swan consider him to be rich. He told me that he does not know how he will manage his operating costs or how he and his wife will survive. These are real-life Territory examples of people who are doing it tough and who are genuinely concerned about the Gillard Labor government's carbon tax promise.


As I have said time and time again in this place, families will be better off under a coalition government because we will remove the carbon tax and deliver real tax cuts. Only a coalition government will give Australia hope, reward and opportunity, because we on this side of the House do not support a carbon tax. Only a coalition government will deliver to Australians an Australia free of a carbon tax.

"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2012-05-30,"



Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff) (19:00):  I am mindful of the time of night, so I will keep my remarks fairly succinct. What we know is that it is forecast that as a direct result of the operation of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation taxpayers have a default rate of 7½ per cent of the forecast expenditure by CEFC. Seven-and-a-half per cent of the forecast expenditure equates to $150 million a year of losses. Two billion dollars has been allocated to CEFC each year over five years—that is a $10 billion investment. Of that $10 billion it is predicted that at least $750 million of taxpayers' money will be lost as a result of defaults. That is the starting point—$750 million of taxpayer losses. I would say that if you go into a deal where the government says right up front, 'We're going to lose $750 million of taxpayers' funds and that's our starting point', then it gives some indication of this government's cavalier approach to the industry. But the way they try to defend it is to say, 'Yes, but we're probably going to seek to have a bond rate return on the total pool of investments'.


We had the opportunity as part of the committee inquiry to test the basis on which the government makes its forecast. We looked at two crucial elements. The first question was: where does the 7½ per cent default target rate come from? The answer: 'We do not know; it is effectively a direction from the government'. I would love to hear the minister account for this because the 7½ per cent default rate is not based on best practice, it is not based on international benchmarks and it is not based on prior experience. It is only based on a direction from the government to the departments of Treasury and climate change. The second question was: on what basis is the benchmark made of a bond rate return, of three or four per cent return on the total amount of pooled funds? Where does that come from? Lo and behold, it comes from the same source. It is not based on international benchmarks, it is not based on global experience, and it is not based on any kind of analysis or modelling. Rather, it is a consequence of direction again from the executive arm of the parliament down to the departments that that will be the forecast rate. So the reality of the operation of the CEFC is that there actually could be substantially higher losses. Instead of being a starting point of $750 million of lost taxpayers' funds, it could amount to being billions of dollars of lost taxpayers' funds. Instead of the return being a three or four per cent return it could in reality be a return of negative three or four per cent, because the only people who have made this decision thus far are the minister and I guess a coterie of people around him. And that is it!


Australian taxpayers need to understand that the Australian Labor Party is committing them to a $10 billion level of expenditure for the government to pick winners when it comes to clean energy technology. That should ring alarm bells. It rings alarm bells with the opposition. It rings alarm bells with the Liberal members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics who participated in the inquiry, but it does not ring alarm bells on the opposite side because it is just business as usual. It is just standard, typical practice from a government that has become fat and lazy when it comes to dealing with taxpayers' funds. That is the concern that I and others have.


But more than that, make no mistake, the whole basis on which CEFC will operate is fundamentally flawed because, again from the evidence before the inquiry, it is clear that the sole purpose of the operation of the CEFC is to provide a taxpayer subsidy for clean tech that otherwise will not be commercially funded. They are called barriers to entry or barriers to investment. The Labor Party cannot have its cake and eat it too. You cannot say, 'Well, there is a market failure here, there is a reason why these start-ups, these commercialised entities, cannot receive private sector finance and that is because it is too risky and too pricey for these ventures to be funded. That is why we are going to suddenly come in like the cavalry with a $10 billion fund,' but then at the same time say, 'No, there's not a heightened level of risk, it's okay'. The reality is this is a risky venture right from day one, which is why the Labor Party says, 'We expect a 7½ per cent default—that is, we expect taxpayers to lose $750 million, which could actually be substantially higher'.


This is a government with a bad track record. It is a government that now thinks it knows better than the private sector when it comes to investing in clean tech. It is a government which, as the very basic starting point for CEFC, acknowledges that these institutions, companies, or whatever they might actually be, cannot secure private sector funding at the level required to make a go of it. That is the whole rationale for this $10 billion fund and that is the reason why the coalition will rip it apart, because it is bad policy, it is bad use of taxpayers' money and it is Australian taxpayers that wear the risk of this investment, not the private sector. I am very pleased to say that we do not support this jaunt. We do not support risking $10 billion of taxpayers' money and we do not support a starting point that says we are going to lose $750 million—a figure that has just materialised out of thin air and is not actually based on international benchmarks.


The final point lies with why this is actually taking place. I said I would be relatively brief, so I will finalise on this point. It is the opportunity cost associated with the operation of the CEFC. We already know the government is taking it off budget. We know the government has used tricky legislative implementation to ensure that they make it as difficult as possible for a subsequent government that would seek to repeal this particular agency. It is Australians who will have to finance this through borrowed funds. So this little jaunt down the road of being venture capitalists, which is effectively what the CEFC will be, this little jaunt at the direction of the minister at the table, the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, will see Aussie kids for the next 20 years having even more debt to pay off to pay for this little venture capital expedition that the minister and others want to go on. They are the ones in whose apparent cause we are trying to do our little bit to clean the environment, even though the rest of the world is continuing to pollute. It is in their interests, apparently, that all this is taking place, yet they always seem to avoid the little asterisk at the end of that sentence, which is that the next generation of Australians will be paying all the debt and interest associated with this $10 billion junket.


I am pleased to stand opposed to the CEFC. It is a bad decision. The government should not be in the business of thinking that it is smarter than the private sector because, if there is one thing that we have learned time and time again, it is that governments are not. I have absolute knowledge about one thing, and that is that this government certainly is not.

"Combet, Greg, MP",ALP,2012-05-30,"



Mr COMBET
 (Charlton—Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (19:08):  The House has been debating the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill 2012, the Clean Energy Legislation Amendment Bill 2012, the Clean Energy (Customs Tariff Amendment) Bill 2012 and the Clean Energy (Excise Tariff Legislation Amendment) Bill 2012. This is a very important package of legislation, and it continues to implement the Gillard government's historic reforms to build a clean energy future.


I thank all members for their contribution to the second reading debate on each of these bills and the associated legislation, although I should observe that some of the contributions really have been quite misleading and misrepresentative of the purposes of the legislation. One only has to consider the accusation of governments picking winners to recognise what nonsense has really been spoken by some of those on the other side of the House. In fact, the opposition has a policy called Direct Action, which is picking winners. What we are doing here with the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill is establishing a corporation, vesting it with funds that will operate independent of government according to an investment mandate and make investments on a commercial basis. To suggest otherwise just completely misrepresents the legislation.


I would also like to thank members of the House Standing Committee on Economics, particularly the chair, the member for Parramatta, for the inquiry that has been conducted into the legislation which built on the extensive consultation that the expert review panel, chaired by Jillian Broadbent, a Reserve Bank of Australia board member, undertook from October last year to March this year.


The Clean Energy Finance Corporation is a very important part of the government's clean energy future plan. It will encourage private investment and help overcome financial barriers that were clearly articulated in the review report that was chaired by Jillian Broadbent to commercialising and deploying cleaner energy technologies. The fact of the matter, as was identified in the review report, is that investment in clean energy technologies often faces a range of obstacles in attracting financing. I outlined those obstacles in my second reading speech.


The corporation will capitalise private finance into Australia's clean energy sector, renewable energy and low emissions technology using financial products and structures that address those financial barriers. They could include the provision of loans, loan guarantees or equity investments, but the corporation will operate on a commercial basis. The corporation, as I indicated earlier, will operate independently from government also, and it will focus on bringing private finance into the financing of renewable energy and low emissions technology investments. It is not expected to be the sole financier. In this way, it will build investor confidence in the clean energy sector.


It is also important to note just in summary that the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, the carbon price mechanism and the renewable energy target have all been designed to complement each other and, in order to facilitate the investments that need to be made in renewable energy, in low emissions technologies, in clean energy and in energy efficiency, to work together so that we achieve the goal of reducing our emissions, meeting our international obligations and achieving a 20 per cent renewable energy target by the year 2020 at lowest cost to the economy. These components of policy will work effectively together.


Finally, in relation to the Clean Energy Legislation Amendment Bill and the two other associated bills, it is important to note that the amendment bill will provide for something that the gaseous fuels industry has been asking for and consulting with the government for quite a period of time. It is something that came out of the inquiry into the clean energy bills last year—that is, to facilitate the opportunity for LPG, LNG and CNG to come underneath the carbon price mechanism rather than fuel excise arrangements. CNG, according to this bill and consequent upon its passage through parliament, will come under the carbon price mechanism from 1 July this year, and LPG and LNG will come under the carbon price mechanism from 1 July 2013. The amendments in the amendment bill and the associated bills principally deal with that issue.


With those remarks in summary, I commend the bills to the House.

Mr MORRISON
 (Cook) (19:34):  Sydney airport is a key driver of our local shire and economy, providing jobs for thousands in aviation and related industries. My constituents have a great interest in securing the airport's ongoing success, and planning for future infrastructure needs will be critical to that success. We have now reached the point where a second Sydney airport is no longer a bold vision, like the Sydney Harbour Bridge was when it was planned and built, but an overdue necessity.


The Joint study on aviation capacity for the Sydney region report details two alarming warnings for my electorate and the Sydney community. Without a supplementary second airport there is no ability for Sydney to grow our aviation capacity to realise our future opportunities and noise sharing at KSA will effectively be impossible within 18 months. In order to sustain Sydney as the aviation hub it is today, a second supplementary airport is critical to ensuring Sydney's continued dominance and prominence in aviation. Even on conservative estimates, demand for aviation services in the Sydney region will double to nearly 88 million passenger movements by 2035 and to 165 million passengers by 2060. International experience suggests that for every million passengers airports generate a thousand jobs. The most immediate employment benefits fall within the local area. Yet, without a second supplementary airport, on its current trajectory KSA's ability to grow new services will leave Sydney short.


The status quo is not an acceptable solution for the airport needs of a major city of Sydney's global stature in the 21st century. If future aviation demand cannot be met, by 2060 we will have lost almost $60 billion in forgone expenditure and $34 billion in forgone gross domestic product. The New South Wales economy alone would forego $17.5 billion in gross state product. We are running out of time. Even if the site was fixed upon tonight, the timeline for developing and building something of this magnitude could be in the order of 15 years.


It is imperative this government makes a decision on a site for a second supplementary airport for Sydney before the next election. It is a federal decision, not a state decision. Once decided we must work positively with the state government and not seek to fit up that government with all of the associated land based transport infrastructure costs. Seeking a blank cheque commitment in advance from the New South Wales government for a site yet undetermined by the federal government is not practical and not helpful. No wonder the New South Wales Premier is proposing that the second Sydney airport not even be in the same state let alone in the same city. He has some experience in being fit up by this government for major transport projects.


Without a second airport our capacity to share aircraft noise in Sydney would also be compromised. It is bewildering for my constituents why, when we are blessed with a coastline and a swathe of national park, aircraft on rivet 9 flight path still fly over Caringbah, Lilli Pilli, Grays Point and Cronulla, or oceanic arrivals fly loops over our southern suburbs before 6 am, or Boree 4 flights take the land rather than the water leg when they could route over vacant parkland or sea instead without disturbing anyone.


The long-term operating plan introduced by the Howard government, supported by the legislated cap and curfew introduced by the government, has been a productive initiative to share aircraft noise and maintain community support for our airport. It is a critical component of the compact with the Sydney community to deliver peaceful and prosperous coexistence between the airport and local communities. LTOP rates rotate 10 different modes of runway use through the day to offer a reprieve to residents under the flight paths. Ministerial direction includes that the proposed changes to the elements of the plan should be tested with the public through the Sydney Airport Community Forum before being implemented. In this respect, I want to pay tribute to Mr John Woods and the special community representative, Kevin Hill, who serve on that forum. I was therefore particularly disturbed by the joint committee's recommendation that LTOP be reviewed to determine new, more effective measures of aircraft noise impacts and respite rather than the current runway-end movements. 


LTOP is clearly over. The report admits growth and operations at KSA will lead to loss of the capacity to share noise and provide respite. By 2015 nine hours of the weekday will have demand levels exceeding 55 movements per hour, the approximate point beyond which the LTOP noise-sharing modes can no longer be operated and parallel runway operations are required. By 2020 the report forecast that demand at all hours between 7 am and 8 pm, save for two hours in the afternoon, will exceed that aircraft movement limit. The only opportunities for respite would be after 8 pm and a small window on the weekend.


Details of this review process are still unavailable. The last thing anyone wants is a return to the days when parallel runways were used, as the former transport minister Mark Vaile said, like the deck of an aircraft carrier in a war zone. With or without a second airport, we need to set our minds to developing LTOP mark 2. We need a new deal and a fair deal for all Sydney communities and we need a decision on a second supplementary airport as soon as possible . Both of these initiatives have my very strong support.

Mr TUDGE
 (Aston) (09:39):  Sport is a massive part of our culture. We watch it, we follow it and we participate in it in great numbers. In my electorate of Aston we participate in all types of sport in enormous numbers. It is one of the real strengths of our community, because big sporting clubs, in concert with the churches, are the major social hubs where people of multiple generations come together and where young people are kept active.


But we have a problem in Knox with our core sporting infrastructure, which is not universally keeping up with demand.

Mr TUDGE:
  The problem is with our core infrastructure not universally keeping up with the demands. This problem is in part caused by population growth with more people wanting to participate, but it is also caused in part just naturally, because a lot of the infrastructure was built 30 or 40 years ago when the suburbs were being built and their time for renewal has come. Helping to build the sporting infrastructure in Knox to cater for the demands should be a priority for us. I know in Knox Gardens, the Knox Falcons Football Club, for example, is seeking to improve their second oval for the junior football club. I have spoken at length to Lee Metherell and Mark Fisher about this. Similarly, at the Scoresby Oval there is a desire for improved lighting so that they can extend the use of their great facilities there. I have spoken at length to our largest junior football club, the Rowville Hawks, and its president, Darren Humphries, about their expansion plans, and similarly with the St Simons Knights' facilities. Bayswater, Boronia and Wantirna South clubs all have some pretty good facilities right now but of course they always have further plans. A new club, Lysterfield Wolves, wants to get further established.


Similarly, with the soccer clubs, they have grown rapidly and they do not have the facilities which can cater for their capacity at the moment, and this includes Knox United and the Knox Churches soccer clubs. On the weekend, the vice-president of the Rowville Netball Club, Grant Atkinson, was speaking to me about his desire for all-weather facilities for the netball club. I could keep going.

  There are too many projects to do overnight, and I have not mentioned them all today. We need to continue to remind governments at all levels that these facilities do not just provide benefit to the direct users but have extensive flow-on effects for the entire community in terms of keeping people active and younger people engaged. For that reason, I will continue to fight to ensure that we have the infrastructure capacity in Knox to meet the growing demand.

Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (10:51):  I speak in support of the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Digital Television) Bill 2012. The bill amends the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to include the regulatory framework for digital television services. Importantly, it will facilitate earlier access to services licensed under section 38C, known as viewer access satellite television, or VAST, for viewers in areas which will not be able to receive adequate digital reception after digital switchover and gives the minister greater flexibility in varying the dates in switchover determinations.


These amendments will benefit television viewers in regional and metropolitan areas who do not receive adequate commercial digital television terrestrial reception. Currently, viewers in Australia who do not receive adequate commercial digital television terrestrial reception are not eligible to access the VAST service until six months before switchover in their licensed area. The proposed amendments to the conditional access scheme will establish a means for those viewers whom the commercial broadcasters do not intend to serve terrestrially to obtain early access to the VAST service.


On 2 November 2009 the minister made the Broadcasting Services (Simulcast Period For Metropolitan Licence Areas) Determination (No. 1) 2009, which determines when the switchover would occur. Switchover for Brisbane TV1 and Perth TV1 licence areas will occur on 30 June 2013. Switchover for Adelaide TV1, Melbourne TV1 and Sydney TV1 licence areas will occur on 31 December 2013. Following further consultation with broadcasters it is apparent that the switchover dates in all of the metropolitan licence areas are likely to require change. These variations in the switchover dates are to facilitate a staggered approach to the transition to digital television in metropolitan areas to ensure both government assistance schemes and broadcaster engineering resources are available and appropriately managed to achieve digital switchover by the end of 2013. In some cases the amended dates could fall outside the legislated six-month variation window where a determination can be varied up to three months earlier or three months later than the determined date. This means that setting the dates in some metropolitan areas could not be made by a simple variation to the Broadcasting Services (Simulcast Period For Metropolitan Licence Areas) Determination (No. 1) 2009.


The amendments allow the minister to vary the date of the switchover determination to a new date that the minister specifies, provided that the date determined is before 31 December 2013. Current restrictions do not provide the minister with sufficient flexibility to do this. Current restrictions do not provide the minister with sufficient flexibility to do this. Similarly, legislative provisions governing the making of digital-only local market areas determinations to allow the minister to vary the timing when a local market area becomes a digital-only market area are also being amended.


Failure to pass the bill during the winter 2012 sittings will delay earlier access to VAST services for some viewers in digital television blackspots in the major population centres of Adelaide, Brisbane, Darwin, Hobart, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney. Failure to pass the bill during the winter 2012 sittings will also prevent the minister from varying the switchover dates in metropolitan areas to ensure that switch-over occurs progressively throughout the year and that the switchover dates are varied in time to provide certainty to both viewers and the broadcasting industry.


This is an important consideration for people who live in my electorate of Makin. One of the proposed variations in the switchover dates requested by the broadcasting industry was to determine the switchover date for Adelaide in the first half of 2013. This would be welcomed by people living in Makin and other residents in South Australia.


This is a matter that is of real importance and would be very much welcomed by the people of the electorate which I represent—the people of Makin. My electorate is located along the Para Escarpment, which is predominantly what would be referred to as a 'hills face zone'. For decades, people living in that region have not received good television reception. That is because the TV towers of the main channels are located on the top of Mount Lofty above the area of my electorate. Many homes do not receive the signals because they are not in direct line of sight from where the signals are sent. Homes in some of the valleys, or which are obstructed by some of the local hills from the direct line signals, receive very, very poor service. This has been a longstanding problem.


Of course, in recent years the installation of cable TV, such as Foxtel, has helped out. But unfortunately not all people can afford pay TV. Even with some retransmission facilities that have been constructed over the years, the service to some parts of the electorate is still very poor. And it has been made even worse by interference caused by the roofs of some very large buildings that have been constructed in the area in recent years. Services whereby the TV screen becomes snowy or fuzzy, or in some cases where there is no service at all, or where you have what is referred to as 'ghosting' are commonly brought to my attention. I can recall having a long discussion with Mr Ian Hunt, a local resident of Salisbury East, who spent some time looking into this matter and the causes of the poor reception to people in the region. We had a discussion about what those causes were and what some of the solutions might be. It was interesting to speak to him because he certainly has done some really good work in respect of analysing what the problems were.


This legislation is therefore most welcome because for so many people in my electorate it will mean that finally they might be able to get some good television reception. In respect of that I have heard stories of people who have spent considerable amounts of money replacing their television set, constructing different types of aerials—sometimes at considerable cost—putting in new set-top boxes and the like, and yet they have still failed to get a good reception.


The importance of this legislation is simply this: firstly, digital TV should provide better reception to all. My understanding is that the digital signal is much more effective. Secondly, the digital switchover in Adelaide may be brought forward to the first half of 2013, and that is also good news. Thirdly, it now means for those people who have been waiting so long to get good television reception that they will be able to do so as a result of the flexibility that this legislation provides to the minister to enable people to access the satellite VAST service much sooner than they otherwise would have been able to do. It is the access to the satellite service that I believe is absolutely important with respect to this particular legislation.


I represent an electorate where there are a considerable number of aged people. For aged people today, access to their television set and having a good picture is very, very important, particularly if they are aged people confined to their home or who have other mobility problems. Television today is not simply a luxury anymore, as it might have been in years gone by. It is an important facet of life because people get so much information through the television set. It provides entertainment to those who cannot leave their home and, to many people who are living alone, it also provides a sense of company. For those reasons it is important for them to have good television service. Some of the people who have, over the years, raised with me their concerns about the poor service they are receiving are, in fact, elderly people.


This is good legislation because, for all of those people who have been waiting decades to get good television service, it looks as if they will be able to do so much sooner than they otherwise might have been able to. For those reasons I commend the legislation to the House.

"Randall, Don, MP",LP,2012-05-30,"



Mr RANDALL
 (Canning) (11:01):  I am pleased to speak on the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Digital Television) Bill 2012 because it has an effect on many in my electorate, which is an outer urban electorate. This bill effects changes needed to improve the processes around the switch to digital-only TV. In particular it makes VAST, Viewer Access Satellite Television, services available earlier for viewers who will never receive a reliable terrestrial signal.


By the end of 2013, all analogue TV broadcast will cease and all free-to-air television will be broadcast in digital format only. Some areas on the eastern seaboard have already made the switch, but in Western Australia we will see this occur sometime after June 2013. The coalition supports the bill and the switch to digital television but wants to ensure the rollout is effective, that digital coverage is adequate and that the rollout times are achieved.


Canning electorate is 6,500 square kilometres. Much of it is rural and has a topography which sometimes affects television signals. This legislation is very relevant to some of the outlying towns in the electorate. Two of those towns are Boddington and Waroona. Boddington is the home of the Newmont Gold Mine, which is going to be the largest gold mine in Australia, producing some 850,000 ounces of gold a year. There are a number of people moving to Boddington and Waroona, and their populations are due to increase as a result of that large mine. Boddington, as I said, is listed to possibly receive the Satellite Subsidy Scheme, the SSS. The scheme will provide a subsidy for eligible households to switch to digital TV via the Viewer Access Satellite Television; however, we need to see that this Labor government is not leaving people in rural and regional areas at a disadvantage with regard to the switchover.


The western VAST service, in other words the service for Western Australia, started in August 2011 to provide digital free-to-air channels to those who require a satellite service for digital TV. One of my constituents, Mr Peter Shoudra of Boddington, told me he thought it was unfair that country people need to get the VAST service to access digital TV and then have to pay for the connection of the technology while their city counterparts do not.


Although I expect the Satellite Subsidy Scheme will be applicable to Mr Shoudra in Boddington—and this is yet to be confirmed, unfortunately—he will still have to contribute something like $200 to $350 towards getting this service. As I said, this seems unfair for somebody living in the bush when their city counterparts do not have to. This is a big cost for families struggling with the rising costs of living and even more so for pensioners.


Furthermore, although the VAST service started in Western Australia in August last year, people in the Boddington area, according to the Digital Ready website, are not yet able to apply for subsidies under the Satellite Subsidy Scheme, with the application open and close dates yet to be determined. So how can Western Australians apply for them if they do not even know when they are available to be applied for?


Western Australia has the most towns of any state listed as eligible to receive a subsidy under the Satellite Subsidy Scheme, but it is the last state where you will have the opportunity to get it. There is something funny about that—it is a long way from Canberra, so out of sight, out of mind. Once again, as I said, the further away we are from Canberra, the more insignificant we are to the Canberra based bureaucrats—and I see them sitting over there.


One of the specific provisions in the bill should make this situation better—that is, 'to facilitate early access to the VAST service for viewers who will never be able to receive an adequate terrestrial television signal.' Currently, some viewers need to wait six months for the analog signal to be switched off in their area before they can access VAST. In other words, they have to wait six months before they can apply.


Clarifying arrangements for determining whether a resident is eligible for the VAST service is also a key component of this bill.  For example, areas that have a self-help transmission tower are being asked to give the government sufficient notice of any decision to switch off the tower or convert it to digital.


These towers are sometimes owned and maintained by the local government authority—in this case, the Boddington ShireCouncil—so you can imagine the cost of converting them to digital. It is a cost that a small council the size of Boddington just cannot afford.


For that reason you can imagine that most local government authorities with these towers will just turn them off. Yet the federal government is sitting back, saying: 'You tell us what you are doing'—which is just an easy way to put the blame back on the council when the rollout is late. The onus should not be on the council; it should be on the government which is switching off this service to liaise properly with them so that they can coordinate the switch-off and the rollout of the digital signal.


The government's rollout of digital TV must be closely monitored. I wish to provide this feedback from Canning constituents who are having some issues with the digital service. For example, Colin Lankford, from Kelmscott, recently switched to digital TV. Since then he has only been able to access two channels, despite being able to access all other channels when he had analog TV. He has had aerial technicians come to his house to check the issue, but they have said that the location of the house means that there is very poor reception throughout the region, which has also been confirmed by the Australian Communications and Media Authority. He inquired about getting the VAST service and accessing the Satellite Subsidy Scheme, but he is not eligible as he is living in a metropolitan area. He is still in my electorate and, dare I say, on the south-east corner of the metropolitan area and only a kilometre or so from the bush. That is how close he is to being out of the metropolitan area. He has no other options available to him.


Pam Herbert, also from Kelmscott, said that she has the same issues as Mr Lankford—in other words, once she switched to digital, not getting the channels she should.   Graeme Leach and Ken Lee, who both live in Erskine, which is further south towards Mandurah, have the same issues as I have listed regarding the signal. They are also not eligible for the subsidy. That is the trouble with outer metropolitan electorates. The metropolitan arbitrary line is drawn such that, when it suits government and government agencies, these areas are deemed as metropolitan and if they are a bit further out they are still deemed to be metropolitan, if it suits them—for example, in terms of the provision of aged care. But in this case, because they are after proper treatment through this digital rollout, they can be considered to be not within a rural or regional area but metropolitan. They are in a very grey area. 


The key point that I am making is that there are clearly ongoing issues with the digital TV rollout, which are going to be exacerbated once the complete switch-over takes place next year. The federal government and ACMA, seemingly, are unwilling to provide any assistance, only offering the VAST Satellite Subsidy Scheme to those in rural or remote regions. As I said, this offer is clouded in uncertainty and fraught with technical difficulties, which many of my constituents are extremely frustrated about. The minister has only answered these concerns with four suggestions—can you believe this? The response from the minister was: 'How about telling them to turn their aerials in a different direction,' or, 'Ask an aerial technician to assess the problem,' which they have already done. These people have already tried these options, but it is becoming a growing inconvenience and expense when they have to call out the TV repairman.


When you put this together with the government's initiative two budgets ago on set-top boxes, it just makes you realise how shambolic and symptomatic this is of a government handling an issue like this TV switch-over. The set-top box situation is just ludicrous. In fact, I have a number of set-top boxes that I cannot even give away to constituents because they do not want them. Attaching a set-top box to an analog TV for a pensioner is not the cheap, $350 option, because you then have to get out a technician to connect it and do something with the aerial. They would be far better off getting the same amount of money to allow them to go to JB Hi-Fi or Harvey Norman and just buy a proper digital TV for probably less money. You can get a good 32-inch digital TV at any of these places for about $350. This thinking is about as clever as some of the other brain snaps like pink batts, green loans and cash for clunkers that this government has come up with, and it does not solve the problem. The government needs a more orderly and structured process when people like those I have mentioned in my electorate are having extreme difficulty with this signal, whether it be for terrestrial reasons or due to the location of the tower—in his speech the member for Makin mentioned the shadow of the signal. All those sorts of issues need to be dealt with because people in outer urban electorates are just as important and just as equal as those in metropolitan areas. They deserve better.

Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Government Whip) (11:12):  I must share with the House that I have had similar problems with constituents in my electorate. It will be resolved in the future, and maybe I could meet with the member for Canning later and tell him what is happening in my area. I rise to support this legislation to improve the regulatory framework for digital television services, the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Digital Television) Bill 2012. In particular, it will facilitate earlier access to services licensed under section 38C, known as VAST, for viewers in areas which will not be able to receive adequate digital reception after digital switch-over. It gives the minister greater flexibility in varying the dates of the switch-over determinations.


The Shortland electorate straddles two switch-over areas. The Hunter region switches over on 27 November 2012 and the Central Coast part of Shortland electorate, which is in the Sydney broadcasting area, will switch over in 2013. The legislation will allow for the management of the switch-over process by broadcasters and it will ensure the government's assistance schemes are delivered in a timely manner.


Shortland electorate has areas with significant digital signal problems. One area in particular is the suburbs of Belmont North and Jewells. They are very similar to areas that the member for Canning mentioned; they will not qualify for satellite and the subsidy that goes along with that. Also, many parts of the Central Coast area are affected, but the biggest problem on the Central Coast relates to the ABC. The signals are basically clashing and interfering with reception. That needs to be dealt with by the ABC. In relation to the problem in Belmont North and Jewells, there is going to be a new tower built that will circumvent some of the difficulties that are present in that area. If the member for Canning visits the website that shows where new towers are to be built, he will see if his area is missing out on one of the new towers. There has been lengthy community consultation, and I made sure that the residents in my area had all the information. It sounds like a very similar problem to the one that they were having. As a consequence of the intervention and presenting the information, Broadcast Australia has put in a proposal for a new transmission site, which will most likely use existing mobile phone towers. They put the technology onto that, and then that helps with the problem that is being experienced with reception.


The proposal has the new transmission site located on Violet Town Road at Belmont North, at the junction of Violet Town Road and the Pacific Highway. That will assist with the problem. The transmission will commence from that site about six weeks before the switchover. It will be completed in time for the switchover so that the people who would not have the ability to watch digital TV will have reception. The new transmission site should resolve all reception difficulties in the northern part of my electorate. I suggest that, if the member for Canning can link into a similar situation, then his problems will be resolved. I know there are a number of new transmission sites that are being constructed throughout the country. I am very pleased that the problem area I had at Belmont North and Jewells will be resolved. People who are experiencing problems should go to the mySwitch website and check how the improvements will affect them. Once again, if the member for Canning has a look at that site, he might find that it is going to help his constituents. The problems on the Central Coast are twofold. There are problems caused by topography, which is quite significant, and problems caused by signal clash of the ABC's single frequency network.


The legislation will allow commercial broadcasters to take a considered and managed approach to the massive task of switchover in metropolitan areas. Further work needs to be done on the Central Coast by commercial broadcasters to audit the reception problems and to plan solutions for the problems. That is something that I am going to be following very closely, because once the digital switchover takes place we need to ensure that people can receive television. It is not a very good situation if we have people who are not eligible for any sort of subsidy and cannot receive reception on their television sets. It can be resolved, as I have shown, and has been resolved at Belmont North and Jewells.


The big problem is in the ABC transmission and how the ABC intends to resolve the clash of their network. That is the biggest problem on the Central Coast. The other will be resolved but I think we need to resolve that issue with the ABC. I have made representation to the ABC about that. Some areas of my electorate are able to receive an ABC transmission from three sources: from Sydney, from Mount Sugarloaf and from the Central Coast. For many, many constituents this results in a signal clash and is very difficult for individual households to resolve. They turn their aerial one way and then the other, they raise their aerial and do many things but still do not resolve the problem. I would really encourage the ABC to resolve that issue on the Central Coast. It is very important to the constituents I represent in the parliament. But I am very, very pleased with the resolution found to the problems experienced by residents at Belmont Beach north of Jewells Beach in the northern part of my electorate. Those residents will be able to receive digital reception once the switchover takes place because of the action that the minister has facilitated through community consultation leading to Regional Broadcasting Australia putting in a proposal to upgrade the site and to ensure that digital television access is available.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (11:21):  I would like to thank the members who have contributed to the debate on the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Digital Television) Bill 2012. The bill contains a number of measures to improve the regulatory framework for digital television services. In particular, it will facilitate earlier access to services known as the Viewer Access Satellite Television service, or VAST, for viewers in areas unable to receive adequate digital reception after switchover. The bill will enable the conditional access scheme administrator for the VAST service to specify open-access areas to allow viewers in these areas immediate access to VAST. The bill also broadens the definition of applicable services used by the scheme administrator to assess eligibility to access VAST. As at 2 May 2012, over 68,400 households in remote and regional Australia had already been connected to VAST. 


The bill also gives the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy greater flexibility in varying the dates in switchover determinations. It allows the minister to vary the date for a licensed areas digital switchover to any future date the minister specifies, provided that date is before 31 December 2013. Similar amendments will be made in respect of digital-only local market area determinations.


The amendments in this bill will provide the government and the broadcasting industry with the necessary flexibility to deliver a managed and efficient final stage of digital switchover. I thank all members who are supporting this bill's proposals, and I commend the bill to the House.

That is because the TV towers of the main channels are located on the top of Mount Lofty above the area of my electorate. Many homes do not receive the signals because they are not in direct line of sight from where the signals are sent. Homes in some of the valleys, or which are obstructed by some of the local hills from the direct line signals, receive very, very poor service. This has been a longstanding problem.


Of course, in recent years the installation of cable TV, such as Foxtel, has helped out. But unfortunately not all people can afford pay TV. Even with some retransmission facilities that have been constructed over the years, the service to some parts of the electorate is still very poor. And it has been made even worse by interference caused by the roofs of some very large buildings that have been constructed in the area in recent years. Services whereby the TV screen becomes snowy or fuzzy, or in some cases where there is no service at all, or where you have what is referred to as 'ghosting' are commonly brought to my attention. I can recall having a long discussion with Mr Ian Hunt, a local resident of Salisbury East, who spent some time looking into this matter and the causes of the poor reception to people in the region. We had a discussion about what those causes were and what some of the solutions might be. It was interesting to speak to him because he certainly has done some really good work in respect of analysing what the problems were.


This legislation is therefore most welcome because for so many people in my electorate it will mean that finally they might be able to get some good television reception. In respect of that I have heard stories of people who have spent considerable amounts of money replacing their television set, constructing different types of aerials—sometimes at considerable cost—putting in new set-top boxes and the like, and yet they have still failed to get a good reception.


The importance of this legislation is simply this: firstly, digital TV should provide better reception to all. My understanding is that the digital signal is much more effective. Secondly, the digital switchover in Adelaide may be brought forward to the first half of 2013, and that is also good news. Thirdly, it now means for those people who have been waiting so long to get good television reception that they will be able to do so as a result of the flexibility that this legislation provides to the minister to enable people to access the satellite VAST service much sooner than they otherwise would have been able to do. It is the access to the satellite service that I believe is absolutely important with respect to this particular legislation.


I represent an electorate where there are a considerable number of aged people. For aged people today, access to their television set and having a good picture is very, very important, particularly if they are aged people confined to their home or who have other mobility problems. Television today is not simply a luxury anymore, as it might have been in years gone by. It is an important facet of life because people get so much information through the television set. It provides entertainment to those who cannot leave their home and, to many people who are living alone, it also provides a sense of company. For those reasons it is important for them to have good television service. Some of the people who have, over the years, raised with me their concerns about the poor service they are receiving are, in fact, elderly people.


This is good legislation because, for all of those people who have been waiting decades to get good television service, it looks as if they will be able to do so much sooner than they otherwise might have been able to. For those reasons I commend the legislation to the House.

Mr RANDALL
 (Canning) (11:01):  I am pleased to speak on the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Digital Television) Bill 2012 because it has an effect on many in my electorate, which is an outer urban electorate. This bill effects changes needed to improve the processes around the switch to digital-only TV. In particular it makes VAST, Viewer Access Satellite Television, services available earlier for viewers who will never receive a reliable terrestrial signal.


By the end of 2013, all analogue TV broadcast will cease and all free-to-air television will be broadcast in digital format only. Some areas on the eastern seaboard have already made the switch, but in Western Australia we will see this occur sometime after June 2013. The coalition supports the bill and the switch to digital television but wants to ensure the rollout is effective, that digital coverage is adequate and that the rollout times are achieved.


Canning electorate is 6,500 square kilometres. Much of it is rural and has a topography which sometimes affects television signals. This legislation is very relevant to some of the outlying towns in the electorate. Two of those towns are Boddington and Waroona. Boddington is the home of the Newmont Gold Mine, which is going to be the largest gold mine in Australia, producing some 850,000 ounces of gold a year. There are a number of people moving to Boddington and Waroona, and their populations are due to increase as a result of that large mine. Boddington, as I said, is listed to possibly receive the Satellite Subsidy Scheme, the SSS. The scheme will provide a subsidy for eligible households to switch to digital TV via the Viewer Access Satellite Television; however, we need to see that this Labor government is not leaving people in rural and regional areas at a disadvantage with regard to the switchover.


The western VAST service, in other words the service for Western Australia, started in August 2011 to provide digital free-to-air channels to those who require a satellite service for digital TV. One of my constituents, Mr Peter Shoudra of Boddington, told me he thought it was unfair that country people need to get the VAST service to access digital TV and then have to pay for the connection of the technology while their city counterparts do not.


Although I expect the Satellite Subsidy Scheme will be applicable to Mr Shoudra in Boddington—and this is yet to be confirmed, unfortunately—he will still have to contribute something like $200 to $350 towards getting this service. As I said, this seems unfair for somebody living in the bush when their city counterparts do not have to. This is a big cost for families struggling with the rising costs of living and even more so for pensioners.


Furthermore, although the VAST service started in Western Australia in August last year, people in the Boddington area, according to the Digital Ready website, are not yet able to apply for subsidies under the Satellite Subsidy Scheme, with the application open and close dates yet to be determined. So how can Western Australians apply for them if they do not even know when they are available to be applied for?


Western Australia has the most towns of any state listed as eligible to receive a subsidy under the Satellite Subsidy Scheme, but it is the last state where you will have the opportunity to get it. There is something funny about that—it is a long way from Canberra, so out of sight, out of mind. Once again, as I said, the further away we are from Canberra, the more insignificant we are to the Canberra based bureaucrats—and I see them sitting over there.


One of the specific provisions in the bill should make this situation better—that is, 'to facilitate early access to the VAST service for viewers who will never be able to receive an adequate terrestrial television signal.' Currently, some viewers need to wait six months for the analog signal to be switched off in their area before they can access VAST. In other words, they have to wait six months before they can apply.


Clarifying arrangements for determining whether a resident is eligible for the VAST service is also a key component of this bill.  For example, areas that have a self-help transmission tower are being asked to give the government sufficient notice of any decision to switch off the tower or convert it to digital.


These towers are sometimes owned and maintained by the local government authority—in this case, the Boddington ShireCouncil—so you can imagine the cost of converting them to digital. It is a cost that a small council the size of Boddington just cannot afford.


For that reason you can imagine that most local government authorities with these towers will just turn them off. Yet the federal government is sitting back, saying: 'You tell us what you are doing'—which is just an easy way to put the blame back on the council when the rollout is late. The onus should not be on the council; it should be on the government which is switching off this service to liaise properly with them so that they can coordinate the switch-off and the rollout of the digital signal.


The government's rollout of digital TV must be closely monitored. I wish to provide this feedback from Canning constituents who are having some issues with the digital service. For example, Colin Lankford, from Kelmscott, recently switched to digital TV. Since then he has only been able to access two channels, despite being able to access all other channels when he had analog TV. He has had aerial technicians come to his house to check the issue, but they have said that the location of the house means that there is very poor reception throughout the region, which has also been confirmed by the Australian Communications and Media Authority. He inquired about getting the VAST service and accessing the Satellite Subsidy Scheme, but he is not eligible as he is living in a metropolitan area. He is still in my electorate and, dare I say, on the south-east corner of the metropolitan area and only a kilometre or so from the bush. That is how close he is to being out of the metropolitan area. He has no other options available to him.


Pam Herbert, also from Kelmscott, said that she has the same issues as Mr Lankford—in other words, once she switched to digital, not getting the channels she should.   Graeme Leach and Ken Lee, who both live in Erskine, which is further south towards Mandurah, have the same issues as I have listed regarding the signal. They are also not eligible for the subsidy. That is the trouble with outer metropolitan electorates. The metropolitan arbitrary line is drawn such that, when it suits government and government agencies, these areas are deemed as metropolitan and if they are a bit further out they are still deemed to be metropolitan, if it suits them—for example, in terms of the provision of aged care. But in this case, because they are after proper treatment through this digital rollout, they can be considered to be not within a rural or regional area but metropolitan. They are in a very grey area. 


The key point that I am making is that there are clearly ongoing issues with the digital TV rollout, which are going to be exacerbated once the complete switch-over takes place next year. The federal government and ACMA, seemingly, are unwilling to provide any assistance, only offering the VAST Satellite Subsidy Scheme to those in rural or remote regions. As I said, this offer is clouded in uncertainty and fraught with technical difficulties, which many of my constituents are extremely frustrated about. The minister has only answered these concerns with four suggestions—can you believe this? The response from the minister was: 'How about telling them to turn their aerials in a different direction,' or, 'Ask an aerial technician to assess the problem,' which they have already done. These people have already tried these options, but it is becoming a growing inconvenience and expense when they have to call out the TV repairman.


When you put this together with the government's initiative two budgets ago on set-top boxes, it just makes you realise how shambolic and symptomatic this is of a government handling an issue like this TV switch-over. The set-top box situation is just ludicrous. In fact, I have a number of set-top boxes that I cannot even give away to constituents because they do not want them. Attaching a set-top box to an analog TV for a pensioner is not the cheap, $350 option, because you then have to get out a technician to connect it and do something with the aerial. They would be far better off getting the same amount of money to allow them to go to JB Hi-Fi or Harvey Norman and just buy a proper digital TV for probably less money. You can get a good 32-inch digital TV at any of these places for about $350. This thinking is about as clever as some of the other brain snaps like pink batts, green loans and cash for clunkers that this government has come up with, and it does not solve the problem. The government needs a more orderly and structured process when people like those I have mentioned in my electorate are having extreme difficulty with this signal, whether it be for terrestrial reasons or due to the location of the tower—in his speech the member for Makin mentioned the shadow of the signal. All those sorts of issues need to be dealt with because people in outer urban electorates are just as important and just as equal as those in metropolitan areas. They deserve better.

Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Government Whip) (11:12):  I must share with the House that I have had similar problems with constituents in my electorate. It will be resolved in the future, and maybe I could meet with the member for Canning later and tell him what is happening in my area. I rise to support this legislation to improve the regulatory framework for digital television services, the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Digital Television) Bill 2012. In particular, it will facilitate earlier access to services licensed under section 38C, known as VAST, for viewers in areas which will not be able to receive adequate digital reception after digital switch-over. It gives the minister greater flexibility in varying the dates of the switch-over determinations.


The Shortland electorate straddles two switch-over areas. The Hunter region switches over on 27 November 2012 and the Central Coast part of Shortland electorate, which is in the Sydney broadcasting area, will switch over in 2013. The legislation will allow for the management of the switch-over process by broadcasters and it will ensure the government's assistance schemes are delivered in a timely manner.


Shortland electorate has areas with significant digital signal problems. One area in particular is the suburbs of Belmont North and Jewells. They are very similar to areas that the member for Canning mentioned; they will not qualify for satellite and the subsidy that goes along with that. Also, many parts of the Central Coast area are affected, but the biggest problem on the Central Coast relates to the ABC. The signals are basically clashing and interfering with reception. That needs to be dealt with by the ABC. In relation to the problem in Belmont North and Jewells, there is going to be a new tower built that will circumvent some of the difficulties that are present in that area. If the member for Canning visits the website that shows where new towers are to be built, he will see if his area is missing out on one of the new towers. There has been lengthy community consultation, and I made sure that the residents in my area had all the information. It sounds like a very similar problem to the one that they were having. As a consequence of the intervention and presenting the information, Broadcast Australia has put in a proposal for a new transmission site, which will most likely use existing mobile phone towers. They put the technology onto that, and then that helps with the problem that is being experienced with reception.


The proposal has the new transmission site located on Violet Town Road at Belmont North, at the junction of Violet Town Road and the Pacific Highway. That will assist with the problem. The transmission will commence from that site about six weeks before the switchover. It will be completed in time for the switchover so that the people who would not have the ability to watch digital TV will have reception. The new transmission site should resolve all reception difficulties in the northern part of my electorate. I suggest that, if the member for Canning can link into a similar situation, then his problems will be resolved. I know there are a number of new transmission sites that are being constructed throughout the country. I am very pleased that the problem area I had at Belmont North and Jewells will be resolved. People who are experiencing problems should go to the mySwitch website and check how the improvements will affect them. Once again, if the member for Canning has a look at that site, he might find that it is going to help his constituents. The problems on the Central Coast are twofold. There are problems caused by topography, which is quite significant, and problems caused by signal clash of the ABC's single frequency network.


The legislation will allow commercial broadcasters to take a considered and managed approach to the massive task of switchover in metropolitan areas. Further work needs to be done on the Central Coast by commercial broadcasters to audit the reception problems and to plan solutions for the problems. That is something that I am going to be following very closely, because once the digital switchover takes place we need to ensure that people can receive television. It is not a very good situation if we have people who are not eligible for any sort of subsidy and cannot receive reception on their television sets. It can be resolved, as I have shown, and has been resolved at Belmont North and Jewells.


The big problem is in the ABC transmission and how the ABC intends to resolve the clash of their network. That is the biggest problem on the Central Coast. The other will be resolved but I think we need to resolve that issue with the ABC. I have made representation to the ABC about that. Some areas of my electorate are able to receive an ABC transmission from three sources: from Sydney, from Mount Sugarloaf and from the Central Coast. For many, many constituents this results in a signal clash and is very difficult for individual households to resolve. They turn their aerial one way and then the other, they raise their aerial and do many things but still do not resolve the problem. I would really encourage the ABC to resolve that issue on the Central Coast. It is very important to the constituents I represent in the parliament. But I am very, very pleased with the resolution found to the problems experienced by residents at Belmont Beach north of Jewells Beach in the northern part of my electorate. Those residents will be able to receive digital reception once the switchover takes place because of the action that the minister has facilitated through community consultation leading to Regional Broadcasting Australia putting in a proposal to upgrade the site and to ensure that digital television access is available.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (11:21):  I would like to thank the members who have contributed to the debate on the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Digital Television) Bill 2012. The bill contains a number of measures to improve the regulatory framework for digital television services. In particular, it will facilitate earlier access to services known as the Viewer Access Satellite Television service, or VAST, for viewers in areas unable to receive adequate digital reception after switchover. The bill will enable the conditional access scheme administrator for the VAST service to specify open-access areas to allow viewers in these areas immediate access to VAST. The bill also broadens the definition of applicable services used by the scheme administrator to assess eligibility to access VAST. As at 2 May 2012, over 68,400 households in remote and regional Australia had already been connected to VAST. 


The bill also gives the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy greater flexibility in varying the dates in switchover determinations. It allows the minister to vary the date for a licensed areas digital switchover to any future date the minister specifies, provided that date is before 31 December 2013. Similar amendments will be made in respect of digital-only local market area determinations.


The amendments in this bill will provide the government and the broadcasting industry with the necessary flexibility to deliver a managed and efficient final stage of digital switchover. I thank all members who are supporting this bill's proposals, and I commend the bill to the House.
