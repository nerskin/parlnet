Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR
 (Gorton—Minister for Immigration and Citizenship) (09:02):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.




The purpose of this 
bill
 is to propose a package of integrity measures that seek to enhance the government's ability to deter sponsor behaviour which is inconsistent with the policy intent of the 
s
ubclass 457 visa program and other temporary employer sponsored visa programs. Together with proposed amendments to the Migration Regulations 1994, this 
bill
 presents a comprehensive package of reforms which would balance the interests of Australian workers with the need to strengthen protection for overseas workers.





Importantly, the 
bill
 gives powers to the Fair Work Ombudsman (and Fair Work 
i
nspectors) to monitor and investigate compliance with sponsorship obligations, to ensure workers are working in their nominated occupation and being paid market salary rates.





It will require 
sub
class 457 sponsors to undertake labour market testing in relation to a nominated occupation, in a manner consistent with Australia's relevant 
international trade obligations, to ensure that Australian citizens and permanent residents are given the first opportunity to apply for skilled vacancies in the domestic labour market.





The government has always said that the 
s
ubclass 457 visa plays an important role in allowing employers to address skill shortages when skilled local labour is unavailable. It is intended as a vehicle to allow employers to quickly supplement the Australian labour market, including the use of enterprise migration agreements and regional migration agreements, where a genuine skill shortage exists.





It is an important component of our overall non-discriminatory migration program, wh
ich is roughly comprised of one-third families and two-
thirds skilled migration. Just over half of the current holders of 
sub
class 457 visas go on to apply for permanent residence
,
 and we think that
 i
s appropriate. 





The use of the 
s
ubclass 457 visa program has been growing strongly in recent years. The number of primary 
sub
class 457 visa holders in Australia has risen from 68
,
400 in June 2010 to 106
,
680 as at 31 May 2013, an increase of 56 per cent.





Many growing industries
,
 including those connected with the resources boom, such as mining, as well as non-resource
-
sector users of the program, such as health care and information and communications technology, accounted for a large portion
,
 over half
,
 of all 
sub
class 457 visa
 grants in 2011-12.





However, strong growth has also been recorded in industries in which employment has fallen recently, such as accommodation and food service, and retail trade.





It concerns the government that, at a time when the labour market has been flattening and some sectors and regions have 
experienced lay-offs and increased unemployment, the 
sub
class 457 program has continued to grow.





Coupled with this strong growth is a tendency for some employers to source foreign labour through the 
sub
class 457 program without regard to the Australian domestic labour force.





These trends highlight that current requirements do not commit sponsors to using the 
sub
class 457 program as a supplement to, rather than a substitute for, the domestic labour force.





In the recently released report of the Migration Council Australia, survey data of 
sub
class 457 employer sponsors revealed that 15
 per cent
 of employers say that they have no difficulty finding suitable labour locally and yet they sponsor employees from overseas under this scheme.





Further, 
seven per cent
 of primary visa holders surveyed said that they were remunerated differently to their Australian counterparts doing the same work
, and
 a further 
two per cent
 stated they were paid well under the minimum salary for a 457 employee which is currently $51,400.





Indeed, the reforms at the heart of this 
bill
 are not un
ique to the Australian context.


As recently as 7 May this year, the Canadian Prim
e Minister, Mr Stephen Harper—
a conservative
—s
tated in relation to his country's equivalent of t
he s
ubclass 457 scheme:



Not only has the government indicated for some time that it would be reforming the temporary foreign workers program, but in the budget last year specifically we brought in measures to better match job vacancies with people who are seeking work or in the employment insurance system. We have been very clear. We need to do a better job of matching the demand for employment insurance and the demand for temporary foreign workers. That is precisely what the government has been doing for a year and a half … The minister brought in changes last year to make sure people who are on employment insurance get first crack at jobs rather than temporary foreign workers.


And on 23 April 2013, the Governor of the Bank of Canada and Governor-Elect of the Bank of England, Mr Mark Carney, said:


The challenge of a skills shortage is not unique to Canada but the solution is training not bringing in temporary foreign workers.


The Canadian government is taking steps to tighten the provisions of their program to ensure that only genuine skill shortages are being filled by temporary overseas labour.


Likewise, academics from the law school of the University of Adelaide recently submitted to a Senate inquiry that the 457 scheme had shifted in focus since its introduction in 1996 from a focus on filling high-skill jobs in areas of skill shortage to satisfying broader employer demand for labour. It is worth noting that back in 1996 labour market testing was a requirement of the scheme.


The Australian Hotels Association underlines this shift in recently arguing for a lowering of the minimum salary threshold of $51,400, such that employers in their industry could use the scheme more extensively. I remind the House that in the past 12 months the use of 457s in the hospitality industry has doubled—yes, it has doubled in the past year.




This 
bill
, together with the package of reforms announced in February 2013, seeks to realign the program to ensure a balance between job opportunities for Australian citizens and permanent residents, enabling employers to fill skills shortages, while protecting overseas workers. The measures will be implemented in a manner consistent with Australia's relevant i
nternational trade obligations.





The purpose of the s
ubclass 457 visa program is to address genuine shortages without displacing employment and training opportunities for Australian citizens and permanent residents and without serving as the mainstay of the skilled migration program.





The government has concerns that some employers are turning to overseas workers first, rather than investing in local training and recruitment. There has also been evidence of some sponsors paying overseas workers below the market rate, failing to commit to the training requirements of the program, and using the visa fraudulently to help family and friends migrate.





In February, the 
g
overnment announc
ed a package of reforms to the s
ubclass 457 visa program to strengthen its capacity to identify and prevent employer practices that are not in keeping 
with the intent of the program.





T
hese reforms will build on the w
orker 
p
rotection reforms of 2009 that introduced a sponsorship framework designed to ensure that the working conditions of sponsored visa holders meet Australian standards and provided certain cost incentives to encourage employers to seek to recruit Australians before looking to sponsor overseas skilled workers. The 2009 reforms also introduced a civil penalty regime, including infringement notice
s to enhance the powers of the d
epartment to take action against sponsors who fail to meet their sponsorship obligations.





The proposed changes to the 
M
igration 
R
egulations will seek to reduce the risk of nominations for non-genuine positions; strengthen the market salary rate requirement; align the English language requirement with that of the permanent Employer Nomination Scheme; introduce an obligation that sponsors meet the training requirement for the term of sponsorship 
approval; remove potential for the exploitation of temporary overseas skilled workers; and restore public co
nfidence in the program.





To
 complement the reforms to the M
igration 
R
egulations announced in February 2013, the 
bill
 will enshrine in the Migration Act the kinds of sponsorship obligations which are to be prescribed in the 
M
igration 
R
egulations.





This will ensure that the 
M
igration 
R
egulations include existing sponsorship obligations requiring sponsors to among other things:




ensure equivalent terms and conditions of employment (including payment of a 'market salary rate'),



keep information and provide information to the department, and



cooperate with inspectors,


as well as new and strengthened sponsorship obligations proposed to come into effect on 1 July 2013 to:



meet training requirements for the term of sponsorship approval, not transfer, charge or recover certain costs from sponsored visa holders and restrict on-hiring arrangements.


The details of these new obligations will be spelt out in the Migration Regulations proposed to commence on 1 July 2013.




The 
bill
 will further strengthen the integrity of the 
s
ubclass 457 visa program by expanding the government's capacity to detect and take action against sponsors who do the wrong thing and ensure that overseas workers are not used as a substitute for Australian workers
.





The government believes that Australian citizens and Australian permanent residents deserve the opportunity to get local jobs on local projects.





The government also announced in February an expansion of the Fair Work Ombudsman and 
inspector powers.



This bill expands the government's capacity to monitor and investigate compliance with the temporary sponsored work visa program by enabling Fair Work inspectors to exercise powers for the purposes of the Migration Act.


The bill will make it clear that a Fair Work inspector is also an inspector for the purposes of the Migration Act and is able to exercise all the powers conferred on inspectors by the Migration Act.


The department currently has 32 active inspectors appointed under the Migration Act to monitor compliance with sponsorship obligations. An expansion of inspector powers to over 300 Fair Work inspectors will significantly increase the government's capacity to monitor compliance with the subclass 457 visa program and other sponsored visas.


Fair Work inspectors will focus in particular on monitoring a sponsor's compliance with the following obligations:


to ensure equivalent terms and conditions of employment which requires sponsors to ensure the subclass 457 visa holders are receiving at least the same salary as that which was approved at nomination; and


to ensure the sponsored person works or participates in the nominated occupation and is performing the duties of the occupation, approved at nomination.


The bill will also expand an inspector's powers to investigate a sponsor's use of temporary work visas that have associated work rights but do not have the sponsorship requirement (for example, student or work and holiday visas). This will build in flexibility to allow inspectors to investigate work related offences and question sponsors and visa holders to ensure visa holders are not working in breach of their visa condition.


The Migration Act contains an enforcement framework relating to the sponsor-monitoring regime which includes administrative sanctions (to bar or cancel the approval of a person as a sponsor), an infringement notice and civil penalty scheme.


The bill provides for enforceable undertakings as an additional enforcement option under the Migration Act where a sponsor has failed to satisfy a sponsorship obligation.


Enforceable undertakings are promises enforceable in court which would be agreed between the minister and a sponsor.


Enforceable undertakings would be used as an alternative to, or work in combination with, barring a sponsor or cancelling a sponsor's approval.


Enforceable undertakings might also avoid the substantial legal costs associated with litigation in the courts. They are designed to be flexible and to secure compensation for any loss resulting from contraventions (for example, payments to compensate for underpayment of workers).


The amendment will also allow the minister to publish enforceable undertakings on the department's website. This is an important tool to encourage compliance by all sponsors and a means of providing transparency to the Australian public on the monitoring of sponsors.




A key objective of this 
bill
 is to strengthen the government's capacity to manage the 
T
emporary 
S
ponsored 
W
ork 
V
isa program (in particular, the 
s
ubclass 457 visa program). It will seek assurance from employers that they are only utilising the 457 visa program in circumstances where there is a genuine skills shortage in Australia. To 
enable this outcome, the 
bill
 introduces a requirement that sponsors must undertake 
l
abour 
m
arket 
t
esting in relation to nominated occupations, in a manner consistent with Australia's relevant international trade obligations.



In recognition that the subclass 457 visa is the primary visa that delivers our World Trade Organization and free trade agreement obligations for the movement of natural persons, the bill ensures that Australia continues to meet our obligations not to labour market test certain categories of persons.


The bill allows the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship to determine by legislative instrument how to give effect to relevant categories of persons for whom international obligations are owed. The legislative instrument will reflect the relevant commitments with respect to labour market testing under Australia's international trade agreements.


It is proposed that the labour market testing requirement will initially require a sponsor to demonstrate that they have sought to find a suitably qualified Australian citizen or Australian permanent resident within six months prior to submission of an application for nomination approval. This will provide a balance between giving Australians the opportunity to apply for jobs, and ensuring that Australian businesses do not experience undue delays in filling skilled labour shortages which would negatively impact on their businesses.


The labour market testing requirement will be satisfied if the employer provides evidence of attempts to recruit locally, such as details of advertising or participation at relevant job fairs, and details of the results of such attempts which demonstrates that a suitably qualified and experienced Australian citizen or Australian permanent resident is not readily available to fill the nominated position.


The bill proposes a delayed commencement for the labour market testing requirement to allow sufficient time for the implementation of labour market testing and ensure that sponsors are given a period of time to undertake labour market testing.


Further, the bill includes an exemption to the labour market testing requirement in the event of a major disaster, natural or otherwise, in order to assist disaster relief or recovery.


This exemption will give the government flexibility to respond to situations of national or state emergency and would facilitate the speedy entry of overseas skilled workers without the delay caused by requiring a sponsor to undertake labour market testing.


In addition, an exemption to the labour market testing condition will apply to specific occupations, by legislative instrument, within skill levels 1 or 2 as currently described in the Australian and New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupations. I intend to make a legislative instrument to exempt most, but not all, skill level 1 occupations.


The legislative instrument of exemption for occupations in skill levels 1 and 2 will be disallowable by either house of the parliament.


At present all primary subclass 457 visa holders are subject to visa condition 8107, which provides the visa holder must not cease employment for 28 consecutive days. If a visa holder does not comply with this condition there are grounds to cancel their visa.


This bill amends the Migration Regulations 1994 to extend the period from 28 days to 90 consecutive days, enabling a more socially just outcome for visa holders as they will have more time find an alternative job with an employer sponsor or to arrange their personal affairs at the conclusion of sponsored employment.


This amendment is in line with recommendations of the 2008 Deegan review of the subclass 457 visa program and the Migration Council Australia in its report of 11 May 2013.


The government intends to review the efficacy of these reforms within three years of their implementation to ascertain whether further refinements are required. We have some major changes in our labour market over recent years and it is appropriate that we re-examine these policy settings.




The totality of the 
g
overnment's reforms will close loopholes in the current legislative and policy settings to ensure that the program can only be used by appropriately skilled persons and to fill genuine skills shortages
,
 as was intended. Put another way, they aim to ensure the program better meets its overarching intent of acting as a supplement to rather than a substitute for the Australian labour market, in a manner consistent with Australia's relevant international trade obligations.





The government is confident that the revised legislative and policy settings for the 
s
ubclass 457 program will achieve this balance, and will further enhance an already successful program.





I commend the 
bill
 to the 
c
hamber.

Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (09:21):  The coalition is deeply unhappy with the government's chaotic handling of this bill, the Tax Laws Amendment (2013 Measures No. 2) Bill 2013. The bill was introduced last Wednesday, and the coalition sought to have the bill referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services. That request was denied. Instead, the government sent it to the House Economics Committee. Then the House Economics Committee last Friday refused to hold an inquiry into the bill.


The government is now asking the parliament to consider an incredibly complex taxation bill with significant changes, with no committee consideration, and the bill was only introduced last week. There has been no community consultation. There has been no committee consultation. The bill has been drafted. We hear the government itself is amending the bill which it only introduced last week. The government thinks it is giving this parliament the chance to have an appropriate process for the deliberation of something so significant. Fair dinkum!


They wonder why their government is chaotic, and here is their taxation bill, and it is the largest taxation law amendment bill on record. It has 11 schedules dealing with a range of different taxation issues. The government introduced it a week ago and have prevented any consultation by any committee. Then the government cannot understand why they keep screwing up policies. This is exhibit A. We are trying to deal with this bill in good faith. We are trying to deal with all these taxation issues in good faith, because they go to revenue collection, and they go to stability in the economy. But this is not the way to run taxation policy. This is not the way to run the parliament: introducing a complicated taxation bill last week, refusing to hold any committee inquiry at all and now trying to rush it through on the eve of an election without consulting those people who are most affected. I thought the mining tax was a warning and then I thought the carbon tax was a warning. What is it with these guys? This is not the way to run a country, it is certainly not the way to run a parliament, and it is most definitely not the way to run a taxation system.


In particular, schedules 3, 4 and 5 of this bill deserve considerable additional scrutiny. We will be moving amendments to excise these schedules from the bill so that can happen. I will explain the impact of those schedules further down the track. Schedule 1 of this bill deals with the 2012 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook measure that sought to bring forward $8 billion of company tax revenue by requiring companies to pay income tax instalments monthly rather than quarterly. This is all about trying to get the surplus. Companies currently pay tax on a quarterly basis. The government said: 'Don't worry about the paperwork; don't worry about any of that. And we're going to make you all pay it monthly.' That brings forward money.


The government did not consult with the business community about this; this came out of left field. They did not ask anyone about the paperwork implications; they did not do any of that. They are doing this because they need to bring forward money to try and create a paper surplus. The first step, starting on 1 January 2014, is for companies with a turnover of a billion dollars or more to lodge monthly returns. A year later, 1 January 2015, it is companies with a turnover of $100 million or more. A year later, companies with a turnover of $20 million or more will have to lodge monthly rather than quarterly payments with the tax office. Have the government thought about the paperwork implications of this? A billion dollars is a significant turnover, and there is probably more of an issue of cash flow for a company with this turnover. Companies with an annual turnover of $100 million or more could be companies with 200 or 300 employees. It is not hard to get to $100 million in turnover for a company that operates in every state. But then companies with a turnover of $20 million or more have to lodge monthly returns.


I thought, 'Twenty million bucks, that's not necessarily a big company.' If you think about the local news agency, it has a big turnover but probably small margins. I am not saying they would have a $20 million turnover, but they have a big turnover because they have a lot of cash go through the tills. Pubs have a lot of turnover. There would be plenty of individual pubs with a turnover of $20 million.




Mr Buchholz:
  Service stations.




Mr HOCKEY:
  Service stations, as my learned colleague knows, having run a business. There would be plenty of service stations with a turnover of $20 million, even though the margins are very thin. Tourism companies would have big turnovers, even though their margins are small. If you pay $5,000 to have a tour of Australia, out of that maybe 200 bucks goes to the travel agent. All these businesses would now have to lodge monthly returns, because the government needs the money.


I have deep, deep reservations about this in particular. It is one thing for large companies, and I have reservations about monthly returns for them, but for businesses with a turnover of $20 million—fair dinkum, seriously, where do they pluck these numbers from? We are not allowed to ask, and even if we did we would not get any answers. Where did $20 million turnover come from? On what basis? Who is the genius that thought it up? Was it the Treasurer? Was it the tax office? Was it someone in the Treasury?


Who was the genius who picked $20 million for monthly returns?


Where was consultation? Did they speak to anyone in the business community? Did they speak to any chambers of commerce? Did they speak to any industry associations about the implications? The Service Station Association, or newsagents or the Pharmacy Guild—did they speak to them? Plenty of pharmacists might have a turnover of $20 million, with the PBS and prescription services. They could be two shops or three shops. But now they have to lodge monthly returns. Fair dinkum! What a chaotic government!


What we do know is that they claim this move is going to net $1.4 billion over the forward estimates. I see the member for—is it Werriwa—there?




Mr Laurie Ferguson:
  Yes.




Mr HOCKEY:
  Prophetically, he declared, 'The Labor Party is dead over boats,' and it is dead over tax too. I know that does not come to mind first.




Mr Laurie Ferguson:
  Who wrote this? Laundy?




Mr HOCKEY:
  But I would say to you, sir, that it is not just boats that Labor is dead on; it is dead on tax policy and it is dead in this parliament. Exhibit A is this bill, mate. You introduce a complicated taxation bill last week, no community consultation, no committee consultation, and ram it through the parliament, all because you are trying to get to a surplus that was never going to happen under Labor. And now you are introducing provisions that are going to have a huge impact in the community, but you do not want to speak to anyone about them!


I would say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the total measures in this bill bring forward more than $10 billion worth of tax receipts—$10 billion. And it has been all about a surplus that Labor will never deliver. What a surprise! Even with all these measures in this chaotic taxation policy, the debt keeps growing. As we found out yesterday, the debt limit is going to have to be increased again. The Treasurer does not have any courage; he is a weak man. He does not have the courage to come into this place and ask for an increase in the credit card limit of the Commonwealth. And why? Because he has done it on four previous occasions and he does not want to have to do it on the fifth. He will leave it to whoever is there on 15 September. As he said to Neil Mitchell, 'It will be someone else's problem'. He does not even think that he will be there; it will be someone else's problem.


Do you know whose problem it is going to be? It will be that lady's, up there in the gallery. It is going to be your problem. And the gentleman next to you, and the gentleman to him. All of you—it will be your problem. Because there will be a mess left by this government again that someone has to clean up.


Schedule 2 of the bill makes various amendments to tax laws and the Infrastructure Australia Act to introduce a tax loss incentive for infrastructure projects identified by the Infrastructure Coordinator. Now, the government claims that this measure will encourage private sector investment in nationally significant infrastructure such as roads, rail and ports. I want to see that too. We want to encourage private sector investment in infrastructure. This is hugely important. Governments—state, federal, Liberal or Labor, whatever the case—do not have the money available for massive up-front investment in infrastructure, so we have to find ways to encourage that vast pool of money, particularly of superannuation, to go into infrastructure.


The changes within this schedule allow entities such as corporates and trusts that are carried on exclusively for the purposes of what is called a DIP—a designated infrastructure project—to uplift tax losses by the long-term government bond rate and carry forward tax losses, as well as plain bad debt deductions, even though that does not satisfy the continuity of ownership and same business test for companies and equivalent tests for trusts.


It is an enormous amount of power in the hands of the Infrastructure Coordinator. We would have liked to get more information about this in the committee process, but, again, we can only deal with what we have before us. I would like to know what the possible unintended consequences of this provision are, but we are not going to get any answers.


Schedule 3 and schedule 4 of this bill deal with the Tax Agent Services Act 2009. I stated from the outset that the coalition has a number of concerns in relation to schedules 3 and 4. We are going to move amendments to excise these two schedules from the bill. The Tax Agent Services Act was introduced in order to provide a national regulatory regime for tax agents and BAS agents:


… to ensure that providers of tax agent services to the public meet appropriate professional and ethical standards.


Now, the Tax Agent Services Act seeks to address the fine line between whether an entity is merely providing general information about the tax implications of particular products or giving tax advice that can be reasonably expected to be relied on, and therefore a taxation service.


The government took the decision to carve out the tax agent services provided by financial services licensees, and this carve-out is due to expire on 30 June 2013. So, with less than four weeks to go before its proposed implementation, schedule 3 of this bill seeks to create a completely new regulatory regime for financial services industry entities that give tax advice. So with less than four weeks to go—just think about this—anyone in the financial services industry who gives tax advice under the act is going to have a completely new regulatory regime start, and here is the legislation.




Mr Buchholz:
  The busiest time of the year!




Mr HOCKEY:
  The busiest time of the year in the lead-up to the end of the financial year, and some genius somewhere who is probably the same person who gave advice on the rest of the bill has said, 'Let's get on with it and give them four weeks notice.'


We have said this is a joke. The government proposes that a tax or financial advice service consists of two elements: the provision of tax agent service and the provision of a service in the course of giving advice that is of a kind usually given by a financial services licensee or representative. Seriously—these are new definitions. These are new rules with less than four weeks to go. People out there are trying to earn a buck, and you are changing the regulatory regime. The government has sat on its hands for three years on this and now it is doing it with less than four weeks to go—and, by the way, it is meant to go through the Senate in two weeks. It is not just going through this place; it actually has to go through the Senate in three weeks. The Senate only sits for two weeks, and Lord knows how many bills the Senate has itself.


The government are recklessly exposing all the financial advisers to the risk of being noncompliant with the relevant laws from 1 July 2013. There is no practical way for them to achieve compliance within the short time frame left before these schedules become applicable law. It is just impossible. It could change in the Senate in three weeks time. Then it has to be gazetted. So they are saying to the financial services industry, which as a percentage of GDP is the second largest in Australia after health and around 10 per cent of the economy, 'Guys, we're giving you less than a week for a new regulatory regime.' The Labor Party wonder why there is chaos. Here—look at this bill. They are wondering why consumer sentiment is poor. They are wondering why business confidence is poor. They are creating a new regulatory regime for a large part of the Australian economy, and they are giving them a week's notice at the busiest time of the year.


The Financial Planning Association, the Financial Services Council and the Association of Financial Advisers have all pleaded that they get time to assess this bill. This relates not only to the consultation process but to definitions in the act. It is unclear, for example, if stockbrokers, insurance brokers and mortgage brokers are covered. They are pleading for time to look at potential negative interactions and inconsistencies with the government's own bungled FOFA changes, which also come into effect on 1 July 2013. They are trying to work out any increases in compliance costs resulting from the changes and what the consumer benefit of these changes is. These poor buggers have a new pricing regime for their business that they build into for their accounts. They are trying to work out what the costs are for consumers and what the cost of this massive new compliance regime is to their business. I do not think that is unreasonable. Surely the Treasury gave advice that this is a mess. I just cannot believe it. I do not think any department could be so removed from the community that it is there to serve that it would suggest that this is going to work in a week's process. This is ridiculous. We are going to try to excise it. This is ridiculous. It has to be put off.


Schedule 5 we are, again, going to seek to excise. We have deep concerns about this. The first of these measures requires the commissioner to publish particular information obtained from tax returns of those corporate tax entities which have a total income of $100 million or more for an income year. What the Commissioner of Taxation is going to do—and this is the first time this has happened—is publish individual companies' tax. He will also have a duty to publish the final annual amount of an entity's minerals resource rent tax—we know that is not that much—or the petroleum resource rent tax payable as reported by the entity regardless of the total income.


I introduced a private member's bill on 18 March this year to amend the Taxation Administration Act to remove any doubt that taxation officers may disclose to the minister information about instalments in the MRRT. We had high farce. We had the government saying it was not able to give the Australian people an update on how much the mining tax was collecting because that might disclose individual companies. How that works I do not know, because it is a tax on an industry and even we assume that there might be more than one taxpayer. But, even if there were one taxpayer, so what? It would not be disclosed. No-one would know who it was. We just asked that there be information made available, as there is for capital gains tax, income tax and every other tax. We just asked that there be updates available on the amount of revenue being collected under a particular tax headline.


The government said they could not do it, so I introduced my private member's bill to say, 'Well, sure you can.' The government were so opposed to what we were trying to do that they do not want to just list the amount of revenue raised from the mining tax; they want to disclose who is paying it. They want to tell you the names of the companies. Again, this is exactly the same old story. What consistent principles do the government hold? What do the government actually believe in that can be considered the same today as it was yesterday? Is there any consistent bone in the aggregate of bones over there?


We support the publication of aggregate tax information, unless that information can be reasonably attributed to a single person. But the government has gone one step further and said, 'No, we think individual companies should have their tax disclosed. Okay—a number of companies already disclose the amount of tax they pay in their annual returns. But what does this mean for Australia? I think that is a question this government does not ask itself often enough.


Ernst and Young, one of the largest global accounting firms, said:


… it is premature for Australia as a small open economy to engage in this public disclosure proposal unless and until public disclosure of corporate tax is identified by a majority of the G20, G8, OECD stakeholders or countries in the Asia Pacific region … it represents a distraction from the much bigger task of adjusting the system for taxation of international business.


The only country in the OECD that requires disclosure of tax from large companies, including foreign companies, is Denmark. Denmark is not really in competition with us. When I think of the competition Australia faces in taxation, trade, resources and investment, I do not automatically think of Denmark.


So what is the implication of this? Australia should not make the mistake identified by the United Kingdom Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, who was recently quoted as saying:


There is mounting concern about where tax is actually paid … The danger at the moment is that this just spills over into a generalised anti-business, anti-multinational sentiment which is unhelpful because we do want successful businesses, we do want inward investment. We don't want people to be stigmatised on the basis of ad hoc little bits of research.


I understand where he is coming from. I have no problems with disclosure, and I certainly want companies that earn money in Australia to pay tax in Australia. But I am not sure that these things are being redressed. Again, I think the risk of this schedule is that the government is like a bull at the gate. It is just going down the process of taking on business—a war with business. For all of its years it has been at war with business. After the first 12 months of the Rudd government, Labor has been at war with business. But the worst part is that it then introduces legislation that has unintended consequences and then cries crocodile tears when we have business sitting on its hands for new investment—or, worse, pulling out.


Schedule 6 of the bill amends the petroleum resource rent tax, and this builds on the calamity of the recent decision of the full Federal Court in the case of Esso Australia Resources. I would just say to you that we have tried to deal with a number of these issues previously. We are not going to stand in the way of these amendments. We do support the clarification contained in schedule 6 relating to the deduction of legitimate project expenditures. Schedule 7 is about removing the CGT discount for foreign individuals. We will allow the passage of the measure, particularly given the budget emergency which clearly exists under Labor. We support the amendments in schedule 8. Schedule 9 is on the GST-free treatment of National Disability Insurance Scheme funded supports; we support that. We are prepared to support updating the list of deductible gift recipients. In schedule 11 there are a number of miscellaneous amendments to the tax and super laws as the government claims, removing some anomalies.


Finally, I just say again that this bill is an absolute calamity in terms of its aggregate impact. It just represents in so many ways the chaos of the government. So, whilst we recognise that revenue needs to be raised, we also will move amendments to make sure that it is properly dealt with by this parliament in a respectful way.

Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright) (09:51):  It is always a pleasure to follow the shadow Treasurer. I know firsthand that he has enormous small business experience and understanding and so comes to this House with a different set of skills that assist our nation in making tax law amendment decisions. As the shadow Treasurer pointed out, this is a poorly thought-out bill which defies most of the standing orders and procedures of this House. But, unsurprisingly, as I stand to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (2013 Measures No. 2) Bill 2013, it is consistent with a lot of other bills that come into this House. 


There are three commonalities to bills that come before this House from Labor. The first is that they normally give more power to a union mate. Second, somehow in there there is an increase in the Public Service. Third, there is an increased tax. That is what this one is. It comprises the largest number of taxation amendments in this term and contains 11 schedules. The coalition will move an amendment to this bill to excise schedules 3, 4 and 5, given the government denied the opportunity for this bill to be properly scrutinised before coming to the House.


I will explain for the benefit of Hansard and for the nation how the normal line of scrutiny would be applied. Deputy Speaker Georganas, let me start with a bit of history that I am sure you will find informative but not surprising. The coalition is deeply unhappy with the handling of this bill. When the bill was introduced the coalition sought to have the bill referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services. The House Economics Committee used its numbers to have the debate shut down. What happens is that such a bill, by definition, is referred to the Economics Committee, which then becomes the front door. It is the Economics Committee's role to look for public scrutiny. The Economics Committee would then go to the market, to the stakeholders and those that the bill would have implications for, and they would call a public inquiry. They would call stockbrokers, mortgage brokers—any interested party that would have a linkage and where this bill would affect their business. They would call them to a room. They would allow those stakeholders to give evidence, to ask questions of Treasury and to put their side of the story so that the bill could be properly scrutinised. It did not happen.


They shut that part of the procedure down by using their numbers in the Economics Committee so that this bill could not be debated and scrutinised. It is a single taxation bill with 11 amendments, which is unprecedented, but with no consultation with industry. If I am an Australian I am starting to get suspicious. Why would a government do that, especially a government that advocated earlier in its turn that we needed to open the window and let the sunlight in—that we needed to have transparency in this parliament? 


But this is not an isolated case. When it comes to trying to hide the facts, we saw it only a couple of days go with the Education Bill. It was Labor's cornerstone policy, one of the jewels in the crown, but a measly 1,400-word document on nine pages was brought into the House. There were 71 amendments and then the debate was shut down. There is a pattern emerging between this bill, where they are trying to shut down scrutiny, and what we are seeing happening on a regular basis. It is happening on a regular basis because we are seeing the wake of a desperate government. These are the side effects and we are a poorer nation for it.


On Friday, 31 May 2013, the Labor majority of the House Economics Committee refused to hold an inquiry. That was a sad day. So we are now in the position of having the government asking the parliament to pass a bill with significant changes to the law within a week of its introduction to the parliament with no committee oversight. I said before that the bill currently before the House contains 11 complex schedules. Schedules 3, 4 and 5 in the bill particularly deserve scrutiny. 


Schedule 1 speaks to monthly PAYG instalments. It deals with the 2012 MYEFO budget measure that sought to bring forward more than $8 billion worth of company tax revenue by requiring companies to pay income tax by instalments monthly rather than quarterly. The main driver and sole purpose of this measure seemed to be shoring up the future promise of a budget surplus. I need not take you too far back to when on over 300 occasions—some advocate 300, some advocate that in aggregate it was 500—claims were made that this government would return our nation to a surplus. When you hear that a government is going to return our nation to surplus you would think that they would be going to do it by stimulating economic activity in the market. You would think they would do it by increasing the pie. You know how these guys were looking to get to a surplus, Deputy Speaker? They were looking to do it by accounting trickery—by not actually increasing the pie but by simply taking the revenue that would have been generated in a quarter, breaking it down into months, and using it through an accounting procedure in the quarter before the budget to make the revenue numbers in Q2 look stronger. 


And do you know who pays? It is the business sector that pays as a result of cash-flow limitations. They would normally have had their overdrafts and their cash flow through their business scheduled for quarterly payments of the PAYG. But, no, some genius decided that if they applied this accounting trickery they would be able to move towards their surplus. It used to be that the only businesses that would have to pay the quarterly instalment were businesses that generated over $1 billion worth of turnover. That did not seem to be generating too much coin and they thought that there was an opportunity for more tax to be raised if they dropped the amount to $100 million. Not happy with $100 million, it was then dropped down to $20 million. The reason I draw your attention to those numbers is that I want to show you how it is trending. It was from $1 billion to $100 million to $20 million. I will tell you where it stops: it stops next at mum and dad, or anyone—they will not stop until they have got it all.


The aim of the original MYEFO measure was to deliver a surplus, but that then ended up as a deficit. This move netted the government $1.4 billion over the estimates. If you remember, $1.4 billion was roughly what the surplus was going to be. That is what they were forecasting—about a $1.3 billion surplus. It came in at—what?—a $19.4 billion deficit. So it was nearly $20 billion out. But that was consistent, because they are normally about $20 billion out with their forecasts. In total, the measures within this bill bring forward more than $10 billion worth of taxation receipts and bolster the government's budget bottom line over the forward estimates. It is accounting trickery. As I say, nothing in this measure increases the pie. It does nothing to give business confidence. 


The Treasurer comes into this House on a regular basis to say what strength our economy is in. The other day we had the Reserve Bank hand down its findings on the cash rate, which is staying where it was. An analysts' perception from Macquarie, which is on the public record, states:


The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Board decided to leave rates unchanged in June. While this was in line with market expectations, we thought there was a clear case for cutting rates further.


They made a case for cutting rates further—and this is in an environment where this bill attacks the cash flow of businesses. They stated:


This view was premised on the sharp falls in consumer confidence, falling house prices, declining commodity prices, insipid retail spending, declining business investment, falling job advertisements, a raft of downgrades from mining services companies, slowing wages growth and weak business confidence.


And the best thing this government can come up with is to say: 'Let's tax you more. Let's take your quarterly commitment away and go after you monthly.' That is the government's answer to recent comments from Macquarie Bank.


The alarm bells are ringing about the state of the competitiveness of our economy and the alarm bells are ringing in every business in my electorate of Wright as the debt and the deficit are reaching unprecedented levels. We have a budget emergency. The emergency started back in 2008. We had money in the bank when we were in government. In 2008 this government said we needed to increase our master card debt ceiling to $75 billion because that was what we needed to get us through the GFC. Yes, there is some economic rationalism on that stimulus government spend. Nothing is wrong with that $75 billion. That was their first forecast. A couple of years later they were back wanting to increase that master card limit to $200 billion. There is a vast difference between $75 billion and $200 billion. But that was not enough. Back in 2012 they were looking to increase the debt cap to $250 billion and not too long after they got to $300 billion. When you look at the expenditure in the forward estimates, from there on it will not be long before we are looking down the barrel at $400 billion.


The member for North Sydney, the previous speaker, raised the point that this government knows quite well that it is going to be somebody else's job to pay down that debt. Because guess what? We cannot pay this debt off in one generation. They say it is not a lot of money, but in the Howard era we would have had to have 18 of the biggest surpluses in a row to clear out the debt. So we are looking at a minimum of a couple of generations of working lives, when people are able to contribute taxes, and that is if we do not put on more debt.


Schedule 2 of the bill relates to incentives for designated infrastructure projects. This bill makes various amendments to taxation laws and the Infrastructure Australia Act 2008 to introduce a tax loss incentive for infrastructure projects designated by the infrastructure coordinator. The government claims that this measure will encourage private sector investment in nationally significant infrastructure such as roads, rail and ports.


The coalition have reservations about this schedule due to the discretion given to the infrastructure coordinator in approving tax concessions for individual projects. However, we will not oppose this measure, because we are going to have our own internal hurdles as a nation on how infrastructure projects are going to be funded in the future. The coalition have a plan on how we will fund those in partnership with the market combined with tax incentives. We will be keeping the implementation of this policy under watch, however.


Schedule 3 creates a regulatory framework for financial advice services and schedule 4 contains other amendments to the Tax Agent Services Act. These parts of the bill are unduly cruel. Schedules 3 and 4 of this bill deal with the Tax Agent Services Act 2009. It is another attack on small business. My office has received many emails from tax agents in my electorate sharing concern over this proposal. This is a bad tax. This one is the shocker. If we are going to get an amendment up, this has to come out. 


It is unduly unjust. At two minutes before midnight, with no public scrutiny we will be implementing at the busiest time of the year for our tax agents another layer of regulatory burden. One can only assume from a cynical perspective that the intention of the tax office and this government is to trap small business so it can be seen as another source of revenue from implementing fines or to run people out of business. There is no sense. I do not believe for one minute that that is their intention. I believe this was an oversight, so I call on the government to let the sun shine in on this part of the bill, to let the sun shine in on these amendments. These are cruel. The rollout of this needs to be delayed from 2013 through to 2014 so more consideration can be given. There are too many unknowns around schedules 3 and 4. You have 100 days of government left. In that last 100 days do one thing right: fix this.

"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2013-06-06,"



Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff) (10:06):  I rise to speak to the Tax Laws Amendment (2013 Measures No. 2) Bill 2013. I have had the opportunity to raise this matter on the handling of this bill in the chamber previously. I did so as the Deputy Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics. The shadow Treasurer and the member for Wright have touched on the journey we have gone on to arrive at this destination. It has been a convoluted journey, but it has been a relatively short journey because this tax laws amendment bill No. 2, which contains over $10 billion of additional receipts for the federal Labor government, has been rammed through this parliament without appropriate parliamentary scrutiny.


For a measure like this, which I am informed by the shadow Treasurer is the single biggest revenue item in a tax laws amendment bill that we have seen in the parliament's history, it is extraordinary to think that this Labor government is so bereft of any ability to conform to appropriate levels of scrutiny, with absolutely no desire to provide any adequate justification, no attempt to explain to the Australian people why it is doing what it is doing and, most concerningly, no regard for the consequent impact as a result of these changes on thousands, if not tens of thousands, of stakeholders across the Australian economy—indeed, hundreds of thousands, when you consider schedule 1 alone.


So what has been the journey for the Australian Labor Party? How have we reached this new low when it comes to their inability to make any of the big calls correctly? We know that the Australian Labor Party has world's greatest Treasurer over there, the member for Lilley—you would have to question the methodology about how they arrived at that conclusion but, that notwithstanding, he has got the gong and he is going to hold it with all his might. I suspect he will hold that gong with more resilience than any State of Origin player did last night with the ball, but he is going to hold on to that precious little gong that he has because, frankly, that is all he has. His track record does not attest to the fact that he is the world's greatest Treasurer. The tax record of the member for Lilley is to be up to his eyeballs in debt and deficit and to make one false promise after another, but that is entirely consistent with the Prime Minister, so we should not be surprised.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr S Georganas
):  I remind the member to be relevant to the bill.




Mr CIOBO:
  The Australian Labor Party, as part of their attempt to pull the wool over the eyes of the Australian public last year, saw the Treasurer stand up and say, 'This will be the first year of surplus, followed by four years or three years of surplus thereafter.' That is what he said; those were his words on last year's budget. And we now know the truth: instead of it being a billion-dollar surplus—we knew Labor were never going to get there; we flagged it at the time—it has actually turned into, low and behold, a $19 billion deficit.


But as part of the grubby attempt by Labor to deliver a surplus on paper, even though there was absolutely no way they would deliver a surplus in reality, they introduced the initiative that is contained within schedule 1 of this bill. That initiative is to bring forward company tax payments from the quarterly approach to now being required to be paid monthly. That window of the first 12 months, the change from quarterly reporting to monthly reporting, with payments being made to the tax office as a direct result, saw an injection of cash into the federal government to make up for the fact that there would be a change from four times per year to 12 times per year, which saw a short-term injection of cash. And that, on paper, meant the Australian Labor Party were able to bolster their books and there would be just that little bit of extra cash sitting in there, which helped the Treasurer to fall across the line when it came to delivering his so-called billion-dollar budget surplus.


They made this announcement with no consultation, no forewarning, no attempt to determine what the compliance impact was going to be. Instead, the only thing that the Treasurer was concerned about was if that was going to help to prop up his pathetic billion-dollar paper surplus. And now, 12 months later, we know there was no billion-dollar surplus. Instead we have another $19 billion deficit—just the latest in a series of deficits as part of the $190 billion of deficits this government has run up since they were elected—as part of their inexorable march towards reaching gross public debt, a peak approaching $400 billion.


Here we are, 12 months later, and the government are ramming this bill through the parliament. And they are doing so, as I said, with no regard to the compliance cost on those businesses that now have to change to report monthly instead of quarterly. Part of the problem is that in making this change, given that we did not even have a surplus and we had another $19 billion deficit, there will not be a surplus next year, there will be an $18 billion deficit; there will not be a surplus the year after that, there will be another deficit. For as long as Labor are in power there will be deficits. But despite that, the entire policy rationale for making this change has evaporated because we are not in surplus anyway. And instead companies, trusts, a whole range of different individuals now have to put up with all the extra paperwork and the compliance to satisfy schedule 1 of this bill. We attempted to apply some parliamentary scrutiny and attempted to discern what the impact would be on business. The Labor Party shut it down; the executive arm of government shut down parliamentary scrutiny.


The coalition sought to say: 'What are the impacts of these TLA No. 2 bill? What will it actually mean in terms of compliance? In respect of schedules 3, 4 and 5, what will their impact be on tax agents? What will the impact be on financial planners, on tax advisers?' Those schedules, again, have not seen the light of day. It is not as if the government or the Department of the Treasury or others have been out there massaging the stakeholders, saying: 'Look, can you explain this to us? We want to make sure that public policy represents best practice. Can you tell us: how can we change the laws to help you do your job? Explain to us: what can we do in terms of public policy to make sure the Australian people are better off as a consequence of our changes?' No, that is not Labor's approach. That is not the approach of this government. Instead they shove these changes into this TLA bill.


We the coalition attempted to refer the bill off for parliamentary inquiry before the committee system, as should be the case. What does Labor do? They shut it down. They use their numbers to make sure there is no inquiry and instead they just push the bill through the parliament with the support, once again I expect, of the so-called puppet Independents—the member for Lyne and the member for Windsor and others who will just allow this to go through, again just washing their hands, as Pontius Pilate did, of any of the consequent impacts in terms of red tape, compliance and livelihoods on tax agents and in terms of the impact of the changes on those tax agents and the Australian people who rely on the financial advice they receive. They will just wash their hands of it and say, 'We want stability in government.'


There are absolutely no points for understanding that this is just another nail in the coffin of this government, another reason the Australian people do not trust a government that undertakes decisions like this, that runs scared from parliamentary scrutiny, that does not have the decency to talk to stakeholders whose livelihoods rely on this. It is a government that does not care about what the public policy ramifications will mean for the mums and dads who will go and see financial planners and make decisions about their financial security and their futures off the back of changes that are contained within these laws. 


That is the reason the Australian people are fed up with the Australian Labor Party. They have good reason to be because Labor are just so arrogant when it comes to their approach to governing. Labor are completely obsessed with ramming through whatever they can in these final two weeks and one day of parliament without any regard for what the impact on the community will be.


We in the coalition will use the brief periods that we have to highlight all the shortfalls that we see contained within laws like this. When the Australian people hear that all the extra red tape and all the extra compliance contained within this bill are here for one reason only—because the Treasurer, the member for Lilley, needed to try to deliver a couple of hundred million of extra revenue, on paper, one financial year to try to prop up his pathetic attempt to reach a budget surplus—only to know that we have a $19 billion deficit and therefore there was no point to the change whatsoever, no wonder they will just say, 'They are a joke.' 


The Labor Party is a joke and should be branded a joke because this represents the lowest form and the lowest approach to public policy that could possibly exist. There are no benchmarks here, no gold standard, no world best practice with the approach contained within this bill. That is not even with respect to tax matters. That is with respect to parliamentary scrutiny. Remember the days of 'let the sunshine in'. They have closed the curtains and drawn the blinds. That is what is going on. It is entirely consistent—I notice the minister at the table—with the approach that Labor also adopted with respect to Gonski, another multibillion dollar approach.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr S Georganas
):  I ask the member to be relevant to the tax bill.




Mr CIOBO:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I am just talking about a pattern of behaviour by this Labor government. I do not intend to go through all 11 schedules in the bill, but I will also touch upon those schedules that the coalition is attempting to have segregated from the balance of the bill so that effectively the bill is split.


Schedules 3 and 4 deal with creating a regulatory framework for tax and financial advice services as well as other amendments to the Tax Agent Services Act. The carve-out was put in place sometime ago and it expires on 30 June this year. As I indicated already in my comments, the coalition sought to provide opportunity for the stakeholders—the people who inform the mums and dads of this nation about what they should be doing in their financial affairs—to have their feedback upon the approach that Labor was adopting. Labor said, 'We do not want the feedback, frankly, we are not prepared to listen, we will just what we want to do.' 


The Financial Planning Association, the Financial Services Council and the Association of Financial Advisers have all raised concerns with respect to the changes contained within this bill. They are concerned about the fact that there has been a complete lack of consultation on the bill. They are concerned about the definitions used in the act. It is unclear, for example, if stockbrokers, insurance brokers and mortgage brokers are covered. There are concerns about possible negative interactions in relation to FOFA, the future of financial advice, reforms in this bill. They are also concerned about increased compliance costs resulting from the bill. That inevitably means one thing: extra compliance costs that are faced by tax agents, financial advisers and others will simply be passed through to consumers. We do not know what the impact of this is going to be. We know that all the peak bodies are concerned. We know that very good people like John Brogden are concerned, but we do not have the opportunity to discern what the impact will be because Labor will not enjoy the scrutiny. 


This bill, in my view, represents one of the lowest points for the Australian Labor Party. The bill does need to be split so that the less controversial aspects can go through, although they should have gone through after parliamentary inquiry. In the absence of that, at least they can go through, but the more controversial aspects—schedules 3, 4 and 5—ought to be separated and the coalition attempts to do that with the amendments we have put forward.

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (10:21):  I rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (2013 Measures No. 2) Bill 2013. This 118-page bill contains a range of tax changes in 11 schedules. They are very complex changes that require careful consideration and proper parliamentary scrutiny, as outlined by my colleague the member for Moncrieff. However, at this stage this will not occur because the Labor government are ramming this bill through parliament before the election, irrespective of its incredibly complex consequences for industry and the Australian economy. We saw a similar process occur when this government rammed through the Future of Financial Advice legislation.


The bill was introduced just last Wednesday, on 29 May, after which the bill was appropriately referred to the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services and then passed off to the House Standing Committee on Economics. That Labor dominated committee since decided that such complex changes do not warrant any scrutiny, declaring:


... due to the urgency of the bill and the need to resume the second reading debate there is insufficient time to undertake an inquiry.


It is the view of the coalition that this is simply not acceptable. As the coalition members of the House Economics Committee indicated in their dissenting report:


Coalition members of the committee recognise the importance of parliamentary scrutiny of executive government. The decision of the committee to reject an inquiry into the Tax Laws Amendment (2013 Measures No. 2) Bill 2013 due to ""insufficient time"" represents arrogance from Labor members.


This bill significantly increases government revenue (in other words—higher tax receipts) by nearly one billion dollars in schedule 1 alone.


The fact relevant government agencies, as well as the public and key stakeholders were denied an opportunity to inform the committee of the consequences of this decision by the Gillard Labor government underscores the shambolic and reckless approach to policy development by Labor.


Allowing the debate on the second reading today does not give important stakeholders any opportunity to consider and comment on the proposed changes, which could have huge ramifications in their industries.


First, I will address schedules 3 and 4 of this bill which respectively extend the regulatory framework for tax and financial advice services and make other amendments to the Tax Agent Services Act 2009. Schedule 3 amends the Tax Agent Services Act 2009, TASA, so that tax advice given by practitioners in the course of giving advice that is usually provided by financial services licensees falls within the regulatory regime administered by the Tax Practitioners Board, TPB. TASA introduced a national regulatory regime for tax agents and business activity statement agents to ensure that providers of tax agent services to the public meet appropriate so-called professional and ethical standards. TASA introduced this regulatory regime based on three elements: the definition of what constitutes a tax agent service, the registration requirements for the code of professional conduct that applies to registered tax agents, as well as civil penalties that could apply to unregistered tax agents. As outlined in the explanatory memorandum to this bill, TASA generally requires entities that provide tax agent services to register with the TPB.


At the time of that legislation, there was a recognition of the fine line between whether an entity is merely providing general information about the tax implications of particular financial products or whether it is giving tax advice that could reasonably be expected to be relied on and therefore a tax agent service. Therefore, it was decided to exempt tax agent services provided by financial services licensees and their authorised representatives from TASA. This is set to expire on 30 June 2013.


This means that there will be a new regulatory regime within TASA for entities in the financial services industry which give tax advice. It does this by creating a new type of regulated service—that of a 'tax (financial) advice service'. The definition of a 'tax (financial) advice service' would comprise two elements: that of providing a tax agent service and providing that service in the course of giving advice that is of a kind usually given by a financial services licensee or an authorised representative. Therefore, providers of tax (financial) advice services from July 1, 2013 would need to register with the Tax Practitioners Board and meet the requirements of the legislation.


There has already been strong feedback from the industry about these changes. The Association of Financial Advisers has called this legislation 'rushed and flawed', which has been brought forward 'without due process or adequate consultation'. As they have highlighted, 'there is a serious risk that the legislation will result in significant unintended consequences' because of the 'lack of detail and regulation or guidance'. The latter characteristics are symptomatic of most of the legislation put up by this Labor government


There are several other outstanding issues raised by these changes, including, but not limited to, the lack of clarity of which types of financial advisers will be captured under the act such as stockbrokers, insurance brokers or mortgage brokers. Questions remain about whether all financial advisers will have to be registered and, furthermore, what will this legislation mean in terms of further training for financial advisers and how will the interactions evolve between the registration of financial advisers with changes already passed in the rushed and highly complicated FOFA legislation? Lastly, what are the implications of this bill in terms of the interaction between the TPB and the Australian Securities and Investments Corporation, who are both regulators in this area, and who will take precedence where there are inconsistencies?


Those FOFA changes were debated in this House in March 2012 following an inquiry process which actually did occur. At that time, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services was advised time and time again that FOFA would result in huge additional costs, reduce employment levels in the financial industry and reduce the availability and access to quality advice. The Gillard government did not listen and passed that complicated legislation, which the coalition strongly opposed and voted against. Although they will not allow this legislation to be referred to a committee, I remind the Gillard government that the financial services industry is already trying its hardest to implement FOFA by 1 July this year, and these changes to TASA have the potential to further hurt the financial services industry.


Other constituents in my electorate who are financial advisers have also contacted my office to highlight the important work of financial advisers, who help 'workers, retirees and their families in Queensland achieve their financial objectives and be independent in retirement'. They have outlined their concerns about this 'costly duplicative regulation'. They are concerned that the TASA changes 'will make the cost of doing business prohibitive, meaning job losses and financial advice becoming more expensive and less accessible around the country'. These constituents and stakeholders deserve to have their voices heard and their questions answered during a parliamentary inquiry. Ultimately, all these unanswered questions mean the potential for uncertain increases in compliance costs for financial advisers.


The coalition therefore seeks to excise these schedules from the bill. We do not believe that the government should be proceeding with changes to TASA; instead, we should extend the transitional arrangements already in place—which exempt tax agent services provided by financial services licensees—to ensure consultation can be brought to a judicious conclusion.


If this means deferring these changes through the committee process and beginning anew after the next election, then so be it. The time line of an election of this parliament does not negate the need for proper parliamentary processes, nor should it impact on the passage of poorly designed legislation.


Further, schedule 5 involves amendments to the Taxation Administration Act 1993 to change the rules regarding Australia's business tax system. There are three primary changes. Firstly, there is the imposition on the tax commissioner to make public certain information obtained from the tax returns of corporate tax entities with a total income of $100 million or more in a financial year. This imposition will also involve the publication of an entity's final annual amount payable under the minerals resource rent tax or petroleum resource rent tax, regardless of its total income.


Secondly, the new law will allow the publication of aggregate tax information, irrespective of whether such disclosure is reasonably capable of being attributed to a particular entity, unless that entity is an individual. The third measure increases information sharing between government agencies, as the explanatory memorandum states, 'involving information to the Secretary of the Treasury, for the purposes of briefing the Treasurer in relation to a decision that may be made under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 or Australia's foreign investment policy'.


As I previously mentioned, the coalition did attempt to refer this bill to the House economics committee, but Labor rejected that. Therefore, the coalition will seek to excise this schedule from the bill. We do so because of concerns particularly with the imposition on the tax commissioner to make public the tax affairs of corporate tax entities with reported total income over $100 million and the relation to payments through the mining tax and PRRT. 


The intention for these amendments was announced in February 2013 by the Labor government—after the government attempted to hide the failure of its mining tax by refusing to release those revenue figures in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. At the time, the government claimed it could not release the figures because it could potentially identify the tax information of specific corporate entities. The coalition did not believe this assessment at the time, which is why in the end the government indeed released the mining tax revenue receipts; because the Treasurer's confidentiality arguments could not be sustained.


So what is the government's legislative response? It is now actually imposing on the tax commissioner to release information about the liability of companies under the mining tax and PRRT and allow the publication of tax information, even if it does attribute that information to a particular entity. The coalition believes that is a massive overreach by this government; just as it would be if the government were to make public tax information relating to an individual.


Furthermore, schedule 1 of this bill amends the tax laws to require certain large companies to pay their PAYG, pay as you go, tax instalments monthly rather than quarterly or annually. Under current law, all entities are liable for PAYG instalments quarterly unless they are eligible to become an annual or biannual payer. Under the new law, entities will be liable for monthly PAYG instalments if they exceed certain thresholds, which are 'base assessment instalment income in a particular financial year'.


The threshold will begin at $1 billion for corporate tax entities from 1 January 2014 and subsequently lower to $100 million from 1 January 2015 and to $20 million from 1 January 2016. From that date, all other entities with a base assessment income threshold of $1 billion, including superannuation funds, trusts and individuals, will be required to pay monthly PAYG instalments, reducing to $20 million the year after.


The government claims that this change will not increase the overall tax burden on a corporation or other entity. However, for those entities affected, this change does amount to a very significant one-off bringing forward in their tax and could potentially result in perpetually tighter cash flows and slimmer operating cash buffers. I do note that the reduction in payments to monthly is intended to bring in $10.15 billion to the government over the forward estimates.


I do not have the time now to go through every single measure in today's bill. This bill involves extremely complicated changes which would be best left to be further considered by the oversight of a parliamentary committee, as the coalition has recommended. This would allow parliament to fully scrutinise the intended consequences and, more importantly, the unintended consequences of the measures and allow the relevant stakeholders to have their say about what these changes mean for them.


In relation to schedules 3 and 4, as I have highlighted, this opportunity is particularly important for the financial services industry, who are already struggling with the implementation costs of this Labor government's FOFA legislation. Complex changes require careful consideration. The failure of this government to put forward this legislation with full scrutiny is yet another reason why Australians simply cannot trust this Labor government.

"Fletcher, Paul, MP",LP,2013-06-06,"



Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (10:35):  I am pleased to rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (2013 Measures No. 2) Bill 2013. This bill contains 11 complex and highly technical schedules. As the coalition have made clear, we believe that schedules 3, 4 and 5 in particular deserve further scrutiny, and we will be moving amendments to excise these schedules from the bill.


In the brief time I have available to me this morning I wish to focus on schedules 3 and 4, which are intended to establish a new regulatory framework governing tax advice given by financial advisers, financial planners and others who are giving such advice on tax incidental to the course of giving advice on broader financial issues. The key issue which is addressed by these schedules is whether that advice should be subject to the regime in the existing Tax Agent Services Act 2009.


In the time available to me I want to make three points. The first is that there are complex issues here which affect a wide range of stakeholders. The second is that the government has rushed through these detailed and complex changes with very little consultation. Thirdly, therefore, the coalition does not support these changes to the regulatory arrangements governing the provision of tax advice without further scrutiny and consultation.


Let me turn to the first proposition, which is that these measures raise complex issues which affect many stakeholders. Indeed, these measures would affect many professionals who provide tax advice incidentally to the provision of advice on financial products. It is a fairly obvious proposition that it is difficult to untangle tax advice from financial advice. If we think about a financial adviser or a financial planner who is advising a client to increase his or her superannuation contributions, obviously, part of the rationale for such an increase is going to be that superannuation is a tax advantaged investment. Money which goes into a superannuation fund, subject to it being below the annual contribution limit, is taxed at 15 per cent as compared to the marginal rate if the money is taken in ordinary income. In those circumstances, for most taxpayers the marginal rate is well above 15 per cent. If someone is providing advice about extra superannuation contributions, inevitably they, as a financial planner or a financial adviser, will raise tax considerations in the advice that they give to their client.


Similarly, if someone were to advise a client, as a financial planner or a financial adviser, that that client should consider taking out a margin loan to buy a parcel of blue-chip shares, again, the tax considerations would necessarily form part of their discussion with their client. They would need to explain to the client the tax treatment of the interest on the margin loan. While the advice is given primarily as part of assisting the client to develop an effective financial strategy to maximise his or her wealth over time, in the provision of that advice there will necessarily be a discussion of the tax aspects of this particular structuring of the client's affairs.


A third example might be advice regarding the tax benefits of investing in shares which have franking credits. Again, the primary purpose of the provision of the advice is to recommend the desirability of investing in shares as a means of building up wealth over time. I hasten to add that I am not personally expressing a view as to whether shares constitute a good investment for that purpose or not. I am simply making the point that an adviser or planner might very well find themselves in the position of giving such advice to a client. Again, what would necessarily form part of that discussion would be advice about the way the dividend imputation system works. The fact is that shares, in companies which are themselves paying tax, carry with them franking credits, and when that is added into the overall mix that increases the after tax value of the returns from the shares.


The point I am making is that it is very difficult to disentangle advice on the financial affairs of a client from advice on the tax implications of particular financial options and choices that the client may choose to follow based upon advice from, for example, a financial planner or a financial adviser. It follows, therefore, that it is quite problematic if financial planners and financial advisers are not permitted to advise on tax issues. On the other hand, tax is clearly a very complex area. The consequences of getting tax matters wrong can be severe for taxpayers. It is therefore appropriate that the provision of tax advice should be carefully regulated.


These issues were weighed up when the existing Tax Agent Services Act 2009 was passed. That legislation established a national regulatory regime for tax agents and agents providing advice on business activity statements as part of the GST arrangements, so as to ensure that providers of tax agent services to the public meet appropriate professional and ethical standards. The legislation establishes the definition of a 'tax agent service', and the legislation seeks to establish that dividing line. Is the advice merely general information about the tax implications of particular financial products, or is it the provision of tax advice which could reasonably be expected to be relied upon and therefore a tax agent service?


As part of drawing that dividing line, in developing the regime that was legislated under the Tax Agent Services Act the government took the decision to carve out tax agent services provided by financial services licensees and their authorised representatives. In other words, the policy decision that was taken when the 2009 act was passed was to use that particular carve-out mechanism to establish the dividing line. Therefore, somebody who is providing advice to a client and who is a financial services licensee or the authorised representative of a financial services licensee is excluded from the regime in the Tax Agent Services Act, even though in the provision of financial advice—as I have pointed out—that person is inevitably, necessarily and naturally likely to provide advice about the tax implications of that particular financial instrument or structure that they are recommending that the client should invest in.


What we have before the House now is a bill which proposes a complex new regime, taking a different approach to establishing where that dividing line is. It will do so by creating a new type of regulated service: a 'tax (financial) advice service'. Let me briefly note the enthusiasm with which the Treasury and other relevant officials treat the bracket as a device in the naming of bills and other concepts. Under the regime that is proposed in the bill, the tax (financial) advice service will consist of two elements: the provision of a tax agent service and the provision of a service in the course of giving advice of a kind usually given by a financial services licensee or its representative. If you are to provide such services you will need to register with the Tax Practitioners Board.


These issues are complex and they affect many stakeholders. The Financial Planners Association, the Financial Services Council and the Association of Financial Advisers have all raised concerns in relation to the changes proposed in schedule 3 of this bill. Those concerns include the lack of consultation in relation to the bill and the lack of clarity in the definition which is proposed to be used in the bill. It is unclear, for example, if stockbrokers, insurance brokers and mortgage brokers are covered by the definition. Stakeholders have also raised concerns about the potential negative interactions with the very complex and extensive Future of Financial Advice reforms and of the increased compliance costs resulting from the bill that will inevitably be passed onto consumers.


I would like to quote from a letter from the Financial Planning Association of Australia dated 3 June. That association said:


In our view the Bill is far from finalised and does not satisfactorily relate to the taxation advice provided in the context of financial planning advice.


The most significant key outstanding issues include:


a clear and appropriate definition of tax advice (financial product) service;


whether the responsibilities and liabilities for the TASA obligations apply to the individual planner, a supervisor, or the licensee;


alignment with the Best Interest Duty and other Future of Financial Advice (FOFA) reforms; and


ASIC's role in the implementation of TASA.


We are four weeks away from the existing deferral arrangements ending and we are still not clear on the exact requirements and obligations for financial planners in respect to complying with the Tax Agent Services Act, should this be required. … Considering that the Tax Agent Services Act will impact every one of our 9000 practitioner members, and likely more than 40,000 in total, the lack of consultation and the tight time frame is a real concern.


That brings me to my next point, which is that the government has sought to rush through these complex changes with very limited consultation.


When this bill was introduced, the coalition sought to have it referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services. That request was denied and the bill was instead sent to the House Standing Committee on Economics by the selection of bills committee. On Friday, 31 May 2013, the Labor majority of the House economics committee refused to hold an inquiry into this complex bill. So we now have the situation where this government is asking parliament to pass a bill with significant changes to the law and with significant impact on key stakeholders—with those stakeholders very uncertain as to its impact—within a week of the bill being introduced to the parliament, with no committee oversight. There is no word to describe this process other than atrocious.


It is quite difficult to understand why the government has got itself into this situation, given that the 30 June 2013 deadline has been there for a long time. Yet this government has left this important matter to the last minute. Also, the current arrangements have worked satisfactorily. So, even if there is a policy case to improve them—as to which I express no view—there is no particular reason to do it with effect from 1 July this year. It would be perfectly practicable to roll over the current regime for another year to go through a proper and considered process. It is further hard to understand given that these changes affect an industry—the industry of financial planning and advice—which has faced a relentless torrent of regulatory change in the last three years, including Future of Financial Advice reforms, the MySuper reforms, Superstream and a range of others, all of which involve complex changes to business processes, IT systems and client engagement models. And now this government is proposing to dump another burdensome set of regulatory changes on this industry at very short notice.


This brings me to my third and final point, which is that the coalition does not support these changes without extensive further scrutiny. The coalition have a simple choice this morning: do we support these changes as presented to us or do we reject them? We do not dismiss out of hand the question as to whether the dividing line is appropriately struck between the provision of tax advice on the one hand and the provision of financial advice, including tax issues, on the other. We simply say that there has not been adequate time to consider this important question. There are serious stakeholder interests at stake. Until a proper process has been carried out, we will not support these provisions.

"Oakeshott, Robert, MP",Ind.,2013-06-06,"



Mr OAKESHOTT
 (Lyne) (10:50):  I note that several of the speeches made on this bill, the Tax Laws Amendment (2013 Measures No. 2) Bill 2013, seem to be trying to build an element of division around the entire bill, when the truth is that most schedules in this bill have bipartisan support—and that is welcomed. Of the 11 schedules that are in this omnibus tax amendment bill, I understand that there are three that are in disputes—schedules 3, 4 and 5.


Dealing with those issues first, I think we are fundamentally talking about bringing financial planners under the Tax Agents Services Act, which are the schedule 3 provisions, backed up by some technical amendments in schedule 4, and then schedule 5, making the tax paid by large corporations more transparent. I am very surprised with that being at all controversial.


In fact, I will deal with schedule 5 first. This is a key part of the business integrity package as announced in the federal budget. I have a lot of time for the new tax commissioner, Chris Jordan, in particular, who I understand has done a lot of work with the business tax working group following on from the tax summit in 2011. Now in his new role he is implementing with government and with the Assistant Treasurer a business integrity package that I think deserves the support of this chamber.


There are reports from jurisdictions all round the world on this issue that Australia needs to start getting its head around and we need to participate in, in a cross-jurisdictional way, looking at how multinational companies are gaming sovereign tax laws to their own benefit and to the detriment of the communities they are doing business in. That is a noble starting point, that we start to address these issues in a substantive and coordinated way both within Australia and across jurisdictions. The key opposition to this, as far as I can work out, is that there is some belief that government is overreaching. On the contrary, I hope this is just the start of trying to address these issues, which are real and which have the potential to significantly erode the integrity of the tax base in Australia.


These laws do not impact the privacy of one single individual in Australia, even the wealthiest individuals. As far as I understand—and the minister may like to correct me—not one single individual, poor or rich, is impacted in regard to their own privacy. The legislation is starting to try and address, as far as I understand, the issues of large companies with significant turnovers and, I think quite rightly, people wanting to know what tax is paid by the very large corporations in Australia, most of them already reporting this information in their annual returns to their shareholders. In my judgement as a representative in this chamber, I do not view this as a layer of red tape or a further impost. This is allowing Chris Jordan and the ATO to do their job on behalf of all Australians and protect the integrity of our tax base and make sure we are not being gamed. This means that individuals may have to pay more tax, if we are being gamed by the top end of town who are happily doing business and selling products in our market yet not paying a fair and equivalent share of their contribution to the tax base.


I have no problem whatsoever with schedule 5. In fact—and this is a message to both sides of this chamber—I sincerely hope this is just the start of the journey of Australia dealing with issues around the integrity of our tax base and cross-jurisdictional tax issues. There are plenty of examples both within Australia and around the world of well-known multinationals, in particular, gaming those sovereign tax laws at the expense of countries, including ours. I welcome schedule 5.


In relation to schedules 3 and 4, I am really disappointed that they are being omitted. I accept the arguments, and I hope it is only for a short time. It is now four months until an election, so this is a message to both sides: I hope this is not some sort of win for my old mate John Brogden and financial planners or for Mark Rendall. I hope this is not just a cave-in to some pressure from the financial-planning industry and that it is being omitted with the noble intent of buying some time to do some further consultation. But the principles behind schedules 3 and 4 and the importance of consumer protection very much stay on the agenda.


I have heard all the arguments for and against from financial planners, accountants, tax agents, experts in the law and many, many others. Where real concerns have been raised, I have done what I could to get answers. Initially there was a legitimate argument about lack of consultation. The exemption for financial planners under the Tax Agent Services Act was a time limited extension that had expired in 2012. It was extended and it had always been the expectation that financial planners would be governed by this regime. There is still time for consultation on the regulations that will come beneath the act relating specifically to education and experience to achieve registration for financial planners. After having done a bit of homework, I think the lack of consultation question is relatively shallow. I hope once again that this is not a cave-in to some political pressure. Initially I thought there was a fair argument around unreasonably stopping financial planners undertaking their role, but the response has been that there is a three-year transitional period during which planners will only be required to register with the board. I am told the regulations are well underway and there will be plenty of time for educational requirements to be satisfied before the transitional period ends.


The other issue that I thought was legitimate, one I pursued with ministers involved, was that there was an inconsistency between these tax reforms and the very good FOFA reforms that have gone through this parliament as part of a broad reform agenda of this 43rd Parliament. I thought there was some legitimacy in the argument that these laws need to be talking to the FOFA laws and vice versa. That was of concern to the point where I was not going to support schedules 3 and 4 until there was some clear direction on that. I got that clear direction. I got a letter from Minister Bill Shorten, which I am happy to release after this. In the letter he said that the reform of the tax agent services regime does very clearly talk to the FOFA reforms and they work in parallel. Likewise, I received a similar letter from the minister at the table to the effect that creating a co-regulatory framework for tax advice services is actually the point of the exercise—getting the FOFA reforms to talk to tax reform is the narrative; it is the point. That we are now dropping that because of some political pressure is a step backwards. So I received both of those letters.


Importantly, though, I received a letter from ASIC, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, that has said that ASIC is confident that the Corporations Act and TASA are consistent and that a financial adviser can comply with both. That is a relatively long letter that also provides comfort. And my good friends at the Tax Institute I think put it best of all—and the Tax Institute are hardly a friend of government. Arguably, they are the country's leading professional association in tax, with 13,000 members, including tax agents, accountants and lawyers. Fundamentally, they support the tax profession to work to continually improve tax law and administration. They are very passionate about schedule 3 and say that it is an important consumer protection measure in tax law. I think they will be bitterly disappointed that because of the lack of numbers in this chamber the government has had to omit schedule 3 at the expense of consumer protection in Australia today. I will also release that letter.


The Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia have also passionately argued that the accounting profession supports schedule 3. They said, 'This has been in gestation for some 20 years, with concerted discussion and drafting of this particular element of the Tax Agent Services Act 2009 arrangements over the last three years.' But from the shadow Treasurer through, on one side of this House, we have heard that this has all been a mad rush by a disorganised government and that the sky is falling. Twenty years in gestation, in writing from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia—a good friend, I would have thought, of the Liberal-National Party.


So what has gone on? The Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Tax Institute, ASIC and both ministers have providers letters of comfort to say that schedule 3 talks to the financial services reforms of the last couple of years. They say it is a really important reform for consumer protection in Australia, so who has folded? And why? I hope that the vote actually records who has folded and why.


I am a good friend of John Brogden; I will put that on the record. But I would hope that a lobbying campaign from John Brogden and Mark Rendall is not at the heart of vested interests getting in front of consumer protection and important law reform that has been in gestation for 20 years according to the Institute of Chartered Accountants. Why would our chamber get in the way of improving consumer protection, particularly in the last five years, when every community—mine as well as everyone else's in this chamber—has had superannuants and retirees have their money diddled by people who are working in this field, where there is $1 trillion of superannuation money. The Cooper review has stated that there are immature rules around that trillion dollars. We need to improve the regulatory framework with some urgency, yet some people in this chamber have folded their tent behind a bit of political pressure, a bit of lobbying and a bit of positioning for the next four months.


I think that consumers, who are voters, have a right to be angry. Their money remains exposed, with immature rules around some really critical reforms for our country that get the FOFA reforms talking to our tax laws, as clearly identified in letters of comfort from ASIC, from the Tax Institute, from the Institute of Chartered Accountants and from both ministers. I think it is really disappointing that the numbers are not in, and that we have had to omit schedules 3 and 4. I know there are financial planners who will run around and pop the champagne, but consumers should not. Retirees should not; retirees have had a loss today. Their money is still exposed by a regulatory regime that still needs further work.


As a chamber, I would hope that we are not bailing out for good. I hope that, as a compromise, this is just buying a window of time. I would encourage the minister to answer that. I would hope this gets revisited with some urgency, because the point of the exercise is in schedule 3 and 4, and that is to get FOFA talking to our tax laws and vice versa. We have bailed out today. It is disappointing. Consumers have had a loss, and I hope we can revisit it sometime soon.

"Bradbury, David, MP",ALP,2013-06-06,"



Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (11:05):  I would like to take the opportunity to thank all members who contributed to this debate, in particular the member for Lyne for his contribution, which I think was a very worthy one.


Schedule 1 of the Tax Laws Amendment (2013 Measures No. 2) Bill 2013 requires large entities in the pay-as-you-go instalment system to make their instalments monthly instead of quarterly. Unlike the coalition's monster paid parental leave tax, no entity will pay more tax as a result of this change. In fact, not one extra dollar in tax will be paid. This merely changes the frequency with which instalment amounts must be remitted to the Australian Taxation Office.


In order to help reduce compliance costs, the commissioner will be granted a new power to develop alternative methods of developing instalment income. Earlier this year, I also announced a longer term review of the pay-as-you-go instalment system. As part of this review the government will consult with industry to identify longer term reforms to improve the pay-as-you-go instalment system for all businesses, large and small.


The member for North Sydney bleated that the $20 million threshold had been plucked out of thin air. Once again, the member for North Sydney is showing his ignorance of these matters and also, I think, is showing why he is unfit to be sticking his hand up to be the Treasurer. The $20 million threshold was chosen to align with the GST threshold for being a monthly GST reporter, so there is a very clear reason. The figure was not plucked out of the air; there is a very strong rationale for that. The whole purpose of the reform is to better align PAYG instalment payments with the GST payments for most large companies and to allow PAYG instalments to be more responsive to the economic conditions faced by their businesses.


Schedule 2 to this bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to introduce a new tax loss incentive for designated infrastructure projects. The tax incentive will promote private sector investment in infrastructure projects determined to be of national significance. Examples of these projects that could benefit include the Brisbane Cross River Rail, Sydney motorways and Melbourne Metro projects. I know firsthand how important the Sydney motorways project is to the people of Western Sydney. It is desperately needed, but we would of course like to see the extension to the M4 go all the way to the city and would like to ensure that, whatever the financing arrangements, a new toll is not imposed on an old road where motorists are forced to pay a toll for driving along a road that they currently drive on for free.



Mr Hockey interjecting—




Mr BRADBURY:
  The member opposite says it will never happen. Perhaps he should tell the people of Western Sydney that he is intending to make a false promise.


This is an important part of a broader package of reforms to build the—




Mr Hockey:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I am not going to have that misrepresentation. I said it will never happen without a toll. He verballed me and sought to misrepresent me.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms Vamvakinou
):  The minister will stick with the matter.




Mr BRADBURY:
  And that was very much a part of the package of measures that we have before us. But this is an important part of a broader package of reforms to build the infrastructure Australia needs to compete in the 21st century. The tax incentive will promote private investment by preserving the value of accumulated losses over time. Further support is provided by removing the restrictions imposed on the use of carry-forward losses, which can prevent losses being claimed if there is a change of ownership of a project. The tax incentive will encourage private investment in nationally significant infrastructure such as roads, rail and ports. It is a clear demonstration that this side of the House is committed to improving the nation's infrastructure, which is so important for the long-term growth of this country.


Schedules 3 and 4 ensure the appropriate regulation of all forms of tax advice whether they are provided by a tax agent, a BAS agent or an entity in the financial services industry. Contrary to the misleading claims of those opposite, the bill contains a three-year transitional period to allow financial advisers to comply with the regime. All of this rubbish about people being required to come into compliance with the regime in a matter of weeks is precisely that. This is similar to the transition period that this parliament provided to accountants who provide financial advice. These amendments are designed to ensure that all entities that give tax advice meet appropriate professional and ethical standards.


That is what they would do, of course, if the coalition were not determined to block them as they are. The member for Lyne made the point very clearly that somebody has to come into this place and stand up for the protection of consumers. It is one thing, as one of the members opposite said, to talk about the financial planners in her electorate, and I am sure they are wonderful people doing a good job, but it is our responsibility to protect the consumers—the broader population—from the professional activities of those within the financial-planning sector who are engaged in providing advice that is of a taxation nature. These amendments would give consumers the confidence they need and they deserve. The government thinks that Australians who use financial advisers should feel secure knowing that the adviser meets appropriate professional and ethical standards. I think it seems hard to object to that.


The shadow Treasurer claimed that there has been no consultation. The truth is that there has been extensive consultation. If we have a look at what has been occurring, we can see that on 29 November 2010—that is right; back in 2010—the government consulted with the public on a discussion paper titled Regulation of tax agent services provided by financial planners. Then, throughout 2011 and 2012, the former Assistant Treasurer, my predecessor, held roundtable consultation with Treasury and with stakeholders. Furthermore, there was public and targeted consultation on the draft legislation. If the opposition are hiding behind claims of process to avoid the truth—that they are not willing to stand up for consumers—let me, in detailing that consultation, remove that fig leaf.


The government are committed to these reforms, and we will continue to advocate for the rights of consumers. If three rounds of consultation are not enough for the shadow Treasurer then we will allow parliament more time to scrutinise these amendments and ask that the coalition join with us in supporting these important consumer protection measures.


Schedule 5 provides important opportunities for the public to scrutinise the performance of Australia's business tax system and the contributions made by large and multinational businesses. Like the member for Lyne, I am surprised to see that the opposition is proposing to oppose this. There is growing concern not just here in Australia but right around the world that many of the key rules of international taxation have not kept pace with the evolution of the global economy. The apparent ease with which some large corporate entities can shift taxable profits and erode a country's tax base is a shared concern for this government, for the G20 and for, in fact, most OECD countries. I am surprised that it is not a concern of those opposite. Policymakers and the Australian public should have more transparency around the levels of tax being paid by large and multinational businesses in Australia to allow for an informed debate about the efficiency and equity of our tax system. By increasing the transparency of our business tax system the government will ensure that the public is well informed about the contributions made by large corporations. The amendments will also ensure that the government can be advised on and publish period aggregate tax collection information even where there may be few corporate entities paying a particular tax. In addition, schedule 5 facilitates increased information sharing between government agencies.


I pick up on the point that the member for Lyne made. We believe that the privacy of individuals in relation to their tax affairs should remain sacrosanct, and nothing in this schedule will alter that. But I make this central point: as we engage in a debate around base erosion and profit shifting, I hear plenty of stakeholders—in fact, some opposite—come forward and say, 'Show us the evidence that the corporate tax base is being eroded; show us the evidence that there is profit shifting.' In fact, these are the arguments that I have heard from those opposite when they have come into this place consistently to oppose measures that we have introduced to crack down on corporate tax loopholes—over $10 billion worth of measures in revenue protection that have been voted against by those opposite. Every single time, they come into this place and they say, 'Show us the evidence that big multinationals are not paying their fair share of tax.' We say, 'Okay, we need to amend the law so that you can see all of that evidence,' and they come in here and say they are opposed to it. What are you hiding? Why is it that you are so determined to hide the tax position of so many of these companies? It is outrageous. The net effect is that, if we do not crack down on these loopholes, individuals and small businesses—average, hardworking Australians out there—have to end up paying a higher burden of tax to pick up the slack when some of the most profitable companies in the world are not paying their fair share. You should be ashamed of yourselves.


Schedule 6 addresses issues arising from the full Federal Court decision in Esso Australia Resources Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation in 2012. Without amendment, there would be significant financial implications for industry, with many taxpayers being unable to deduct legitimate project expenditures in determining the PRRT liability for their petroleum projects. The government recognises that such an outcome would be inconsistent with the policy intent underpinning the PRRT regime and the way it has been administered since its commencement in 1987. The amendments maintain the policy intent of the PRRT as a profits based tax and are broadly consistent with the ATO's longstanding application of the PRRT law in relation to the treatment of deductible expenditure. At the same time, they preserve the substance of the court's decision that a taxpayer cannot derive a tax advantage via contract arrangements with related parties.


Schedule 7 exempts from income tax payments made to individuals under the Defence Abuse Reparations Scheme. The establishment of the scheme forms part of the government's response to the DLA Piper report of the review into allegations of sexual or other forms of abuse in Defence. The payments made under the scheme are in recognition of the fact that abuse in Defence is unacceptable and wrong. Exempting these payments from tax will ensure that recipients receive the full benefit of the payment. Exempting the reparation payment from the income tax will also prevent it having an impact on people's social security payments, such as parental leave, family assistance and child support payments.


Schedule 8 implements the government's announcement of 8 May 2012 to remove the 50 per cent discount on capital gains accrued after that date for foreign individuals. Foreign and temporary resident individuals will still be entitled to the 50 per cent discount on eligible capital gains accrued prior to 8 May 2012 after offsetting any capital losses, provided they choose to value the asset as at that day.


Schedule 9 amends the GST law to establish the framework for providing that certain services and support provided to National Disability Insurance Scheme participants will be GST free when they are provided for in a National Disability Insurance Scheme plan. This will ensure greater certainty for National Disability Insurance Scheme participants and providers that supply services to those participants. These amendments will apply in relation to supplies made on or after the commencement of section 37 of the National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013. However, this is subject to state and territory agreement to the making of the necessary determination.


Schedule 10 amends the deductible gift recipient provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. Taxpayers can claim an income tax deduction for gifts to organisations that are DGRs. Schedule 10 adds five new organisations to the act: namely, the Aurora Education Foundation Ltd, United Way Australia, the Australian Neighbourhood Houses and Centres Association Inc., the Australia Foundation in support of Human Rights Watch Ltd, and the Layne Beachley Aim for the Stars Foundation Ltd. The government will also move an amendment to add an additional organisation to the act: namely, Social Traders Ltd. Making these organisations deductible gift recipients will assist them to attract public support for their activities. Schedule 10 also extends the listings of two organisations in the act: the DGR listings for the Roberta Sykes Indigenous Education Foundation and the Charlie Perkins Scholarship Trust have been extended indefinitely. Extending the DGR listings for these organisations will assist them in continuing to attract public support for their activities.


Finally, schedule 11 makes several miscellaneous amendments to the taxation and superannuation laws. These amendments are part of the government's commitment to the care and maintenance of the taxation and superannuation systems. I commend this bill to the House.

Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (11:20):  I present supplementary explanatory memoranda to the bill. I ask leave of the House to move government amendments (1) and (2) on sheet ME100 and (1) to (4) on sheet BF253.


Leave granted.

In moving these amendments, I reinforce the points made in the summing-up speech in relation to the importance of listing for Social Traders Ltd. I also recognise the fact that, given the opposition to schedules in relation to the Tax Agent Services Act, we will ensure that some additional consultation can occur in relation to those matters. But I reiterate the fact that the government remains committed to proceeding with what are essentially amendments that will ensure that financial planners engaged in the provision of taxation advice are subject to the same requirements of those elsewhere that are providing taxation advice.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House, Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and Minister for Regional Development and Local Government) (11:22):  I want to take the opportunity to speak briefly on these amendments and on the legislation, because they do provide important reform to infrastructure, including the new tax-loss incentive to major infrastructure projects introduced by schedule 2 of this bill. By removing tax disincentives this reform will support up to $25 billion in new private sector infrastructure spending. This important reform is yet another milestone in federal Labor's ambitious infrastructure agenda. We are delivering record funding for infrastructure investment, but we recognise that we need to mobilise private capital as well as direct government expenditure. 


I congratulate the minister on this initiative, which arises from an announcement that we made in the 2012 budget and arises from the sort of work that the Infrastructure Australia Finance Working Group, chaired by Jim Murphy from Treasury, has done. We, of course, have funded all of the 15 projects deemed ready to proceed on the Infrastructure Australia National Priority List. Building on this, the Infrastructure Coordinator will designate projects eligible for the tax concession. To be eligible, projects need to be assessed as ready to proceed on the priority project list. 


The tax loss incentive also complements our recent budget announcement for the transformational public transport projects—the Melbourne Metro and Brisbane Cross River Rail. Both of these projects have been identified as priority projects of national significance. They are critical in addressing capacity constraints and congestion in our major cities and will enhance productivity growth. They also are projects on a scale that requires private sector contributions. Therefore, we are taking a new, innovative approach which is structured around an availability payment model to attract private sector investment. The tax loss incentive will also encourage private sector investment for such projects by preserving the value of infrastructure project losses over time and exempting these losses from utilisation tests that normally apply.


This reform will support major transport projects that transform our cities and make our international gateways more competitive. This is an important piece of legislation. I commend the legislation as well as the amendments to the House. It is important that we continue to invest in both road and rail infrastructure in addressing congestion issues in our cities. Our approach is about delivering reforms that complement our nation-building investment program, such as this tax loss incentive.

Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (11:25):  I welcome the backdown from the government in relation to these amendments. Occasionally they do listen to the wise counsel of the coalition. On this occasion they have, appropriately, shelved schedules 3 and 4 and allowed for proper consultation.


I do not want to rub it in, but I do note the speech from the member for Lyne. I just cannot help but be reminded of his absolute, total hypocrisy in this place. The member for Lyne was a guy that said: 'Let the sunshine into the parliament. Let everyone have a good look. Let's have proper scrutiny and treat the chamber with the respect it deserves.' Yet he stood in this place not long ago and said: 'Don't worry, I have letters from ministers that assure me that this bill is not going to have what could be the impacts. We don't need to have a parliamentary inquiry. I've got—I, the member for Lyne, Rob Oakeshott—letters from ministers and I've got letters from these people. I'm satisfied. Therefore, no-one else needs to have the opportunity to consult. Because if you consult with me, Rob Oakeshott, that is all the consultation you need. Don't worry about the parliament. Don't worry about any committees of the parliament.' What a complete hypocrite this guy is. Seriously, every time we have tried to have additional scrutiny, the member for Lyne is in the way. Yet he goes out there and parades like some sanctimonious god of accountability. Frankly, he is a complete, damn hypocrite.


I cannot wait for the day that he is not in this place so that we can have someone who actually is consistent representing Lyne. The previous member for Lyne was a man of great integrity. This current member for Lyne—I do not know what he is possibly thinking when he gets up here in this rather droll way and says: 'Don't worry, I've consulted and therefore we should all be satisfied. Everything is okay as long as I'm satisfied.' Whereas, actually, nearly half the House, on this side, are not satisfied—and now the government themselves are saying they are not satisficed—with the proper level of scrutiny of those schedules to the bill. So the overwhelming majority now in the chamber want further consultation in relation to the schedules. But for the member for Lyne, because he is satisfied everyone else should be satisfied. Anyway, common sense has prevailed and we welcome just a little sliver, a glimpse, of common sense from the government.

"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,2013-06-06,"



Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (11:28):  by leave—I move opposition amendments (2) and (5):


(2) Clause 2, page 2 (table item 10), omit ""5"", substitute ""6"".


(5) Schedule 5, page 77 (line 1) to page 83 (line 11), omit the Schedule.


Confidentiality of taxpayer information is fundamental to the administration of taxation law, and confidentiality is protected because ensuring the privacy of sensitive information, including commercial information, goes to public confidence in the system of tax. The minister for superannuation, the member for Maribyrnong, has said as much himself. He said:


Taxpayers provide personal information to the Tax Office expecting it to be kept confidential. 


The public release of taxpayer information, therefore, needs compelling justification. What have the government said? They have said they are going to reveal taxpayer information for two reasons. The first is, as the Assistant Treasurer says:


… more transparency around the levels of tax being paid by large and multinational businesses in Australia to allow an informed debate about the efficiency and equity of our tax system.


Schedule 5 requires the commissioner of tax to release information to the public that is disclosed in the taxpayer's tax return—namely, the entity's total gross income, its net taxable income and its income tax payable. It only applies to companies if their total income is $100 million or more. So multinational groups, such as Google, Amazon or Starbucks, which may have minimal income sourced in Australia, will not be affected, I understand.




Mr Bradbury:
  No, that's not true. That's why we have the accounting figure. It's not true.




Mr HOCKEY:
  I welcome clarification, but that is my understanding. Instead, this measure, as I understand it, will potentially provide reputational risk to privately owned entities and shareholders, so private companies. In their submission to the Treasury discussion paper of April 2013, Godfrey Hirst Australia Pty Ltd, Australia's largest carpet manufacturer that has a base in Geelong and has a turnover exceeding $300 million, noted that the disclosure relates only to companies and stated:


… for those which are privately and closely held it will be an easy task for commentators to apply the tax paid (or not paid) to the owners. Publication of the data would give information that could be detrimental to shareholders, including to their safety.


How will that allow for better informed debate?


Reconciling total income to taxable income is set out in the tax return and provided to the ATO. The reconciliation contains numerous adjustments, each of which is allowed under the tax law and reflects established tax policy, and can include: dividends from tax sources overseas that are exempt when they get to Australia, so it is all additional income; dividends from taxed Australian sources that have franking credits attached; prior year losses which are offset against taxable income; as well as tax incentives such as the R&D offset, which the government ripped $1.1 billion out of this year apparently. An Australian group with major operations in overseas subsidiaries would have a large total income but a comparatively small taxable income because of exempt dividends. So that information may well be used by other countries to punish Australian entities operating in their countries. Why would you want to do that? Why would you want to make it harder for Australian exporters operating in other jurisdictions to deal with those jurisdictions by publishing this information in Australia about how well they are doing in other jurisdictions when they do not do that with us? This government feels the need to lead in every regard, no matter what the cost is to Australian employers.



Without additional guidance the information that the bill compels the commissioner to make available to the public may well be grossly misleading. Far from improving transparency, public release of the information referred to in proposed section 3C of the Tax Administration Act is likely to reduce transparency. It misleads unless there is additional context. So, no doubt, companies will be required by the activism of advocacy groups to explain the apparent disconnect between the tax they have paid and their income. Let it be done if that is the government's view, but it is an additional significant cost and it is additional significant regulation and it makes us less competitive. The government always feels the need to make us less competitive, because of its unintended— (Extension of time granted)


Secondly, the Assistant Treasurer's second reading speech contends that the increased transparency is intended to discourage aggressive tax minimisation practices by large and multinational businesses. I have no issue with making life extremely difficult for those who break the law and I want the tax office to go after them with the full force of all the available resources, but I make this point: do not make it too hard to do business in Australia by imposing regulation on businesses that are complying with the law because they may then find that this additional regulatory burden in Australia just makes it too hard to stay here.


The basis of our legal system is summed up by the Tax Institute in its submission to a Treasury discussion paper released in April. They said:


… a taxpayer's obligation to pay their “fair share” of tax in Australia cannot be imposed via any means other than clearly defined laws, as made by the Australian Government. Taxpayer obligations should begin and end with compliance with the tax law. 


I agree. In recent years the ATO's risk assessment practices have expanded to include a number of tools that help the ATO determine how compliant particular corporate groups may be. New methods of risk determination include prelodgement, review of the tax return, the reportable tax position schedule and the international dealings schedule. The question is: have the ATO got sufficient powers? I would contend that yes, they have. Of course they have. If they have not then let them prove their case.


What I am saying is that you do not just give the ATO more powers, and you do not just give everyone unfettered access to everyone else's information without having proper accountability. I would say to the government: think carefully before you do this stuff. Do not go down the path, time and time again, of knee-jerk reactions to populism like the member for Lyne. Think carefully about what needs to be done. But, most importantly, think carefully about what our competition is doing, because there are other places to invest in other than Australia.


If foreign corporations operating in Australia feel as though Australia is simply picking them out when no other jurisdiction, other than Denmark, is going down this path, then it is easy for them to move out, and that just costs jobs. And it could be the difference between a major operation continuing to manufacture in Australia or moving their operations overseas. It could be that little bit extra that makes it just a little bit harder to do business in Australia and tips the board to decide that it will go to New Zealand or South Africa or China or the United States or any other jurisdiction. This added burden of regulations, added burden of red tape—it just keeps adding, adding, adding to the difficulties of doing business in Australia. That is why we are sticking with our commitment to move amendments (2) and (5) as circulated in my name.

"Bradbury, David, MP",ALP,2013-06-06,"



Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (11:38):  Just a couple of quick points. The member opposite began by saying that he had concerns for Australian businesses and how these transparency measures would impact on them. But then in the course of his discussion he quickly moved on to saying that if larger multinational businesses felt that they were somehow being discriminated against then they would not invest in the country. I think he should work out his line: whether he is here protecting small Australian companies that might inadvertently get caught in this measure, as he was suggesting, or whether he is talking about larger multinational companies.


One reason why this is important—the member for North Sydney talks about regulatory impact and the disincentives for businesses to come and set up here in Australia. One way you can discourage businesses to set up is to slug them with a big tax, a $20 billion paid parental leave tax.



Mr Hockey interjecting—




Mr BRADBURY:
  It is relevant because one of the threshold tests for that tax is that you have to have a $5 million taxable income. As the member for North Sydney scurries out of the chamber, what he will not do is tell the Australian people who are the 3,000-plus companies that will be stuck paying that levy. In fact, he cannot tell the Australian people who they are because we do not actually know who they are. We do not know who the companies are that are going to be slugged with that tax. He came in here and said he is concerned about reputational damage to companies, yet he went through and named a handful of companies. If he is fair dinkum, his paid parental leave tax will slug businesses. We do not even know who is on that hit list. Who are those 3,000-plus companies? I tell you what: the Australian people deserve to know. They deserve to know when it comes to transparency.




Mr Robert:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order going to relevance. Looking at amendments (2) and (5), I see no indication or relevance at all to paid parental leave schemes in relation to where the amendments to this bill are going.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. DGH Adams
):  Order! The Assistant Treasurer will be relevant to the amendments before the chair.




Mr BRADBURY:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I am being absolutely relevant. This is about tax transparency. They have a new tax they want to slug people with, and it goes to the question of eligibility. You pay that paid parental leave tax if you have a taxable income of $5 million or more. Now we do not know who those companies are, and maybe that is why the opposition are opposed this measure because they do not want the hit list of companies that they are going to slug with their paid parental leave tax to be known.


I can tell you that on the question of $5 million taxable income there will be multinational companies that do not qualify to pay paid parental leave tax, and there will be lots of small- and medium-sized Australian companies that will get slugged with this $20 billion tax. It is no wonder they are going to great lengths to try to conceal the identity of the 3,000-plus companies that will be on their hit list for their paid parental leave scheme. I reiterate the point I made earlier: do not come into this place and say, 'We want evidence that we need new powers for the tax commissioner to crack down on corporate tax loopholes,' and when we try to come up with a means of demonstrating that there is base erosion and profit shifting going on then say, 'Oh no, we don't think we can support this amendment.' They are not fair dinkum when it comes to tackling these corporate loopholes. We have brought measures into the parliament, they have opposed them every time. I am not surprised that they come in here again to oppose these measures once more.



The SPEAKER:  The question is the amendments moved by the member for North Sydney be agreed to.

Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (09:21):  The coalition is deeply unhappy with the government's chaotic handling of this bill, the Tax Laws Amendment (2013 Measures No. 2) Bill 2013. The bill was introduced last Wednesday, and the coalition sought to have the bill referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services. That request was denied. Instead, the government sent it to the House Economics Committee. Then the House Economics Committee last Friday refused to hold an inquiry into the bill.


The government is now asking the parliament to consider an incredibly complex taxation bill with significant changes, with no committee consideration, and the bill was only introduced last week. There has been no community consultation. There has been no committee consultation. The bill has been drafted. We hear the government itself is amending the bill which it only introduced last week. The government thinks it is giving this parliament the chance to have an appropriate process for the deliberation of something so significant. Fair dinkum!


They wonder why their government is chaotic, and here is their taxation bill, and it is the largest taxation law amendment bill on record. It has 11 schedules dealing with a range of different taxation issues. The government introduced it a week ago and have prevented any consultation by any committee. Then the government cannot understand why they keep screwing up policies. This is exhibit A. We are trying to deal with this bill in good faith. We are trying to deal with all these taxation issues in good faith, because they go to revenue collection, and they go to stability in the economy. But this is not the way to run taxation policy. This is not the way to run the parliament: introducing a complicated taxation bill last week, refusing to hold any committee inquiry at all and now trying to rush it through on the eve of an election without consulting those people who are most affected. I thought the mining tax was a warning and then I thought the carbon tax was a warning. What is it with these guys? This is not the way to run a country, it is certainly not the way to run a parliament, and it is most definitely not the way to run a taxation system.


In particular, schedules 3, 4 and 5 of this bill deserve considerable additional scrutiny. We will be moving amendments to excise these schedules from the bill so that can happen. I will explain the impact of those schedules further down the track. Schedule 1 of this bill deals with the 2012 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook measure that sought to bring forward $8 billion of company tax revenue by requiring companies to pay income tax instalments monthly rather than quarterly. This is all about trying to get the surplus. Companies currently pay tax on a quarterly basis. The government said: 'Don't worry about the paperwork; don't worry about any of that. And we're going to make you all pay it monthly.' That brings forward money.


The government did not consult with the business community about this; this came out of left field. They did not ask anyone about the paperwork implications; they did not do any of that. They are doing this because they need to bring forward money to try and create a paper surplus. The first step, starting on 1 January 2014, is for companies with a turnover of a billion dollars or more to lodge monthly returns. A year later, 1 January 2015, it is companies with a turnover of $100 million or more. A year later, companies with a turnover of $20 million or more will have to lodge monthly rather than quarterly payments with the tax office. Have the government thought about the paperwork implications of this? A billion dollars is a significant turnover, and there is probably more of an issue of cash flow for a company with this turnover. Companies with an annual turnover of $100 million or more could be companies with 200 or 300 employees. It is not hard to get to $100 million in turnover for a company that operates in every state. But then companies with a turnover of $20 million or more have to lodge monthly returns.


I thought, 'Twenty million bucks, that's not necessarily a big company.' If you think about the local news agency, it has a big turnover but probably small margins. I am not saying they would have a $20 million turnover, but they have a big turnover because they have a lot of cash go through the tills. Pubs have a lot of turnover. There would be plenty of individual pubs with a turnover of $20 million.




Mr Buchholz:
  Service stations.




Mr HOCKEY:
  Service stations, as my learned colleague knows, having run a business. There would be plenty of service stations with a turnover of $20 million, even though the margins are very thin. Tourism companies would have big turnovers, even though their margins are small. If you pay $5,000 to have a tour of Australia, out of that maybe 200 bucks goes to the travel agent. All these businesses would now have to lodge monthly returns, because the government needs the money.


I have deep, deep reservations about this in particular. It is one thing for large companies, and I have reservations about monthly returns for them, but for businesses with a turnover of $20 million—fair dinkum, seriously, where do they pluck these numbers from? We are not allowed to ask, and even if we did we would not get any answers. Where did $20 million turnover come from? On what basis? Who is the genius that thought it up? Was it the Treasurer? Was it the tax office? Was it someone in the Treasury?


Who was the genius who picked $20 million for monthly returns?


Where was consultation? Did they speak to anyone in the business community? Did they speak to any chambers of commerce? Did they speak to any industry associations about the implications? The Service Station Association, or newsagents or the Pharmacy Guild—did they speak to them? Plenty of pharmacists might have a turnover of $20 million, with the PBS and prescription services. They could be two shops or three shops. But now they have to lodge monthly returns. Fair dinkum! What a chaotic government!


What we do know is that they claim this move is going to net $1.4 billion over the forward estimates. I see the member for—is it Werriwa—there?




Mr Laurie Ferguson:
  Yes.




Mr HOCKEY:
  Prophetically, he declared, 'The Labor Party is dead over boats,' and it is dead over tax too. I know that does not come to mind first.




Mr Laurie Ferguson:
  Who wrote this? Laundy?




Mr HOCKEY:
  But I would say to you, sir, that it is not just boats that Labor is dead on; it is dead on tax policy and it is dead in this parliament. Exhibit A is this bill, mate. You introduce a complicated taxation bill last week, no community consultation, no committee consultation, and ram it through the parliament, all because you are trying to get to a surplus that was never going to happen under Labor. And now you are introducing provisions that are going to have a huge impact in the community, but you do not want to speak to anyone about them!


I would say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the total measures in this bill bring forward more than $10 billion worth of tax receipts—$10 billion. And it has been all about a surplus that Labor will never deliver. What a surprise! Even with all these measures in this chaotic taxation policy, the debt keeps growing. As we found out yesterday, the debt limit is going to have to be increased again. The Treasurer does not have any courage; he is a weak man. He does not have the courage to come into this place and ask for an increase in the credit card limit of the Commonwealth. And why? Because he has done it on four previous occasions and he does not want to have to do it on the fifth. He will leave it to whoever is there on 15 September. As he said to Neil Mitchell, 'It will be someone else's problem'. He does not even think that he will be there; it will be someone else's problem.


Do you know whose problem it is going to be? It will be that lady's, up there in the gallery. It is going to be your problem. And the gentleman next to you, and the gentleman to him. All of you—it will be your problem. Because there will be a mess left by this government again that someone has to clean up.


Schedule 2 of the bill makes various amendments to tax laws and the Infrastructure Australia Act to introduce a tax loss incentive for infrastructure projects identified by the Infrastructure Coordinator. Now, the government claims that this measure will encourage private sector investment in nationally significant infrastructure such as roads, rail and ports. I want to see that too. We want to encourage private sector investment in infrastructure. This is hugely important. Governments—state, federal, Liberal or Labor, whatever the case—do not have the money available for massive up-front investment in infrastructure, so we have to find ways to encourage that vast pool of money, particularly of superannuation, to go into infrastructure.


The changes within this schedule allow entities such as corporates and trusts that are carried on exclusively for the purposes of what is called a DIP—a designated infrastructure project—to uplift tax losses by the long-term government bond rate and carry forward tax losses, as well as plain bad debt deductions, even though that does not satisfy the continuity of ownership and same business test for companies and equivalent tests for trusts.


It is an enormous amount of power in the hands of the Infrastructure Coordinator. We would have liked to get more information about this in the committee process, but, again, we can only deal with what we have before us. I would like to know what the possible unintended consequences of this provision are, but we are not going to get any answers.


Schedule 3 and schedule 4 of this bill deal with the Tax Agent Services Act 2009. I stated from the outset that the coalition has a number of concerns in relation to schedules 3 and 4. We are going to move amendments to excise these two schedules from the bill. The Tax Agent Services Act was introduced in order to provide a national regulatory regime for tax agents and BAS agents:


… to ensure that providers of tax agent services to the public meet appropriate professional and ethical standards.


Now, the Tax Agent Services Act seeks to address the fine line between whether an entity is merely providing general information about the tax implications of particular products or giving tax advice that can be reasonably expected to be relied on, and therefore a taxation service.


The government took the decision to carve out the tax agent services provided by financial services licensees, and this carve-out is due to expire on 30 June 2013. So, with less than four weeks to go before its proposed implementation, schedule 3 of this bill seeks to create a completely new regulatory regime for financial services industry entities that give tax advice. So with less than four weeks to go—just think about this—anyone in the financial services industry who gives tax advice under the act is going to have a completely new regulatory regime start, and here is the legislation.




Mr Buchholz:
  The busiest time of the year!




Mr HOCKEY:
  The busiest time of the year in the lead-up to the end of the financial year, and some genius somewhere who is probably the same person who gave advice on the rest of the bill has said, 'Let's get on with it and give them four weeks notice.'


We have said this is a joke. The government proposes that a tax or financial advice service consists of two elements: the provision of tax agent service and the provision of a service in the course of giving advice that is of a kind usually given by a financial services licensee or representative. Seriously—these are new definitions. These are new rules with less than four weeks to go. People out there are trying to earn a buck, and you are changing the regulatory regime. The government has sat on its hands for three years on this and now it is doing it with less than four weeks to go—and, by the way, it is meant to go through the Senate in two weeks. It is not just going through this place; it actually has to go through the Senate in three weeks. The Senate only sits for two weeks, and Lord knows how many bills the Senate has itself.


The government are recklessly exposing all the financial advisers to the risk of being noncompliant with the relevant laws from 1 July 2013. There is no practical way for them to achieve compliance within the short time frame left before these schedules become applicable law. It is just impossible. It could change in the Senate in three weeks time. Then it has to be gazetted. So they are saying to the financial services industry, which as a percentage of GDP is the second largest in Australia after health and around 10 per cent of the economy, 'Guys, we're giving you less than a week for a new regulatory regime.' The Labor Party wonder why there is chaos. Here—look at this bill. They are wondering why consumer sentiment is poor. They are wondering why business confidence is poor. They are creating a new regulatory regime for a large part of the Australian economy, and they are giving them a week's notice at the busiest time of the year.


The Financial Planning Association, the Financial Services Council and the Association of Financial Advisers have all pleaded that they get time to assess this bill. This relates not only to the consultation process but to definitions in the act. It is unclear, for example, if stockbrokers, insurance brokers and mortgage brokers are covered. They are pleading for time to look at potential negative interactions and inconsistencies with the government's own bungled FOFA changes, which also come into effect on 1 July 2013. They are trying to work out any increases in compliance costs resulting from the changes and what the consumer benefit of these changes is. These poor buggers have a new pricing regime for their business that they build into for their accounts. They are trying to work out what the costs are for consumers and what the cost of this massive new compliance regime is to their business. I do not think that is unreasonable. Surely the Treasury gave advice that this is a mess. I just cannot believe it. I do not think any department could be so removed from the community that it is there to serve that it would suggest that this is going to work in a week's process. This is ridiculous. We are going to try to excise it. This is ridiculous. It has to be put off.


Schedule 5 we are, again, going to seek to excise. We have deep concerns about this. The first of these measures requires the commissioner to publish particular information obtained from tax returns of those corporate tax entities which have a total income of $100 million or more for an income year. What the Commissioner of Taxation is going to do—and this is the first time this has happened—is publish individual companies' tax. He will also have a duty to publish the final annual amount of an entity's minerals resource rent tax—we know that is not that much—or the petroleum resource rent tax payable as reported by the entity regardless of the total income.


I introduced a private member's bill on 18 March this year to amend the Taxation Administration Act to remove any doubt that taxation officers may disclose to the minister information about instalments in the MRRT. We had high farce. We had the government saying it was not able to give the Australian people an update on how much the mining tax was collecting because that might disclose individual companies. How that works I do not know, because it is a tax on an industry and even we assume that there might be more than one taxpayer. But, even if there were one taxpayer, so what? It would not be disclosed. No-one would know who it was. We just asked that there be information made available, as there is for capital gains tax, income tax and every other tax. We just asked that there be updates available on the amount of revenue being collected under a particular tax headline.


The government said they could not do it, so I introduced my private member's bill to say, 'Well, sure you can.' The government were so opposed to what we were trying to do that they do not want to just list the amount of revenue raised from the mining tax; they want to disclose who is paying it. They want to tell you the names of the companies. Again, this is exactly the same old story. What consistent principles do the government hold? What do the government actually believe in that can be considered the same today as it was yesterday? Is there any consistent bone in the aggregate of bones over there?


We support the publication of aggregate tax information, unless that information can be reasonably attributed to a single person. But the government has gone one step further and said, 'No, we think individual companies should have their tax disclosed. Okay—a number of companies already disclose the amount of tax they pay in their annual returns. But what does this mean for Australia? I think that is a question this government does not ask itself often enough.


Ernst and Young, one of the largest global accounting firms, said:


… it is premature for Australia as a small open economy to engage in this public disclosure proposal unless and until public disclosure of corporate tax is identified by a majority of the G20, G8, OECD stakeholders or countries in the Asia Pacific region … it represents a distraction from the much bigger task of adjusting the system for taxation of international business.


The only country in the OECD that requires disclosure of tax from large companies, including foreign companies, is Denmark. Denmark is not really in competition with us. When I think of the competition Australia faces in taxation, trade, resources and investment, I do not automatically think of Denmark.


So what is the implication of this? Australia should not make the mistake identified by the United Kingdom Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, who was recently quoted as saying:


There is mounting concern about where tax is actually paid … The danger at the moment is that this just spills over into a generalised anti-business, anti-multinational sentiment which is unhelpful because we do want successful businesses, we do want inward investment. We don't want people to be stigmatised on the basis of ad hoc little bits of research.


I understand where he is coming from. I have no problems with disclosure, and I certainly want companies that earn money in Australia to pay tax in Australia. But I am not sure that these things are being redressed. Again, I think the risk of this schedule is that the government is like a bull at the gate. It is just going down the process of taking on business—a war with business. For all of its years it has been at war with business. After the first 12 months of the Rudd government, Labor has been at war with business. But the worst part is that it then introduces legislation that has unintended consequences and then cries crocodile tears when we have business sitting on its hands for new investment—or, worse, pulling out.


Schedule 6 of the bill amends the petroleum resource rent tax, and this builds on the calamity of the recent decision of the full Federal Court in the case of Esso Australia Resources. I would just say to you that we have tried to deal with a number of these issues previously. We are not going to stand in the way of these amendments. We do support the clarification contained in schedule 6 relating to the deduction of legitimate project expenditures. Schedule 7 is about removing the CGT discount for foreign individuals. We will allow the passage of the measure, particularly given the budget emergency which clearly exists under Labor. We support the amendments in schedule 8. Schedule 9 is on the GST-free treatment of National Disability Insurance Scheme funded supports; we support that. We are prepared to support updating the list of deductible gift recipients. In schedule 11 there are a number of miscellaneous amendments to the tax and super laws as the government claims, removing some anomalies.


Finally, I just say again that this bill is an absolute calamity in terms of its aggregate impact. It just represents in so many ways the chaos of the government. So, whilst we recognise that revenue needs to be raised, we also will move amendments to make sure that it is properly dealt with by this parliament in a respectful way.

"Buchholz, Scott, MP",LP,2013-06-06,"



Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright) (09:51):  It is always a pleasure to follow the shadow Treasurer. I know firsthand that he has enormous small business experience and understanding and so comes to this House with a different set of skills that assist our nation in making tax law amendment decisions. As the shadow Treasurer pointed out, this is a poorly thought-out bill which defies most of the standing orders and procedures of this House. But, unsurprisingly, as I stand to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (2013 Measures No. 2) Bill 2013, it is consistent with a lot of other bills that come into this House. 


There are three commonalities to bills that come before this House from Labor. The first is that they normally give more power to a union mate. Second, somehow in there there is an increase in the Public Service. Third, there is an increased tax. That is what this one is. It comprises the largest number of taxation amendments in this term and contains 11 schedules. The coalition will move an amendment to this bill to excise schedules 3, 4 and 5, given the government denied the opportunity for this bill to be properly scrutinised before coming to the House.


I will explain for the benefit of Hansard and for the nation how the normal line of scrutiny would be applied. Deputy Speaker Georganas, let me start with a bit of history that I am sure you will find informative but not surprising. The coalition is deeply unhappy with the handling of this bill. When the bill was introduced the coalition sought to have the bill referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services. The House Economics Committee used its numbers to have the debate shut down. What happens is that such a bill, by definition, is referred to the Economics Committee, which then becomes the front door. It is the Economics Committee's role to look for public scrutiny. The Economics Committee would then go to the market, to the stakeholders and those that the bill would have implications for, and they would call a public inquiry. They would call stockbrokers, mortgage brokers—any interested party that would have a linkage and where this bill would affect their business. They would call them to a room. They would allow those stakeholders to give evidence, to ask questions of Treasury and to put their side of the story so that the bill could be properly scrutinised. It did not happen.


They shut that part of the procedure down by using their numbers in the Economics Committee so that this bill could not be debated and scrutinised. It is a single taxation bill with 11 amendments, which is unprecedented, but with no consultation with industry. If I am an Australian I am starting to get suspicious. Why would a government do that, especially a government that advocated earlier in its turn that we needed to open the window and let the sunlight in—that we needed to have transparency in this parliament? 


But this is not an isolated case. When it comes to trying to hide the facts, we saw it only a couple of days go with the Education Bill. It was Labor's cornerstone policy, one of the jewels in the crown, but a measly 1,400-word document on nine pages was brought into the House. There were 71 amendments and then the debate was shut down. There is a pattern emerging between this bill, where they are trying to shut down scrutiny, and what we are seeing happening on a regular basis. It is happening on a regular basis because we are seeing the wake of a desperate government. These are the side effects and we are a poorer nation for it.


On Friday, 31 May 2013, the Labor majority of the House Economics Committee refused to hold an inquiry. That was a sad day. So we are now in the position of having the government asking the parliament to pass a bill with significant changes to the law within a week of its introduction to the parliament with no committee oversight. I said before that the bill currently before the House contains 11 complex schedules. Schedules 3, 4 and 5 in the bill particularly deserve scrutiny. 


Schedule 1 speaks to monthly PAYG instalments. It deals with the 2012 MYEFO budget measure that sought to bring forward more than $8 billion worth of company tax revenue by requiring companies to pay income tax by instalments monthly rather than quarterly. The main driver and sole purpose of this measure seemed to be shoring up the future promise of a budget surplus. I need not take you too far back to when on over 300 occasions—some advocate 300, some advocate that in aggregate it was 500—claims were made that this government would return our nation to a surplus. When you hear that a government is going to return our nation to surplus you would think that they would be going to do it by stimulating economic activity in the market. You would think they would do it by increasing the pie. You know how these guys were looking to get to a surplus, Deputy Speaker? They were looking to do it by accounting trickery—by not actually increasing the pie but by simply taking the revenue that would have been generated in a quarter, breaking it down into months, and using it through an accounting procedure in the quarter before the budget to make the revenue numbers in Q2 look stronger. 


And do you know who pays? It is the business sector that pays as a result of cash-flow limitations. They would normally have had their overdrafts and their cash flow through their business scheduled for quarterly payments of the PAYG. But, no, some genius decided that if they applied this accounting trickery they would be able to move towards their surplus. It used to be that the only businesses that would have to pay the quarterly instalment were businesses that generated over $1 billion worth of turnover. That did not seem to be generating too much coin and they thought that there was an opportunity for more tax to be raised if they dropped the amount to $100 million. Not happy with $100 million, it was then dropped down to $20 million. The reason I draw your attention to those numbers is that I want to show you how it is trending. It was from $1 billion to $100 million to $20 million. I will tell you where it stops: it stops next at mum and dad, or anyone—they will not stop until they have got it all.


The aim of the original MYEFO measure was to deliver a surplus, but that then ended up as a deficit. This move netted the government $1.4 billion over the estimates. If you remember, $1.4 billion was roughly what the surplus was going to be. That is what they were forecasting—about a $1.3 billion surplus. It came in at—what?—a $19.4 billion deficit. So it was nearly $20 billion out. But that was consistent, because they are normally about $20 billion out with their forecasts. In total, the measures within this bill bring forward more than $10 billion worth of taxation receipts and bolster the government's budget bottom line over the forward estimates. It is accounting trickery. As I say, nothing in this measure increases the pie. It does nothing to give business confidence. 


The Treasurer comes into this House on a regular basis to say what strength our economy is in. The other day we had the Reserve Bank hand down its findings on the cash rate, which is staying where it was. An analysts' perception from Macquarie, which is on the public record, states:


The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Board decided to leave rates unchanged in June. While this was in line with market expectations, we thought there was a clear case for cutting rates further.


They made a case for cutting rates further—and this is in an environment where this bill attacks the cash flow of businesses. They stated:


This view was premised on the sharp falls in consumer confidence, falling house prices, declining commodity prices, insipid retail spending, declining business investment, falling job advertisements, a raft of downgrades from mining services companies, slowing wages growth and weak business confidence.


And the best thing this government can come up with is to say: 'Let's tax you more. Let's take your quarterly commitment away and go after you monthly.' That is the government's answer to recent comments from Macquarie Bank.


The alarm bells are ringing about the state of the competitiveness of our economy and the alarm bells are ringing in every business in my electorate of Wright as the debt and the deficit are reaching unprecedented levels. We have a budget emergency. The emergency started back in 2008. We had money in the bank when we were in government. In 2008 this government said we needed to increase our master card debt ceiling to $75 billion because that was what we needed to get us through the GFC. Yes, there is some economic rationalism on that stimulus government spend. Nothing is wrong with that $75 billion. That was their first forecast. A couple of years later they were back wanting to increase that master card limit to $200 billion. There is a vast difference between $75 billion and $200 billion. But that was not enough. Back in 2012 they were looking to increase the debt cap to $250 billion and not too long after they got to $300 billion. When you look at the expenditure in the forward estimates, from there on it will not be long before we are looking down the barrel at $400 billion.


The member for North Sydney, the previous speaker, raised the point that this government knows quite well that it is going to be somebody else's job to pay down that debt. Because guess what? We cannot pay this debt off in one generation. They say it is not a lot of money, but in the Howard era we would have had to have 18 of the biggest surpluses in a row to clear out the debt. So we are looking at a minimum of a couple of generations of working lives, when people are able to contribute taxes, and that is if we do not put on more debt.


Schedule 2 of the bill relates to incentives for designated infrastructure projects. This bill makes various amendments to taxation laws and the Infrastructure Australia Act 2008 to introduce a tax loss incentive for infrastructure projects designated by the infrastructure coordinator. The government claims that this measure will encourage private sector investment in nationally significant infrastructure such as roads, rail and ports.


The coalition have reservations about this schedule due to the discretion given to the infrastructure coordinator in approving tax concessions for individual projects. However, we will not oppose this measure, because we are going to have our own internal hurdles as a nation on how infrastructure projects are going to be funded in the future. The coalition have a plan on how we will fund those in partnership with the market combined with tax incentives. We will be keeping the implementation of this policy under watch, however.


Schedule 3 creates a regulatory framework for financial advice services and schedule 4 contains other amendments to the Tax Agent Services Act. These parts of the bill are unduly cruel. Schedules 3 and 4 of this bill deal with the Tax Agent Services Act 2009. It is another attack on small business. My office has received many emails from tax agents in my electorate sharing concern over this proposal. This is a bad tax. This one is the shocker. If we are going to get an amendment up, this has to come out. 


It is unduly unjust. At two minutes before midnight, with no public scrutiny we will be implementing at the busiest time of the year for our tax agents another layer of regulatory burden. One can only assume from a cynical perspective that the intention of the tax office and this government is to trap small business so it can be seen as another source of revenue from implementing fines or to run people out of business. There is no sense. I do not believe for one minute that that is their intention. I believe this was an oversight, so I call on the government to let the sun shine in on this part of the bill, to let the sun shine in on these amendments. These are cruel. The rollout of this needs to be delayed from 2013 through to 2014 so more consideration can be given. There are too many unknowns around schedules 3 and 4. You have 100 days of government left. In that last 100 days do one thing right: fix this.

"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2013-06-06,"



Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff) (10:06):  I rise to speak to the Tax Laws Amendment (2013 Measures No. 2) Bill 2013. I have had the opportunity to raise this matter on the handling of this bill in the chamber previously. I did so as the Deputy Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics. The shadow Treasurer and the member for Wright have touched on the journey we have gone on to arrive at this destination. It has been a convoluted journey, but it has been a relatively short journey because this tax laws amendment bill No. 2, which contains over $10 billion of additional receipts for the federal Labor government, has been rammed through this parliament without appropriate parliamentary scrutiny.


For a measure like this, which I am informed by the shadow Treasurer is the single biggest revenue item in a tax laws amendment bill that we have seen in the parliament's history, it is extraordinary to think that this Labor government is so bereft of any ability to conform to appropriate levels of scrutiny, with absolutely no desire to provide any adequate justification, no attempt to explain to the Australian people why it is doing what it is doing and, most concerningly, no regard for the consequent impact as a result of these changes on thousands, if not tens of thousands, of stakeholders across the Australian economy—indeed, hundreds of thousands, when you consider schedule 1 alone.


So what has been the journey for the Australian Labor Party? How have we reached this new low when it comes to their inability to make any of the big calls correctly? We know that the Australian Labor Party has world's greatest Treasurer over there, the member for Lilley—you would have to question the methodology about how they arrived at that conclusion but, that notwithstanding, he has got the gong and he is going to hold it with all his might. I suspect he will hold that gong with more resilience than any State of Origin player did last night with the ball, but he is going to hold on to that precious little gong that he has because, frankly, that is all he has. His track record does not attest to the fact that he is the world's greatest Treasurer. The tax record of the member for Lilley is to be up to his eyeballs in debt and deficit and to make one false promise after another, but that is entirely consistent with the Prime Minister, so we should not be surprised.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr S Georganas
):  I remind the member to be relevant to the bill.




Mr CIOBO:
  The Australian Labor Party, as part of their attempt to pull the wool over the eyes of the Australian public last year, saw the Treasurer stand up and say, 'This will be the first year of surplus, followed by four years or three years of surplus thereafter.' That is what he said; those were his words on last year's budget. And we now know the truth: instead of it being a billion-dollar surplus—we knew Labor were never going to get there; we flagged it at the time—it has actually turned into, low and behold, a $19 billion deficit.


But as part of the grubby attempt by Labor to deliver a surplus on paper, even though there was absolutely no way they would deliver a surplus in reality, they introduced the initiative that is contained within schedule 1 of this bill. That initiative is to bring forward company tax payments from the quarterly approach to now being required to be paid monthly. That window of the first 12 months, the change from quarterly reporting to monthly reporting, with payments being made to the tax office as a direct result, saw an injection of cash into the federal government to make up for the fact that there would be a change from four times per year to 12 times per year, which saw a short-term injection of cash. And that, on paper, meant the Australian Labor Party were able to bolster their books and there would be just that little bit of extra cash sitting in there, which helped the Treasurer to fall across the line when it came to delivering his so-called billion-dollar budget surplus.


They made this announcement with no consultation, no forewarning, no attempt to determine what the compliance impact was going to be. Instead, the only thing that the Treasurer was concerned about was if that was going to help to prop up his pathetic billion-dollar paper surplus. And now, 12 months later, we know there was no billion-dollar surplus. Instead we have another $19 billion deficit—just the latest in a series of deficits as part of the $190 billion of deficits this government has run up since they were elected—as part of their inexorable march towards reaching gross public debt, a peak approaching $400 billion.


Here we are, 12 months later, and the government are ramming this bill through the parliament. And they are doing so, as I said, with no regard to the compliance cost on those businesses that now have to change to report monthly instead of quarterly. Part of the problem is that in making this change, given that we did not even have a surplus and we had another $19 billion deficit, there will not be a surplus next year, there will be an $18 billion deficit; there will not be a surplus the year after that, there will be another deficit. For as long as Labor are in power there will be deficits. But despite that, the entire policy rationale for making this change has evaporated because we are not in surplus anyway. And instead companies, trusts, a whole range of different individuals now have to put up with all the extra paperwork and the compliance to satisfy schedule 1 of this bill. We attempted to apply some parliamentary scrutiny and attempted to discern what the impact would be on business. The Labor Party shut it down; the executive arm of government shut down parliamentary scrutiny.


The coalition sought to say: 'What are the impacts of these TLA No. 2 bill? What will it actually mean in terms of compliance? In respect of schedules 3, 4 and 5, what will their impact be on tax agents? What will the impact be on financial planners, on tax advisers?' Those schedules, again, have not seen the light of day. It is not as if the government or the Department of the Treasury or others have been out there massaging the stakeholders, saying: 'Look, can you explain this to us? We want to make sure that public policy represents best practice. Can you tell us: how can we change the laws to help you do your job? Explain to us: what can we do in terms of public policy to make sure the Australian people are better off as a consequence of our changes?' No, that is not Labor's approach. That is not the approach of this government. Instead they shove these changes into this TLA bill.


We the coalition attempted to refer the bill off for parliamentary inquiry before the committee system, as should be the case. What does Labor do? They shut it down. They use their numbers to make sure there is no inquiry and instead they just push the bill through the parliament with the support, once again I expect, of the so-called puppet Independents—the member for Lyne and the member for Windsor and others who will just allow this to go through, again just washing their hands, as Pontius Pilate did, of any of the consequent impacts in terms of red tape, compliance and livelihoods on tax agents and in terms of the impact of the changes on those tax agents and the Australian people who rely on the financial advice they receive. They will just wash their hands of it and say, 'We want stability in government.'


There are absolutely no points for understanding that this is just another nail in the coffin of this government, another reason the Australian people do not trust a government that undertakes decisions like this, that runs scared from parliamentary scrutiny, that does not have the decency to talk to stakeholders whose livelihoods rely on this. It is a government that does not care about what the public policy ramifications will mean for the mums and dads who will go and see financial planners and make decisions about their financial security and their futures off the back of changes that are contained within these laws. 


That is the reason the Australian people are fed up with the Australian Labor Party. They have good reason to be because Labor are just so arrogant when it comes to their approach to governing. Labor are completely obsessed with ramming through whatever they can in these final two weeks and one day of parliament without any regard for what the impact on the community will be.


We in the coalition will use the brief periods that we have to highlight all the shortfalls that we see contained within laws like this. When the Australian people hear that all the extra red tape and all the extra compliance contained within this bill are here for one reason only—because the Treasurer, the member for Lilley, needed to try to deliver a couple of hundred million of extra revenue, on paper, one financial year to try to prop up his pathetic attempt to reach a budget surplus—only to know that we have a $19 billion deficit and therefore there was no point to the change whatsoever, no wonder they will just say, 'They are a joke.' 


The Labor Party is a joke and should be branded a joke because this represents the lowest form and the lowest approach to public policy that could possibly exist. There are no benchmarks here, no gold standard, no world best practice with the approach contained within this bill. That is not even with respect to tax matters. That is with respect to parliamentary scrutiny. Remember the days of 'let the sunshine in'. They have closed the curtains and drawn the blinds. That is what is going on. It is entirely consistent—I notice the minister at the table—with the approach that Labor also adopted with respect to Gonski, another multibillion dollar approach.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr S Georganas
):  I ask the member to be relevant to the tax bill.




Mr CIOBO:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I am just talking about a pattern of behaviour by this Labor government. I do not intend to go through all 11 schedules in the bill, but I will also touch upon those schedules that the coalition is attempting to have segregated from the balance of the bill so that effectively the bill is split.


Schedules 3 and 4 deal with creating a regulatory framework for tax and financial advice services as well as other amendments to the Tax Agent Services Act. The carve-out was put in place sometime ago and it expires on 30 June this year. As I indicated already in my comments, the coalition sought to provide opportunity for the stakeholders—the people who inform the mums and dads of this nation about what they should be doing in their financial affairs—to have their feedback upon the approach that Labor was adopting. Labor said, 'We do not want the feedback, frankly, we are not prepared to listen, we will just what we want to do.' 


The Financial Planning Association, the Financial Services Council and the Association of Financial Advisers have all raised concerns with respect to the changes contained within this bill. They are concerned about the fact that there has been a complete lack of consultation on the bill. They are concerned about the definitions used in the act. It is unclear, for example, if stockbrokers, insurance brokers and mortgage brokers are covered. There are concerns about possible negative interactions in relation to FOFA, the future of financial advice, reforms in this bill. They are also concerned about increased compliance costs resulting from the bill. That inevitably means one thing: extra compliance costs that are faced by tax agents, financial advisers and others will simply be passed through to consumers. We do not know what the impact of this is going to be. We know that all the peak bodies are concerned. We know that very good people like John Brogden are concerned, but we do not have the opportunity to discern what the impact will be because Labor will not enjoy the scrutiny. 


This bill, in my view, represents one of the lowest points for the Australian Labor Party. The bill does need to be split so that the less controversial aspects can go through, although they should have gone through after parliamentary inquiry. In the absence of that, at least they can go through, but the more controversial aspects—schedules 3, 4 and 5—ought to be separated and the coalition attempts to do that with the amendments we have put forward.

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (10:21):  I rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (2013 Measures No. 2) Bill 2013. This 118-page bill contains a range of tax changes in 11 schedules. They are very complex changes that require careful consideration and proper parliamentary scrutiny, as outlined by my colleague the member for Moncrieff. However, at this stage this will not occur because the Labor government are ramming this bill through parliament before the election, irrespective of its incredibly complex consequences for industry and the Australian economy. We saw a similar process occur when this government rammed through the Future of Financial Advice legislation.


The bill was introduced just last Wednesday, on 29 May, after which the bill was appropriately referred to the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services and then passed off to the House Standing Committee on Economics. That Labor dominated committee since decided that such complex changes do not warrant any scrutiny, declaring:


... due to the urgency of the bill and the need to resume the second reading debate there is insufficient time to undertake an inquiry.


It is the view of the coalition that this is simply not acceptable. As the coalition members of the House Economics Committee indicated in their dissenting report:


Coalition members of the committee recognise the importance of parliamentary scrutiny of executive government. The decision of the committee to reject an inquiry into the Tax Laws Amendment (2013 Measures No. 2) Bill 2013 due to ""insufficient time"" represents arrogance from Labor members.


This bill significantly increases government revenue (in other words—higher tax receipts) by nearly one billion dollars in schedule 1 alone.


The fact relevant government agencies, as well as the public and key stakeholders were denied an opportunity to inform the committee of the consequences of this decision by the Gillard Labor government underscores the shambolic and reckless approach to policy development by Labor.


Allowing the debate on the second reading today does not give important stakeholders any opportunity to consider and comment on the proposed changes, which could have huge ramifications in their industries.


First, I will address schedules 3 and 4 of this bill which respectively extend the regulatory framework for tax and financial advice services and make other amendments to the Tax Agent Services Act 2009. Schedule 3 amends the Tax Agent Services Act 2009, TASA, so that tax advice given by practitioners in the course of giving advice that is usually provided by financial services licensees falls within the regulatory regime administered by the Tax Practitioners Board, TPB. TASA introduced a national regulatory regime for tax agents and business activity statement agents to ensure that providers of tax agent services to the public meet appropriate so-called professional and ethical standards. TASA introduced this regulatory regime based on three elements: the definition of what constitutes a tax agent service, the registration requirements for the code of professional conduct that applies to registered tax agents, as well as civil penalties that could apply to unregistered tax agents. As outlined in the explanatory memorandum to this bill, TASA generally requires entities that provide tax agent services to register with the TPB.


At the time of that legislation, there was a recognition of the fine line between whether an entity is merely providing general information about the tax implications of particular financial products or whether it is giving tax advice that could reasonably be expected to be relied on and therefore a tax agent service. Therefore, it was decided to exempt tax agent services provided by financial services licensees and their authorised representatives from TASA. This is set to expire on 30 June 2013.


This means that there will be a new regulatory regime within TASA for entities in the financial services industry which give tax advice. It does this by creating a new type of regulated service—that of a 'tax (financial) advice service'. The definition of a 'tax (financial) advice service' would comprise two elements: that of providing a tax agent service and providing that service in the course of giving advice that is of a kind usually given by a financial services licensee or an authorised representative. Therefore, providers of tax (financial) advice services from July 1, 2013 would need to register with the Tax Practitioners Board and meet the requirements of the legislation.


There has already been strong feedback from the industry about these changes. The Association of Financial Advisers has called this legislation 'rushed and flawed', which has been brought forward 'without due process or adequate consultation'. As they have highlighted, 'there is a serious risk that the legislation will result in significant unintended consequences' because of the 'lack of detail and regulation or guidance'. The latter characteristics are symptomatic of most of the legislation put up by this Labor government


There are several other outstanding issues raised by these changes, including, but not limited to, the lack of clarity of which types of financial advisers will be captured under the act such as stockbrokers, insurance brokers or mortgage brokers. Questions remain about whether all financial advisers will have to be registered and, furthermore, what will this legislation mean in terms of further training for financial advisers and how will the interactions evolve between the registration of financial advisers with changes already passed in the rushed and highly complicated FOFA legislation? Lastly, what are the implications of this bill in terms of the interaction between the TPB and the Australian Securities and Investments Corporation, who are both regulators in this area, and who will take precedence where there are inconsistencies?


Those FOFA changes were debated in this House in March 2012 following an inquiry process which actually did occur. At that time, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services was advised time and time again that FOFA would result in huge additional costs, reduce employment levels in the financial industry and reduce the availability and access to quality advice. The Gillard government did not listen and passed that complicated legislation, which the coalition strongly opposed and voted against. Although they will not allow this legislation to be referred to a committee, I remind the Gillard government that the financial services industry is already trying its hardest to implement FOFA by 1 July this year, and these changes to TASA have the potential to further hurt the financial services industry.


Other constituents in my electorate who are financial advisers have also contacted my office to highlight the important work of financial advisers, who help 'workers, retirees and their families in Queensland achieve their financial objectives and be independent in retirement'. They have outlined their concerns about this 'costly duplicative regulation'. They are concerned that the TASA changes 'will make the cost of doing business prohibitive, meaning job losses and financial advice becoming more expensive and less accessible around the country'. These constituents and stakeholders deserve to have their voices heard and their questions answered during a parliamentary inquiry. Ultimately, all these unanswered questions mean the potential for uncertain increases in compliance costs for financial advisers.


The coalition therefore seeks to excise these schedules from the bill. We do not believe that the government should be proceeding with changes to TASA; instead, we should extend the transitional arrangements already in place—which exempt tax agent services provided by financial services licensees—to ensure consultation can be brought to a judicious conclusion.


If this means deferring these changes through the committee process and beginning anew after the next election, then so be it. The time line of an election of this parliament does not negate the need for proper parliamentary processes, nor should it impact on the passage of poorly designed legislation.


Further, schedule 5 involves amendments to the Taxation Administration Act 1993 to change the rules regarding Australia's business tax system. There are three primary changes. Firstly, there is the imposition on the tax commissioner to make public certain information obtained from the tax returns of corporate tax entities with a total income of $100 million or more in a financial year. This imposition will also involve the publication of an entity's final annual amount payable under the minerals resource rent tax or petroleum resource rent tax, regardless of its total income.


Secondly, the new law will allow the publication of aggregate tax information, irrespective of whether such disclosure is reasonably capable of being attributed to a particular entity, unless that entity is an individual. The third measure increases information sharing between government agencies, as the explanatory memorandum states, 'involving information to the Secretary of the Treasury, for the purposes of briefing the Treasurer in relation to a decision that may be made under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 or Australia's foreign investment policy'.


As I previously mentioned, the coalition did attempt to refer this bill to the House economics committee, but Labor rejected that. Therefore, the coalition will seek to excise this schedule from the bill. We do so because of concerns particularly with the imposition on the tax commissioner to make public the tax affairs of corporate tax entities with reported total income over $100 million and the relation to payments through the mining tax and PRRT. 


The intention for these amendments was announced in February 2013 by the Labor government—after the government attempted to hide the failure of its mining tax by refusing to release those revenue figures in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. At the time, the government claimed it could not release the figures because it could potentially identify the tax information of specific corporate entities. The coalition did not believe this assessment at the time, which is why in the end the government indeed released the mining tax revenue receipts; because the Treasurer's confidentiality arguments could not be sustained.


So what is the government's legislative response? It is now actually imposing on the tax commissioner to release information about the liability of companies under the mining tax and PRRT and allow the publication of tax information, even if it does attribute that information to a particular entity. The coalition believes that is a massive overreach by this government; just as it would be if the government were to make public tax information relating to an individual.


Furthermore, schedule 1 of this bill amends the tax laws to require certain large companies to pay their PAYG, pay as you go, tax instalments monthly rather than quarterly or annually. Under current law, all entities are liable for PAYG instalments quarterly unless they are eligible to become an annual or biannual payer. Under the new law, entities will be liable for monthly PAYG instalments if they exceed certain thresholds, which are 'base assessment instalment income in a particular financial year'.


The threshold will begin at $1 billion for corporate tax entities from 1 January 2014 and subsequently lower to $100 million from 1 January 2015 and to $20 million from 1 January 2016. From that date, all other entities with a base assessment income threshold of $1 billion, including superannuation funds, trusts and individuals, will be required to pay monthly PAYG instalments, reducing to $20 million the year after.


The government claims that this change will not increase the overall tax burden on a corporation or other entity. However, for those entities affected, this change does amount to a very significant one-off bringing forward in their tax and could potentially result in perpetually tighter cash flows and slimmer operating cash buffers. I do note that the reduction in payments to monthly is intended to bring in $10.15 billion to the government over the forward estimates.


I do not have the time now to go through every single measure in today's bill. This bill involves extremely complicated changes which would be best left to be further considered by the oversight of a parliamentary committee, as the coalition has recommended. This would allow parliament to fully scrutinise the intended consequences and, more importantly, the unintended consequences of the measures and allow the relevant stakeholders to have their say about what these changes mean for them.


In relation to schedules 3 and 4, as I have highlighted, this opportunity is particularly important for the financial services industry, who are already struggling with the implementation costs of this Labor government's FOFA legislation. Complex changes require careful consideration. The failure of this government to put forward this legislation with full scrutiny is yet another reason why Australians simply cannot trust this Labor government.

"Fletcher, Paul, MP",LP,2013-06-06,"



Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (10:35):  I am pleased to rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (2013 Measures No. 2) Bill 2013. This bill contains 11 complex and highly technical schedules. As the coalition have made clear, we believe that schedules 3, 4 and 5 in particular deserve further scrutiny, and we will be moving amendments to excise these schedules from the bill.


In the brief time I have available to me this morning I wish to focus on schedules 3 and 4, which are intended to establish a new regulatory framework governing tax advice given by financial advisers, financial planners and others who are giving such advice on tax incidental to the course of giving advice on broader financial issues. The key issue which is addressed by these schedules is whether that advice should be subject to the regime in the existing Tax Agent Services Act 2009.


In the time available to me I want to make three points. The first is that there are complex issues here which affect a wide range of stakeholders. The second is that the government has rushed through these detailed and complex changes with very little consultation. Thirdly, therefore, the coalition does not support these changes to the regulatory arrangements governing the provision of tax advice without further scrutiny and consultation.


Let me turn to the first proposition, which is that these measures raise complex issues which affect many stakeholders. Indeed, these measures would affect many professionals who provide tax advice incidentally to the provision of advice on financial products. It is a fairly obvious proposition that it is difficult to untangle tax advice from financial advice. If we think about a financial adviser or a financial planner who is advising a client to increase his or her superannuation contributions, obviously, part of the rationale for such an increase is going to be that superannuation is a tax advantaged investment. Money which goes into a superannuation fund, subject to it being below the annual contribution limit, is taxed at 15 per cent as compared to the marginal rate if the money is taken in ordinary income. In those circumstances, for most taxpayers the marginal rate is well above 15 per cent. If someone is providing advice about extra superannuation contributions, inevitably they, as a financial planner or a financial adviser, will raise tax considerations in the advice that they give to their client.


Similarly, if someone were to advise a client, as a financial planner or a financial adviser, that that client should consider taking out a margin loan to buy a parcel of blue-chip shares, again, the tax considerations would necessarily form part of their discussion with their client. They would need to explain to the client the tax treatment of the interest on the margin loan. While the advice is given primarily as part of assisting the client to develop an effective financial strategy to maximise his or her wealth over time, in the provision of that advice there will necessarily be a discussion of the tax aspects of this particular structuring of the client's affairs.


A third example might be advice regarding the tax benefits of investing in shares which have franking credits. Again, the primary purpose of the provision of the advice is to recommend the desirability of investing in shares as a means of building up wealth over time. I hasten to add that I am not personally expressing a view as to whether shares constitute a good investment for that purpose or not. I am simply making the point that an adviser or planner might very well find themselves in the position of giving such advice to a client. Again, what would necessarily form part of that discussion would be advice about the way the dividend imputation system works. The fact is that shares, in companies which are themselves paying tax, carry with them franking credits, and when that is added into the overall mix that increases the after tax value of the returns from the shares.


The point I am making is that it is very difficult to disentangle advice on the financial affairs of a client from advice on the tax implications of particular financial options and choices that the client may choose to follow based upon advice from, for example, a financial planner or a financial adviser. It follows, therefore, that it is quite problematic if financial planners and financial advisers are not permitted to advise on tax issues. On the other hand, tax is clearly a very complex area. The consequences of getting tax matters wrong can be severe for taxpayers. It is therefore appropriate that the provision of tax advice should be carefully regulated.


These issues were weighed up when the existing Tax Agent Services Act 2009 was passed. That legislation established a national regulatory regime for tax agents and agents providing advice on business activity statements as part of the GST arrangements, so as to ensure that providers of tax agent services to the public meet appropriate professional and ethical standards. The legislation establishes the definition of a 'tax agent service', and the legislation seeks to establish that dividing line. Is the advice merely general information about the tax implications of particular financial products, or is it the provision of tax advice which could reasonably be expected to be relied upon and therefore a tax agent service?


As part of drawing that dividing line, in developing the regime that was legislated under the Tax Agent Services Act the government took the decision to carve out tax agent services provided by financial services licensees and their authorised representatives. In other words, the policy decision that was taken when the 2009 act was passed was to use that particular carve-out mechanism to establish the dividing line. Therefore, somebody who is providing advice to a client and who is a financial services licensee or the authorised representative of a financial services licensee is excluded from the regime in the Tax Agent Services Act, even though in the provision of financial advice—as I have pointed out—that person is inevitably, necessarily and naturally likely to provide advice about the tax implications of that particular financial instrument or structure that they are recommending that the client should invest in.


What we have before the House now is a bill which proposes a complex new regime, taking a different approach to establishing where that dividing line is. It will do so by creating a new type of regulated service: a 'tax (financial) advice service'. Let me briefly note the enthusiasm with which the Treasury and other relevant officials treat the bracket as a device in the naming of bills and other concepts. Under the regime that is proposed in the bill, the tax (financial) advice service will consist of two elements: the provision of a tax agent service and the provision of a service in the course of giving advice of a kind usually given by a financial services licensee or its representative. If you are to provide such services you will need to register with the Tax Practitioners Board.


These issues are complex and they affect many stakeholders. The Financial Planners Association, the Financial Services Council and the Association of Financial Advisers have all raised concerns in relation to the changes proposed in schedule 3 of this bill. Those concerns include the lack of consultation in relation to the bill and the lack of clarity in the definition which is proposed to be used in the bill. It is unclear, for example, if stockbrokers, insurance brokers and mortgage brokers are covered by the definition. Stakeholders have also raised concerns about the potential negative interactions with the very complex and extensive Future of Financial Advice reforms and of the increased compliance costs resulting from the bill that will inevitably be passed onto consumers.


I would like to quote from a letter from the Financial Planning Association of Australia dated 3 June. That association said:


In our view the Bill is far from finalised and does not satisfactorily relate to the taxation advice provided in the context of financial planning advice.


The most significant key outstanding issues include:


a clear and appropriate definition of tax advice (financial product) service;


whether the responsibilities and liabilities for the TASA obligations apply to the individual planner, a supervisor, or the licensee;


alignment with the Best Interest Duty and other Future of Financial Advice (FOFA) reforms; and


ASIC's role in the implementation of TASA.


We are four weeks away from the existing deferral arrangements ending and we are still not clear on the exact requirements and obligations for financial planners in respect to complying with the Tax Agent Services Act, should this be required. … Considering that the Tax Agent Services Act will impact every one of our 9000 practitioner members, and likely more than 40,000 in total, the lack of consultation and the tight time frame is a real concern.


That brings me to my next point, which is that the government has sought to rush through these complex changes with very limited consultation.


When this bill was introduced, the coalition sought to have it referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services. That request was denied and the bill was instead sent to the House Standing Committee on Economics by the selection of bills committee. On Friday, 31 May 2013, the Labor majority of the House economics committee refused to hold an inquiry into this complex bill. So we now have the situation where this government is asking parliament to pass a bill with significant changes to the law and with significant impact on key stakeholders—with those stakeholders very uncertain as to its impact—within a week of the bill being introduced to the parliament, with no committee oversight. There is no word to describe this process other than atrocious.


It is quite difficult to understand why the government has got itself into this situation, given that the 30 June 2013 deadline has been there for a long time. Yet this government has left this important matter to the last minute. Also, the current arrangements have worked satisfactorily. So, even if there is a policy case to improve them—as to which I express no view—there is no particular reason to do it with effect from 1 July this year. It would be perfectly practicable to roll over the current regime for another year to go through a proper and considered process. It is further hard to understand given that these changes affect an industry—the industry of financial planning and advice—which has faced a relentless torrent of regulatory change in the last three years, including Future of Financial Advice reforms, the MySuper reforms, Superstream and a range of others, all of which involve complex changes to business processes, IT systems and client engagement models. And now this government is proposing to dump another burdensome set of regulatory changes on this industry at very short notice.


This brings me to my third and final point, which is that the coalition does not support these changes without extensive further scrutiny. The coalition have a simple choice this morning: do we support these changes as presented to us or do we reject them? We do not dismiss out of hand the question as to whether the dividing line is appropriately struck between the provision of tax advice on the one hand and the provision of financial advice, including tax issues, on the other. We simply say that there has not been adequate time to consider this important question. There are serious stakeholder interests at stake. Until a proper process has been carried out, we will not support these provisions.

"Oakeshott, Robert, MP",Ind.,2013-06-06,"



Mr OAKESHOTT
 (Lyne) (10:50):  I note that several of the speeches made on this bill, the Tax Laws Amendment (2013 Measures No. 2) Bill 2013, seem to be trying to build an element of division around the entire bill, when the truth is that most schedules in this bill have bipartisan support—and that is welcomed. Of the 11 schedules that are in this omnibus tax amendment bill, I understand that there are three that are in disputes—schedules 3, 4 and 5.


Dealing with those issues first, I think we are fundamentally talking about bringing financial planners under the Tax Agents Services Act, which are the schedule 3 provisions, backed up by some technical amendments in schedule 4, and then schedule 5, making the tax paid by large corporations more transparent. I am very surprised with that being at all controversial.


In fact, I will deal with schedule 5 first. This is a key part of the business integrity package as announced in the federal budget. I have a lot of time for the new tax commissioner, Chris Jordan, in particular, who I understand has done a lot of work with the business tax working group following on from the tax summit in 2011. Now in his new role he is implementing with government and with the Assistant Treasurer a business integrity package that I think deserves the support of this chamber.


There are reports from jurisdictions all round the world on this issue that Australia needs to start getting its head around and we need to participate in, in a cross-jurisdictional way, looking at how multinational companies are gaming sovereign tax laws to their own benefit and to the detriment of the communities they are doing business in. That is a noble starting point, that we start to address these issues in a substantive and coordinated way both within Australia and across jurisdictions. The key opposition to this, as far as I can work out, is that there is some belief that government is overreaching. On the contrary, I hope this is just the start of trying to address these issues, which are real and which have the potential to significantly erode the integrity of the tax base in Australia.


These laws do not impact the privacy of one single individual in Australia, even the wealthiest individuals. As far as I understand—and the minister may like to correct me—not one single individual, poor or rich, is impacted in regard to their own privacy. The legislation is starting to try and address, as far as I understand, the issues of large companies with significant turnovers and, I think quite rightly, people wanting to know what tax is paid by the very large corporations in Australia, most of them already reporting this information in their annual returns to their shareholders. In my judgement as a representative in this chamber, I do not view this as a layer of red tape or a further impost. This is allowing Chris Jordan and the ATO to do their job on behalf of all Australians and protect the integrity of our tax base and make sure we are not being gamed. This means that individuals may have to pay more tax, if we are being gamed by the top end of town who are happily doing business and selling products in our market yet not paying a fair and equivalent share of their contribution to the tax base.


I have no problem whatsoever with schedule 5. In fact—and this is a message to both sides of this chamber—I sincerely hope this is just the start of the journey of Australia dealing with issues around the integrity of our tax base and cross-jurisdictional tax issues. There are plenty of examples both within Australia and around the world of well-known multinationals, in particular, gaming those sovereign tax laws at the expense of countries, including ours. I welcome schedule 5.


In relation to schedules 3 and 4, I am really disappointed that they are being omitted. I accept the arguments, and I hope it is only for a short time. It is now four months until an election, so this is a message to both sides: I hope this is not some sort of win for my old mate John Brogden and financial planners or for Mark Rendall. I hope this is not just a cave-in to some pressure from the financial-planning industry and that it is being omitted with the noble intent of buying some time to do some further consultation. But the principles behind schedules 3 and 4 and the importance of consumer protection very much stay on the agenda.


I have heard all the arguments for and against from financial planners, accountants, tax agents, experts in the law and many, many others. Where real concerns have been raised, I have done what I could to get answers. Initially there was a legitimate argument about lack of consultation. The exemption for financial planners under the Tax Agent Services Act was a time limited extension that had expired in 2012. It was extended and it had always been the expectation that financial planners would be governed by this regime. There is still time for consultation on the regulations that will come beneath the act relating specifically to education and experience to achieve registration for financial planners. After having done a bit of homework, I think the lack of consultation question is relatively shallow. I hope once again that this is not a cave-in to some political pressure. Initially I thought there was a fair argument around unreasonably stopping financial planners undertaking their role, but the response has been that there is a three-year transitional period during which planners will only be required to register with the board. I am told the regulations are well underway and there will be plenty of time for educational requirements to be satisfied before the transitional period ends.


The other issue that I thought was legitimate, one I pursued with ministers involved, was that there was an inconsistency between these tax reforms and the very good FOFA reforms that have gone through this parliament as part of a broad reform agenda of this 43rd Parliament. I thought there was some legitimacy in the argument that these laws need to be talking to the FOFA laws and vice versa. That was of concern to the point where I was not going to support schedules 3 and 4 until there was some clear direction on that. I got that clear direction. I got a letter from Minister Bill Shorten, which I am happy to release after this. In the letter he said that the reform of the tax agent services regime does very clearly talk to the FOFA reforms and they work in parallel. Likewise, I received a similar letter from the minister at the table to the effect that creating a co-regulatory framework for tax advice services is actually the point of the exercise—getting the FOFA reforms to talk to tax reform is the narrative; it is the point. That we are now dropping that because of some political pressure is a step backwards. So I received both of those letters.


Importantly, though, I received a letter from ASIC, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, that has said that ASIC is confident that the Corporations Act and TASA are consistent and that a financial adviser can comply with both. That is a relatively long letter that also provides comfort. And my good friends at the Tax Institute I think put it best of all—and the Tax Institute are hardly a friend of government. Arguably, they are the country's leading professional association in tax, with 13,000 members, including tax agents, accountants and lawyers. Fundamentally, they support the tax profession to work to continually improve tax law and administration. They are very passionate about schedule 3 and say that it is an important consumer protection measure in tax law. I think they will be bitterly disappointed that because of the lack of numbers in this chamber the government has had to omit schedule 3 at the expense of consumer protection in Australia today. I will also release that letter.


The Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia have also passionately argued that the accounting profession supports schedule 3. They said, 'This has been in gestation for some 20 years, with concerted discussion and drafting of this particular element of the Tax Agent Services Act 2009 arrangements over the last three years.' But from the shadow Treasurer through, on one side of this House, we have heard that this has all been a mad rush by a disorganised government and that the sky is falling. Twenty years in gestation, in writing from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia—a good friend, I would have thought, of the Liberal-National Party.


So what has gone on? The Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Tax Institute, ASIC and both ministers have providers letters of comfort to say that schedule 3 talks to the financial services reforms of the last couple of years. They say it is a really important reform for consumer protection in Australia, so who has folded? And why? I hope that the vote actually records who has folded and why.


I am a good friend of John Brogden; I will put that on the record. But I would hope that a lobbying campaign from John Brogden and Mark Rendall is not at the heart of vested interests getting in front of consumer protection and important law reform that has been in gestation for 20 years according to the Institute of Chartered Accountants. Why would our chamber get in the way of improving consumer protection, particularly in the last five years, when every community—mine as well as everyone else's in this chamber—has had superannuants and retirees have their money diddled by people who are working in this field, where there is $1 trillion of superannuation money. The Cooper review has stated that there are immature rules around that trillion dollars. We need to improve the regulatory framework with some urgency, yet some people in this chamber have folded their tent behind a bit of political pressure, a bit of lobbying and a bit of positioning for the next four months.


I think that consumers, who are voters, have a right to be angry. Their money remains exposed, with immature rules around some really critical reforms for our country that get the FOFA reforms talking to our tax laws, as clearly identified in letters of comfort from ASIC, from the Tax Institute, from the Institute of Chartered Accountants and from both ministers. I think it is really disappointing that the numbers are not in, and that we have had to omit schedules 3 and 4. I know there are financial planners who will run around and pop the champagne, but consumers should not. Retirees should not; retirees have had a loss today. Their money is still exposed by a regulatory regime that still needs further work.


As a chamber, I would hope that we are not bailing out for good. I hope that, as a compromise, this is just buying a window of time. I would encourage the minister to answer that. I would hope this gets revisited with some urgency, because the point of the exercise is in schedule 3 and 4, and that is to get FOFA talking to our tax laws and vice versa. We have bailed out today. It is disappointing. Consumers have had a loss, and I hope we can revisit it sometime soon.

"Bradbury, David, MP",ALP,2013-06-06,"



Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (11:05):  I would like to take the opportunity to thank all members who contributed to this debate, in particular the member for Lyne for his contribution, which I think was a very worthy one.


Schedule 1 of the Tax Laws Amendment (2013 Measures No. 2) Bill 2013 requires large entities in the pay-as-you-go instalment system to make their instalments monthly instead of quarterly. Unlike the coalition's monster paid parental leave tax, no entity will pay more tax as a result of this change. In fact, not one extra dollar in tax will be paid. This merely changes the frequency with which instalment amounts must be remitted to the Australian Taxation Office.


In order to help reduce compliance costs, the commissioner will be granted a new power to develop alternative methods of developing instalment income. Earlier this year, I also announced a longer term review of the pay-as-you-go instalment system. As part of this review the government will consult with industry to identify longer term reforms to improve the pay-as-you-go instalment system for all businesses, large and small.


The member for North Sydney bleated that the $20 million threshold had been plucked out of thin air. Once again, the member for North Sydney is showing his ignorance of these matters and also, I think, is showing why he is unfit to be sticking his hand up to be the Treasurer. The $20 million threshold was chosen to align with the GST threshold for being a monthly GST reporter, so there is a very clear reason. The figure was not plucked out of the air; there is a very strong rationale for that. The whole purpose of the reform is to better align PAYG instalment payments with the GST payments for most large companies and to allow PAYG instalments to be more responsive to the economic conditions faced by their businesses.


Schedule 2 to this bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to introduce a new tax loss incentive for designated infrastructure projects. The tax incentive will promote private sector investment in infrastructure projects determined to be of national significance. Examples of these projects that could benefit include the Brisbane Cross River Rail, Sydney motorways and Melbourne Metro projects. I know firsthand how important the Sydney motorways project is to the people of Western Sydney. It is desperately needed, but we would of course like to see the extension to the M4 go all the way to the city and would like to ensure that, whatever the financing arrangements, a new toll is not imposed on an old road where motorists are forced to pay a toll for driving along a road that they currently drive on for free.



Mr Hockey interjecting—




Mr BRADBURY:
  The member opposite says it will never happen. Perhaps he should tell the people of Western Sydney that he is intending to make a false promise.


This is an important part of a broader package of reforms to build the—




Mr Hockey:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I am not going to have that misrepresentation. I said it will never happen without a toll. He verballed me and sought to misrepresent me.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms Vamvakinou
):  The minister will stick with the matter.




Mr BRADBURY:
  And that was very much a part of the package of measures that we have before us. But this is an important part of a broader package of reforms to build the infrastructure Australia needs to compete in the 21st century. The tax incentive will promote private investment by preserving the value of accumulated losses over time. Further support is provided by removing the restrictions imposed on the use of carry-forward losses, which can prevent losses being claimed if there is a change of ownership of a project. The tax incentive will encourage private investment in nationally significant infrastructure such as roads, rail and ports. It is a clear demonstration that this side of the House is committed to improving the nation's infrastructure, which is so important for the long-term growth of this country.


Schedules 3 and 4 ensure the appropriate regulation of all forms of tax advice whether they are provided by a tax agent, a BAS agent or an entity in the financial services industry. Contrary to the misleading claims of those opposite, the bill contains a three-year transitional period to allow financial advisers to comply with the regime. All of this rubbish about people being required to come into compliance with the regime in a matter of weeks is precisely that. This is similar to the transition period that this parliament provided to accountants who provide financial advice. These amendments are designed to ensure that all entities that give tax advice meet appropriate professional and ethical standards.


That is what they would do, of course, if the coalition were not determined to block them as they are. The member for Lyne made the point very clearly that somebody has to come into this place and stand up for the protection of consumers. It is one thing, as one of the members opposite said, to talk about the financial planners in her electorate, and I am sure they are wonderful people doing a good job, but it is our responsibility to protect the consumers—the broader population—from the professional activities of those within the financial-planning sector who are engaged in providing advice that is of a taxation nature. These amendments would give consumers the confidence they need and they deserve. The government thinks that Australians who use financial advisers should feel secure knowing that the adviser meets appropriate professional and ethical standards. I think it seems hard to object to that.


The shadow Treasurer claimed that there has been no consultation. The truth is that there has been extensive consultation. If we have a look at what has been occurring, we can see that on 29 November 2010—that is right; back in 2010—the government consulted with the public on a discussion paper titled Regulation of tax agent services provided by financial planners. Then, throughout 2011 and 2012, the former Assistant Treasurer, my predecessor, held roundtable consultation with Treasury and with stakeholders. Furthermore, there was public and targeted consultation on the draft legislation. If the opposition are hiding behind claims of process to avoid the truth—that they are not willing to stand up for consumers—let me, in detailing that consultation, remove that fig leaf.


The government are committed to these reforms, and we will continue to advocate for the rights of consumers. If three rounds of consultation are not enough for the shadow Treasurer then we will allow parliament more time to scrutinise these amendments and ask that the coalition join with us in supporting these important consumer protection measures.


Schedule 5 provides important opportunities for the public to scrutinise the performance of Australia's business tax system and the contributions made by large and multinational businesses. Like the member for Lyne, I am surprised to see that the opposition is proposing to oppose this. There is growing concern not just here in Australia but right around the world that many of the key rules of international taxation have not kept pace with the evolution of the global economy. The apparent ease with which some large corporate entities can shift taxable profits and erode a country's tax base is a shared concern for this government, for the G20 and for, in fact, most OECD countries. I am surprised that it is not a concern of those opposite. Policymakers and the Australian public should have more transparency around the levels of tax being paid by large and multinational businesses in Australia to allow for an informed debate about the efficiency and equity of our tax system. By increasing the transparency of our business tax system the government will ensure that the public is well informed about the contributions made by large corporations. The amendments will also ensure that the government can be advised on and publish period aggregate tax collection information even where there may be few corporate entities paying a particular tax. In addition, schedule 5 facilitates increased information sharing between government agencies.


I pick up on the point that the member for Lyne made. We believe that the privacy of individuals in relation to their tax affairs should remain sacrosanct, and nothing in this schedule will alter that. But I make this central point: as we engage in a debate around base erosion and profit shifting, I hear plenty of stakeholders—in fact, some opposite—come forward and say, 'Show us the evidence that the corporate tax base is being eroded; show us the evidence that there is profit shifting.' In fact, these are the arguments that I have heard from those opposite when they have come into this place consistently to oppose measures that we have introduced to crack down on corporate tax loopholes—over $10 billion worth of measures in revenue protection that have been voted against by those opposite. Every single time, they come into this place and they say, 'Show us the evidence that big multinationals are not paying their fair share of tax.' We say, 'Okay, we need to amend the law so that you can see all of that evidence,' and they come in here and say they are opposed to it. What are you hiding? Why is it that you are so determined to hide the tax position of so many of these companies? It is outrageous. The net effect is that, if we do not crack down on these loopholes, individuals and small businesses—average, hardworking Australians out there—have to end up paying a higher burden of tax to pick up the slack when some of the most profitable companies in the world are not paying their fair share. You should be ashamed of yourselves.


Schedule 6 addresses issues arising from the full Federal Court decision in Esso Australia Resources Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation in 2012. Without amendment, there would be significant financial implications for industry, with many taxpayers being unable to deduct legitimate project expenditures in determining the PRRT liability for their petroleum projects. The government recognises that such an outcome would be inconsistent with the policy intent underpinning the PRRT regime and the way it has been administered since its commencement in 1987. The amendments maintain the policy intent of the PRRT as a profits based tax and are broadly consistent with the ATO's longstanding application of the PRRT law in relation to the treatment of deductible expenditure. At the same time, they preserve the substance of the court's decision that a taxpayer cannot derive a tax advantage via contract arrangements with related parties.


Schedule 7 exempts from income tax payments made to individuals under the Defence Abuse Reparations Scheme. The establishment of the scheme forms part of the government's response to the DLA Piper report of the review into allegations of sexual or other forms of abuse in Defence. The payments made under the scheme are in recognition of the fact that abuse in Defence is unacceptable and wrong. Exempting these payments from tax will ensure that recipients receive the full benefit of the payment. Exempting the reparation payment from the income tax will also prevent it having an impact on people's social security payments, such as parental leave, family assistance and child support payments.


Schedule 8 implements the government's announcement of 8 May 2012 to remove the 50 per cent discount on capital gains accrued after that date for foreign individuals. Foreign and temporary resident individuals will still be entitled to the 50 per cent discount on eligible capital gains accrued prior to 8 May 2012 after offsetting any capital losses, provided they choose to value the asset as at that day.


Schedule 9 amends the GST law to establish the framework for providing that certain services and support provided to National Disability Insurance Scheme participants will be GST free when they are provided for in a National Disability Insurance Scheme plan. This will ensure greater certainty for National Disability Insurance Scheme participants and providers that supply services to those participants. These amendments will apply in relation to supplies made on or after the commencement of section 37 of the National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013. However, this is subject to state and territory agreement to the making of the necessary determination.


Schedule 10 amends the deductible gift recipient provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. Taxpayers can claim an income tax deduction for gifts to organisations that are DGRs. Schedule 10 adds five new organisations to the act: namely, the Aurora Education Foundation Ltd, United Way Australia, the Australian Neighbourhood Houses and Centres Association Inc., the Australia Foundation in support of Human Rights Watch Ltd, and the Layne Beachley Aim for the Stars Foundation Ltd. The government will also move an amendment to add an additional organisation to the act: namely, Social Traders Ltd. Making these organisations deductible gift recipients will assist them to attract public support for their activities. Schedule 10 also extends the listings of two organisations in the act: the DGR listings for the Roberta Sykes Indigenous Education Foundation and the Charlie Perkins Scholarship Trust have been extended indefinitely. Extending the DGR listings for these organisations will assist them in continuing to attract public support for their activities.


Finally, schedule 11 makes several miscellaneous amendments to the taxation and superannuation laws. These amendments are part of the government's commitment to the care and maintenance of the taxation and superannuation systems. I commend this bill to the House.

Mr O'DOWD
 (Flynn) (13:51):  Mr Anthony Comino is a long-term businessman who has centred his business in Emerald. He has been operating the Western Gateway Motel for 30 years plus. For the first time he has made a decision to close his restaurant on Sunday nights and public holidays. He cited the main reason as: 'I can't afford to pay the penalty rates.' Saturdays are at time and a quarter, Sundays are at double time and public holidays are at double time and a half. Another accommodation owner in Gladstone does not employ people to clean and make up his rooms on Sundays or public holidays. Where are we going as a nation? Tourism bodies must be shaking their heads. 


People who want to work at a lower hourly rate on a Sunday—say, at time and a half—to make ends meet cannot work. They are simply not given the opportunity, because some of these once viable businesses are now struggling to survive. Retailers and hospitality employers are also trying to overcome the difficulties that are presented to them with these ever so high penalty rates forced on them on the weekends. Surely awards should be used to maximise employment, not the polar opposite.

I remind the minister that yesterday he said he would ask his department to brief him on whether there were any other terrorists being detained in the immigration detention network, in spite of the fact that he only took this action six weeks after first being briefed on a convicted Egyptian jihadist terrorist being held in low-security detention in the Adelaide Hills. Can the minister update the House on the outcome of this briefing?

As I said earlier this week, it is important that the honourable member, and other members who have sought a briefing, get a briefing on those matters. I can, however, confirm in response to the question in relation to that matter that the advice I have received is that there are no other IMAs in the detention network who have been identified as having an Interpol red notice. That is a very important piece of advice and I think it is therefore incumbent upon our agencies to continue to work professionally and dedicate themselves to ensure that they protect the community. I can assure the honourable member our agencies are doing just that.

The SPEAKER:  Order! Manager of Opposition Business, I am struggling to see how the minister's answer is not relevant.




Mr Pyne:
  Speaker, on a point of order: I am happy to explain that the minister just said that he had answered the question before. In fact, all he said was that people with an Interpol red notice were not being held in detention.



The SPEAKER:  Order! The Manager for Opposition Business will resume his seat. Before I give the minister the call, points of order on relevance are not for debate.




Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR:
  I can assure the honourable member that our agencies—the department of immigration, the security agency ASIO and the Australian Federal Police—will continue to ensure that they protect the interests of the Australian people. I have been advised that there are no others in the detention network that are on the red notice and I have been advised that the agencies continue to properly assess the situation in the detention network to protect the interests of the Australian people.

 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (15:04):  Thank you, Madam Speaker. If I may, on indulgence, it is quite unusual for another MPI to be selected over one submitted by the Leader of the Opposition. I accept that it is your right to do so. But it is particularly unusual for someone who thought this was so important that it should be the subject of a matter of public importance debate today not to be in the House for this. This is completely, absolutely and utterly unprecedented. It smacks of a set-up, if I may say so, Madam Speaker, and I suggest that—



The SPEAKER:  The Leader of the Opposition is reflecting on the chair, and I am finding this quite offensive.



Opposition members interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  Well, whether you meant to or not, that is what you have just done.




Mr Pyne:
  Madam Speaker, on a point of order: can I say that I think what the Leader of the Opposition was doing was not reflecting on you in any respect but reflecting on the member for Throsby and the government. It is not your fault that the member for Throsby is not in the chamber. Clearly you made a decision. You would not have known that the member for Throsby was not in the chamber when it was called on. It is clearly no reflection on you, and therefore I would ask you to hear the rest of the Leader of the Opposition's statement.



The SPEAKER:  The Leader of the Opposition will conclude his statement.




Mr ABBOTT:
  Thank you, Madam Speaker. If I may, I absolutely agree with the Manager of Opposition Business that there was no reflection intended on you and it would have been disorderly of me to do so. But how could the member for Throsby seriously submit this matter for debate and then absent himself from the House? How could this happen? Under the circumstances I submit that it would be open to you to say, 'Well, really, obviously the matter which is most worthy of debate is that submitted by someone who is actually present in the House.' I suggest that you now put this matter forward for debate.



The SPEAKER: We are bringing on the order of the day. I understand what the Leader of the Opposition has asked me to do, but it is not within the powers of the standing orders. I do not have the ability to do what you have requested.




Mr ABBOTT:
  Can I argue, on indulgence, for the benefit of the House. I wish to protect your position, Madam Speaker, and I think you have been placed in an impossible position. I believe there has been a set-up orchestrated by members opposite. I think you have been placed in a very embarrassing position. I think you have been placed in a humiliating position by the Leader of the House and by the member who put this MPI forward, obviously never intending to bring it to debate today, obviously intending to deny the opportunity for the opposition to raise a perfectly legitimate matter of public importance. I am embarrassed, I am ashamed, that you have been put in this position by this Leader of the House and by the absent member, and I believe the only way to protect the dignity of the parliament is for you, Madam Speaker, to revise that decision on the floor from the chair and to put this matter of public importance that I submitted now.



The SPEAKER:  I understand completely the Leader of the Opposition's point of order, but it is not within my ability within the standing orders to do as he has requested. The member for Mackellar will resume her seat; I will not entertain any more on this matter.

368


Dealing with a dismissal dispute (other than by arbitration)



(1) If an application is made under section 365, the FWC must deal with the dispute (other than by arbitration).


Note: The FWC may deal with a dispute by mediation or conciliation, or by making a recommendation or expressing an opinion (see subsection 595(2)). One of the recommendations that the FWC might make is that an application be made under Part 3‑2 (which deals with unfair dismissal) in relation to the dispute.


(2) Any conference conducted for the purposes of dealing with the dispute (other than by arbitration) must be conducted in private, despite subsection 592(3).


Note: For conferences, see section 592.


(3) If the FWC is satisfied that all reasonable attempts to resolve the dispute (other than by arbitration) have been, or are likely to be, unsuccessful, then:


   (a) the FWC must issue a certificate to that effect; and


   (b) if the FWC considers, taking into account all the materials before it, that arbitration under section 369, or a general protections court application, in relation to the dispute would not have a reasonable prospect of success, the FWC must advise the parties accordingly.


(4) A general protections court application is an application to a court under Division 2 of Part 4‑1 for orders in relation to a contravention of this Part.




369


Dealing with a dismissal dispute by arbitration



(1) This section applies if:


   (a) the FWC issues a certificate under paragraph 368(3)(a) in relation to the dispute; and


   (b) the parties notify the FWC that they agree to the FWC arbitrating the dispute; and


   (c) the notification:


      (i) is given to the FWC within 14 days after the day the certificate is issued, or within such period as the FWC allows on an application made during or after those 14 days; and


      (ii) complies with any requirements prescribed by the procedural rules; and


   (d) sections 726, 728, 729, 730, 731 and 732 do not apply.


Note: Sections 726, 728, 729, 730, 731 and 732 prevent multiple applications or complaints of a kind referred to in those sections from being made in relation to the same dispute. A notification can only be made under this section where there is no such other application or complaint in relation to the dispute at the time the notification is made. Generally, once a notification is made no such application or complaint can be made in relation to the dispute (see section 727).


(2) The FWC may deal with the dispute by arbitration, including by making one or more of the following orders:


   (a) an order for reinstatement of the person;


   (b) an order for the payment of compensation to the person;


   (c) an order for payment of an amount to the person for remuneration lost;


   (d) an order to maintain the continuity of the person's employment;


   (e) an order to maintain the period of the person's continuous service with the employer.


(3) A person to whom an order under subsection (2) applies must not contravene a term of the order.


Note: This subsection is a civil remedy provision (see Part 4‑1).




370


Taking a dismissal dispute to court



      A person who is entitled to apply under section 365 for the FWC to deal with a dispute must not make a general protections court application in relation to the dispute unless:


   (a) both of the following apply:


      (i) the FWC has issued a certificate under paragraph 368(3)(a) in relation to the dispute;


      (ii) the general protections court application is made within 14 days after the day the certificate is issued, or within such period as the court allows on an application made during or after those 14 days; or


   (b) the general protections court application includes an application for an interim injunction.


Note 1: Generally, if the parties notify the FWC that they agree to the FWC arbitrating the dispute (see subsection 369(1)), a general protections court application cannot be made in relation to the dispute (see sections 727 and 728).


Note 2: For the purposes of subparagraph (a)(ii), in Brodie‑Hanns v MTV Publishing Ltd (1995) 67 IR 298, the Industrial Relations Court of Australia set down principles relating to the exercise of its discretion under a similarly worded provision of the Industrial Relations Act 1988.

(1) Despite subsection 604(2), the FWC must not grant permission to appeal from a decision made by the FWC under subsection 369(2) (which is about arbitration of a dismissal dispute) unless the FWC considers that it is in the public interest to do so.


(2) Despite subsection 604(1), an appeal from a decision made by the FWC in relation to a matter arising under subsection 369(2) can only, to the extent that it is an appeal on a question of fact, be made on the ground that the decision involved a significant error of fact.




375B


Costs orders against parties



(1) The FWC may make an order for costs against a party (the first party) to a dispute for costs incurred by the other party to the dispute if:


   (a) an application for the FWC to deal with the dispute has been made under section 365; and


   (b) the FWC is satisfied that the first party caused those costs to be incurred because of an unreasonable act or omission of the first party in connection with the conduct or continuation of the dispute.


(2) The FWC may make an order under subsection (1) only if the other party to the dispute has applied for it in accordance with section 377.

   (c) under section 596, the person is required to seek the FWC's permission to be represented by the representative.


(2) The FWC may make an order for costs against the representative for costs incurred by the other party to the dispute if the FWC is satisfied that the representative caused those costs to be incurred because:


   (a) the representative encouraged the person to start, continue or respond to the dispute and it should have been reasonably apparent that the person had no reasonable prospect of success in the dispute; or


   (b) of an unreasonable act or omission of the representative in connection with the conduct or continuation of the dispute.


(3) The FWC may make an order under this section only if the other party to the dispute has applied for it in accordance with section 377.


(4) This section does not limit the FWC's power to order costs under section 611.

(1) A schedule of costs may be prescribed in relation to items of expenditure likely to be incurred in relation to matters that can be covered by an order under section 611, 375B or 376 in relation to an application under section 365, including expenses arising from the representation of a party by a person or organisation other than on a legal professional basis.


(2) If a schedule of costs is prescribed for the purposes of subsection (1), then, in awarding costs under section 611, 375B or 376 in relation to an application under section 365, the FWC:


   (a) is not limited to the items of expenditure appearing in the schedule; but


   (b) if an item does appear in the schedule—must not award costs in relation to that item at a rate or of an amount that exceeds the rate or amount appearing in the schedule.

Dealing with a dispute (other than by arbitration)



(1) If an application is made under section 773, the FWC must deal with the dispute (other than by arbitration).


Note: The FWC may deal with a dispute by mediation or conciliation, or by making a recommendation or expressing an opinion (see subsection 595(2)).


(2) Any conference conducted for the purposes of dealing with the dispute (other than by arbitration) must be conducted in private, despite subsection 592(3).


Note: For conferences, see section 592.


(3) If the FWC is satisfied that all reasonable attempts to resolve the dispute (other than by arbitration) have been, or are likely to be, unsuccessful, then:


   (a) the FWC must issue a certificate to that effect; and


   (b) if the FWC considers, taking into account all the materials before it, that arbitration under section 777, or an unlawful termination court application, in relation to the dispute would not have a reasonable prospect of success, the FWC must advise the parties accordingly.


(4) An unlawful termination court application is an application to a court under Division 2 of Part 4‑1 for orders in relation to a contravention of subsection 772(1).




777


Dealing with a dispute by arbitration



(1) This section applies if:


   (a) the FWC issues a certificate under paragraph 776(3)(a) in relation to the dispute; and


   (b) the parties notify the FWC that they agree to the FWC arbitrating the dispute; and


   (c) the notification:


      (i) is given to the FWC within 14 days after the day the certificate is issued, or within such period as the FWC allows on an application made during or after those 14 days; and


      (ii) complies with any requirements prescribed by the procedural rules; and


   (d) sections 726, 727, 728, 729, 731 and 732 do not apply.


Note: Sections 726, 727, 728, 729, 731 and 732 prevent multiple applications or complaints of a kind referred to in those sections from being made in relation to the same dispute. A notification can only be made under this section where there is no such other application or complaint in relation to the dispute at the time the notification is made. Generally, once a notification is made no such application or complaint can be made in relation to the dispute (see section 730).


(2) The FWC may deal with the dispute by arbitration, including by making one or more of the following orders:


   (a) an order for reinstatement of the employee;


   (b) an order for the payment of compensation to the employee;


   (c) an order for payment of an amount to the employee for remuneration lost;


   (d) an order to maintain the continuity of the employee's employment;


   (e) an order to maintain the period of the employee's continuous service with the employer.


(3) A person to whom an order under subsection (2) applies must not contravene a term of the order.


Note: This subsection is a civil remedy provision (see Part 4‑1).




778


Taking a dispute to court



      A person who is entitled to apply under section 773 for the FWC to deal with a dispute must not make an unlawful termination court application in relation to the dispute unless:


   (a) both of the following apply:


      (i) the FWC has issued a certificate under paragraph 776(3)(a) in relation to the dispute;


      (ii) the unlawful termination court application is made within 14 days after the day the certificate is issued, or within such period as the court allows on an application made during or after those 14 days; or


   (b) the unlawful termination court application includes an application for an interim injunction.


Note 1: Generally, if the parties notify the FWC that they agree to the FWC arbitrating the dispute (see subsection 777(1)), an unlawful termination court application cannot be made in relation to the dispute (see sections 730 and 731).


Note 2: For the purposes of subparagraph (a)(ii), in Brodie‑Hanns v MTV Publishing Ltd (1995) 67 IR 298, the Industrial Relations Court of Australia set down principles relating to the exercise of its discretion under a similarly worded provision of the Industrial Relations Act 1988.




779


Appeal rights



(1) Despite subsection 604(2), the FWC must not grant permission to appeal from a decision made by the FWC under subsection 777(2) (which is about arbitration of a dispute) unless the FWC considers that it is in the public interest to do so.


(2) Despite subsection 604(1), an appeal from a decision made by the FWC in relation to a matter arising under subsection 777(2) can only, to the extent that it is an appeal on a question of fact, be made on the ground that the decision involved a significant error of fact.




779A


Costs orders against parties



(1) The FWC may make an order for costs against a party (the first party) to a dispute for costs incurred by the other party to the dispute if:


   (a) an application for the FWC to deal with the dispute has been made under section 773; and


   (b) the FWC is satisfied that the first party caused those costs to be incurred because of an unreasonable act or omission of the first party in connection with the conduct or continuation of the dispute.


(2) The FWC may make an order under subsection (1) only if the other party to the dispute has applied for it in accordance with section 781.


(3) This section does not limit the FWC's power to order costs under section 611.




780


Costs orders against lawyers and paid agents



(1) This section applies if:


   (a) an application for the FWC to deal with a dispute has been made under section 773; and


   (b) a person who is a party to the dispute has engaged a lawyer or paid agent (the representative) to represent the person in the dispute; and


   (c) under section 596, the person is required to seek the FWC's permission to be represented by the representative.


(2) The FWC may make an order for costs against the representative for costs incurred by the other party to the dispute if the FWC is satisfied that the representative caused those costs to be incurred because:


   (a) the representative encouraged the person to start, continue or respond to the dispute and it should have been reasonably apparent that the person had no reasonable prospect of success in the dispute; or


   (b) of an unreasonable act or omission of the representative in connection with the conduct or continuation of the dispute.


(3) The FWC may make an order under this section only if the other party to the dispute has applied for it in accordance with section 781.


(4) This section does not limit the FWC's power to order costs under section 611.




781


Applications for costs orders



      An application for an order for costs in relation to an application under section 773 must be made within 14 days after the FWC finishes dealing with the dispute.




781A

(2) If a schedule of costs is prescribed for the purposes of subsection (1), then, in awarding costs under section 611, 779A or 780 in relation to an application under section 773, the FWC:


   (a) is not limited to the items of expenditure appearing in the schedule; but


   (b) if an item does appear in the schedule—must not award costs in relation to that item at a rate or of an amount that exceeds the rate or amount appearing in the schedule.

Item


4 of Schedule


5 to the amending Act



      The amendment made by item 4 of Schedule 5 to the amending Act applies in relation to an appointment made after the commencement of that Schedule.


The government has proposed five non-controversial amendments to address anomalies in the operation of the fair work legislation on sheet AB231. The first amendment clarifies powers during conferences of the FWC. This technical amendment to the Fair Work Act will clarify the powers the commission can exercise when conducting a conference. The amendment refers to the commission's capacity to conciliate, mediate, express opinions or make recommendations. The amendment is clarifying in nature and will not confer any additional determinative powers or functions on the commission such as arbitration.


Amendment (2), Fair Work Commission consent arbitration of dismissal claims, would allow the Fair Work Commission to undertake arbitration of general protections, dismissal and unlawful termination claims but only where both parties expressly consent to the commission exercising this function. At present, resolution of these matters may only occur via proceedings in the Federal Court. This can involve significant legal costs for both parties and can discourage people with legitimate claims from pursuing a fair outcome. By allowing the commission to exercise this function, it will provide a further option for these matters to be dealt with quickly in a cost-effective way. The changes will provide access to a faster, less expensive, less formal alternative to court proceedings. The jurisdiction will only be available where both parties expressly consent to the commission exercising this function.


Amendment (3) is a technical amendment to clarify that a Fair Work Commission deputy president or commissioner is not prevented from holding concurrent appointment with the president's approval to an office under Commonwealth territorial law. This amendment will provide clarification that deputy presidents or commissioners can be appointed to offices under Commonwealth or territory laws in which their expertise may be useful. From time to time members of the commission and its predecessor have undertaken roles outside the FWC which drew upon their experience and expertise, including in recent years in respect of 457 visas or terms and conditions in the aged-care sector. The clarifying amendment removes a potential impediment to FWC members being considered for appointment to a wider range of roles.


Amendment (4): bullying amendments relating to Defence Force and security personnel. These amendments would limit the operation of the workplace bullying provisions in relation to the Defence Force, Australia's security agencies and the Federal Police to align with the provisions of the Work Health and Safety Act, including limitations to the powers of the Fair Work Commission in relation to particular circumstances going to defence, national security or existing or future covert or international operations of the AFP, and to exclude the operational provisions to members of the ADF. These amendments will reflect the sensitive nature of the work that is undertaken by Australia's defence, security and law enforcement personnel.


Amendment (5): transitional arrangements for reporting of registered organisations disclosures. The government proposes amendments to ensure the disclosure of remuneration to officers of an organisation reflects the government's policy that the five highest paid officers of a national office or the two highest paid officers of a branch are required to disclose their remuneration under section 148A. The amendments provide an exception to obligations to disclose payments to related parties, section 148C, to ensure the disclosure of remuneration only occurs under section 148A. The amendments also clarify the reimbursement of minor expenses, such as the cost of taxi fares, stationery or other incidentals which are reasonably incurred as a result of officials' responsibilities, are not required to be disclosed. They provide transitional disclosure arrangements for the period 1 July 2013 to 31 December 2013 by requiring disclosure of certain matters as soon as practical after 1 January 2014 and no later than 1 January 2014. These amendments allow registered organisations to undertake the required steps to amend their rules as required by amendments passed by the government last year. For the FWC to approve these rule changes, these amendments will not shorten the periods for which disclosure is required. (Quorum formed)


Relevant disclosures will be for the remuneration paid to the officer, because the officer is a member of the board or related part of the organisation, and material personal interest of the officer. I understand these amendments are supported by the House. I commend the amendments to the House.

Ms LEY
 (Farrer) (15:16):  On this occasion we do agree with the government and the minister, but on nothing else related to this Fair Work Amendment Bill 2013. These amendments have been the subject of discussion. I understand they are broadly supported by industry and were recommendations of the Fair Work Commission. We have no issue with them.

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (15:17):  I present a supplementary explanatory memorandum to the Fair Work Amendment Bill 2013 and move government amendment (1) on sheet BW301:


(1) Clause 2, page 2 (table item 6), omit the table item, substitute:





6. Schedule 3




1 January 2014.




1 January 2014










Again I believe this is broadly agreed in the House. The bill currently before the House provides that relevant provisions will commence on proclamation or not later than six months after royal assent. The amendment clarifies that the provisions will commence on 1 January 2014. This will provide certainty to all stakeholders, including employers, employees and the Fair Work Commission, about the operation and commencement of this important jurisdiction. (Quorum formed)

Very briefly, I spoke to these amendments during my contribution in the second reading debate. These are simple amendments that would extend and provide a means for enforcing the right that people have under the Fair Work Act to request flexible working arrangements. These amendments would in situations where an employer unreasonably refuses that right allow the employee to take the matter to the Fair Work Commission, where they would be able to balance the needs of the employer, including the operational requirements of the employer, and the legitimate needs of the employee. This is important. It is important that the right to request these arrangements has teeth, otherwise it amounts to little more than a right to have a conversation. That would be the state that the bill would be in if we did not pass these amendments. I think these amendments would have broad support in the community. People are increasingly struggling to balance their work and life arrangements. I commend the amendments to the House.

Again, very briefly, I addressed these matters in my speech in the second reading debate. These amendments would address some of the issues that have arisen in respect of the operation of the Fair Work Act. In particular, for nurses and people in the public sector where they face powerful employers—workers, for example, in areas like Qantas—it would provide them with some protection against powerful employers tactically using industrial action or tactically dragging out negotiations. It would give the Fair Work Commission greater power to resolve the whole of disputes and ensure that, from the perspective of powerful employers, they could not do these things tactically—for example, by prolonging disputes or by grounding a fleet. I commend the amendments to the House.

(2) Examples of behaviour that may constitute family violence include (but are not limited to) the following:


   (a) physical assault;


   (b) a sexual assault or other sexually abusive behaviour;


   (c) economic abuse;


   (d) emotional or psychological abuse;


   (e) stalking;


   (f) kidnapping or deprivation of liberty;


   (g) damage to property (whether or not the victim owns the property);


   (h) causing injury or death to an animal (whether or not the animal belongs to the victim);


   (i) behaviour that exposes a child to behaviour of the kind described above.

   Omit ""or social origin"", substitute "", social origin or experience of family violence"".




5


After paragraph 772(1)(h)



   Insert:


   ; (i) experience of family violence.


Briefly, I referred to this in my speech in the second reading debate. This bill proposed by the government makes some welcome moves to extend protections to people who have experienced family violence. In particular, I applaud the government for extending the right to request flexible working arrangements. What my amendments would do is strengthen the protections against adverse action for victims of family violence. What this would mean is that someone who is in a position where they have experienced family violence or are looking after someone who has experienced it, who perhaps then makes a request of their employer, or perhaps not, are protected against adverse action from their employer. For example, if someone is not in a position to turn up to work on a particular day because they have been the victim of family violence, then it would be prohibited to take adverse action against them that might otherwise be lawful. This amendment has the support of domestic family violence campaigners. It is something that I hope receives sympathetic attention from the government and the opposition.

 (Melbourne) (15:30):  by leave—I move amendments (1) and (2) on sheet 9 as circulated in my name together:.


(1) Clause 2, page 2 (after table item 10), insert:

5A—Increases to compulsory superannuation not to affect minimum wage reviews or orders





Fair Work Act 2009





1


At the end of section


285



   Add:


(4) In exercising its power in an annual wage review:


   (a) to make determinations referred to in paragraph (2)(b); and


   (b) to make a national minimum wage order;


the FWC must disregard any increase in relevant superannuation contributions that takes effect after this subsection commences.


(5) Relevant superannuation contributions are contributions to a superannuation fund made by an employer to the extent that one or more of the following applies:


   (a) the employer would have been liable to pay superannuation guarantee charge under the Superannuation Guarantee Charge Act 1992 in relation to the person if the amounts had not been so contributed;


   (b) the employer is required to contribute to the fund for the employee's benefit in relation to a defined benefit interest (within the meaning of section 292‑175 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997) of the employee;


   (c) the employer is required to contribute to the fund for the employee's benefit under a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory.


As we have seen recently, when the Fair Work Commission assesses the minimum wage it takes into account potential superannuation rises for employees. This amendment would have the effect of saying that would not be taken into account for future increases to the minimum wage. I accept that for wages above the minimum wage it may be appropriate to consider whether to trade off future superannuation increases against wage increases. But for those who are on the minimum wage, when the minimum wage is so low, that trade-off should not be made because they are probably going to retire on the pension and not be reliant on their superannuation in the same way as others. So they need a wage increase now and that should be taken into account by the Fair Work Commission.

These amendments relate to workplace bullying and many speakers on this side of the House have alerted members opposite in the government to the ridiculousness of including provisions on workplace bullying in a fair work bill.


There is a plethora of state and also federal agencies that can take complaints about workplace bullying. There is a Work Safe Australia in every single state and territory. It is bizarre that the government should have decided that they want to include a whole new subject matter in a bill to amend the Fair Work laws of this country that actually has nothing to do with that. There are provisions already underway with the government's own Safe Work Australia. Why would you introduce a new mechanism about a new subject that is already under discussion for legislative debate with Safe Work Australia into a bill that is designed to look at the Fair Work review? We take very seriously the issue of workplace bullying. We noted with interest the House of Representatives committee's report into the issue, but we are really disappointed that the government did not see fit to deal with the issue in separate legislation.


We support the proposals to address workplace bullying, but only if it is clear that the worker has first sought help and impartial advice from an independent regulatory agency and, further, that these provisions are expanded to include the conduct of union officials towards workers and employers. The amendments that I move achieve this objective and I would encourage members on the crossbenches to support them. It is important to recognise that these amendments have already been supported by the government's handpicked lead reviewer of the Fair Work Act who was reported in Workplace Express on 14 May as having said the coalition's proposal that bullying claims go through an independent regulatory agency before being lodged with the Fair Work Commission was a great way to do it.


In fact, the minister just moved an amendment that we agreed to that said that the workplace bullying activities of the Fair Work Commission would not start until 1 January because there is absolutely no way that the Fair Work Commission can get together a whole unit to deal with the subject matter that is not really in its purview in the next couple of weeks. So the government acknowledges itself that it cannot get its act together before 1 January and has extended the period by six months. The most sensible thing would be to filter out complaints of bullying made in the workplace through the existing agencies and the existing structures which include state OH&S law as well as the common law. Then, if there is no resolution, maybe bring it to the Fair Work Commission. 


As well as that, it is perfectly obvious to everyone in this place that some of the biggest bullies in the workplace are union bosses. So we are saying that the bill should be amended to include bullying by union bosses of workers and employers in the workplace. Every speaker on this side of the House has brought evidence to the parliament in this debate of exactly that. These are perfectly moderate amendments and I commend them to the House.

Obviously, coming out of mustering camps and having worked as a labourer on many occasions in the mines, I have difficulty here because what one person may construe as bullying may be another way that people just simply talk to each other in situations of very high tension and very high danger. We are not people to equivocate in the bush and in the mines, I can assure you. So the definition worries me greatly and I have had difficulties with no part of the ALP proposal except in this area.

(2) Schedule 4, page 20 (line 1) to page 28 (line 29), omit the Schedule.


(3) Schedule 7, item 1, page 34 (lines 14 to 29), omit Part 5.


I will speak briefly about the amendments, but what is more interesting and important in the case of these amendments is the process. The government and the opposition struck an agreement to remove the expanded right-of-entry provisions from the Fair Work Amendment Bill yesterday. That agreement was still in place when we all woke up this morning and, as far as I know, it was in place at lunchtime today. But in a hasty scramble, only an hour before question time, the government informed us that in fact the very amendments that they were about to move, to take the right-of-entry provisions out of this bill, were not going to be moved, and that the bill as originally circulated by the government was going to stand.


So the government's own amendments were pulled at the last minute. Why could that be? Who benefits from union right of entry, or should I say expanded right of entry? Unions, of course. What dirty deal must have been done? What insistence was there that more money be allocated to the union coffers in this last few hours before these right-of-entry provisions hit the table to make this minister and this government scramble away from them and give in to the union bosses that hold them to ransom?


We have referred to the Prime Minister's promise of no expanded right of entry. Right-of-entry provisions in this country today are very strong. They are very firm. They allow unions way too much, and we have said that we will draw them back. Only today I heard of an example of a childcare centre in Queensland where the union, United Voice, desperate to sign up new members, barged into the lunch room, looked at the sign-on sheet and said: 'We haven't met these members of staff. Who are they? Where are they? Why can't they come in? Why can't we sign them up to the union?'


What we are moving with these amendments is to take out the right-of-entry provisions that the government had agreed with us to do. We are concerned about joy-rides and lunch room invasions; the default provisions in this bill say that the union can choose the lunch room as the default meeting place. Only 13 per cent of Australian workers belong to unions; the other 87 per cent have to have their lunchtime and their quiet time interrupted in this manner.


I strongly commend these amendments to the House and I look forward to the support of the crossbenchers.

The SPEAKER:  The member for Kooyong will get to the amendments or I will sit him down.




Mr FRYDENBERG:
  Here I am finding myself debating an important amendment that we put forward about the right of entry. The reason we have to debate this point is the Labor Party has done a backflip under the pressure of the unions—their paymasters in the unions. Shame on you, Labor Party! Shame on you! Not only is it good enough that 50 per cent of all votes at the federal Labor conferences go to the unions but 100 per cent of members of those opposite in the caucus are also members of the union. If you go to the number of members of unions across the private sector of Australia, only 13 per cent are members of the union. Here we have right-of-entry provisions that this government wants to introduce to allow union bosses to go into the lunchtime hours of private sector workers across the country. What about the 87 per cent of the workers who are not members of the union? They want to eat their burger and chips in quiet. They do not want to have the union bosses storm into their lunchtime hours and try to recruit them.


If it was not good enough that the Labor Party, whether in the childcare sector or in the aged-care sector, made someone's payments to those sectors contingent upon them joining a union, now they have taken it to the workplaces of every private sector employer in the country. That is not good enough, because it was not a recommendation of the Fair Work review panel hand-picked by those on the other side. They hand-picked their own reviewers, led by Professor McCallum, and those reviewers did not even recommend this amendment before the House. That is why the pieman, Bill Shorten, the member for Maribyrnong, said he was going to remove this amendment. But now he has got the phone call from the TWU and the CFMEU and the AWU—they have all rung his office at once and said, 'Bring back that right-of-entry provision.'


What is absolutely outrageous about this is that it is in breach of the Prime Minister's promise to the Australian people. We had a promise from the Prime Minister about the carbon tax. We had a promise from the Prime Minister about private health insurance. We had a promise from the Prime Minister about family tax benefit A. And we had a promise from the Prime Minister about right of entry. This is what the Prime Minister said about keeping the right-of-entry provisions as they were, in the National Press Club debate on 8 November 2007:


I'm happy to do whatever you would like. If you'd like me to pledge to resign—


yes, we would—


sign a contract in blood—


yes, we would—


take a polygraph—


yes, we would—


bet my house on it—


yes, we would—


give you my mother as a hostage—


yes, we would—


whatever you'd like.


She said they would keep the right-of-entry provisions as they are. How outrageous is that? I say to the Independents: how outrageous is it that the Prime Minister goes to the Australian National Press Club and tells the people across this country—all 23 million of them—'We are going to keep the right-of-entry provisions as they are'?


Again, Julia Gillard in a media press release on 28 August 2007 said, 'As of today federal Labor will maintain existing right-of-entry rules without exception.' They have not. We know, through the economic reforms that we introduced, that we delivered a 22 per cent increase in real wages and two million new jobs, paid back $96 billion of debt, lifted the credit rating from AA to AAA and doubled the crane works on our waterfront. That was as a result of our workplace relations reforms and our prudent economic management. Those on the other side have broken promise after promise to the Australian people, have come into this House and done a backflip out of all proportion and now are saying to every employer of Australia, 'Your lunchrooms are not safe because we will be in there at the first opportunity.' Shame on you, Labor Party! Shame on you!

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (15:57):  I have to respond to that fairytale espoused by the member for Kooyong. First of all, what is most revealing is to hear the member for Kooyong enthusiastically embrace the workplace relations system of the Howard era. I know that he is waiting for some of his shadow front bench to move on so he can see his own ambitions fulfilled—it is an open secret. I read the Peter van Onselen columns as much as you guys leak to them.


But in terms of the member for Kooyong's speech, such as it was, he ran with his usual anti-union bile and prejudice. The provisions currently in the bill reform the right-of-entry regime in response to the recommendation findings from the independent Fair Work review panel. The provisions better balance the right of unions representing employees to be able to represent their members professionally, with the need for their employers to go about their business productively.


As a government we believe in freedom of association. We reject the language of the opposition where freedom of association somehow means an invasion. We believe that people have the right to choose to belong or not to belong to a union. We believe this is a fundamental right. We reject the proposition of the opposition that this freedom should be accessed only with the permission of an employer. We understand that the vast majority of trade unions and employer organisations are accountable to their members. We also believe that anyone in a position of trust or responsibility in a registered organisation has to comply with the law. We believe in balancing the right of employers to go about their business without undue interference, with the democratic right of employees to be represented in the workplace and to participate in discussions with their union at appropriate times. We reject the exaggerated language about joy-rides. There is no evidence that has been offered for that, not a scintilla of proof. That, as ever, has hardly stopped some of the anti-union, bigoted baiters opposite from attacking us.

Mr SHORTEN:
  Touched a sore nerve there, I think. We do not believe employers should be out of pocket. We do not believe in employees being forced to talk to people to whom they do not wish to talk, but that is why the bill as it currently stands does not provide for any of the fears, concerns, dogma, propaganda, prejudice, bile and ignorance that we hear from those opposite.


This debate proves yet again that you cannot trust conservatives on workplace relations. The contributions of those opposite yet again prove that the coalition are never straight with the Australian people on workplace relations.

 (Farrer) (16:00):  One question, Minister: why the backflip? I have here government amendments: 'Excise schedule 4'. The entire right-of-entry provisions were going to be taken out of this bill by you up until lunchtime today. So my short, sharp question—not debating the right of entry or the increased right of entry per se—is: why the backflip?

"Billson, Bruce, MP",LP,2013-06-06,"



Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley) (16:00):  We had today an arrangement that had recognised clear deficiencies in these right-of-entry and joy-ride provisions—something even the government recognised—but then at the eleventh hour the provisions are back on the table. What happened? Was it the fully owned subsidiary of the union movement, being the Gillard Labor government, not having done enough to pay their dues to their sponsors? Is that what happened? It is not clear, because we have had no explanation.


Bear a thought for the small businesses of Australia. It is bad enough that this government broke its promise not to disclose the addresses of home based businesses when it came to the Australian business name register. The small business community did not want their privacy breached by this national scheme that ignored the protections that were in the state based schemes, where home based businesses could provide another address as a point of contact and not have to tell the whole world where their home is. That promise was broken, and that broken promise on disclosure of people's home addresses for home based businesses is now matched by another one.


You can imagine a union fronting up to someone's home based business, where there might be one or two people in there, and banging on the door—because of the broken promise about not having that privacy matter disclosed—and saying: 'I want to use your lunch room. Hang on; it's your home. I want to take over your dining room. I want to go into the family area. I want to go into the house.' Why? Because these laws have not been thought through.


The only construct of economic contribution Labor understand is that of big organisations and big unions with big workforces where there are dozens of people who look after these tricky amendments and changes that this government is inflicting on people. Labor do not understand the nature of small business. Imagine if you were a corner store selling pies or something like that and someone came in wanting to talk to your staff—someone wanted to barge their way through the store area into what would be the family room of your home, if that business were attached to a home in a residential area.


There has been no thought given to how these measures—which were supposed to be off the table last night but are now back on the table—will be yet another affront to the small business men and women of Australia. They have been let down time and time again. Their privacy has been breached. That was a broken promise. The Prime Minister provided all of these assurances and even said, 'I will bet my house on it.' Minister, small business men and women bet their house on their business every day and, if they are operating from home, they do not need someone coming in and demanding entry under your laws and then taking over their dining room. Why? Because not all workplaces are big unionised shops like you seem to think. There is a vast number—millions of people—contributing to the economy and the wellbeing of this nation who do not fit this construct that you have.


The small business men and women of Australia have had a gutful of Labor, who have done nothing for them. Employment in that sector has gone down. The number of small businesses willing to employ is not even where it was back when this government was elected. We are seeing small business formation halved. Why? Because time and time again this Labor government has been completely insensitive and indifferent to the real-life challenges that small businesses face. Minister, this is an invitation for home based businesses to have their door knocked on—because you breached their privacy, in another broken promise—and to have someone demand access to their place. There is no lunch room; it is their lounge room; it is their dining room. It is their personal home. It is where their kids are.


This is why you have not thought this through. This is why we thought you had actually been sensible in your assurance to the coalition that you would carve out these provisions. But something has happened. You got a knock on the door and someone said, 'Oh, Bill, Bill, as part of a labour movement, you are a fully owned subsidiary of the unions that are demanding this be put back in,' with no interest in its impact on the small business men and women who are creating opportunities across this continent. You have no idea about the pressures they face. These provisions should be carved out because you have not thought them through. These provisions are offensive. They are an affront to small business men and women. We say to all those tens of thousands of small business men and women who operate from their homes to create wealth and opportunity: you cannot count on Labor—they have never done anything for you—but you can count on the coalition, because we respect what you do, we recognise your contribution and we value the risk that you take, and you do not need a union person coming in and taking over your dining room as well.

"Buchholz, Scott, MP",LP,2013-06-06,"



Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright) (16:05):  I will not detain the House for any longer than is absolutely necessary. I believe that, within the provisions of this bill, the Fair Work Amendment Bill 2013—and my audience is the crossbenchers—there is a genuine unintended consequence for family business and for larger enterprises. The provision I speak of is linked to the right of entry—the lunch room invasion. In and around my electorate I have businesses that employ up to 800 people on site. As a show of good faith, these businesses forgo business space on their sites and give that free of charge to the union movement so that the union delegates on site, who are free to come and go as they wish, can meet with—




Mr Husic:
  No, they're not.




Mr BUCHHOLZ:
  The intimidation shown there is consistent with the intimidation that you get throughout the union movement. Minister, you have the power to repeal this one section of the bill. There are good businesses out there that have invested in locations on site where the unions can go and meet. The unintended consequence of this schedule in this bill means that there is no right of refusal for the business owner to be able to say, 'I have provided that to you free of charge; take that space.' There is no right of refusal for the business owner, when the union delegate comes in and says: 'I don't want that spot. I want to speak to the guys in the lunch room.' I will stand corrected, Minister, if that is not the case and then I will take that with humble pie. But, if it is an unintended consequence, I do implore you and the crossbenches to reconsider your support for this bill, because it is fundamentally wrong. There are other provisions in which union guys can get their message across.


Minister, in an earlier response you said that everyone has the right to be a union member. Exactly, but everyone also has the right not to be a union member if they so wish. It is unthinkable that if I were in a coffee shop or a public locality—as when a telemarketer rings my house and asks me to join, I have the right to say no. Under these provisions the unintended consequence is that there will be no provision for those people that wish not to be part of a union to remove themselves from the company or the union delegate on site unless they physically get up and leave the lunch room. This is unfair, Minister.

All the same, I would ask the minister to consider that maybe somewhere along the track that should be moved.

Conciliation and arbitration of disputes



(1) Despite any other provision of this Act but without limitation, the FWC may deal with a dispute in the following way:


   (a) in the first 3 months of the dispute—by fixing a date to begin conciliation;


   (b) in the 3 months following the date fixed to begin conciliation—by conciliation;


(c) after the end of the period referred to in paragraph (b)—by arbitration (including by making any orders it considers appropriate) on application by:


      (i) an employee who is a party to the dispute; or


      (ii) an organisation that is entitled to represent the industrial interests of such an employee.


(2) On application in accordance with paragraph (1)(c), the FWC:


   (a) may arbitrate the dispute; and


   (b) must arbitrate the dispute if arbitration by the FWC is agreed to by:


      (i) a majority of the employees who are parties to the dispute, by a voting method approved by the FWC; and


      (ii) any organisations entitled to represent the industrial interests of those employees.


(3) On request by an employee who is a party to the dispute or an organisation that is entitled to represent the industrial interests of such an employee, the FWC may, but is not required to:


   (a) consider; and


   (b) approve or refuse to approve;


a voting method for the purposes of subparagraph (2)(b)(i).


I will speak very briefly. The issues that I am talking about are extremely complex, so I will just give generalities without going into all the specifics. But the generality is a fairly simple principle: where people are having an argument about whether they should get a pay rise or whether they should not, for 110 years in this country when that dispute occurred it was resolved by way of arbitration. I tend to feel that I am looking like an extremist insofar as I am putting up a proposition which successive governments have subscribed to in this country for 110 years.


When we play football, we have a referee; it is a fairly simple concept. When we have a disagreement between the employer and the employee, we then go to a referee called an arbitration commission to make a determination. The opposition abolished our right to get a fair go and, of course, the government has not restored it, because the current access to the arbitration commission is really no access at all, except for the purpose of stopping a strike. There is no ability for either side to go to the arbitration commission and ask for an award determination. That power is not there. All I am asking is what every successive government in 110 years in this country agreed to—anything but an extremist position. The fact that I actually have to defend that position is a reflection upon every person in this House who is not going to vote with me and the member for Denison. We are simply asking for a restoration of the parties' access to arbitration.


There are other bits and pieces here, but, the time being late, I know I will not be given the time to complete an explanation of the other aspects of the bill, so I will just state the central thrust of what we are talking about here. The Liberal government removed arbitration. They said, 'You will now play football without a referee'—a touch of humour, Madam Speaker. We did it last night and I didn't think it was a real good idea, but that might be a viewpoint of a New South Welshman! But to put aside the humour and come back to the seriousness of this debate: all I am asking for is that, when an employer and an employee cannot agree about, for example, a CPI increase, the parties have the right to go to arbitration—we are back playing football with a referee, which every single government in this place for 110 years has considered a reasonable proposition. When that right was removed, the people thought it was so unreasonable that they threw Prime Minister Bruce out of parliament altogether. John Howard—except for this little aberration, a very decent Australian, in my opinion—they threw out as well.


Our position is not unreasonable. Our position is the position that every single Australian, if they thought about it, would have. They would be in here voting the same way as me and the honourable member for Denison.

The SPEAKER:  The member for Kooyong will get to the amendments or I will sit him down.




Mr FRYDENBERG:
  Here I am finding myself debating an important amendment that we put forward about the right of entry. The reason we have to debate this point is the Labor Party has done a backflip under the pressure of the unions—their paymasters in the unions. Shame on you, Labor Party! Shame on you! Not only is it good enough that 50 per cent of all votes at the federal Labor conferences go to the unions but 100 per cent of members of those opposite in the caucus are also members of the union. If you go to the number of members of unions across the private sector of Australia, only 13 per cent are members of the union. Here we have right-of-entry provisions that this government wants to introduce to allow union bosses to go into the lunchtime hours of private sector workers across the country. What about the 87 per cent of the workers who are not members of the union? They want to eat their burger and chips in quiet. They do not want to have the union bosses storm into their lunchtime hours and try to recruit them.


If it was not good enough that the Labor Party, whether in the childcare sector or in the aged-care sector, made someone's payments to those sectors contingent upon them joining a union, now they have taken it to the workplaces of every private sector employer in the country. That is not good enough, because it was not a recommendation of the Fair Work review panel hand-picked by those on the other side. They hand-picked their own reviewers, led by Professor McCallum, and those reviewers did not even recommend this amendment before the House. That is why the pieman, Bill Shorten, the member for Maribyrnong, said he was going to remove this amendment. But now he has got the phone call from the TWU and the CFMEU and the AWU—they have all rung his office at once and said, 'Bring back that right-of-entry provision.'

Minister, this is an invitation for home based businesses to have their door knocked on—because you breached their privacy, in another broken promise—and to have someone demand access to their place. There is no lunch room; it is their lounge room; it is their dining room. It is their personal home. It is where their kids are.


This is why you have not thought this through. This is why we thought you had actually been sensible in your assurance to the coalition that you would carve out these provisions. But something has happened. You got a knock on the door and someone said, 'Oh, Bill, Bill, as part of a labour movement, you are a fully owned subsidiary of the unions that are demanding this be put back in,' with no interest in its impact on the small business men and women who are creating opportunities across this continent. You have no idea about the pressures they face. These provisions should be carved out because you have not thought them through. These provisions are offensive. They are an affront to small business men and women. We say to all those tens of thousands of small business men and women who operate from their homes to create wealth and opportunity: you cannot count on Labor—they have never done anything for you—but you can count on the coalition, because we respect what you do, we recognise your contribution and we value the risk that you take, and you do not need a union person coming in and taking over your dining room as well.

Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright) (16:05):  I will not detain the House for any longer than is absolutely necessary. I believe that, within the provisions of this bill, the Fair Work Amendment Bill 2013—and my audience is the crossbenchers—there is a genuine unintended consequence for family business and for larger enterprises. The provision I speak of is linked to the right of entry—the lunch room invasion. In and around my electorate I have businesses that employ up to 800 people on site. As a show of good faith, these businesses forgo business space on their sites and give that free of charge to the union movement so that the union delegates on site, who are free to come and go as they wish, can meet with—




Mr Husic:
  No, they're not.




Mr BUCHHOLZ:
  The intimidation shown there is consistent with the intimidation that you get throughout the union movement. Minister, you have the power to repeal this one section of the bill. There are good businesses out there that have invested in locations on site where the unions can go and meet. The unintended consequence of this schedule in this bill means that there is no right of refusal for the business owner to be able to say, 'I have provided that to you free of charge; take that space.' There is no right of refusal for the business owner, when the union delegate comes in and says: 'I don't want that spot. I want to speak to the guys in the lunch room.' I will stand corrected, Minister, if that is not the case and then I will take that with humble pie. But, if it is an unintended consequence, I do implore you and the crossbenches to reconsider your support for this bill, because it is fundamentally wrong. There are other provisions in which union guys can get their message across.


Minister, in an earlier response you said that everyone has the right to be a union member. Exactly, but everyone also has the right not to be a union member if they so wish. It is unthinkable that if I were in a coffee shop or a public locality—as when a telemarketer rings my house and asks me to join, I have the right to say no. Under these provisions the unintended consequence is that there will be no provision for those people that wish not to be part of a union to remove themselves from the company or the union delegate on site unless they physically get up and leave the lunch room. This is unfair, Minister.

 (Kennedy) (16:08):  On the point the opposition makes about its core business, yes, it would have been highly desirable if an amendment had been moved to eliminate from the bill businesses under 15 or something of that nature.

All the same, I would ask the minister to consider that maybe somewhere along the track that should be moved. If the opposition as a government moves it in the next parliament, I would most certainly back the sort of proposition that the opposition spokesman put forward with respect to small business.

Conciliation and arbitration of disputes



(1) Despite any other provision of this Act but without limitation, the FWC may deal with a dispute in the following way:


   (a) in the first 3 months of the dispute—by fixing a date to begin conciliation;


   (b) in the 3 months following the date fixed to begin conciliation—by conciliation;


(c) after the end of the period referred to in paragraph (b)—by arbitration (including by making any orders it considers appropriate) on application by:


      (i) an employee who is a party to the dispute; or


      (ii) an organisation that is entitled to represent the industrial interests of such an employee.


(2) On application in accordance with paragraph (1)(c), the FWC:


   (a) may arbitrate the dispute; and


   (b) must arbitrate the dispute if arbitration by the FWC is agreed to by:


      (i) a majority of the employees who are parties to the dispute, by a voting method approved by the FWC; and


      (ii) any organisations entitled to represent the industrial interests of those employees.


(3) On request by an employee who is a party to the dispute or an organisation that is entitled to represent the industrial interests of such an employee, the FWC may, but is not required to:


   (a) consider; and


   (b) approve or refuse to approve;


a voting method for the purposes of subparagraph (2)(b)(i).


I will speak very briefly. The issues that I am talking about are extremely complex, so I will just give generalities without going into all the specifics. But the generality is a fairly simple principle: where people are having an argument about whether they should get a pay rise or whether they should not, for 110 years in this country when that dispute occurred it was resolved by way of arbitration. I tend to feel that I am looking like an extremist insofar as I am putting up a proposition which successive governments have subscribed to in this country for 110 years.


When we play football, we have a referee; it is a fairly simple concept. When we have a disagreement between the employer and the employee, we then go to a referee called an arbitration commission to make a determination. The opposition abolished our right to get a fair go and, of course, the government has not restored it, because the current access to the arbitration commission is really no access at all, except for the purpose of stopping a strike. There is no ability for either side to go to the arbitration commission and ask for an award determination. That power is not there. All I am asking is what every successive government in 110 years in this country agreed to—anything but an extremist position. The fact that I actually have to defend that position is a reflection upon every person in this House who is not going to vote with me and the member for Denison. We are simply asking for a restoration of the parties' access to arbitration.


There are other bits and pieces here, but, the time being late, I know I will not be given the time to complete an explanation of the other aspects of the bill, so I will just state the central thrust of what we are talking about here. The Liberal government removed arbitration. They said, 'You will now play football without a referee'—a touch of humour, Madam Speaker. We did it last night and I didn't think it was a real good idea, but that might be a viewpoint of a New South Welshman! But to put aside the humour and come back to the seriousness of this debate: all I am asking for is that, when an employer and an employee cannot agree about, for example, a CPI increase, the parties have the right to go to arbitration—we are back playing football with a referee, which every single government in this place for 110 years has considered a reasonable proposition. When that right was removed, the people thought it was so unreasonable that they threw Prime Minister Bruce out of parliament altogether. John Howard—except for this little aberration, a very decent Australian, in my opinion—they threw out as well.


Our position is not unreasonable. Our position is the position that every single Australian, if they thought about it, would have. They would be in here voting the same way as me and the honourable member for Denison.



The SPEAKER:  The question is that the amendments be agreed to.




A division having been called and the bells having been rung—




The SPEAKER:  As there are fewer than five members on the side for the ayes, in this division I declare the question negated in accordance with standing order 127. The names of those members who are in the minority will be recorded in the Votes and Proceedings.

Ms GAMBARO
 (Brisbane) (16:28):  I rise to present a petition that has been found to be in order by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Petitions and which has been signed by 272 Australians in my electorate.




The petition read as follows—



To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives


This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the failure of the Government to commit to a new entrance to the Enoggera Army Base on Samford Road and the uncertainty and delay that this creates in reducing the impact of traffic on local roads.


We therefore ask the House to urge the Minister for Defence to instruct his Department to contribute to the construction of a new entrance to the Enoggera Army Base on Samford Road in consideration of the residents and businesses in that area.


from 272 citizens


Petition received.




Ms GAMBARO:
  This petition is signed by the local residents of Ashgrove and Enoggera and draws to the attention of the House the failure of the government to commit to a new entrance to the Enoggera Barracks on Samford Road and the uncertainty and delay that this creates in reducing the impact of traffic on local roads. It goes on to ask the House to urge the Minister for Defence to instruct his department to contribute to the construction of a new entrance to the Enoggera Army base on Samford Road in consideration of the residences and businesses in that area.


I can say without a shadow of a doubt that the biggest local issue I have in my electorate is traffic congestion on local roads. It is not confined to one suburb or a block of streets; it is becoming a significant source of frustration to many of the local suburban residents. Large amounts of traffic, including heavy vehicles such as semitrailers, are rat-running using our local streets as opposed to using the main arterial routes. This is tending to mainly affect the inner suburbs, where traffic to and from the city during peak times diverts through local roads and is a major safety issue, as well as incredibly inconvenient.


However, this afternoon I am going to concentrate on a local road issue that will not go away. I am talking about the traffic congestion around Ashgrove and Enoggera and the failure of the government to commit to opening a new entrance to the Enoggera Army base on Samford Road to alleviate traffic. This saga—and it is a saga—has been going on since 2010, and it is just not good enough. I have raised this matter before in the House and recently I welcomed the shadow minister for defence science, technology and personnel, Stuart Robert MP, to Enoggera to meet with local residents about their concerns.


Meetings first commenced in June 2010 between the Department of Defence and the Queensland government's Department of Transport and Main Roads to include the Samford Road entrance to the Enoggera Army base as part of the Queensland government's Samford Road corridor plan. An article in the North-West News of 7 July 2011 notes that Defence announced it is working with the transport and main roads department for a new entrance as part of the state's Samford Road corridor. The Department of Defence is quoted as saying:


… plans would be finalised as part of the Samford Rd corridor plan …


Then, in November 2011, the answer to a Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works question on notice on the LAND 17 phase 1A infrastructure project included the following response:


The Department of Defence is committed to putting an entrance on to Samford Rd, but we cannot proceed with any works on Samford Road until the final road design for the Samford Rd and Wardell St intersection upgrade has been finalised.'


Meetings continued between the Queensland Department of Transport and Main Roads and the Department of Defence, and the dialogue went through all of 2011 and 2012. They met to progress these projects. Campbell Newman announced the revised plans on 22 June 2011 for the Samford Road-Wardell Street intersection, which would also include a new entrance to the Enoggera Barracks at a cost of $65 million. Senator Feeney, the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence, also indicated in correspondence dated 26 June that Defence would possibly contribute $5.4 million for the new entrance to the barracks off Samford Road. 


After all the negotiations and all the work that has been completed over this issue over a period of two years, the government then indicated in estimates in February that they would not commit to a new entrance after all but instead would commission yet another study. Works on the Samford-Wardell upgrade have now been started by the Newman government, and this is quite farcical: there will be a turning lane into a fence, as there will be no entrance because Defence will not commit to a new entrance off Samford Road. This is just incredible.


In direct contrast to this government, we are committed to working through the issues surrounding traffic management around the Enoggera Army base and surrounds, and should the coalition win the election later this year we will make absolutely sure that we will resolve this issue and make it a top priority.

Mr RANDALL
 (Canning) (09:30):  I wish to discuss a serious public health issue to the people of Mandurah in my electorate of Canning in Western Australia. In December last year I was contacted by a lawn mowing contractor in Mandurah who had witnessed subcontractors in France Street removing and replacing a Telstra pit in preparation for the rollout of the NBN. This whistleblower visited the site after the subcontractor had finished and was astonished to see fragments of asbestos concrete strewn over the lawn. He subsequently contacted my office. A staff member inspected the site. We had the fragments tested at my own expense and confirmed that the fragments did indeed contain asbestos. We found the material at not one but several sites. As we know, asbestos poses a significant health hazard to those who are in contact with it.


While the NBN asbestos issue has obviously been hot news in recent weeks, I must say that we alerted to the relevant authorities many months ago—six months ago in fact. While I have seen Telstra wear the blame for this issue in recent days I think it is important to keep in mind that the asbestos in the Telstra pits is a matter that should have been a appropriately foreshadowed by NBN prior to the rollout of what is Australian's most expensive national infrastructure project.


Like everything else this Labor government does, all the emphasis is placed on the announcement, and detail is a secondary consideration. This is a matter that NBN Co. were well aware of yet now we see Prime Minister Gillard and Ministers Conroy and Shorten scurrying away from an issue that any responsible government would have known would become a significant problem. Yes, it is true that Telstra owns and therefore ultimately is responsible for the pits that are the source of the asbestos. However, the fact remains that this is not a concern that has arisen unexpectedly.


After I alerted authorities to the issue in Mandurah, Comcare initiated an investigation. Curiously, I did not receive any follow-up report from Comcare until my office contacted the department last month. My office was told that the report on the investigation would be provided; however, days later, no such report had been provided. The following week my office was provided with a three-paragraph summary of the investigation undertaken by Comcare, which included very little detail on this very serious matter.


When I subsequently contacted Comcare to request a full copy of the inspector's report, I was astonished when I was told that I must submit a freedom of information application to see the report. The absurdity of this situation is astounding. After having brought this issue to the attention of relevant authorities, I now as a federal member of parliament need to submit an FOI application to see the full results of the federal department's investigation. Perhaps these departments need to be reminded that they exist to serve and are funded by the Australian people.



I also have concerns over the truncated summary of Comcare's report. It states, 'I can advise that Comcare inspected the Telstra pit,' which indicates they inspected the single pit in France Street where the issue originated. I have evidence that the asbestos was found in several sites in France Street alone. I want to see the full report. (Time expired)

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House, Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and Minister for Regional Development and Local Government) (10:02):  The 2013-14 budget not only continues to roll out federal Labor's Nation Building Program but begins identifying future funding priorities. This budget continues the achievements of the first phase of the program, with the final instalment of $5.7 billion in 2013-14. Already we have doubled the federal roads budget. We have increased investment in rail tenfold. We have committed more to urban public transport since 2007 than all previous governments combined since Federation. In this budget we announced more additional investment in urban public transport than any previous budget since Federation. 


The budget announced $24 billion for the next phase of the Nation Building Program, which commences in 2014-15, taking the total program to a record $60 billion. This is the largest capital works program in the nation's history, and the new projects announced in the budget build on this. In the budget, we provided $715 million towards the construction of the Brisbane Cross River Rail, and $3 billion for the Melbourne Metro. Both of these projects have been identified by Infrastructure Australia as priority projects of national significance that are ready to proceed. 


But these mega transport projects are on a scale that also requires private sector contributions, so we are taking a new innovative approach which is structured around an availability payment model to attract private sector investment. We are also determined to engage with the private sector when it comes to urban road infrastructure, particularly in our biggest city of Sydney. That is why we allocated $400 million to finally get the 'missing link' between the F3 and M2 to go to market within months. We brought forward $5 million into the current financial year in order to assist with taking that project to market.


Federal Labor's investment in Australia's vital infrastructure extends well beyond the limits of our cities. Regional Australians are also big winners of the Nation Building Program, with almost two-thirds of all funding being invested in regional Australia. The program is funding a number of highway upgrade packages vital to our regions, such as the $4.1 billion 10-year package to upgrade and maintain the Bruce Highway. The budget also announced $500 million for a 10-year capital works program along the Midland Highway in Tasmania and $307 million for the Great Northern Highway in Western Australia.


Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be very pleased with the $317 million allocated for the Warrrego Highway in Queensland. Might I add: more money than National Party ministers ever allocated to the Warrego Highway in Queensland was allocated in this budget. There was $257.5 million provided for the duplication of the Princes Highway West. The budget also provides $2 billion to continue important transport safety and improvement programs, including $1.8 billion over five years for network maintenance, and an additional $100 million over five years for the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program. In addition, the budget provided $5 million to assist the Australian shipping industry to meet its future workforce training needs as well as almost $10 million for urgent safety upgrades at remote airstrips across Australia.


Federal Labor understands the importance of investing in land transport infrastructure in terms of national productivity and the liveability of our cities. We have the processes right. Now, in this budget, as well as Cross River Rail and the Melbourne Metro, we funded the two managed motorways programs in Melbourne that were identified by Infrastructure Australia. That means that all 15 projects—15 out of 15—that have been identified by Infrastructure Australia have received funding by this government. We have the process right. We have put the dollars in, the investment in, to create jobs and growth, not just now but into the future.

"Truss, Warren, MP",Nats,2013-06-06,"



Mr TRUSS
 (Wide Bay—Leader of The Nationals) (10:07):  Once again we have listened to the over-the-top rhetoric of the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. We have been listening to that for quite some time. However, this is the budget where it all comes unstuck, because the reality is that, in spite of the minister's claims, this budget actually predicts a $1.2 billion cut per year for road and raid funding under their so-called nation building 2 program, which is set to commence on 1 July 2014. A $36 billion program has on the government's own figures become a $24 billion program. Once more, even that figure is probably overblown. The minister makes big announcements about things such as the Melbourne Metro link project. He talked again just now about it being a $3 billion project. What he did not say is that there is only $75 million in the next four years to actually fund it.


He was boasting about WestConnex being a $1.8 billion project—although  we all know the Prime Minister has put conditions on that project which make it absolutely impossible for it to ever proceed—but there is only $400 million actually provided. There is not $1.8 billion—it is only $400 million. And, since the government is insisting that there be no tolls, there is about a 75 per cent gap in the funding for a project of that nature.


The reality is that there will only be $2 billion spent on the entire national highway network across the country in the first year of nation building 2 program. This is just typical of Labor's approach in other areas, where they announce big programs but they are not funded—like the NDIS, like Gonski. They announce what sound like big amounts of money, but the money is not provided. When you look at these kinds of investments, we are left with significant gaps in what is actually going to be able to be achieved. What is even more alarming is that the government seems to be manipulating the figures to make the $24 billion look as big as it is.


For instance, the department confirmed in Senate estimates last week that almost $4 billion of untied local road grants for local government is included now as a subprogram in Nation Building 2. I ask the minister, is that $4 billion included in his $24 billion announcement? In the past, that money has been dealt with in other ways. But this time the department has said that this $4 billion funding, the traditional funding that goes to local government for roads, is now part of their nation-building strategy. When you look at the program and realise that $1.5 billion of that $24 billion is coming out of the Building Australia Fund—created entirely by the previous Howard government—and when you realise that there is $2 billion being transferred out of the mining tax, the real amount allocated for road funding over the next five-year program is not $24 billion; it is about $17 billion. This will be the smallest program that we have had in this nation for a very long time in real terms.


The minister again talked about their $4.1 billion program for the Bruce Highway. We have actually had candidates out there announcing projects—including a member who I notice is in the chamber—yet the funding is not profiled in any way in the budget announcement. When asked about this in Senate estimates, the minister's department said the profiles were not available yet we have got candidates announcing that these projects are going to be built while the profile for the funding is not announced.


Of the $4.1 billion that the government says is committed to the Bruce Highway, $1.7 billion has been previously announced and $1.1 billion will not be available until after 2019—a lot of big numbers but, when you look at them, they do not seem to add up.


Since I will only get one chance to speak in this debate—because the government always manages to talk these estimates out these days—let me talk about another issue, the Moorebank Intermodal Terminal where, quite extraordinarily, the government has announced that there are to be four new board members appointed to the terminal, but the department was unable to give the names of these members during estimates. So I am now informed that these four board members have actually attended board meetings yet their names are still a secret. The government has not announced their names yet these people are already attending board meetings. This seems to be remarkable. At the department's own estimates just a few days ago, they were unable to name those people. (Time expired)

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House, Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and Minister for Regional Development and Local Government) (10:13):  The shadow minister made some extraordinary statements during that contribution. One was that the Building Australia Fund was somehow a creation of the Howard government. It was created through legislation moved by me as the minister as part of the creation of Infrastructure Australia. It is a part of the infrastructure Australia setup, something that they never did. They never set up a process and indeed they opposed the Infrastructure Australian legislation. It is complete nonsense from those opposite.


He went on to pretend that programs that are under construction with real money creating real jobs, creating real improvements in infrastructure do not exist. He should go to Rockhampton, have a look at the Yeppen roundabout, have a look at the duplication of the bridges that are under construction right now. It is not an apparition; it is real. It exists. There is steel and concrete, and there are workers and cranes working right now on the Bruce Highway.


This shadow minister was once the minister and he described the Cooroy to Curra section of the Bruce Highway as the worst section of road in Australia. He was the transport minister, it is in his electorate and he did nothing about it. Well, we have for one section of it. We promised it, funded it, built it and opened it. He did not play a role in any of those activities. I say to the shadow minister that next week I will be turning a sod on construction in his electorate. Come along—Cooroy to Curra section A, funded by us. Come along.




Mr Truss:
  You haven't invited me. You don't invite me.




Mr ALBANESE:
  You know full well that the—



Mr Truss interjecting—




Mr ALBANESE:
  You might not. You are so hopeless that you might not know that the state government—the Newman government—and your mate Jeff Seeney organise the invites. So ring up Jeff. Get yourself on the list. He might not know you exist. The state government will be looking after the sod-turning on Cooroy to Curra next Wednesday. Come along. He can say that that is not real as well, because he has gone out there and said—even when we fund projects in his own electorate—that it is not happening. Well, drive on the road. You can, because one section of it is open and the next section of construction we are funding, brought forward into this financial year, will commence construction.


Then he went on to criticise the funding that we have provided for all of these programs, including the Moorebank Intermodal Terminal. The Moorebank Intermodal Terminal is absolutely vital for Sydney's infrastructure, ensuring that we take 3,300 trucks off the road every day. You know what the opposition did? 



Mr Craig Kelly interjecting—





Mr ALBANESE:
  You see, it is really not that complex. You have a port and then you have the city of Sydney, and then you have an intermodal terminal. Here is what an intermodal does—and maybe the member for Hughes can think about this, because he has campaigned against it. His own party are supporting it, but he has campaigned against it, showing how disingenuous and unfair they are. The state government support it. Your opposition support it, because it will take trucks off the road, because you have freight moving onto rail. It is not that complex: trucks off the road, freight onto rail, rather than going through all of the streets, including in the electorate of Hughes, in order to get to its destination. The freight infrastructure investment that we have done will take nine hours off the journey on the East West Link and seven hours off the journey from Melbourne to Brisbane. Let me tell you: what he does not say is that the land and the site were chosen by the Howard government. They chose the site. Since then the coalition campaigned against it at the last election and now they are for it again. If he is fair dinkum, he will say at the next election campaign that they are actually for this vital project. We issued a release with the board members on the Moorebank Intermodal Terminal, as we do with all board appointments. (Time expired)

Ms LIVERMORE
 (Capricornia) (10:19):  Thank you, Deputy Speaker. I appreciate the opportunity to speak about this very important portfolio and what it is doing for the Central Queensland region. I was just thinking that we are not even 20 minutes into this consideration in detail and I have already lost track of the number of projects that the minister has talked about and the amount of funding that is in discussion here this morning.


I think back to consideration in detail in the nine years I spent in opposition when I would come in and be part of listening to the minister's counterpart in the Howard years, and I cannot really imagine what he would have talked about. But I know what I would have been talking about: I would have been talking about what was not happening on the Bruce Highway and what was needed in terms of this very important piece of infrastructure for the state of Queensland and indeed the entire nation.


We have heard many times from this government, and we speak about it with great pride and conviction, that since coming to power the Labor government has spent four times as much—the minister will correct me if I get this wrong—on the Bruce Highway in half the time compared to the entire spend in the time of the Howard government. That is a great figure to quote but what does it really mean when we talk about that level of investment in this very important highway? I can tell the House, and constituents of Capricornia could tell the House, that it means basically constant nonstop roadworks setting about greatly improving the Bruce Highway both north and south of Rockhampton. Go south of Gladstone and you get to the Calliope crossroads, an enormous project underway there. In the northern part of my electorate there is the southern access to Mackay, which is an extremely busy and important section of road which really doubles as the Bruce Highway but also a very vital connection between the community of Sarina and the industrial area of Hay Point, the massive coal terminal, and Paget to the south of Mackay. We have duplicated that southern access to Mackay. It was done within a couple of years of us taking government. Work improving that section of the highway continues with further overtaking lanes between Sarina and Mackay. 


Very important is the project the minister has already referred to, and you just have to laugh when the shadow minister talks about, 'They have announced this and what does it mean.' The minister has invited the shadow minister to please come to Rockhampton, although if the shadow minister comes to Rockhampton it could get very embarrassing, because so far we have had the shadow Treasurer and the opposition leader twice come to Rockhampton and fail to make a commitment, refuse to make a commitment for this extremely important project for the people of Central Queensland. This project is fixing up the Yeppen floodplains, finding a solution to this section of the Bruce Highway which we know from very painful experience in 2011 and before that in 1991 can be cut in times of flood, which cuts off Rockhampton and the entire northern half of the state for weeks at a time, causing huge disruption to our local economy, huge disruption to very important businesses right around Central Queensland and beyond. So there is work going on right now on the duplication and lifting of the Yeppen Bridge, and that is going to include very important improvements to the congestion for people having to travel in and out from Gracemere every day, something that is very important to our local area.


What comes next is what is required to really boost the flood immunity of that stretch of road. I would like the minister to talk a little more about what is in the budget for the Yeppoon South project. Even more than that, because there is so much to talk about in terms of Bruce Highway improvements, I would like the minister to talk about the Bruce Highway funding package in the budget.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House, Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and Minister for Regional Development and Local Government) (10:23):  In terms of the Bruce Highway I really want to pay tribute to the member for Capricornia over her time representing that important part of Queensland for the work that she has done. There is no greater tribute to her work and her legacy as the member, given that she has announced her retirement at the next election, than the work that has happened around the southern approaches to Rockhampton. In this budget we have brought forward funding to make sure that this southern approach can be fixed. We brought it forward to the next financial year. This goes on top of the other work that is occurring.


Already right now under construction are: the Calliope Crossroads project; the Bruce and Capricorn highways; the Yeppen roundabout; the southern approach to Mackay; the Burdekin River bridge; flattening and straightening the Bruce Highway over Cardwell Range; projects associated with the Burdekin Road safety audit; the southern approach to Cairns—where I will also be next week—straightening and widening the highway from Cabbage Tree Creek to Carman Road and across Back Creek Range; straightening the highway just south of Gin Gin; and straightening and raising the Bruce Highway between Sandy Corner and Collinson's Lagoon.


We will shortly begin the upgrade of the Pumicestone Road interchange, part of a $195 million contribution from the federal government. Over the next year, in 2013-14, we will have the Cooroy to Curra section A construction commencing with the sod turned next week; the duplication of the highway just south of Townsville between Vantassel Street and Cluden; the construction of the new interchange and replacing the existing intersections between Roy's Road and Bells Creek Road, part of a $195 million contribution; and construction of the final section of the Townsville Ring Road between Shaw Road and Mt Low.


These are the sorts of projects that have led the LNP member for Herbert to say:


I will give Labor a pat on the back and say they have spent more in their four or five years on the Bruce highway than we did before.


That is what local members who are rational say about our contribution to the Bruce Highway. There has been a total funding commitment of $5.7 billion since we came to office compared with the former government's $1.3 billion. Even those arithmetically challenged should recognise 5.7 is a lot more than 1.3. It is not just a figure though because what that means is that there are real jobs as a result of the contributions that have been made.


It compares favourably across the board because we heard before the shadow minister dismiss the $24-billion figure that we have announced already for Nation Building 2. I have no doubt there is more to come in future budgets as state governments and territory governments submit properly funded projects. He said that is a terrible figure. The former government's big trumpet under AusLink was $11.4 billion. The shadow minister says it was more than that. Maybe they got it wrong because they are not real good with numbers. But $11.4 billion was the headline in their press release for Australia's roads and railways. That was their contribution. Twenty-four is more than 11 and—that is moving forward as we receive further projects.


What we know is that investment in infrastructure produces a return in productivity, a return that leads to higher growth, a return that leads therefore to higher revenues and a return that produces outcomes in economic growth and jobs. It is the driver of our national economy. We can invest in two things: physical capital and human capital. That is why we regard infrastructure and skills of the two parts—investing in people through education and training, and investing in nation-building infrastructure. (Time expired)

Mr CHESTER
 (Gippsland) (10:29):  It is always fascinating for members on this side to receive lectures about supposedly not been good with numbers when the member for Lilley has presided over the worst deficits in Australian history. I would like to take the minister to his opening comments where he referred to the future funding priorities in his budget. In particular I want to refer to the Princes Highway, not only in my electorate but also along the south coast of New South Wales.


The minister is well aware of both my concerns and the concerns of the member for Eden-Monaro about the state of the Princes Highway. Without wishing to be political on the issue, I think the highway between Sydney and Sale has probably been neglected and ignored by governments of both political persuasions. In fact, some parts of that highway are in a deplorable state. I do acknowledge that some work has been undertaken in the Eden-Monaro area, the Bega bypass and other areas under The National Road Network as an off-network project.


My particular interest, Minister, relates to the duplication project, which has been jointly funded between Traralgon and Sale, with $140 million from the federal government and $35 million from the state. The minister would be aware that the current funding for this project is set to expire with the completion of the stage between Stammers Road and Minniedale Road. I think the minister would be aware of that. There is concern within the community, within Latrobe City Council, Wellington Shire Council and the general public about whether future funding opportunities exist for that duplication work. I understand that the cost of the project is in the order of $500 million and that $175 million has been allocated to it. So I would be interested to know: where does the Princes Highway East, Traralgon to Sale, fit in the government's future funding priorities?


The second question I would like to ask the minister relates to an issue he may well be able to clarify for me—and that is, the $20 million reprofiling that occurred, due to the EPBC Act issue, around the time of Queensland floods. I know the minister is aware of this issue. I am hoping to get some clarity about whether that funding has now flowed through to the actual project.


Perhaps more generally—and I invite the minister's comments on this particular issue—in terms of road-funding activities across Australia, I am particularly concerned about the amount of the road budget that is being redirected into issues relating to things such as the EPBC Act. The way in which we have been forced to move roads out of road reserves because of EPBC Act intervention, I think, is a concern for this government and future governments. 


From my understanding of the EPBC Act, it was really meant to relate to issues of national significance, yet we are seeing local highway duplication projects being moved out of the road reserve onto private property at significant expense to the Commonwealth and the relevant state governments. I would invite the minister's comments: how significant an issue is this for our nation? How much road money allocated to the transport department is being diverted into these environmental issues, which are sometimes quite spurious? I would invite your comments on that, Minister.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House, Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and Minister for Regional Development and Local Government) (10:32):  I thank the member for Gippsland for his considered approach to infrastructure. I acknowledge that he is one member on the other side of the House who genuinely makes representations on behalf of his electorate and who plays a constructive role in the putting forward of that funding. 


I note that the member has acknowledged that this is the first time that significant funding, $140 million from the federal Labor government and $35 million from the Victorian government, has gone into this section of the Princes Highway East. The current schedule of works is scheduled to be completed in late 2015. We have done exactly what we said we would do: duplicate the highway between Traralgon and Sale. I acknowledge that I would like more to be done and acknowledge the representations of both the member for Gippsland and the member for Eden-Monaro about these issues. 


At the other end, the Bega bypass is currently under construction, fully funded, 100 per cent, by the Commonwealth government. Not one cent has come from the New South Wales government. However, that will not stop them from turning up at media opportunities, should they arise in the future.


Labor has done substantially more than the former government did. That is not hard, because they did not put a cent into this section of the highway. There is more to be done. The current process for Nation Building Program 2 is that we have asked all of the state and territory governments to make submissions as to their funding priorities on the road and rail networks. I sat down on a number of occasions with the Victorian government, the Victorian minister, and worked out some initial priorities in terms of the major projects for Nation Building Program 2 that the Victorian government wanted. Part of that was the Melbourne Metro project that, in Minister Mulder's own words, is the No. 1 priority for Victoria. We worked out funding for that project—$3 billion from each level of government plus an availability payment model, as I said in my opening remarks—but the Victorian government appear to be stepping away from that. I must say we have had difficulties getting any cost-benefit analysis from the Victorian government for road projects such as the east-west tunnel. Their proposals talk about it beginning in the east, and there is a question about what the appropriate model is. I certainly believe in funding both road and rail projects, but it is beyond me why the Victorian government are refusing to submit this cost-benefit analysis or any business plan to the federal government, my department or to Infrastructure Australia.


I indicate to the member for Gippsland that as part of those discussions we also talked about savings that exist on current Victorian projects that were part of NB1. We have not received from the Victorian government any proposals as to where their priorities would be. But I say to the member that I would be happy to continue to work with him in a constructive way on Nation Building Program 2. We indicated very publicly, on budget night—the shadow minister seems to be surprised by this—that these are instalments for specific projects that we have included in the program.


I am a minister who argues for additional funding for infrastructure. The former government seemed to have transport ministers who just rolled over for the Liberal Party partners and did not seem to actually be able to win an argument in their party room, in the cabinet or wherever. There was a distinct lack of funding. Indeed, the last time the coalition were in office they cut $2 billion from road funding in their first budget, and their budgets never recovered from those cuts.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms Saffin
):  The question is that the proposed expenditure be agreed to. Given that there are a lot of members who want to ask questions, for the convenience of the House, if members on my right could ask questions seriatim and then not speak for so long, you will get your questions in and the minister can respond. Members on my left, I take it that the Leader of the Nationals and the honourable member for Dawson are going to ask questions? Okay. I will lead off with the member for Gellibrand.

Ms ROXON
 (Gellibrand) (10:38):  I will ask a very brief question in order to enable my colleagues to raise some of their issues, because the minister has touched briefly on the issue that I wanted to ask him about, which is for him to address further this question of infrastructure, particularly in the western suburbs of Melbourne. The lack of funding for roads by the coalition is true not just if you look at spending from our government compared with the previous, Howard government but also if you look at the last 20 or 30 years: the big infrastructure projects were funded by Labor governments.


Minister Albanese, I am wondering if you can talk a little bit more about the latest investment in the Western Ring Road, the western suburbs of Melbourne being one of the fastest growing communities in the country; and how they complement our investments in regional rail and the latest investments in the Melbourne Metro. I, perhaps cheekily, put on the record that, if the east-west tunnel—as others persist in calling it—is to go ahead, I would like to call it the west-east tunnel! I do believe, given where the particular population pressures are, that, if it were to go ahead, consideration should be given to building it from the western end rather than the eastern end. That has a long way to travel, as the minister mentioned, when work has not already been done by the state government—and you might want to address that too, Minister. But I understand my colleague is going to ask you some questions to handle together.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I thank the member for Gellibrand for her brevity.

"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,2013-06-06,"



Mr ADAMS
 (Lyons) (10:39): I take this opportunity to ask the minister some questions in relation to expenditure on transport and infrastructure in the budget appropriations. There have been some great investments in Tasmania under this Labor government—about $1.9 billion. That has been great for lifting the infrastructure which is so urgently needed and for creating great jobs. The electorate of Lyons is 50 per cent of the state of Tasmania and has most of the great highway between the south and the north. I am often referred to as 'the honest broker in the middle' and it is a title I enjoy wearing. The minister might like to outline the $500 million announced in the latest package for work on the Midland Highway and also the Launceston bypass. Planning for the new Bridgewater bridge is continuing. There is the upgrading of the Mona Vale and St. Peters Pass, one of the oldest passes in Tasmania. There is quite a bit of activity around Mona Vale—I see there is a cherry farm in that area—and between Mangalore and Bagdad. In the north towards Launceston, just past my electorate office in Perth the highway is being duplicated and upgraded between Perth and the Launceston airport roundabout. They are urgently needed upgrades, which have been put aside for too long.


When you come to Tasmania you can see much work going on in infrastructure, with all the water pipes for the Midlands Irrigation Scheme sitting beside the highway. Down in the Colebrook sportsground you can see the rail sleepers for the upgrading of the rail at Rhyndaston and there are plenty of bulldozers. With the great work done on the Brighton bypass, that town is now in the biggest growth area in Tasmania. So Minister, I ask you how you see those areas and that infrastructure coming together with the $1.9 million this government has put into infrastructure in Tasmania.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House, Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and Minister for Regional Development and Local Government) (10:43):  I thank members for their questions. Firstly, the member for Gellibrand is very conscious of the federal government's investment of $13.5 billion into Victorian infrastructure. That is a shift from $89 per head to more than $200 per Victorian. So we have more than doubled the infrastructure budget for Victoria. Concerning specific projects, we are currently investing more than $3.2 billion in the regional rail link, including through the member's electorate. Right now, there are 3,500 Australians working directly on that project as a result of that investment. Geelong, Bendigo, Ballarat and Melbourne are all benefitting. It is a very exciting project, one I have visited on a number of occasions and one which I note the federal Leader of the Opposition did not even know existed—an extraordinary proposition—when he said on Melbourne radio that the federal government does not invest in any urban rail projects, except for the Moreton Bay rail link. It is an exciting project.


The M80 has also been an absolutely critical project. We have committed some $900 million to the upgrade of the Western and the Metropolitan ring-roads. In this budget, we have added a further $525 million for that project, which is absolutely vital for the efficiency of the Victorian road system. It is an absolutely vital project for Melbourne. The important thing about the east-west—




Honourable member interjecting—





Mr ALBANESE:
  or west-east, as the member said—




Honourable member interjecting—





Mr ALBANESE:
  That is why you have a business plan; it is to work out issues—for example, with the West Gate Bridge: what is the priority for where the link should begin? We want to see it. The Victorian government say that they have got it, but they will not show it to anyone. It is quite an extraordinary proposition. I think our record in Victorian infrastructure stands in stark contrast to our predecessor's. 


In Tasmania, we have invested $1.9 billion. This, again, is almost a doubling of infrastructure spending in Tasmania. In this budget, the Midland Highway package is particularly important for the electorate of the member for Lyons. There is planning for a future Launceston bypass, duplicating the Perth to Breadalbane section, and dedicated safety upgrades at Mona Vale, St Peter's Pass, and between Mangalore and Bagdad, as well as activities to advance the Bridgewater Bridge. The Freight Rail Revitalisation project is also absolutely vital. It includes replacing approximately 290 kilometres of old rail track. This creates jobs in manufacturing as well as in the specific work that takes place there. Also, there are the commitments to the Brooker Highway, the Domain Highway, the Huon Highway and the Tasman Highway ramps. All of this adds up to a major benefit. 


Of course, the opposition have said that they can duplicate the Midland Highway for $400 million. That is just a nonsense. We have committed $500 million. We are not pretending that we will be able to duplicate the whole highway. The opposition pluck figures from nowhere. It is bit like the construction of the Hunter Expressway, which is now underway, at $1.65 billion. When the coalition said that they would do something about the expressway, they did not actually advance the project. In 2004, they said the costing was $382 million. By 2007, they said it was $1.2 billion. They just make up these figures as they go along. They hold out false hope and pretend that they can build things with an amount that they simply cannot. We have invested real dollars into real projects that are making a real difference in terms of costing. The whole duplication has been costed at $2.7 billion. That is more than $400 million. Those opposite need to stop the sort of nonsense that they go on with. We have invested real money in those real projects.

"Christensen, George, MP",Nats,2013-06-06,"



Mr CHRISTENSEN
 (Dawson) (10:48):  Deputy Speaker, I have three issues to put to the minister. The first is in relation to the upgrade of the Bruce Highway from Vantassel Street in Townsville to the Flinders Highway. The minister would know of it: $110 million was announced in the budget for this project. It was certainly something that the government was going to remove altogether to pay for the flood reconstruction in Queensland, and only after campaigning by the Liberal-National coalition was it reinstated in the budget. That was a good outcome. I have written to the minister, and I believe that the Townsville City Council has written to the minister—and perhaps the minister has also received correspondence from the Townsville Turf Club—about some issues that the community have with the upgrade of that road. I am just wondering whether the minister is aware of that and what the minister is going to do about those concerns. 


The second issue I refer to concerns the Bruce Highway. The minister and, I believe, the Prime Minister came to Rockhampton to announce a supposed $4.1 billion Bruce Highway package. We later found out that roughly $1.76 billion of that was already announced funding. This leaves around $2.4 billion to be spent over the next 10 years. 


The Department of Main Roads in Queensland has a Bruce Highway action plan where they say that $6 billion over the next 10 years is needed for the highest priority projects on that highway. The $2.4 billion that you have allocated over the next 10 years is not even half of what is needed. The minister will probably respond that all of that $1.76 billion was announced after the Bruce Highway action plan came into effect, but that answer will only really fly if the $1.76 billion in funding that has already been committed out of that $4.1 billion is for projects that are actually contained within the Bruce Highway action plan. So my second question to the ministry is whether he can assure me and indeed the House that out of that $4.1 billion that has been allocated, including the $1.76 billion that has already been allocated, all of it is going to projects that are identified in the Bruce Highway action plan. The following question is, if there cannot be an assurance there, what projects are we going to miss out on? Will the Haughton River Bridge be something we miss out on, the upgrade of Sandy Gully near Bowen, the planning for Beganga Plains in the Whitsundays be something we miss out on? 


In relation to the ring road, there was a visit by the Prime Minister on 24 April to Mackay and she announced that the ring road would be funded by the government. There were no details but she told reporters that in the budget the ring road would be included. We have got the budget before us and there is no line item mentioning the ring road whatsoever. There is no mention of the ring road in the budget. There have been indications made to journalists by the Prime Minister, by the minister and indeed by the Labor candidate in the electorate of Dawson that the ring road funding will be available in the 2013-14 financial year. I want a clear answer from the minister, a yes or a no: will the ring road funding be made available in the 2013-14 financial year?

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House, Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and Minister for Regional Development and Local Government) (10:52):  I am very pleased to get this question from the member opposite. It seems he does not understand budgets and he does not understand infrastructure the way that it happens. The Department of Main Roads Queensland, his Tory colleagues, run the projects in regard to the Vantassel Street issue that he raises, in terms of that upgrade. The process of the implementation, the management of the projects is done by the Queensland LNP government. Okay? It is not that hard, mate. You should be able to work that out. So in terms of issues with regard to specific details of construction we provide money to the Department of Main Roads, you have a contract between the federal and state governments and they then manage the project. 


With regard to the funding that is in the budget, he also does not seem to understand that what you have is line items in the budget of funding for the Bruce Highway. He has produced some ads on the Mackay ring road, which is bizarre because of the quotes he uses to say what the promise is. I read from his ad. He said that the Prime Minister said funding would be sourced from a federal infrastructure scheme known as Nation Building 2. That is the commitment of the Prime Minister.



Mr Christensen interjecting—




Mr ALBANESE:
  According to you. This is your ad. The broken promise he says is Infrastructure Australia are now in a position to release a preliminary schedule of new projects to be funded and delivered over the five-year life of our next nation building program, which is Nation Building 2. We said we would fund it under Nation Building 2. Your ad says Nation Building 2—

  I withdraw. That is a compliment. 2014-15 to 2018-19. It is there in your ad. You cannot help some people. We already have funding to progress the planning. Funding is already there for the community consultation for the Mackay ring road, which I announced in Mackay, which closes next month.




Mr Christensen:
  It's already underway, mate.




Mr ALBANESE:
  We're funding it, you nong! We're funding it!



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Minister, will you not use that language. Withdraw.




Mr ALBANESE:
  I withdraw. It is not that complex, mate, and you should talk to the member for Gippsland about the way that he approaches infrastructure investment in his seat. He makes approaches, as a member of the National Party. He gives credit when it is there; he says, 'This is a good thing for my electorate,' and he asks for more. That is what he does. That is what a good local member does.


You have got money for planning—$10 million, and not a cent from the state government but totally funded by us, to do the planning. We have released, now, for community consultation, the proposed route. That is out there. As to the community consultation, that funding has already been provided under Nation Building 1. We have a program for the Mackay ring road: planning in Nation Building 1, and then construction in Nation Building 2. That is what the Prime Minister said. That is what is there.


And in yesterday's state budget, 85 per cent of the $690 million the Queensland government said was being committed to the Bruce Highway is funding from us—85 per cent is from the federal government.



Mr Christensen interjecting—




Mr ALBANESE:
  And you have not promised a zack, a cent, of funding for the Bruce Highway, but you come in here and get critical about funding for your electorate! You are one of the only members of parliament I have ever seen in the entire time I have been here, 17 years, who have complained about funding being in your electorate. You have campaigned against it, and you need to do your job. (Time expired)

  It will indeed be a quick question. I want to note, in the minister's comments today, not just the significant amounts of money that are being invested, and not just the vision and a deep understanding of investment for the benefit of the nation, for our productivity and our future, but the constant awareness of the reality that these projects create jobs.


I come from a family steeped in construction. The first photographs I have of me, Minister, are of me sitting on top of a D9, a great big bulldozer, when my father was helping build the Bradfield Highway. And I was delighted to climb onto a Hitachi excavator in the electorate just last week for the announcement of the Gosford passing loops and that $146 million project.


But my questions go particularly today to the F3-M2, because this is a critical piece of infrastructure, and also to the widening of the exits and sections of the F3, which will improve not only the safety of people from the Central Coast in travelling to and from Sydney but also their lifestyle, by helping them to be able to get home. So this is part of a great national investment, and I would like to hear more from the Minister about the F3-M2.

 (Grayndler—Leader of the House, Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and Minister for Regional Development and Local Government) (10:59):  To wrap up this series, the F3 to M2 is an absolutely vital project. It effectively will be the Sydney bypass. It means that vehicles can go from the south, head north via the M7 and M2 and on to what has been the missing link. It is a vital project. We sat down constructively with the New South Wales government and with Transurban and got this done. Without the federal government's $400-million investment, it simply would not have happened. The previous government did lots of studies but no action. On top of that we have the F3 upgrades we announced with the Prime Minister and the member for Robertson. It will make a huge difference to the Central Coast.


It appears that the Queensland state government is against investment in Brisbane because, in the budget they handed down yesterday, they failed to put any money into the Gateway North project at all. They have only put $5 million into the next section of the Ipswich motorway and they failed to put any funding at all into the Cross River rail project, which is absolutely vital in dealing with congestion. Indeed they have come up with quite an innovative plan.


A new rail crossing across the river would ensure that people not just in Brisbane but people on the Sunshine Coast and on the Gold Coast and everywhere in between could benefit. Four new rail stations were also envisaged. But after writing to us and making a number of requests—all of which were agreed to—and after exchanging letters in writing about this project, they walked away from it under pressure from the federal coalition.


The Queensland state government have come up with another unique and innovative plan. They plan to rip the seats out of the existing trains and make people stand on the train so they can squeeze more people in. I am sure they will have an employment project just like you see in Tokyo whereby people with gloves will be charged with pushing people, cramming them like sardines, on to the trains.



Honourable members interjecting—




Mr ALBANESE:
  As member the for Moreton suggested, that might be stage 2 of the solution from the Queensland state government.


What we now know about the Moreton Bay regional rail link is that all contracts which have not been entered into on public transport projects are under threat from the federal coalition should they be elected. The Cross River rail project was first promised in the Queensland parliament in 1895. The whole of the next century went through without a commitment. It took the current federal Labor government, largely due to the campaign by the member for Petrie over and over again, to make this a reality. It has begun but I am very concerned that the project is under threat because of the statements on the record from the coalition, which is they do not believe in any investment in public transport. To quote the Leader of the Opposition, they should 'stick to their knitting', which consists of minor road funding in marginal electorates. It was what the record was previously. There should be no funding.


They and the Leader of the National Party have made it very clear that they do not believe in sticking to commitments where contracts have not been entered into. They have made it very clear that is their position. We know in spite of the fact that there are so many people on the record, including the Premier of Queensland and the transport minister, supporting the Cross River rail project but it is not going ahead. I think other projects would be under threat as well. The only way to ensure proper infrastructure funding for South-East Queensland as well as for the whole of regional Queensland, including the Bruce Highway, is with the re-election of the Labor government. (Time expired)




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms Saffin

Mr ALBANESE:
  Just before you do that, Madam Deputy Speaker, I table the ad placed by the member for Dawson. It is such a cracker of an ad! I am prepared to table a coalition ad because it is so absurd.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (11:05):  The government is making the choice to keep our economy strong and to invest in our future. The Australian economy, by international standards, continues to perform extraordinarily well. We have a low debt-to-GDP ratio, one of the lowest in the developed world. We have strong employment, with the unemployment rate having a five at the front of it. Our economy has grown by 14 per cent since the global financial crisis, while Europe's economy has shrunk and the US economy has grown by just a couple of percentage points. The Australian stock market has grown strongly and the Australian economy is a standout performer on the international stage.


The government has recognised the challenges that the high Australian dollar places on our public finances. So the 2013-14 budget charts a pathway to return to balance in 2015-16 and to surplus by 2016-17, improving the sustainability of Australia's public finances and building on Australia's record of fiscal and economic strength. The priorities of the budget are providing schoolchildren with the opportunities to reach their full potential, with $9.8 billion invested in new school funding; providing support for people with severe and permanent disability through the historic $14.3 billion investment in DisabilityCare Australia; and providing critical infrastructure, as we heard in the previous portfolio's consideration in detail, with $24 billion of new investment in road and rail.


The budget charts a path to surplus, although the hit to revenues will see a budget deficit in 2013-14. The budget continues the government's record of identifying strategic savings rather than making savage cuts. While those opposite would cut back vital services that Australians depend on, while they would raise superannuation taxes on low-income workers, we on this side of the House have a different set of priorities. The coalition believe it is appropriate to take away money from children on their first day of school—




Mr Briggs:
  Madam Deputy Speaker Saffin, I raise a point of order on relevance. I understand this is the parliamentary secretary's first attempt at a consideration-in-detail stage of portfolio expenditure, but he should confine his remarks to the budget papers, as I understand it. Talking about the opposition, telling fibs about the opposition, does not relate to the budget papers for the forward estimates—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms Saffin
):  The member for Mayo will resume his seat. 




Mr Briggs:
  so, if he could confine his remarks to the budget papers, that would be terrific.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Mayo will take his seat. There is no point of order, and I think the honourable member for Mayo knows that.




Dr LEIGH:
  The budget makes $43 billion of savings across the forward estimates, continuing a legacy of making responsible savings so that we can fund necessary investments. The government has chosen a sensible path of consolidation, maintaining strong growth and low unemployment while ensuring that Australia's debt levels are among the lowest in the developed world. Through these investments in the National Plan for School Improvement, DisabilityCare Australia, the National Health Reform Agreement and aged care, the government is ensuring that Australia is a stronger and more socially cohesive nation. 


On the topic of aged-care investments, it was my pleasure recently to join the Minister for Mental Health and Ageing in my own electorate to speak with local residents about the importance of aged-care reform. This is just one of many consultations the government has held on aged-care reform. 


The government's investments keep to our medium-term fiscal strategy, a fiscal strategy that has remained unchanged since the government's first budget in 2008-09—and that is, to achieve budget surpluses, on average, over the medium term; to keep taxation as a share of GDP, on average, below the level from 2007-08; and to improve the government's net financial worth over the medium term. While we have seen significant hits to revenue, the government has continued to hue to that path.


For the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, there are three new measures in the 2013-2014 budget, with a total fiscal impact of $112 million over four years. The government will provide $13.8 million over four years to the department to maintain existing organisational capacity and to support the government's critical initiatives and reform agenda. There will be $97.5 million over three years to support the G20 meetings in Queensland, in 2014, and there will be $0.65 million over three years to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to support Australia's membership of the United Nations Security Council.

Mr BRIGGS
 (Mayo) (11:11):  Firstly, given the seniority of the cabinet minister at the table—and I appreciate him being here—I might ask the questions I have in relation to the Social Inclusion Unit and get the minister to respond before asking some questions of the parliamentary secretary in relation to the Prime Minister and Cabinet portfolio.


The coalition thinks that all Australians deserve the best opportunity at the life they wish to pursue. That is why we have announced a series of policies as part of our real solutions plan, to ensure people have those opportunities over the coming months. Where we find a little inconsistency is when the government has this so-called Social Inclusion Unit but seeks publicly to denigrate Australians it does not agree with. I refer in this respect to the terrific and remarkable contribution last week by the member for Batman in his speech to the parliament announcing his retirement, in which he made the point: 'We should be about creating opportunities for all Australians, not pursuing our pointless class rhetoric.'


How does a minister justify having a Social Inclusion Unit at the same time as the Treasurer of the country seeks to pursue, it would seem daily, this class warfare rhetoric in the parliament and outside by targeting Australians because of their success? How is that consistent with establishing this so-called Social Inclusion Unit and, in so doing, spending millions of dollars? Equally, Minister, can you outline to the parliament how much funding has been allocated to the Social Inclusion Unit over the forward estimates? How much of that funding has been allocated to the board as well as to the unit itself? How many people are currently employed within the Social Inclusion Unit? And what is the total expenditure so far in 2012-13 for this unit?

Mr BUTLER
 (Port Adelaide—Minister for Mental Health and Ageing, Minister for Housing and Homelessness, Minister for Social Inclusion and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Mental Health Reform) (11:13):  I thank the member for Mayo for his question and his interest in the concepts of social inclusion and for giving me the opportunity to talk a little bit about that and to answer, as best I can, his questions and maybe take on notice some of the more specific questions about dollars.


The government, since we came to power in 2007-08, thought it was important to have a social inclusion approach to government. I will talk a bit about the precise focus of that agenda, because I am not sure the member for Mayo has completely understood the idea of the social inclusion agenda, at least from our government's perspective. 


Social inclusion, essentially, is about a fair go for all Australians. But taking particular account of the fact that, in spite of our extraordinary economic success over the periods of the Hawke government, the Keating government, the Howard government and our government since 2007, 21 years of uninterrupted economic growth which, as the parliamentary secretary eloquently said, has been the envy of the advanced economies around the world, that rising tide has simply not lifted all ships. We know through research that there remain around 600,000 adults in Australia who experience multiple points of disadvantage, by which I mean that it is not just that they are experiencing poverty or it is not just that they are experiencing disability or it is not just that they are experiencing unstable housing or perhaps homelessness. It is that they are experiencing a whole range of those disadvantages. 


The Social Inclusion Agenda recognises two things: 1) that any country worth its salt needs to continue to focus on ensuring that, in our case, those Australians have the opportunity enjoyed by all others to participate in this country's success; and 2) that some of the traditional approaches to dealing with disadvantage are simply not working for that group. By that I mean that traditionally what we have done for someone experiencing poverty is to give them an income support program. What we have done for someone experiencing mental illness or disability is to give them some mental health support, and what we have done for someone experiencing housing issues is to give them housing support. Where people are dealing with multiple points of disadvantage we recognise there is an obligation on government and delivery agencies funded by government to work more in a joined-up way so that rather than those Australians having to go forum shopping with eight or 10 different agencies, they are given an approach that is centred upon them rather than centred upon different government agencies or different NGOs.


The member for Mayo will see that through a number of different reform initiatives pursued by this government. In my area of mental health, the Partners in Recovery program, which seeks to support some of the most chronically and seriously unwell in our community, is deliberately a joined-up program that seeks to bring together often eight or 10 different agencies that are providing support to these 60,000 or so Australians and ensure that the agencies work through one centralised support program rather than expecting those Australians and their families or carers to go shopping time and time again for different supports from different agencies. That is the purpose of our Social Inclusion Agenda. 


I think the member for Mayo has slightly misunderstood the idea of social inclusion and taken a much broader sweep than we are intending to do through our agenda. Be very clear, our agenda on social inclusion is focused on those Australians experiencing the most intractable disadvantage. We receive very good advice and support from the Social Inclusion Board. Their How Australia is faring report is one of the best reports to bring together a range of different sources of evidence and research to understand better what is driving that level of disadvantage among those Australians—the extent to which it is locality based, the extent to which it focuses around poor health and disability. We know through those research pieces that these are the surest paths into intractable disadvantage, but we also understand that the surest path out of that disadvantage is training and employment. I appreciate the advice we have received from the Social Inclusion Board. I will take on notice the particular questions about the dollars that the member for Mayo has asked me and I thank him again for his interest in this very important policy agenda.

Ms HALL
 (Shortland) (11:18):  I would like to start my contribution, prior to asking the minister the question I have, by thanking him very much for visiting my electorate last week and for the Social Inclusion report that has been done on Wyong Shire Council, and particularly the area he visited which is extremely disadvantaged. It is an area that will benefit enormously from the government's contribution in the area of social inclusion. I particularly thank him for meeting with a number of young people on the issue of mental health and the need for mental health resources in a very poor and isolated area. The report on Wyong Shire has shown just how people in that area have missed out. The concept of social inclusion is very important. It is not playing one group against another; it is making sure that everybody in our society has an opportunity.


The government has invested substantially in improved mental health services over the last five years, culminating in a record $2.2 billion package of reforms announced in the budget, which are now being successfully implemented across Australia. We all just need to look at our electorates to see how successful it has been. We express our thanks to the government, at least on this side of the House. A key part of that reform package was to establish a new mental health commission, to bring better transparency and to report on performance to our mental health service and in our entire mental health system. The budget continues the government support for funding of the National Mental Health Commission and the commission continues to be funded through the Prime Minister's office. Could the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Mental Health Reform inform the chamber  how this funding will be used and what progress the commission has made already? I also invite the minister to reflect on the leadership of the commission, especially given the recent announcement by Robin Kruk AM about her intention to resign from the Australian Public Service.

Mr BUTLER
 (Port Adelaide—Minister for Mental Health and Ageing, Minister for Housing and Homelessness, Minister for Social Inclusion and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Mental Health Reform) (11:20):  I thank the member for Shortland for her question. For the benefit of the chamber, I am sworn as the  Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Mental Health Reform so that I can be sworn to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet because that is where the National Mental Health Commission is situated as an agency, for reasons I will explain shortly.


I thank the  member for Shortland for hosting me last week in her beautiful electorate, for the events we were able to hold there and for the discussions particularly that we were able to have with an incredibly impressive and resilient group of young people in San Remo. This is a group of young people who have been through pretty tough times in family circumstances dealing with mental health issues, who advocated very clearly and forcefully the need for mental health services in the northern part of the Wyong Shire. The strip from the Central Coast up to Newcastle is well serviced by headspace services. The headspace Gosford service, now called headspace Central Coast, is one of the oldest headspaces and one of the most professional services we have in the country. Deb there is a great leader of headspace, not just in that part of New South Wales but around the country. We were able to open headspace Newcastle last week as well. 


The arguments were forcefully made that there perhaps is the need for us to consider some support for the northern Wyong Shire Council, nestled between Gosford and Newcastle. I was particularly struck by some of the arguments made by young people, their parents, their teachers, their high school principals and, in some cases, their grandparents about the particular social circumstances of that part of the Shortland electorate. There are relatively speaking low rates of car ownership impacting on someone's capacity to drive to Gosford or to Newcastle. The relatively low rates of internet connection restrains a young person's ability to tap into our investments in e-headspace and other mental health initiatives. That for me was a very powerful discussion and again I thank you for that.


As your question intimates, the National Mental Health Commission is structurally a very important part of our mental health reform agenda. I want to place on record that the idea of mental health reform and the need to improve mental health services has happily been a bipartisan idea for several years. We differ sometimes on the details of that effort, but I am very pleased that, from the community's point of view, that is seen as a bipartisan obligation on all governments—Commonwealth or state.


As I was developing the reform agenda to take to cabinet for the 2011 budget process, I heard very forcefully from mental health academics but also and most importantly from consumers and carers that they wanted a body like the National Mental Health Commission, for two reasons. They wanted an agency at arm's length from government that would report without fear or favour on the performance of our mental health services. We have reported now for more than 20 years in this country in minute detail the number of beds we have in the mental health system, the number of staff we have in the system, but we have not been good at reporting on outcomes. We have not been good at reporting on the degree to which those investments through taxpayer dollars change people's lives and help them recover from their illness, help them connect back with their families and communities, back to work, back into stable housing and so on.


That is the message I heard most clearly from consumers and carers, and that is the job of the National Mental Health Commission. They have done it marvellously well in their first year. The report card that they released just before Christmas put a spotlight—I think for the first time—on the extraordinary physical health disadvantage that, particularly, people with severe mental illness experience. Their life expectancy gap—the gap between their life expectancy and the average—is almost 30 years. The only other group in the Australian community that experiences a similar life expectancy gap is Indigenous Australians. I think that was a very powerful piece of work, and they also put the spotlight back on the use of seclusion and restraint, particularly in state mental health systems.


Robyn Kruk has been a great leader of this commission. She is a former New South Wales Director General of Premier and Cabinet and director general of the health service. She has held senior positions in the APS. She has announced her retirement from the APS, and consequently the position of head of the commission, in the past several weeks. I want to place on record her work in setting up the commission to be, I think, a long-term benefit to the Australian community.

Mr BRIGGS
 (Mayo) (11:26):  I want to acknowledge the minister's comments just then, acknowledging that this has been a bipartisan commitment. I thank him for that. It has been. The shadow minister for health has pursued these issues with vigour in the last few years, and the Leader of the Opposition also. I also acknowledge the minister's commitment. In my own electorate he has met with groups and attempted to solve some of the challenges that I think there are, particularly in regional mental health issues. You would know yourself, Madam Deputy Speaker Saffin, that they are a different set of issues and are very hard to fix. I know the minister has put some attention on that, and we appreciate that. I am not sure we have yet got it right, so it is an issue which we need to continue to focus on.


I want to turn my attention to the administration of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, particularly with the parliamentary secretary here. Some of the machinery aspects of government which I think are important have been downplayed by ministers in this place this week, but I think they are substantially important to the operations of an effective executive government. During the Howard years, of which I had some experience as a staff member, there was a focus on ensuring the proper process was always followed—certainly from the Prime Minister, who very much respected the office that he held and the processes and traditions of that office. What has become apparent this week in estimates and in questioning in this place is that it seems that there are a series of ministers, through the chaos and dysfunction of the events of March this year, who have not received their charter letter from the Prime Minister.


For those unfamiliar with it, a charter letter is the letter which in effect is a job description for the minister. It outlines what it is the minister is responsible for, acts and the expectations of the minister. In the Howard years, the Prime Minister would have a session with each minister every 12 months to go through the charter letter and work through whether the outcomes that he expected to be achieved in the portfolio area to further the government's agenda were indeed being achieved. It was a very important letter for internally holding ministers to account to ensure that the aims and the pursuit of the policy direction of the government—which is usually announced at the beginning of a term in the Governor-General's speech—were being achieved.


It strikes me as quite remarkable that the Minister for Human Services, who is responsible in this budget for $157 billion worth of payments—the agency of human services is responsible for $157 billion worth of payments which Australians rely on, whether it be pensions, childcare payments, payments in relation to family tax benefit or Medicare rebates; you name it, they are responsible for it—does not have a charter letter from the chaos and dysfunction of March. There was no charter letter. It was then revealed in the portfolio of the minister for social and community services, Minister Macklin, that she does not have a charter letter. I presume the minister for mental health and other issues has a charter letter.


After that short preamble, my questions to the parliamentary secretary are as follows. How many ministers have not received their charter letter? Will they get the charter letter prior to the government entering into its caretaker period, which is about 78 days away? Have the Prime Minister and her department drafted those letters yet? Is this stuck in the in-tray? Do they intend to put some urgency to it? Can the parliamentary secretary update us on these matters?

Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (11:30):  I thank the member for Mayo for his questions. He raises an important question of proper process, the details of which I am happy to take on notice and supply to him. But I share his commitment to proper processes and have great faith in the diligence of public servants, not just in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet but in other departments as well. 


This government has a strong commitment to reform and a strong commitment to ensuring that proper processes are followed. That is why under this government we have seen a continued series of important reforms making a difference in people's lives. We have seen the development of the National Broadband Network, DisabilityCare Australia, a profit based mining tax and a price on carbon pollution—any single one of which policy developments, under other governments, might have taken the entire attention of the government. Yet this government has managed each of those reforms in the context of a global financial crisis and the unusual perfect storm of a high Australian dollar and a fall-off in commodity prices. The government's commitment to reform remains steadfast, as does our commitment to public servants. It is not for this side of the House to be slashing 20,000 jobs out of the Public Service. We have great faith in the Public Service. It is the view of this side of parliament—




Mr Briggs:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. This was an issue raised about when the Prime Minister was going to send charter letters to her ministers who have not received them. Talking about the opposition's plans to live within our means and to ensure that we have got a Public Service which is operating efficiently—and this instance shows quite clearly that it is not—has not got anything to do with the question I asked.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. DGH Adams
):  As I understand it, the question time rules do not apply. The parliamentary secretary's response is appropriate if it is relevant to the parliamentary secretary's portfolio.




Dr LEIGH:
  Thank you, Deputy Speaker, for that ruling. I share your view that someone who is focused upon the importance of proper rules and proper process should also be aware of the rules and processes of this place and the rules that govern consideration in detail.


I will conclude by saying that this government has a strong record of working constructively with the Public Service. We recognise the great reforming work that public servants do. That is why we are committed to a strong Public Service. That is why this side of parliament will never resort to the sorts of attacks upon public servants that we see from members of the opposition, which are so regrettable because of the great work that is done by public servants to build a stronger and more cohesive nation.

"Owens, Julie, MP",ALP,2013-06-06,"



Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (11:34):  I have a couple of questions for the minister on the not-for-profit reform agenda. I spent a number of years—in fact a couple of decades—of my life working in the not-for-profit sector and have extraordinary regard for the people that work in it, largely from firsthand experience. I got into it as a piano player—a repetiteur in the opera company, coaching singers in their roles—in my early 20s, and I spent the next nearly three decades in it before going into business on my own. It is filled with people who can start with a blank piece of paper and can identify some of the most extraordinarily large problems and chip away at them, on the smell of an oily rag. If you want to see efficiency, look at the not-for-profit sector. They achieve the most extraordinary things with very little money quite often.


But one of the things you also notice when you work in that sector is the amount of time you spend applying to government and, particularly, reporting to government. If you are a large organisation, you might apply for funding across six states and territories plus to the Commonwealth government and local councils, and you might apply to several departments in each of those places. So it is not unusual when you are reporting to have to provide anywhere from three to six copies of annual reports even three years back. In my office we had a shelf of annual reports each year for the last three years, a shelf of constitutions and a shelf of folders that contained things like certificates of cooperation. Several times a year you would send not an envelope off to a government department but a box of stuff.


When applying for grants there is also the need to continually establish your bona fides. There is an incredible amount of repetitive red tape to supply to different bodies and different levels of government. I was really pleased to see the work done by the Labor government in reducing that red tape. It started to rationalise how the not-for-profit sector relates to government, particularly with its exchange of information. I know that incredible work has been done, but I would really like an update on the progress of that reform agenda and the recent achievements in reducing red tape and simplifying Commonwealth grants programs for those who apply for them.


The second matter for me is the issue of gags. Between the years of 2004 and 2007 when I was representing Parramatta in opposition I saw first-hand some of the ramifications of the Howard government's gag clauses. In fact, I went to a forum in this house run by one of the members of the now opposition called 'Participatory democracy: a threat to democracy'. The forum was actually about a view that people in the not-for-profit sector who are representing a community but are not elected by the people are a corruption in democracy. It was actually quite scary. It was filled with Liberal members. I was the only one in the room who was not a Liberal member. I saw the impact of that view in my community when we had organisations representing some of the most vulnerable people in the community who did not feel that they had the right to speak on their behalf. It is my view, and I know it is the government's view, that a good government should be brave enough to feed the hand that bites it. It is the job of the not-for-profit sector to identify problems as they emerge at the coalface, make those well known and speak very, very loudly for those who are not able to speak for themselves.


I know that the Campbell Newman government has reintroduced gag clauses. I know that the Barry O'Farrell government is talking about reintroducing them. I know that the Labor government abolished Howard's gag clauses as one of its first actions in 2008. I would just like the minister to advise the chamber on recent announcements on the gag clauses both from the Commonwealth and from other governments and to inform the House about the impact of those announcements on the freedom of the not-for-profit sector to advocate for policy reform on behalf of some of the most vulnerable people in the community.

I remember walking past the Great Hall when she was rehearsing Rachmaninoff's piano concerto No. 2, which is an extraordinarily difficult piece.




Honourable member interjecting—





Mr BUTLER:
  No—a drummer. I have no particular musical sense. I have some vague sense of rhythm but no sense of tune!


I thank the member for Parramatta. I also thank her for hosting me on a number of occasions in the electorate of Parramatta to meet with some fantastic not-for-profit organisations, the latest of which was when we met with the Evolve Housing organisation, which is a wonderful community housing organisation in the west of Sydney.


I also want to place on record my thanks to the member for Parramatta for her chairing of the House Standing Committee on Economics inquiry into the ACNC, the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission, which is a centrepiece of the government's not-for-profit reform agenda. We have a very strong and firm view that not-for-profit reform is one of the outstanding pieces of microeconomic reform. By 'outstanding' I mean that it is one of those pieces of microeconomic reform that is still to be done. In many respects the ACNC reforms, and a number of other reforms associated with them, mirror the reforms that the Hawke government drove in the late 1980s, in the corporations sector, to do away with the myriad of reporting obligations that corporations back then had to comply with at Commonwealth and state levels. 


The not-for-profit reform sector constitutes about 600,000 organisations. It is responsible for, or employs, about eight per cent of Australia's workforce. It engages about five million, or five-sixths, of the entire Australian volunteer workforce. It contributes—at last count, which is a little bit out of date—about $43 billion to Australia's GDP, which makes it a larger economic contributor to Australia than agriculture and tourism, just to name a couple of other industries. This is a very substantial part of Australia's economy and workforce. 


But perhaps even more importantly, its value is inestimable in terms of its social contribution. All of us as local members of parliament and as members of the Australian community, come across, every day, NFP NGO organisations working with paid staff and with volunteers who are teaching young kids to play footie or engage in surf lifesaving, or delivering some of the most important social services to support some of the most vulnerable members of our community.


In addition to establishing the ACNC we recognise the government's role as a good citizen—as an organisation which contracts with many tens of thousands of not-for-profit organisations who, as I have said, deliver some of these incredibly important services to the Australian community. And I think we have an obligation to be a good citizen in that respect. 


It concerned me, as a line agency minister to a number of departments, the number of contracts that we have with the NFP sector that run for only 12 months; the number of contracts which are renewed only very late in the financial year, which creates great uncertainty for those organisations and their staff; and the number of contracts which do not see timely acquittals. I think we have a very important obligation, regardless of the political flavour of the party in government at the time, to ensure that we are a good purchaser of services from these NGOs.

Mr BRIGGS
 (Mayo) (11:55):  The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet obviously plays an extremely significant role across government activities. In the short time remaining, I am interested in asking the parliamentary secretary—he probably does not have full details—whether he can enlighten the parliament a bit more, given this is a very quickly moving story. Yesterday, at the end of question time, the Prime Minister announced that there would be a review or an inquiry into the events surrounding the placement of a convicted Egyptian Islamic jihadi terrorist in the low-detention facility in the Adelaide Hills for seven months, with the Department of Immigration and Citizenship knowingly having that person there, before the person was moved into high security at Villawood on 17 April, after the West Australian newspaper raised the issue. 


As I said, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet traditionally plays a cross-portfolio role in these sorts of issues and usually establishes a group which, from the public service side, leads inquiries, or the secretariat or support, and provides advice and so forth. I am wondering whether, at this stage, given the government has announced its review, it has worked through the details of what the department's commitment on assisting this review will be, to ensure that the full facts are revealed about why this convicted Islamic terrorist was put into the Inverbrackie facility, which the department of immigration knew, and no action was taken to move that person until this was made public. Given the revelations the minister for immigration made in this place during the week—that the minister was not advised, and then subsequently updated the parliament that the previous minister was advised—obviously the Prime Minister’s department will play an important role in bringing all of this together as a cross-portfolio function. Can the parliamentary secretary tell us, in the short time remaining, how much work has gone into preparing for the inquiry that was announced yesterday and how many resources will be allocated to it?

Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (11:58):  I thank the honourable member for Mayo for his question. The inquiry that was announced yesterday will be conducted by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, not the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. The independent Inspector- General of Intelligence and Security will focus attention on making sure that information is shared appropriately. But I would reinforce the point that the Prime Minister made in the House yesterday—that the individual in question was in detention at all times. That is an important factor for all members of the House to be aware of. 


It is vital that this House is not misled on this matter. It has, I think, been disappointing to see the opposition opposing the independent investigation by the Inspector-General, who has legal authority to conduct such an inquiry, and instead calling for an inquiry by a parliamentary committee that does not have authority to have such an inquiry. It is disappointing and it does speak, I think, to the opposition's willingness to use the important issue of national security as a political football.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House, Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and Minister for Regional Development and Local Government) (10:02):  The 2013-14 budget not only continues to roll out federal Labor's Nation Building Program but begins identifying future funding priorities. This budget continues the achievements of the first phase of the program, with the final instalment of $5.7 billion in 2013-14. Already we have doubled the federal roads budget. We have increased investment in rail tenfold. We have committed more to urban public transport since 2007 than all previous governments combined since Federation. In this budget we announced more additional investment in urban public transport than any previous budget since Federation. 


The budget announced $24 billion for the next phase of the Nation Building Program, which commences in 2014-15, taking the total program to a record $60 billion. This is the largest capital works program in the nation's history, and the new projects announced in the budget build on this. In the budget, we provided $715 million towards the construction of the Brisbane Cross River Rail, and $3 billion for the Melbourne Metro. Both of these projects have been identified by Infrastructure Australia as priority projects of national significance that are ready to proceed. 


But these mega transport projects are on a scale that also requires private sector contributions, so we are taking a new innovative approach which is structured around an availability payment model to attract private sector investment. We are also determined to engage with the private sector when it comes to urban road infrastructure, particularly in our biggest city of Sydney. That is why we allocated $400 million to finally get the 'missing link' between the F3 and M2 to go to market within months. We brought forward $5 million into the current financial year in order to assist with taking that project to market.


Federal Labor's investment in Australia's vital infrastructure extends well beyond the limits of our cities. Regional Australians are also big winners of the Nation Building Program, with almost two-thirds of all funding being invested in regional Australia. The program is funding a number of highway upgrade packages vital to our regions, such as the $4.1 billion 10-year package to upgrade and maintain the Bruce Highway. The budget also announced $500 million for a 10-year capital works program along the Midland Highway in Tasmania and $307 million for the Great Northern Highway in Western Australia.


Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be very pleased with the $317 million allocated for the Warrrego Highway in Queensland. Might I add: more money than National Party ministers ever allocated to the Warrego Highway in Queensland was allocated in this budget. There was $257.5 million provided for the duplication of the Princes Highway West. The budget also provides $2 billion to continue important transport safety and improvement programs, including $1.8 billion over five years for network maintenance, and an additional $100 million over five years for the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program. In addition, the budget provided $5 million to assist the Australian shipping industry to meet its future workforce training needs as well as almost $10 million for urgent safety upgrades at remote airstrips across Australia.


Federal Labor understands the importance of investing in land transport infrastructure in terms of national productivity and the liveability of our cities. We have the processes right. Now, in this budget, as well as Cross River Rail and the Melbourne Metro, we funded the two managed motorways programs in Melbourne that were identified by Infrastructure Australia. That means that all 15 projects—15 out of 15—that have been identified by Infrastructure Australia have received funding by this government. We have the process right. We have put the dollars in, the investment in, to create jobs and growth, not just now but into the future.

"Truss, Warren, MP",Nats,2013-06-06,"



Mr TRUSS
 (Wide Bay—Leader of The Nationals) (10:07):  Once again we have listened to the over-the-top rhetoric of the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. We have been listening to that for quite some time. However, this is the budget where it all comes unstuck, because the reality is that, in spite of the minister's claims, this budget actually predicts a $1.2 billion cut per year for road and raid funding under their so-called nation building 2 program, which is set to commence on 1 July 2014. A $36 billion program has on the government's own figures become a $24 billion program. Once more, even that figure is probably overblown. The minister makes big announcements about things such as the Melbourne Metro link project. He talked again just now about it being a $3 billion project. What he did not say is that there is only $75 million in the next four years to actually fund it.


He was boasting about WestConnex being a $1.8 billion project—although  we all know the Prime Minister has put conditions on that project which make it absolutely impossible for it to ever proceed—but there is only $400 million actually provided. There is not $1.8 billion—it is only $400 million. And, since the government is insisting that there be no tolls, there is about a 75 per cent gap in the funding for a project of that nature.


The reality is that there will only be $2 billion spent on the entire national highway network across the country in the first year of nation building 2 program. This is just typical of Labor's approach in other areas, where they announce big programs but they are not funded—like the NDIS, like Gonski. They announce what sound like big amounts of money, but the money is not provided. When you look at these kinds of investments, we are left with significant gaps in what is actually going to be able to be achieved. What is even more alarming is that the government seems to be manipulating the figures to make the $24 billion look as big as it is.


For instance, the department confirmed in Senate estimates last week that almost $4 billion of untied local road grants for local government is included now as a subprogram in Nation Building 2. I ask the minister, is that $4 billion included in his $24 billion announcement? In the past, that money has been dealt with in other ways. But this time the department has said that this $4 billion funding, the traditional funding that goes to local government for roads, is now part of their nation-building strategy. When you look at the program and realise that $1.5 billion of that $24 billion is coming out of the Building Australia Fund—created entirely by the previous Howard government—and when you realise that there is $2 billion being transferred out of the mining tax, the real amount allocated for road funding over the next five-year program is not $24 billion; it is about $17 billion. This will be the smallest program that we have had in this nation for a very long time in real terms.


The minister again talked about their $4.1 billion program for the Bruce Highway. We have actually had candidates out there announcing projects—including a member who I notice is in the chamber—yet the funding is not profiled in any way in the budget announcement. When asked about this in Senate estimates, the minister's department said the profiles were not available yet we have got candidates announcing that these projects are going to be built while the profile for the funding is not announced.


Of the $4.1 billion that the government says is committed to the Bruce Highway, $1.7 billion has been previously announced and $1.1 billion will not be available until after 2019—a lot of big numbers but, when you look at them, they do not seem to add up.


Since I will only get one chance to speak in this debate—because the government always manages to talk these estimates out these days—let me talk about another issue, the Moorebank Intermodal Terminal where, quite extraordinarily, the government has announced that there are to be four new board members appointed to the terminal, but the department was unable to give the names of these members during estimates. So I am now informed that these four board members have actually attended board meetings yet their names are still a secret. The government has not announced their names yet these people are already attending board meetings. This seems to be remarkable. At the department's own estimates just a few days ago, they were unable to name those people. (Time expired)




Mr Chester:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. During the shadow minister's comments, the minister made an unparliamentary interjection. I would ask him to withdraw.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I am not aware. I did not hear an unparliamentary comment but that does not mean to say that one might not have been made. The minister would assist the chamber if at least—

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2013-06-06,"



Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House, Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and Minister for Regional Development and Local Government) (10:13):  The shadow minister made some extraordinary statements during that contribution. One was that the Building Australia Fund was somehow a creation of the Howard government. It was created through legislation moved by me as the minister as part of the creation of Infrastructure Australia. It is a part of the infrastructure Australia setup, something that they never did. They never set up a process and indeed they opposed the Infrastructure Australian legislation. It is complete nonsense from those opposite.


He went on to pretend that programs that are under construction with real money creating real jobs, creating real improvements in infrastructure do not exist. He should go to Rockhampton, have a look at the Yeppen roundabout, have a look at the duplication of the bridges that are under construction right now. It is not an apparition; it is real. It exists. There is steel and concrete, and there are workers and cranes working right now on the Bruce Highway.


This shadow minister was once the minister and he described the Cooroy to Curra section of the Bruce Highway as the worst section of road in Australia. He was the transport minister, it is in his electorate and he did nothing about it. Well, we have for one section of it. We promised it, funded it, built it and opened it. He did not play a role in any of those activities. I say to the shadow minister that next week I will be turning a sod on construction in his electorate. Come along—Cooroy to Curra section A, funded by us. Come along.




Mr Truss:
  You haven't invited me. You don't invite me.




Mr ALBANESE:
  You know full well that the—



Mr Truss interjecting—




Mr ALBANESE:
  You might not. You are so hopeless that you might not know that the state government—the Newman government—and your mate Jeff Seeney organise the invites. So ring up Jeff. Get yourself on the list. He might not know you exist. The state government will be looking after the sod-turning on Cooroy to Curra next Wednesday. Come along. He can say that that is not real as well, because he has gone out there and said—even when we fund projects in his own electorate—that it is not happening. Well, drive on the road. You can, because one section of it is open and the next section of construction we are funding, brought forward into this financial year, will commence construction.


Then he went on to criticise the funding that we have provided for all of these programs, including the Moorebank Intermodal Terminal. The Moorebank Intermodal Terminal is absolutely vital for Sydney's infrastructure, ensuring that we take 3,300 trucks off the road every day. You know what the opposition did? 



Mr Craig Kelly interjecting—





Mr ALBANESE:
  You see, it is really not that complex. You have a port and then you have the city of Sydney, and then you have an intermodal terminal. Here is what an intermodal does—and maybe the member for Hughes can think about this, because he has campaigned against it. His own party are supporting it, but he has campaigned against it, showing how disingenuous and unfair they are. The state government support it. Your opposition support it, because it will take trucks off the road, because you have freight moving onto rail. It is not that complex: trucks off the road, freight onto rail, rather than going through all of the streets, including in the electorate of Hughes, in order to get to its destination. The freight infrastructure investment that we have done will take nine hours off the journey on the East West Link and seven hours off the journey from Melbourne to Brisbane. Let me tell you: what he does not say is that the land and the site were chosen by the Howard government. They chose the site. Since then the coalition campaigned against it at the last election and now they are for it again. If he is fair dinkum, he will say at the next election campaign that they are actually for this vital project. We issued a release with the board members on the Moorebank Intermodal Terminal, as we do with all board appointments. (Time expired)

The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  No-one has the call at the moment, Member for Capricornia. It would also assist, in the limited hours that are available in these portfolios, if the members asked the question and the minister responded in more of a summing-up way.

Ms LIVERMORE
 (Capricornia) (10:19):  Thank you, Deputy Speaker. I appreciate the opportunity to speak about this very important portfolio and what it is doing for the Central Queensland region. I was just thinking that we are not even 20 minutes into this consideration in detail and I have already lost track of the number of projects that the minister has talked about and the amount of funding that is in discussion here this morning.


I think back to consideration in detail in the nine years I spent in opposition when I would come in and be part of listening to the minister's counterpart in the Howard years, and I cannot really imagine what he would have talked about. But I know what I would have been talking about: I would have been talking about what was not happening on the Bruce Highway and what was needed in terms of this very important piece of infrastructure for the state of Queensland and indeed the entire nation.


We have heard many times from this government, and we speak about it with great pride and conviction, that since coming to power the Labor government has spent four times as much—the minister will correct me if I get this wrong—on the Bruce Highway in half the time compared to the entire spend in the time of the Howard government. That is a great figure to quote but what does it really mean when we talk about that level of investment in this very important highway? I can tell the House, and constituents of Capricornia could tell the House, that it means basically constant nonstop roadworks setting about greatly improving the Bruce Highway both north and south of Rockhampton. Go south of Gladstone and you get to the Calliope crossroads, an enormous project underway there. In the northern part of my electorate there is the southern access to Mackay, which is an extremely busy and important section of road which really doubles as the Bruce Highway but also a very vital connection between the community of Sarina and the industrial area of Hay Point, the massive coal terminal, and Paget to the south of Mackay. We have duplicated that southern access to Mackay. It was done within a couple of years of us taking government. Work improving that section of the highway continues with further overtaking lanes between Sarina and Mackay. 


Very important is the project the minister has already referred to, and you just have to laugh when the shadow minister talks about, 'They have announced this and what does it mean.' The minister has invited the shadow minister to please come to Rockhampton, although if the shadow minister comes to Rockhampton it could get very embarrassing, because so far we have had the shadow Treasurer and the opposition leader twice come to Rockhampton and fail to make a commitment, refuse to make a commitment for this extremely important project for the people of Central Queensland. This project is fixing up the Yeppen floodplains, finding a solution to this section of the Bruce Highway which we know from very painful experience in 2011 and before that in 1991 can be cut in times of flood, which cuts off Rockhampton and the entire northern half of the state for weeks at a time, causing huge disruption to our local economy, huge disruption to very important businesses right around Central Queensland and beyond. So there is work going on right now on the duplication and lifting of the Yeppen Bridge, and that is going to include very important improvements to the congestion for people having to travel in and out from Gracemere every day, something that is very important to our local area.


What comes next is what is required to really boost the flood immunity of that stretch of road. I would like the minister to talk a little more about what is in the budget for the Yeppoon South project. Even more than that, because there is so much to talk about in terms of Bruce Highway improvements, I would like the minister to talk about the Bruce Highway funding package in the budget.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House, Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and Minister for Regional Development and Local Government) (10:23):  In terms of the Bruce Highway I really want to pay tribute to the member for Capricornia over her time representing that important part of Queensland for the work that she has done. There is no greater tribute to her work and her legacy as the member, given that she has announced her retirement at the next election, than the work that has happened around the southern approaches to Rockhampton. In this budget we have brought forward funding to make sure that this southern approach can be fixed. We brought it forward to the next financial year. This goes on top of the other work that is occurring.


Already right now under construction are: the Calliope Crossroads project; the Bruce and Capricorn highways; the Yeppen roundabout; the southern approach to Mackay; the Burdekin River bridge; flattening and straightening the Bruce Highway over Cardwell Range; projects associated with the Burdekin Road safety audit; the southern approach to Cairns—where I will also be next week—straightening and widening the highway from Cabbage Tree Creek to Carman Road and across Back Creek Range; straightening the highway just south of Gin Gin; and straightening and raising the Bruce Highway between Sandy Corner and Collinson's Lagoon.


We will shortly begin the upgrade of the Pumicestone Road interchange, part of a $195 million contribution from the federal government. Over the next year, in 2013-14, we will have the Cooroy to Curra section A construction commencing with the sod turned next week; the duplication of the highway just south of Townsville between Vantassel Street and Cluden; the construction of the new interchange and replacing the existing intersections between Roy's Road and Bells Creek Road, part of a $195 million contribution; and construction of the final section of the Townsville Ring Road between Shaw Road and Mt Low.


These are the sorts of projects that have led the LNP member for Herbert to say:


I will give Labor a pat on the back and say they have spent more in their four or five years on the Bruce highway than we did before.


That is what local members who are rational say about our contribution to the Bruce Highway. There has been a total funding commitment of $5.7 billion since we came to office compared with the former government's $1.3 billion. Even those arithmetically challenged should recognise 5.7 is a lot more than 1.3. It is not just a figure though because what that means is that there are real jobs as a result of the contributions that have been made.


It compares favourably across the board because we heard before the shadow minister dismiss the $24-billion figure that we have announced already for Nation Building 2. I have no doubt there is more to come in future budgets as state governments and territory governments submit properly funded projects. He said that is a terrible figure. The former government's big trumpet under AusLink was $11.4 billion. The shadow minister says it was more than that. Maybe they got it wrong because they are not real good with numbers. But $11.4 billion was the headline in their press release for Australia's roads and railways. That was their contribution. Twenty-four is more than 11 and—that is moving forward as we receive further projects.


What we know is that investment in infrastructure produces a return in productivity, a return that leads to higher growth, a return that leads therefore to higher revenues and a return that produces outcomes in economic growth and jobs. It is the driver of our national economy. We can invest in two things: physical capital and human capital. That is why we regard infrastructure and skills of the two parts—investing in people through education and training, and investing in nation-building infrastructure. (Time expired)

Mr CHESTER
 (Gippsland) (10:29):  It is always fascinating for members on this side to receive lectures about supposedly not been good with numbers when the member for Lilley has presided over the worst deficits in Australian history. I would like to take the minister to his opening comments where he referred to the future funding priorities in his budget. In particular I want to refer to the Princes Highway, not only in my electorate but also along the south coast of New South Wales.


The minister is well aware of both my concerns and the concerns of the member for Eden-Monaro about the state of the Princes Highway. Without wishing to be political on the issue, I think the highway between Sydney and Sale has probably been neglected and ignored by governments of both political persuasions. In fact, some parts of that highway are in a deplorable state. I do acknowledge that some work has been undertaken in the Eden-Monaro area, the Bega bypass and other areas under The National Road Network as an off-network project.


My particular interest, Minister, relates to the duplication project, which has been jointly funded between Traralgon and Sale, with $140 million from the federal government and $35 million from the state. The minister would be aware that the current funding for this project is set to expire with the completion of the stage between Stammers Road and Minniedale Road. I think the minister would be aware of that. There is concern within the community, within Latrobe City Council, Wellington Shire Council and the general public about whether future funding opportunities exist for that duplication work. I understand that the cost of the project is in the order of $500 million and that $175 million has been allocated to it. So I would be interested to know: where does the Princes Highway East, Traralgon to Sale, fit in the government's future funding priorities?


The second question I would like to ask the minister relates to an issue he may well be able to clarify for me—and that is, the $20 million reprofiling that occurred, due to the EPBC Act issue, around the time of Queensland floods. I know the minister is aware of this issue. I am hoping to get some clarity about whether that funding has now flowed through to the actual project.


Perhaps more generally—and I invite the minister's comments on this particular issue—in terms of road-funding activities across Australia, I am particularly concerned about the amount of the road budget that is being redirected into issues relating to things such as the EPBC Act. The way in which we have been forced to move roads out of road reserves because of EPBC Act intervention, I think, is a concern for this government and future governments. 


From my understanding of the EPBC Act, it was really meant to relate to issues of national significance, yet we are seeing local highway duplication projects being moved out of the road reserve onto private property at significant expense to the Commonwealth and the relevant state governments. I would invite the minister's comments: how significant an issue is this for our nation? How much road money allocated to the transport department is being diverted into these environmental issues, which are sometimes quite spurious? I would invite your comments on that, Minister.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House, Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and Minister for Regional Development and Local Government) (10:32):  I thank the member for Gippsland for his considered approach to infrastructure. I acknowledge that he is one member on the other side of the House who genuinely makes representations on behalf of his electorate and who plays a constructive role in the putting forward of that funding. 


I note that the member has acknowledged that this is the first time that significant funding, $140 million from the federal Labor government and $35 million from the Victorian government, has gone into this section of the Princes Highway East. The current schedule of works is scheduled to be completed in late 2015. We have done exactly what we said we would do: duplicate the highway between Traralgon and Sale. I acknowledge that I would like more to be done and acknowledge the representations of both the member for Gippsland and the member for Eden-Monaro about these issues. 


At the other end, the Bega bypass is currently under construction, fully funded, 100 per cent, by the Commonwealth government. Not one cent has come from the New South Wales government. However, that will not stop them from turning up at media opportunities, should they arise in the future.


Labor has done substantially more than the former government did. That is not hard, because they did not put a cent into this section of the highway. There is more to be done. The current process for Nation Building Program 2 is that we have asked all of the state and territory governments to make submissions as to their funding priorities on the road and rail networks. I sat down on a number of occasions with the Victorian government, the Victorian minister, and worked out some initial priorities in terms of the major projects for Nation Building Program 2 that the Victorian government wanted. Part of that was the Melbourne Metro project that, in Minister Mulder's own words, is the No. 1 priority for Victoria. We worked out funding for that project—$3 billion from each level of government plus an availability payment model, as I said in my opening remarks—but the Victorian government appear to be stepping away from that. I must say we have had difficulties getting any cost-benefit analysis from the Victorian government for road projects such as the east-west tunnel. Their proposals talk about it beginning in the east, and there is a question about what the appropriate model is. I certainly believe in funding both road and rail projects, but it is beyond me why the Victorian government are refusing to submit this cost-benefit analysis or any business plan to the federal government, my department or to Infrastructure Australia.


I indicate to the member for Gippsland that as part of those discussions we also talked about savings that exist on current Victorian projects that were part of NB1. We have not received from the Victorian government any proposals as to where their priorities would be. But I say to the member that I would be happy to continue to work with him in a constructive way on Nation Building Program 2. We indicated very publicly, on budget night—the shadow minister seems to be surprised by this—that these are instalments for specific projects that we have included in the program.


I am a minister who argues for additional funding for infrastructure. The former government seemed to have transport ministers who just rolled over for the Liberal Party partners and did not seem to actually be able to win an argument in their party room, in the cabinet or wherever. There was a distinct lack of funding. Indeed, the last time the coalition were in office they cut $2 billion from road funding in their first budget, and their budgets never recovered from those cuts.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms Saffin
):  The question is that the proposed expenditure be agreed to. Given that there are a lot of members who want to ask questions, for the convenience of the House, if members on my right could ask questions seriatim and then not speak for so long, you will get your questions in and the minister can respond. Members on my left, I take it that the Leader of the Nationals and the honourable member for Dawson are going to ask questions? Okay. I will lead off with the member for Gellibrand.

Ms ROXON
 (Gellibrand) (10:38):  I will ask a very brief question in order to enable my colleagues to raise some of their issues, because the minister has touched briefly on the issue that I wanted to ask him about, which is for him to address further this question of infrastructure, particularly in the western suburbs of Melbourne. The lack of funding for roads by the coalition is true not just if you look at spending from our government compared with the previous, Howard government but also if you look at the last 20 or 30 years: the big infrastructure projects were funded by Labor governments.


Minister Albanese, I am wondering if you can talk a little bit more about the latest investment in the Western Ring Road, the western suburbs of Melbourne being one of the fastest growing communities in the country; and how they complement our investments in regional rail and the latest investments in the Melbourne Metro. I, perhaps cheekily, put on the record that, if the east-west tunnel—as others persist in calling it—is to go ahead, I would like to call it the west-east tunnel! I do believe, given where the particular population pressures are, that, if it were to go ahead, consideration should be given to building it from the western end rather than the eastern end. That has a long way to travel, as the minister mentioned, when work has not already been done by the state government—and you might want to address that too, Minister. But I understand my colleague is going to ask you some questions to handle together.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I thank the member for Gellibrand for her brevity.

Mr ADAMS
 (Lyons) (10:39): I take this opportunity to ask the minister some questions in relation to expenditure on transport and infrastructure in the budget appropriations. There have been some great investments in Tasmania under this Labor government—about $1.9 billion. That has been great for lifting the infrastructure which is so urgently needed and for creating great jobs. The electorate of Lyons is 50 per cent of the state of Tasmania and has most of the great highway between the south and the north. I am often referred to as 'the honest broker in the middle' and it is a title I enjoy wearing. The minister might like to outline the $500 million announced in the latest package for work on the Midland Highway and also the Launceston bypass. Planning for the new Bridgewater bridge is continuing. There is the upgrading of the Mona Vale and St. Peters Pass, one of the oldest passes in Tasmania. There is quite a bit of activity around Mona Vale—I see there is a cherry farm in that area—and between Mangalore and Bagdad. In the north towards Launceston, just past my electorate office in Perth the highway is being duplicated and upgraded between Perth and the Launceston airport roundabout. They are urgently needed upgrades, which have been put aside for too long.


When you come to Tasmania you can see much work going on in infrastructure, with all the water pipes for the Midlands Irrigation Scheme sitting beside the highway. Down in the Colebrook sportsground you can see the rail sleepers for the upgrading of the rail at Rhyndaston and there are plenty of bulldozers. With the great work done on the Brighton bypass, that town is now in the biggest growth area in Tasmania. So Minister, I ask you how you see those areas and that infrastructure coming together with the $1.9 million this government has put into infrastructure in Tasmania.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House, Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and Minister for Regional Development and Local Government) (10:43):  I thank members for their questions. Firstly, the member for Gellibrand is very conscious of the federal government's investment of $13.5 billion into Victorian infrastructure. That is a shift from $89 per head to more than $200 per Victorian. So we have more than doubled the infrastructure budget for Victoria. Concerning specific projects, we are currently investing more than $3.2 billion in the regional rail link, including through the member's electorate. Right now, there are 3,500 Australians working directly on that project as a result of that investment. Geelong, Bendigo, Ballarat and Melbourne are all benefitting. It is a very exciting project, one I have visited on a number of occasions and one which I note the federal Leader of the Opposition did not even know existed—an extraordinary proposition—when he said on Melbourne radio that the federal government does not invest in any urban rail projects, except for the Moreton Bay rail link. It is an exciting project.


The M80 has also been an absolutely critical project. We have committed some $900 million to the upgrade of the Western and the Metropolitan ring-roads. In this budget, we have added a further $525 million for that project, which is absolutely vital for the efficiency of the Victorian road system. It is an absolutely vital project for Melbourne. The important thing about the east-west—




Honourable member interjecting—





Mr ALBANESE:
  or west-east, as the member said—




Honourable member interjecting—





Mr ALBANESE:
  That is why you have a business plan; it is to work out issues—for example, with the West Gate Bridge: what is the priority for where the link should begin? We want to see it. The Victorian government say that they have got it, but they will not show it to anyone. It is quite an extraordinary proposition. I think our record in Victorian infrastructure stands in stark contrast to our predecessor's. 


In Tasmania, we have invested $1.9 billion. This, again, is almost a doubling of infrastructure spending in Tasmania. In this budget, the Midland Highway package is particularly important for the electorate of the member for Lyons. There is planning for a future Launceston bypass, duplicating the Perth to Breadalbane section, and dedicated safety upgrades at Mona Vale, St Peter's Pass, and between Mangalore and Bagdad, as well as activities to advance the Bridgewater Bridge. The Freight Rail Revitalisation project is also absolutely vital. It includes replacing approximately 290 kilometres of old rail track. This creates jobs in manufacturing as well as in the specific work that takes place there. Also, there are the commitments to the Brooker Highway, the Domain Highway, the Huon Highway and the Tasman Highway ramps. All of this adds up to a major benefit. 


Of course, the opposition have said that they can duplicate the Midland Highway for $400 million. That is just a nonsense. We have committed $500 million. We are not pretending that we will be able to duplicate the whole highway. The opposition pluck figures from nowhere. It is bit like the construction of the Hunter Expressway, which is now underway, at $1.65 billion. When the coalition said that they would do something about the expressway, they did not actually advance the project. In 2004, they said the costing was $382 million. By 2007, they said it was $1.2 billion. They just make up these figures as they go along. They hold out false hope and pretend that they can build things with an amount that they simply cannot. We have invested real dollars into real projects that are making a real difference in terms of costing. The whole duplication has been costed at $2.7 billion. That is more than $400 million. Those opposite need to stop the sort of nonsense that they go on with. We have invested real money in those real projects.

"Christensen, George, MP",Nats,2013-06-06,"



Mr CHRISTENSEN
 (Dawson) (10:48):  Deputy Speaker, I have three issues to put to the minister. The first is in relation to the upgrade of the Bruce Highway from Vantassel Street in Townsville to the Flinders Highway. The minister would know of it: $110 million was announced in the budget for this project. It was certainly something that the government was going to remove altogether to pay for the flood reconstruction in Queensland, and only after campaigning by the Liberal-National coalition was it reinstated in the budget. That was a good outcome. I have written to the minister, and I believe that the Townsville City Council has written to the minister—and perhaps the minister has also received correspondence from the Townsville Turf Club—about some issues that the community have with the upgrade of that road. I am just wondering whether the minister is aware of that and what the minister is going to do about those concerns. 


The second issue I refer to concerns the Bruce Highway. The minister and, I believe, the Prime Minister came to Rockhampton to announce a supposed $4.1 billion Bruce Highway package. We later found out that roughly $1.76 billion of that was already announced funding. This leaves around $2.4 billion to be spent over the next 10 years. 


The Department of Main Roads in Queensland has a Bruce Highway action plan where they say that $6 billion over the next 10 years is needed for the highest priority projects on that highway. The $2.4 billion that you have allocated over the next 10 years is not even half of what is needed. The minister will probably respond that all of that $1.76 billion was announced after the Bruce Highway action plan came into effect, but that answer will only really fly if the $1.76 billion in funding that has already been committed out of that $4.1 billion is for projects that are actually contained within the Bruce Highway action plan. So my second question to the ministry is whether he can assure me and indeed the House that out of that $4.1 billion that has been allocated, including the $1.76 billion that has already been allocated, all of it is going to projects that are identified in the Bruce Highway action plan. The following question is, if there cannot be an assurance there, what projects are we going to miss out on? Will the Haughton River Bridge be something we miss out on, the upgrade of Sandy Gully near Bowen, the planning for Beganga Plains in the Whitsundays be something we miss out on? 


In relation to the ring road, there was a visit by the Prime Minister on 24 April to Mackay and she announced that the ring road would be funded by the government. There were no details but she told reporters that in the budget the ring road would be included. We have got the budget before us and there is no line item mentioning the ring road whatsoever. There is no mention of the ring road in the budget. There have been indications made to journalists by the Prime Minister, by the minister and indeed by the Labor candidate in the electorate of Dawson that the ring road funding will be available in the 2013-14 financial year. I want a clear answer from the minister, a yes or a no: will the ring road funding be made available in the 2013-14 financial year?

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House, Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and Minister for Regional Development and Local Government) (10:52):  I am very pleased to get this question from the member opposite. It seems he does not understand budgets and he does not understand infrastructure the way that it happens. The Department of Main Roads Queensland, his Tory colleagues, run the projects in regard to the Vantassel Street issue that he raises, in terms of that upgrade. The process of the implementation, the management of the projects is done by the Queensland LNP government. Okay? It is not that hard, mate. You should be able to work that out. So in terms of issues with regard to specific details of construction we provide money to the Department of Main Roads, you have a contract between the federal and state governments and they then manage the project. 


With regard to the funding that is in the budget, he also does not seem to understand that what you have is line items in the budget of funding for the Bruce Highway. He has produced some ads on the Mackay ring road, which is bizarre because of the quotes he uses to say what the promise is. I read from his ad. He said that the Prime Minister said funding would be sourced from a federal infrastructure scheme known as Nation Building 2. That is the commitment of the Prime Minister.



Mr Christensen interjecting—




Mr ALBANESE:
  According to you. This is your ad. The broken promise he says is Infrastructure Australia are now in a position to release a preliminary schedule of new projects to be funded and delivered over the five-year life of our next nation building program, which is Nation Building 2. We said we would fund it under Nation Building 2. Your ad says Nation Building 2—

  Nation Building 2, you nong. It is in the ad that you produced. 2014-15—

Mr ALBANESE:
  I withdraw. That is a compliment. 2014-15 to 2018-19. It is there in your ad. You cannot help some people. We already have funding to progress the planning. Funding is already there for the community consultation for the Mackay ring road, which I announced in Mackay, which closes next month.




Mr Christensen:
  It's already underway, mate.




Mr ALBANESE:
  We're funding it, you nong! We're funding it!



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Minister, will you not use that language. Withdraw.




Mr ALBANESE:
  I withdraw. It is not that complex, mate, and you should talk to the member for Gippsland about the way that he approaches infrastructure investment in his seat. He makes approaches, as a member of the National Party. He gives credit when it is there; he says, 'This is a good thing for my electorate,' and he asks for more. That is what he does. That is what a good local member does.


You have got money for planning—$10 million, and not a cent from the state government but totally funded by us, to do the planning. We have released, now, for community consultation, the proposed route. That is out there. As to the community consultation, that funding has already been provided under Nation Building 1. We have a program for the Mackay ring road: planning in Nation Building 1, and then construction in Nation Building 2. That is what the Prime Minister said. That is what is there.


And in yesterday's state budget, 85 per cent of the $690 million the Queensland government said was being committed to the Bruce Highway is funding from us—85 per cent is from the federal government.



Mr Christensen interjecting—




Mr ALBANESE:
  And you have not promised a zack, a cent, of funding for the Bruce Highway, but you come in here and get critical about funding for your electorate! You are one of the only members of parliament I have ever seen in the entire time I have been here, 17 years, who have complained about funding being in your electorate.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  If we have a quick question and a quick answer, we will be on time.




Ms O'NEILL:
  It will indeed be a quick question. I want to note, in the minister's comments today, not just the significant amounts of money that are being invested, and not just the vision and a deep understanding of investment for the benefit of the nation, for our productivity and our future, but the constant awareness of the reality that these projects create jobs.


I come from a family steeped in construction. The first photographs I have of me, Minister, are of me sitting on top of a D9, a great big bulldozer, when my father was helping build the Bradfield Highway. And I was delighted to climb onto a Hitachi excavator in the electorate just last week for the announcement of the Gosford passing loops and that $146 million project.


But my questions go particularly today to the F3-M2, because this is a critical piece of infrastructure, and also to the widening of the exits and sections of the F3, which will improve not only the safety of people from the Central Coast in travelling to and from Sydney but also their lifestyle, by helping them to be able to get home. So this is part of a great national investment, and I would like to hear more from the Minister about the F3-M2.

I am very interested to hear from the Minister what further investments there are in my electorate of Petrie on the Moreton Bay rail link, something that was promised for 102 years and which took this federal Labor government to make happen; it is important that that money keeps being committed in this year's budget. But also I am interested to know if the state government is fulfilling its commitments. Also I am interested in the Gateway Motorway upgrade, which is critical to the whole of the north side of Brisbane. But so is the Cross River Rail. I am very interested to hear what the commitments are of this federal Labor government.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House, Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and Minister for Regional Development and Local Government) (10:59):  To wrap up this series, the F3 to M2 is an absolutely vital project. It effectively will be the Sydney bypass. It means that vehicles can go from the south, head north via the M7 and M2 and on to what has been the missing link. It is a vital project. We sat down constructively with the New South Wales government and with Transurban and got this done. Without the federal government's $400-million investment, it simply would not have happened. The previous government did lots of studies but no action. On top of that we have the F3 upgrades we announced with the Prime Minister and the member for Robertson. It will make a huge difference to the Central Coast.


It appears that the Queensland state government is against investment in Brisbane because, in the budget they handed down yesterday, they failed to put any money into the Gateway North project at all. They have only put $5 million into the next section of the Ipswich motorway and they failed to put any funding at all into the Cross River rail project, which is absolutely vital in dealing with congestion. Indeed they have come up with quite an innovative plan.


A new rail crossing across the river would ensure that people not just in Brisbane but people on the Sunshine Coast and on the Gold Coast and everywhere in between could benefit. Four new rail stations were also envisaged. But after writing to us and making a number of requests—all of which were agreed to—and after exchanging letters in writing about this project, they walked away from it under pressure from the federal coalition.


The Queensland state government have come up with another unique and innovative plan. They plan to rip the seats out of the existing trains and make people stand on the train so they can squeeze more people in. I am sure they will have an employment project just like you see in Tokyo whereby people with gloves will be charged with pushing people, cramming them like sardines, on to the trains.



Honourable members interjecting—




Mr ALBANESE:
  As member the for Moreton suggested, that might be stage 2 of the solution from the Queensland state government.


What we now know about the Moreton Bay regional rail link is that all contracts which have not been entered into on public transport projects are under threat from the federal coalition should they be elected. The Cross River rail project was first promised in the Queensland parliament in 1895. The whole of the next century went through without a commitment. It took the current federal Labor government, largely due to the campaign by the member for Petrie over and over again, to make this a reality. It has begun but I am very concerned that the project is under threat because of the statements on the record from the coalition, which is they do not believe in any investment in public transport. To quote the Leader of the Opposition, they should 'stick to their knitting', which consists of minor road funding in marginal electorates. It was what the record was previously. There should be no funding.


They and the Leader of the National Party have made it very clear that they do not believe in sticking to commitments where contracts have not been entered into. They have made it very clear that is their position. We know in spite of the fact that there are so many people on the record, including the Premier of Queensland and the transport minister, supporting the Cross River rail project but it is not going ahead. I think other projects would be under threat as well. The only way to ensure proper infrastructure funding for South-East Queensland as well as for the whole of regional Queensland, including the Bruce Highway, is with the re-election of the Labor government.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (11:05):  The government is making the choice to keep our economy strong and to invest in our future. The Australian economy, by international standards, continues to perform extraordinarily well. We have a low debt-to-GDP ratio, one of the lowest in the developed world. We have strong employment, with the unemployment rate having a five at the front of it. Our economy has grown by 14 per cent since the global financial crisis, while Europe's economy has shrunk and the US economy has grown by just a couple of percentage points. The Australian stock market has grown strongly and the Australian economy is a standout performer on the international stage.


The government has recognised the challenges that the high Australian dollar places on our public finances. So the 2013-14 budget charts a pathway to return to balance in 2015-16 and to surplus by 2016-17, improving the sustainability of Australia's public finances and building on Australia's record of fiscal and economic strength. The priorities of the budget are providing schoolchildren with the opportunities to reach their full potential, with $9.8 billion invested in new school funding; providing support for people with severe and permanent disability through the historic $14.3 billion investment in DisabilityCare Australia; and providing critical infrastructure, as we heard in the previous portfolio's consideration in detail, with $24 billion of new investment in road and rail.


The budget charts a path to surplus, although the hit to revenues will see a budget deficit in 2013-14. The budget continues the government's record of identifying strategic savings rather than making savage cuts. While those opposite would cut back vital services that Australians depend on, while they would raise superannuation taxes on low-income workers, we on this side of the House have a different set of priorities. The coalition believe it is appropriate to take away money from children on their first day of school—




Mr Briggs:
  Madam Deputy Speaker Saffin, I raise a point of order on relevance. I understand this is the parliamentary secretary's first attempt at a consideration-in-detail stage of portfolio expenditure, but he should confine his remarks to the budget papers, as I understand it. Talking about the opposition, telling fibs about the opposition, does not relate to the budget papers for the forward estimates—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms Saffin
):  The member for Mayo will resume his seat. 




Mr Briggs:
  so, if he could confine his remarks to the budget papers, that would be terrific.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Mayo will take his seat. There is no point of order, and I think the honourable member for Mayo knows that.




Dr LEIGH:
  The budget makes $43 billion of savings across the forward estimates, continuing a legacy of making responsible savings so that we can fund necessary investments. The government has chosen a sensible path of consolidation, maintaining strong growth and low unemployment while ensuring that Australia's debt levels are among the lowest in the developed world. Through these investments in the National Plan for School Improvement, DisabilityCare Australia, the National Health Reform Agreement and aged care, the government is ensuring that Australia is a stronger and more socially cohesive nation. 


On the topic of aged-care investments, it was my pleasure recently to join the Minister for Mental Health and Ageing in my own electorate to speak with local residents about the importance of aged-care reform. This is just one of many consultations the government has held on aged-care reform. 


The government's investments keep to our medium-term fiscal strategy, a fiscal strategy that has remained unchanged since the government's first budget in 2008-09—and that is, to achieve budget surpluses, on average, over the medium term; to keep taxation as a share of GDP, on average, below the level from 2007-08; and to improve the government's net financial worth over the medium term. While we have seen significant hits to revenue, the government has continued to hue to that path.


For the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, there are three new measures in the 2013-2014 budget, with a total fiscal impact of $112 million over four years. The government will provide $13.8 million over four years to the department to maintain existing organisational capacity and to support the government's critical initiatives and reform agenda. There will be $97.5 million over three years to support the G20 meetings in Queensland, in 2014, and there will be $0.65 million over three years to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to support Australia's membership of the United Nations Security Council.

Mr BRIGGS
 (Mayo) (11:11):  Firstly, given the seniority of the cabinet minister at the table—and I appreciate him being here—I might ask the questions I have in relation to the Social Inclusion Unit and get the minister to respond before asking some questions of the parliamentary secretary in relation to the Prime Minister and Cabinet portfolio.


The coalition thinks that all Australians deserve the best opportunity at the life they wish to pursue. That is why we have announced a series of policies as part of our real solutions plan, to ensure people have those opportunities over the coming months. Where we find a little inconsistency is when the government has this so-called Social Inclusion Unit but seeks publicly to denigrate Australians it does not agree with. I refer in this respect to the terrific and remarkable contribution last week by the member for Batman in his speech to the parliament announcing his retirement, in which he made the point: 'We should be about creating opportunities for all Australians, not pursuing our pointless class rhetoric.'


How does a minister justify having a Social Inclusion Unit at the same time as the Treasurer of the country seeks to pursue, it would seem daily, this class warfare rhetoric in the parliament and outside by targeting Australians because of their success? How is that consistent with establishing this so-called Social Inclusion Unit and, in so doing, spending millions of dollars? Equally, Minister, can you outline to the parliament how much funding has been allocated to the Social Inclusion Unit over the forward estimates? How much of that funding has been allocated to the board as well as to the unit itself? How many people are currently employed within the Social Inclusion Unit? And what is the total expenditure so far in 2012-13 for this unit?

Mr BUTLER
 (Port Adelaide—Minister for Mental Health and Ageing, Minister for Housing and Homelessness, Minister for Social Inclusion and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Mental Health Reform) (11:13):  I thank the member for Mayo for his question and his interest in the concepts of social inclusion and for giving me the opportunity to talk a little bit about that and to answer, as best I can, his questions and maybe take on notice some of the more specific questions about dollars.


The government, since we came to power in 2007-08, thought it was important to have a social inclusion approach to government. I will talk a bit about the precise focus of that agenda, because I am not sure the member for Mayo has completely understood the idea of the social inclusion agenda, at least from our government's perspective. 


Social inclusion, essentially, is about a fair go for all Australians. But taking particular account of the fact that, in spite of our extraordinary economic success over the periods of the Hawke government, the Keating government, the Howard government and our government since 2007, 21 years of uninterrupted economic growth which, as the parliamentary secretary eloquently said, has been the envy of the advanced economies around the world, that rising tide has simply not lifted all ships. We know through research that there remain around 600,000 adults in Australia who experience multiple points of disadvantage, by which I mean that it is not just that they are experiencing poverty or it is not just that they are experiencing disability or it is not just that they are experiencing unstable housing or perhaps homelessness. It is that they are experiencing a whole range of those disadvantages. 


The Social Inclusion Agenda recognises two things: 1) that any country worth its salt needs to continue to focus on ensuring that, in our case, those Australians have the opportunity enjoyed by all others to participate in this country's success; and 2) that some of the traditional approaches to dealing with disadvantage are simply not working for that group. By that I mean that traditionally what we have done for someone experiencing poverty is to give them an income support program. What we have done for someone experiencing mental illness or disability is to give them some mental health support, and what we have done for someone experiencing housing issues is to give them housing support. Where people are dealing with multiple points of disadvantage we recognise there is an obligation on government and delivery agencies funded by government to work more in a joined-up way so that rather than those Australians having to go forum shopping with eight or 10 different agencies, they are given an approach that is centred upon them rather than centred upon different government agencies or different NGOs.


The member for Mayo will see that through a number of different reform initiatives pursued by this government. In my area of mental health, the Partners in Recovery program, which seeks to support some of the most chronically and seriously unwell in our community, is deliberately a joined-up program that seeks to bring together often eight or 10 different agencies that are providing support to these 60,000 or so Australians and ensure that the agencies work through one centralised support program rather than expecting those Australians and their families or carers to go shopping time and time again for different supports from different agencies. That is the purpose of our Social Inclusion Agenda. 


I think the member for Mayo has slightly misunderstood the idea of social inclusion and taken a much broader sweep than we are intending to do through our agenda. Be very clear, our agenda on social inclusion is focused on those Australians experiencing the most intractable disadvantage. We receive very good advice and support from the Social Inclusion Board. Their How Australia is faring report is one of the best reports to bring together a range of different sources of evidence and research to understand better what is driving that level of disadvantage among those Australians—the extent to which it is locality based, the extent to which it focuses around poor health and disability. We know through those research pieces that these are the surest paths into intractable disadvantage, but we also understand that the surest path out of that disadvantage is training and employment.

Ms HALL
 (Shortland) (11:18):  I would like to start my contribution, prior to asking the minister the question I have, by thanking him very much for visiting my electorate last week and for the Social Inclusion report that has been done on Wyong Shire Council, and particularly the area he visited which is extremely disadvantaged. It is an area that will benefit enormously from the government's contribution in the area of social inclusion. I particularly thank him for meeting with a number of young people on the issue of mental health and the need for mental health resources in a very poor and isolated area. The report on Wyong Shire has shown just how people in that area have missed out. The concept of social inclusion is very important. It is not playing one group against another; it is making sure that everybody in our society has an opportunity.


The government has invested substantially in improved mental health services over the last five years, culminating in a record $2.2 billion package of reforms announced in the budget, which are now being successfully implemented across Australia. We all just need to look at our electorates to see how successful it has been. We express our thanks to the government, at least on this side of the House. A key part of that reform package was to establish a new mental health commission, to bring better transparency and to report on performance to our mental health service and in our entire mental health system. The budget continues the government support for funding of the National Mental Health Commission and the commission continues to be funded through the Prime Minister's office. Could the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Mental Health Reform inform the chamber  how this funding will be used and what progress the commission has made already? I also invite the minister to reflect on the leadership of the commission, especially given the recent announcement by Robin Kruk AM about her intention to resign from the Australian Public Service.

Mr BUTLER
 (Port Adelaide—Minister for Mental Health and Ageing, Minister for Housing and Homelessness, Minister for Social Inclusion and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Mental Health Reform) (11:20):  I thank the member for Shortland for her question. For the benefit of the chamber, I am sworn as the  Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Mental Health Reform so that I can be sworn to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet because that is where the National Mental Health Commission is situated as an agency, for reasons I will explain shortly.


I thank the  member for Shortland for hosting me last week in her beautiful electorate, for the events we were able to hold there and for the discussions particularly that we were able to have with an incredibly impressive and resilient group of young people in San Remo. This is a group of young people who have been through pretty tough times in family circumstances dealing with mental health issues, who advocated very clearly and forcefully the need for mental health services in the northern part of the Wyong Shire. The strip from the Central Coast up to Newcastle is well serviced by headspace services. The headspace Gosford service, now called headspace Central Coast, is one of the oldest headspaces and one of the most professional services we have in the country. Deb there is a great leader of headspace, not just in that part of New South Wales but around the country. We were able to open headspace Newcastle last week as well. 


The arguments were forcefully made that there perhaps is the need for us to consider some support for the northern Wyong Shire Council, nestled between Gosford and Newcastle. I was particularly struck by some of the arguments made by young people, their parents, their teachers, their high school principals and, in some cases, their grandparents about the particular social circumstances of that part of the Shortland electorate. There are relatively speaking low rates of car ownership impacting on someone's capacity to drive to Gosford or to Newcastle. The relatively low rates of internet connection restrains a young person's ability to tap into our investments in e-headspace and other mental health initiatives. That for me was a very powerful discussion and again I thank you for that.


As your question intimates, the National Mental Health Commission is structurally a very important part of our mental health reform agenda. I want to place on record that the idea of mental health reform and the need to improve mental health services has happily been a bipartisan idea for several years. We differ sometimes on the details of that effort, but I am very pleased that, from the community's point of view, that is seen as a bipartisan obligation on all governments—Commonwealth or state.


As I was developing the reform agenda to take to cabinet for the 2011 budget process, I heard very forcefully from mental health academics but also and most importantly from consumers and carers that they wanted a body like the National Mental Health Commission, for two reasons. They wanted an agency at arm's length from government that would report without fear or favour on the performance of our mental health services. We have reported now for more than 20 years in this country in minute detail the number of beds we have in the mental health system, the number of staff we have in the system, but we have not been good at reporting on outcomes. We have not been good at reporting on the degree to which those investments through taxpayer dollars change people's lives and help them recover from their illness, help them connect back with their families and communities, back to work, back into stable housing and so on.


That is the message I heard most clearly from consumers and carers, and that is the job of the National Mental Health Commission. They have done it marvellously well in their first year. The report card that they released just before Christmas put a spotlight—I think for the first time—on the extraordinary physical health disadvantage that, particularly, people with severe mental illness experience. Their life expectancy gap—the gap between their life expectancy and the average—is almost 30 years. The only other group in the Australian community that experiences a similar life expectancy gap is Indigenous Australians. I think that was a very powerful piece of work, and they also put the spotlight back on the use of seclusion and restraint, particularly in state mental health systems.


Robyn Kruk has been a great leader of this commission. She is a former New South Wales Director General of Premier and Cabinet and director general of the health service. She has held senior positions in the APS. She has announced her retirement from the APS, and consequently the position of head of the commission, in the past several weeks. I want to place on record her work in setting up the commission to be, I think, a long-term benefit to the Australian community.

Mr BRIGGS
 (Mayo) (11:26):  I want to acknowledge the minister's comments just then, acknowledging that this has been a bipartisan commitment. I thank him for that. It has been. The shadow minister for health has pursued these issues with vigour in the last few years, and the Leader of the Opposition also. I also acknowledge the minister's commitment. In my own electorate he has met with groups and attempted to solve some of the challenges that I think there are, particularly in regional mental health issues. You would know yourself, Madam Deputy Speaker Saffin, that they are a different set of issues and are very hard to fix. I know the minister has put some attention on that, and we appreciate that. I am not sure we have yet got it right, so it is an issue which we need to continue to focus on.


I want to turn my attention to the administration of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, particularly with the parliamentary secretary here. Some of the machinery aspects of government which I think are important have been downplayed by ministers in this place this week, but I think they are substantially important to the operations of an effective executive government. During the Howard years, of which I had some experience as a staff member, there was a focus on ensuring the proper process was always followed—certainly from the Prime Minister, who very much respected the office that he held and the processes and traditions of that office. What has become apparent this week in estimates and in questioning in this place is that it seems that there are a series of ministers, through the chaos and dysfunction of the events of March this year, who have not received their charter letter from the Prime Minister.


For those unfamiliar with it, a charter letter is the letter which in effect is a job description for the minister. It outlines what it is the minister is responsible for, acts and the expectations of the minister. In the Howard years, the Prime Minister would have a session with each minister every 12 months to go through the charter letter and work through whether the outcomes that he expected to be achieved in the portfolio area to further the government's agenda were indeed being achieved. It was a very important letter for internally holding ministers to account to ensure that the aims and the pursuit of the policy direction of the government—which is usually announced at the beginning of a term in the Governor-General's speech—were being achieved.


It strikes me as quite remarkable that the Minister for Human Services, who is responsible in this budget for $157 billion worth of payments—the agency of human services is responsible for $157 billion worth of payments which Australians rely on, whether it be pensions, childcare payments, payments in relation to family tax benefit or Medicare rebates; you name it, they are responsible for it—does not have a charter letter from the chaos and dysfunction of March. There was no charter letter. It was then revealed in the portfolio of the minister for social and community services, Minister Macklin, that she does not have a charter letter. I presume the minister for mental health and other issues has a charter letter.


After that short preamble, my questions to the parliamentary secretary are as follows. How many ministers have not received their charter letter? Will they get the charter letter prior to the government entering into its caretaker period, which is about 78 days away? Have the Prime Minister and her department drafted those letters yet? Is this stuck in the in-tray? Do they intend to put some urgency to it? Can the parliamentary secretary update us on these matters?

Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (11:30):  I thank the member for Mayo for his questions. He raises an important question of proper process, the details of which I am happy to take on notice and supply to him. But I share his commitment to proper processes and have great faith in the diligence of public servants, not just in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet but in other departments as well. 


This government has a strong commitment to reform and a strong commitment to ensuring that proper processes are followed. That is why under this government we have seen a continued series of important reforms making a difference in people's lives. We have seen the development of the National Broadband Network, DisabilityCare Australia, a profit based mining tax and a price on carbon pollution—any single one of which policy developments, under other governments, might have taken the entire attention of the government. Yet this government has managed each of those reforms in the context of a global financial crisis and the unusual perfect storm of a high Australian dollar and a fall-off in commodity prices. The government's commitment to reform remains steadfast, as does our commitment to public servants. It is not for this side of the House to be slashing 20,000 jobs out of the Public Service. We have great faith in the Public Service. It is the view of this side of parliament—




Mr Briggs:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. This was an issue raised about when the Prime Minister was going to send charter letters to her ministers who have not received them. Talking about the opposition's plans to live within our means and to ensure that we have got a Public Service which is operating efficiently—and this instance shows quite clearly that it is not—has not got anything to do with the question I asked.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. DGH Adams
):  As I understand it, the question time rules do not apply. The parliamentary secretary's response is appropriate if it is relevant to the parliamentary secretary's portfolio.




Dr LEIGH:
  Thank you, Deputy Speaker, for that ruling. I share your view that someone who is focused upon the importance of proper rules and proper process should also be aware of the rules and processes of this place and the rules that govern consideration in detail.


I will conclude by saying that this government has a strong record of working constructively with the Public Service. We recognise the great reforming work that public servants do. That is why we are committed to a strong Public Service. That is why this side of parliament will never resort to the sorts of attacks upon public servants that we see from members of the opposition, which are so regrettable because of the great work that is done by public servants to build a stronger and more cohesive nation.

"Owens, Julie, MP",ALP,2013-06-06,"



Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (11:34):  I have a couple of questions for the minister on the not-for-profit reform agenda. I spent a number of years—in fact a couple of decades—of my life working in the not-for-profit sector and have extraordinary regard for the people that work in it, largely from firsthand experience. I got into it as a piano player—a repetiteur in the opera company, coaching singers in their roles—in my early 20s, and I spent the next nearly three decades in it before going into business on my own. It is filled with people who can start with a blank piece of paper and can identify some of the most extraordinarily large problems and chip away at them, on the smell of an oily rag. If you want to see efficiency, look at the not-for-profit sector. They achieve the most extraordinary things with very little money quite often.


But one of the things you also notice when you work in that sector is the amount of time you spend applying to government and, particularly, reporting to government. If you are a large organisation, you might apply for funding across six states and territories plus to the Commonwealth government and local councils, and you might apply to several departments in each of those places. So it is not unusual when you are reporting to have to provide anywhere from three to six copies of annual reports even three years back. In my office we had a shelf of annual reports each year for the last three years, a shelf of constitutions and a shelf of folders that contained things like certificates of cooperation. Several times a year you would send not an envelope off to a government department but a box of stuff.


When applying for grants there is also the need to continually establish your bona fides. There is an incredible amount of repetitive red tape to supply to different bodies and different levels of government. I was really pleased to see the work done by the Labor government in reducing that red tape. It started to rationalise how the not-for-profit sector relates to government, particularly with its exchange of information. I know that incredible work has been done, but I would really like an update on the progress of that reform agenda and the recent achievements in reducing red tape and simplifying Commonwealth grants programs for those who apply for them.


The second matter for me is the issue of gags. Between the years of 2004 and 2007 when I was representing Parramatta in opposition I saw first-hand some of the ramifications of the Howard government's gag clauses. In fact, I went to a forum in this house run by one of the members of the now opposition called 'Participatory democracy: a threat to democracy'. The forum was actually about a view that people in the not-for-profit sector who are representing a community but are not elected by the people are a corruption in democracy. It was actually quite scary. It was filled with Liberal members. I was the only one in the room who was not a Liberal member. I saw the impact of that view in my community when we had organisations representing some of the most vulnerable people in the community who did not feel that they had the right to speak on their behalf. It is my view, and I know it is the government's view, that a good government should be brave enough to feed the hand that bites it. It is the job of the not-for-profit sector to identify problems as they emerge at the coalface, make those well known and speak very, very loudly for those who are not able to speak for themselves.


I know that the Campbell Newman government has reintroduced gag clauses. I know that the Barry O'Farrell government is talking about reintroducing them. I know that the Labor government abolished Howard's gag clauses as one of its first actions in 2008. I would just like the minister to advise the chamber on recent announcements on the gag clauses both from the Commonwealth and from other governments and to inform the House about the impact of those announcements on the freedom of the not-for-profit sector to advocate for policy reform on behalf of some of the most vulnerable people in the community.

 (Port Adelaide—Minister for Mental Health and Ageing, Minister for Housing and Homelessness, Minister for Social Inclusion and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Mental Health Reform) (11:38):  I thank the member for Parramatta for her question and for reminding us of her piano skills. I remember walking past the Great Hall when she was rehearsing Rachmaninoff's piano concerto No. 2, which is an extraordinarily difficult piece.




Honourable member interjecting—





Mr BUTLER:
  No—a drummer. I have no particular musical sense. I have some vague sense of rhythm but no sense of tune!


I thank the member for Parramatta. I also thank her for hosting me on a number of occasions in the electorate of Parramatta to meet with some fantastic not-for-profit organisations, the latest of which was when we met with the Evolve Housing organisation, which is a wonderful community housing organisation in the west of Sydney.


I also want to place on record my thanks to the member for Parramatta for her chairing of the House Standing Committee on Economics inquiry into the ACNC, the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission, which is a centrepiece of the government's not-for-profit reform agenda. We have a very strong and firm view that not-for-profit reform is one of the outstanding pieces of microeconomic reform. By 'outstanding' I mean that it is one of those pieces of microeconomic reform that is still to be done. In many respects the ACNC reforms, and a number of other reforms associated with them, mirror the reforms that the Hawke government drove in the late 1980s, in the corporations sector, to do away with the myriad of reporting obligations that corporations back then had to comply with at Commonwealth and state levels. 


The not-for-profit reform sector constitutes about 600,000 organisations. It is responsible for, or employs, about eight per cent of Australia's workforce. It engages about five million, or five-sixths, of the entire Australian volunteer workforce. It contributes—at last count, which is a little bit out of date—about $43 billion to Australia's GDP, which makes it a larger economic contributor to Australia than agriculture and tourism, just to name a couple of other industries. This is a very substantial part of Australia's economy and workforce. 


But perhaps even more importantly, its value is inestimable in terms of its social contribution. All of us as local members of parliament and as members of the Australian community, come across, every day, NFP NGO organisations working with paid staff and with volunteers who are teaching young kids to play footie or engage in surf lifesaving, or delivering some of the most important social services to support some of the most vulnerable members of our community.


In addition to establishing the ACNC we recognise the government's role as a good citizen—as an organisation which contracts with many tens of thousands of not-for-profit organisations who, as I have said, deliver some of these incredibly important services to the Australian community. And I think we have an obligation to be a good citizen in that respect. 


It concerned me, as a line agency minister to a number of departments, the number of contracts that we have with the NFP sector that run for only 12 months; the number of contracts which are renewed only very late in the financial year, which creates great uncertainty for those organisations and their staff; and the number of contracts which do not see timely acquittals. I think we have a very important obligation, regardless of the political flavour of the party in government at the time, to ensure that we are a good purchaser of services from these NGOs.

Mr BRIGGS
 (Mayo) (11:55):  The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet obviously plays an extremely significant role across government activities. In the short time remaining, I am interested in asking the parliamentary secretary—he probably does not have full details—whether he can enlighten the parliament a bit more, given this is a very quickly moving story. Yesterday, at the end of question time, the Prime Minister announced that there would be a review or an inquiry into the events surrounding the placement of a convicted Egyptian Islamic jihadi terrorist in the low-detention facility in the Adelaide Hills for seven months, with the Department of Immigration and Citizenship knowingly having that person there, before the person was moved into high security at Villawood on 17 April, after the West Australian newspaper raised the issue. 


As I said, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet traditionally plays a cross-portfolio role in these sorts of issues and usually establishes a group which, from the public service side, leads inquiries, or the secretariat or support, and provides advice and so forth. I am wondering whether, at this stage, given the government has announced its review, it has worked through the details of what the department's commitment on assisting this review will be, to ensure that the full facts are revealed about why this convicted Islamic terrorist was put into the Inverbrackie facility, which the department of immigration knew, and no action was taken to move that person until this was made public. Given the revelations the minister for immigration made in this place during the week—that the minister was not advised, and then subsequently updated the parliament that the previous minister was advised—obviously the Prime Minister’s department will play an important role in bringing all of this together as a cross-portfolio function. Can the parliamentary secretary tell us, in the short time remaining, how much work has gone into preparing for the inquiry that was announced yesterday and how many resources will be allocated to it?

Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (11:58):  I thank the honourable member for Mayo for his question. The inquiry that was announced yesterday will be conducted by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, not the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. The independent Inspector- General of Intelligence and Security will focus attention on making sure that information is shared appropriately. But I would reinforce the point that the Prime Minister made in the House yesterday—that the individual in question was in detention at all times. That is an important factor for all members of the House to be aware of. 


It is vital that this House is not misled on this matter. It has, I think, been disappointing to see the opposition opposing the independent investigation by the Inspector-General, who has legal authority to conduct such an inquiry, and instead calling for an inquiry by a parliamentary committee that does not have authority to have such an inquiry. It is disappointing and it does speak, I think, to the opposition's willingness to use the important issue of national security as a political football.

Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (12:40):  I rise to lend the opposition's comment on the Defence Legislation Amendment (Woomera Prohibited Area) Bill 2013. A bit of history is always instructive. The Woomera Prohibited Area is our most important military testing range, established in 1947 as a long-range weapons testing facility by the UK and Australia under the Anglo-Australian Joint Project, which wound down in the seventies. 


By way of geography, the Woomera Prohibited Area is located in South Australia, 450 kilometres north-north-west of Adelaide. It is 127,000 square kilometres in size—just under half the size of New Zealand, to give some scope. It is the largest land range in the world. It has a centre-line of about 600 kilometres. Its centre-line is comparable to that of England. It is remote, as I know from having been there in 1993 with the 3rd Battalion, dealing with a particular demonstration as part of Operation Easter of Peace—I remember it well. It is unequalled in size globally. 


The Woomera Prohibited Area has a very quiet electromagnetic environment. It is an ideal test and evaluation site for Australia, its allies and its partners. It is still utilised extensively by Defence. Yet, in the eighties and nineties, it is fair to say its relative use declined and it was opened up to non-Defence users, introducing the resources sector. The majority of it is South Australian crown land. It is covered by pastoral leases and mining tenements granted by the South Australian government. The Woomera Prohibited Area overlaps a major part of South Australia’s potential for significant minerals and energy resources. It includes 30 per cent of the Gawler Craton, one of the world’s major minerals domains, and the Arckaringa, Officer and Eromanga basins for hydrocarbons and coal. Olympic Dam is adjacent to the prohibited area and of course is part of the same geological formation. Some estimates are that in the next decade $35 billion worth of iron ore, gold and other mineral resources are potentially exploitable from within the Woomera Prohibited Area, noting of course BHP’s reticence to move forward in terms of Olympic Dam; however, let us take it as read that there is a potential. 


In 2010 the government announced the Hawke review, to make recommendations on the best use of the Woomera Prohibited Area in the national interest. Dr Allan Hawke AC did the review, released in May 2011. The significant judgement underpinning the framework is that the South Australian government and Defence are key stakeholders. The review investigated how to use the Woomera Prohibited Area in a way that ensured that its full national security and economic potential was realised. It recommended that Defence remain the primary user of the area, quite rightly. It also acknowledged that exploitation of the Woomera Prohibited Area's considerable natural resources would likely bring significant economic benefit to South Australia and the nation more broadly. I do not have a problem with that, although if BHP is not moving on Olympic Dam it is a fair stretch to say that the Woomera Prohibited Area is going to save the South Australian economy. However, the review proposed that the Woomera Prohibited Area be opened up for resource exploration and mining to the maximum extent possible within the primary use of defence for Australia’s purpose. It is an important distinction the coalition wishes to make that the primary purpose of this area is for defence of Australia and its interests. The government has noted that implementation of the review and operation of the new legislative scheme require continuing close cooperation between the Defence and Resources portfolios, a statement of the bleedingly obvious. It also requires cooperation between Commonwealth agencies and of course South Australian government entities and broader stakeholders. 


It is important to note that once you give up Defence land, you never get it back again. This is the world's largest weapons test range. In terms of long-range missiles, it has a straight centre-line of 600 kilometres. There is nowhere else in the world where Australia, its allies and partners can, over land, test modern weapons over that range. If Defence's capacity to achieve that level of technology is given up, Australia and its allies will never get that type of land back again. Defence's use remains of the primacy.


This bill is designed to provide a framework—coathanger legislation, if you will—which provides certainty for all users of the Woomera Prohibited Area, Defence and non-Defence alike. It is designed to provide greater certainty over access arrangements. It allows users to make commercial decisions with some assurance as to when they will be required to leave the area because of defence activity. Importantly, the legislation will ensure the Woomera Prohibited Area remains first and foremost a national security and defence asset. I am pleased to see that is front and centre in the legislation. Ensuring that defence and national security remain a priority of the highest order is appropriate, sensible and welcome.


The fact that there will now be, to use the government's term, a 'coexistence scheme' which will allow other non-Defence users to access the Woomera Prohibited Area may be acceptable if the appropriate steps are taken to ensure the area remains available and suitable for testing of defence capability. This is a unique capability that we possess and it is of the highest priority that we retain that capability. At this point, it is important to note that the bill will not alter the current arrangements as they apply to Indigenous landholders or pastoralists with an established presence or to existing mining operations. The provisions of the bill and new coexistence scheme will apply to new users—a line in the sand, if you will. Existing users will have the option of voluntarily joining the coexistence scheme established by these measures. 


Given the Woomera Prohibited Area contains recognised traditional owners and significant Indigenous sites, it is appropriate the bill regulate how non-Defence users who gain access to it treat and protect those sites and comply with all relevant native title and Aboriginal heritage laws. The coalition is very comfortable with that. The bill ensures that Indigenous groups with current statutory and access rights expressly retain these rights and will not need to re-apply for permission under the bill. We support that; it is sensible. These are important points which we expect the Senate to examine in some detail when the bill is referred to have committee. But, on the surface, we accept it.


It is also important to note that the bill sets out the broad framework for the new coexistence scheme within the Woomera Prohibited Area. It enables the creation of new security provisions and powers, general rules, offences, penalties et cetera. It details how the new scheme will operate. This is contained within the rules which are currently open for public consultation. The rules will be jointly agreed by the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Resources and Energy. They will, I gather, be amended by regulation as required—and such regulation will be disallowable by parliament, I understand.


We are not opposed in principle to the new management framework for the Woomera Prohibited Area. Given it is highly prospective, given that there is an estimated $35 billion worth of mining development possible over the next decade, it would be churlish at best for us not to welcome it in principle. A draft of the Prohibited Area Rules has been published and written submissions were invited up until 12 July. Due to the ongoing process and following consultation with stakeholders, further scrutiny of the bill would be prudent and there is time to do that—so we should take that time. We do not oppose it. We will certainly seek to refer it to the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee to allow stakeholders—including Defence and the national security community—to put forward their views. 


This is a one-off area. There is nothing like this in the world. It is a phenomenal piece of Defence real estate. We should not rush into folly. We should take our time if we have it—and we do. Clearly we reserve our right to amend the bill post the Senate committee review. We are supportive of the government establishing an independent advisory board to monitor and report on the Woomera Prohibited Area and to oversee the implementation of the coexistence arrangements. This is important because the area may be utilised by the resources sector but will still be utilised as a strategic asset by Australia and its allies. As such, all care must be taken to ensure we do not do ourselves significant harm for short-term gain—with a longer term lack of gain.


The bill enjoys the coalition's guarded support. We will push it to the relevant committee and the Senate to further explore any unintended consequences or known unknowns. From there the coalition will make its decision and reserves its right in the Senate.

Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (12:50):  I rise to make some remarks on the Defence Legislation Amendment (Woomera Prohibited Area) Bill 2013. The bill, which facilitates mining exploration for between 14 and 70 days per year in the Woomera prohibited area, is being rushed through this parliament. The rush was apparent when public consultation on the bill allowed three working days for initial submissions. On Wednesday, 8 May, the defence minister and the resources minister released the draft exposure legislation to increase access to the Woomera prohibited area to miners. Three working days later, on 13 May, the submission period closed. That is just not good enough.


Lawyers representing the Maralinga people advised my colleague Senator Scott Ludlam last week that the consultation on this legislation has been deficient, despite approaching the defence minister on the issue in July 2011. The minister's second reading speech informs us that it was not until Friday, 24 March 2013, 12 days ago, that the South Australian government hosted a discussion between defence officials and traditional owners of Maralinga Tjarutja and APY lands about the legislation. Under the Maralinga Tjarutja Land Rights Act 1984 the Maralinga Tjarutja people have been managing all access and mining issues in relation to the 100,000 square kilometre Maralinga lands since 1984 and in relation to the former nuclear test sites since 2010. After everything these people have endured—literally the use of nuclear weapons and the resulting and ongoing health issues of being exposed to nuclear blasts and the radioactive contamination of their lands—they at least deserve the dignity of consultation over the lands that they have managed under this law for 27 years.


This bill has the capacity to diminish the land rights of these traditional owners, whose interests were not recognised in the Hawke review or the information paper. Another Aboriginal group in the area, the Kokatha people are dissatisfied that protocols in the area are being implemented. They object to the fact that sensitive sites have been disturbed and that activities have taken place in the area without the permission of the local people. It would appear that there are already problems in the handling of the Woomera area and that further opening it up to mining companies would exacerbate them.


Certainly there was a review into this question, led by Dr Allan Hawke, resulting in an 82-page report. However, a three-day consultation period is a joke. The consultation with the traditional owners has been negligent and rushed, and the same can be said of parliamentary scrutiny. Certainly the mining companies have been consulted. The South Australian Chamber of Mines and Energy is celebrating that $1 trillion stands to be made. Some 83 per cent of the mining industry in Australia is overseas owned and, according to an Australia Institute report, 81 per cent of the profits went abroad. Whether it be the South Australian government's prediction that $35 billion can be made from mining in this area or the South Australian Chamber of Mines and Energy's prediction, over 85 per cent of this money will not benefit Australia.


The Greens have been consistent in identifying the lack of fairness in whom this mining boom benefits, and this bill will simply amplify the problem. Our mineral resources are finite, and the wealth generated from exploiting these resources needs to be shared appropriately among the community while the opportunity remains. The mineral wealth potential of the area should be subject to a reconfigured mining tax, similar to that originally proposed by Treasury, to fund investments to benefit Australians for generations.


This area has an estimated 75 per cent of Australia's known uranium reserves. If uranium is mined in this area, this bill will amplify the irresponsibility of exporting dangerous radioactive materials. As members will know, Australian uranium was in each of the reactors at Fukushima when the earthquake and tsunami hit, and 160,000 people continue to be displaced from the contamination zones. The genesis of the nuclear disaster that befell Japan started here in Australia, likely from uranium sourced from BHP's Roxby mine, which is very close to Woomera. The implications are massive.


Uranium is very thirsty, and Woomera is in the driest state in the driest continent on earth. Further uranium mining in the area poses particular dangers for Australia's water security. As member's will know, due to the indenture act BHP is exempt from many of South Australia's environmental, Aboriginal heritage and water laws in operating the Roxby uranium mine. For the price of precisely nothing—not one dollar—BHP is legally able to use up to 42 million litres of water per day. This is having a very serious effect on the Mound Springs, the sensitive and unique water springs in the area of Lake Eyre. Further mining will certainly contribute to further impacts, and uranium mining will especially do so.


While the Greens are absolutely opposed to mining uranium anywhere in Australia, we are not opposed outright to other mineral exploration in the Woomera Prohibited Area if negotiations with the traditional owners can reach agreement and if strict environmental guidelines for exploration are also strictly applied inside the Commonwealth area. The Greens believe this bill should be subjected to a thorough Senate inquiry. We look forward to examining its provisions in more detail throughout that process and will seek to ensure that the environment in this area is not further degraded and that the rights of Aboriginal people are upheld.

Mr STEPHEN SMITH
 (Perth—Minister for Defence and Deputy Leader of the House) (12:56):  I thank both members for their contribution. The government of course is very keen to see that this legislation can be enacted by the parliament before the parliament is prorogued at the end of June. Its rationale for wanting to do that is to ensure that there is greater certainty for present and future access users of the Woomera Prohibited Area. I thank the member for Fadden for his in principle support and acknowledge that the Senate will look at the fine detail not just of the legislation but also of the rules which have recently been published in draft form.


I thank the member for Melbourne for his contribution. I will not rise to the occasion to respond to the Greens well-known policy of total opposition to any development which might involve uranium and general opposition to minerals resources development per se. I would prefer to deal with the point of his speech which I think has some merit and does need some response, both now and into the future. It is of course very important, and I acknowledge the member for Melbourne's contribution in this respect, that, as the legislation and the rules are progressed through the parliament, there is appropriate consultation with interested stakeholders—in particular, the Indigenous groups who have a legal interest and a philosophical and spiritual interest in the area concerned.


The first occasion on which the Department of Defence sought to consult with the relevant groups was in 2010, in the course of the Hawke review. Whilst the member may make a point about consultation on the legislation, it is not the case that this is a new issue or an issue where there is any great surprise. There has been consultation and efforts at consultation on the Woomera Prohibited Area, how the government of the day could open up greater access to new users and how the rights of existing users could be preserved. These have been in play, under consideration and in discussion with relevant groups since the Hawke review was established. The Hawke review's time period was 2010-11 and, over the period of the receipt of the Hawke review, the government, initially through me as Minister for Defence and the then minister for minerals and resources, Martin Ferguson, together with the South Australian government, made it clear that we accepted the review's recommendations and we wanted to implement them.


That is the process we are now engaging in. so far as the legislation itself and the rules are concerned, the legislation makes it expressly clear that any existing right that a current person who has access to the Woomera Prohibited Area has will be expressly preserved by this legislation. There is an express reference to the rights of Indigenous communities laid out in the relevant South Australia land rights legislation. Those rights are expressly preserved. There are, of course, in this legislative regime rules that will be published with the authority of the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Minerals and Resources which are disallowable and subject to parliamentary scrutiny. They were published on the same day that I introduced the legislation into the House some two or three weeks ago. They are also the subject of exhaustive consultation. So far as Indigenous groups and land owners are concerned, my advice is that in the course of the next week there will be further consultations on the detail of both the legislation and the rules, as is appropriate. But the primary starting point so far as the Indigenous land holders are concerned is that their existing rights are not disturbed in any way and that is expressly and advisedly made clear by the legislation. Having said that, it is important to ensure that there is good faith and confidence in the consultative processes and mechanisms, and that will occur.


If I could encourage both of my colleagues to encourage their Senate colleagues to understand the importance of this framework legislation. It will clarify the rights of new access holders; it will preserve the rights of existing land holders; and enable greater access to the area itself for the purposes of an appropriate balance between national security, reflected by the testing regime, and the economic interest which will see greater mineral resources development in that large land area. It will provide benefits to the state of South Australia and the people of South Australia, including Indigenous groups and land holders.

"Robert, Stuart, MP",LP,2013-06-06,"



Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (12:40):  I rise to lend the opposition's comment on the Defence Legislation Amendment (Woomera Prohibited Area) Bill 2013. A bit of history is always instructive. The Woomera Prohibited Area is our most important military testing range, established in 1947 as a long-range weapons testing facility by the UK and Australia under the Anglo-Australian Joint Project, which wound down in the seventies. 


By way of geography, the Woomera Prohibited Area is located in South Australia, 450 kilometres north-north-west of Adelaide. It is 127,000 square kilometres in size—just under half the size of New Zealand, to give some scope. It is the largest land range in the world. It has a centre-line of about 600 kilometres. Its centre-line is comparable to that of England. It is remote, as I know from having been there in 1993 with the 3rd Battalion, dealing with a particular demonstration as part of Operation Easter of Peace—I remember it well. It is unequalled in size globally. 


The Woomera Prohibited Area has a very quiet electromagnetic environment. It is an ideal test and evaluation site for Australia, its allies and its partners. It is still utilised extensively by Defence. Yet, in the eighties and nineties, it is fair to say its relative use declined and it was opened up to non-Defence users, introducing the resources sector. The majority of it is South Australian crown land. It is covered by pastoral leases and mining tenements granted by the South Australian government. The Woomera Prohibited Area overlaps a major part of South Australia’s potential for significant minerals and energy resources. It includes 30 per cent of the Gawler Craton, one of the world’s major minerals domains, and the Arckaringa, Officer and Eromanga basins for hydrocarbons and coal. Olympic Dam is adjacent to the prohibited area and of course is part of the same geological formation. Some estimates are that in the next decade $35 billion worth of iron ore, gold and other mineral resources are potentially exploitable from within the Woomera Prohibited Area, noting of course BHP’s reticence to move forward in terms of Olympic Dam; however, let us take it as read that there is a potential. 


In 2010 the government announced the Hawke review, to make recommendations on the best use of the Woomera Prohibited Area in the national interest. Dr Allan Hawke AC did the review, released in May 2011. The significant judgement underpinning the framework is that the South Australian government and Defence are key stakeholders. The review investigated how to use the Woomera Prohibited Area in a way that ensured that its full national security and economic potential was realised. It recommended that Defence remain the primary user of the area, quite rightly. It also acknowledged that exploitation of the Woomera Prohibited Area's considerable natural resources would likely bring significant economic benefit to South Australia and the nation more broadly. I do not have a problem with that, although if BHP is not moving on Olympic Dam it is a fair stretch to say that the Woomera Prohibited Area is going to save the South Australian economy. However, the review proposed that the Woomera Prohibited Area be opened up for resource exploration and mining to the maximum extent possible within the primary use of defence for Australia’s purpose. It is an important distinction the coalition wishes to make that the primary purpose of this area is for defence of Australia and its interests. The government has noted that implementation of the review and operation of the new legislative scheme require continuing close cooperation between the Defence and Resources portfolios, a statement of the bleedingly obvious. It also requires cooperation between Commonwealth agencies and of course South Australian government entities and broader stakeholders. 


It is important to note that once you give up Defence land, you never get it back again. This is the world's largest weapons test range. In terms of long-range missiles, it has a straight centre-line of 600 kilometres. There is nowhere else in the world where Australia, its allies and partners can, over land, test modern weapons over that range. If Defence's capacity to achieve that level of technology is given up, Australia and its allies will never get that type of land back again. Defence's use remains of the primacy.


This bill is designed to provide a framework—coathanger legislation, if you will—which provides certainty for all users of the Woomera Prohibited Area, Defence and non-Defence alike. It is designed to provide greater certainty over access arrangements. It allows users to make commercial decisions with some assurance as to when they will be required to leave the area because of defence activity. Importantly, the legislation will ensure the Woomera Prohibited Area remains first and foremost a national security and defence asset. I am pleased to see that is front and centre in the legislation. Ensuring that defence and national security remain a priority of the highest order is appropriate, sensible and welcome.


The fact that there will now be, to use the government's term, a 'coexistence scheme' which will allow other non-Defence users to access the Woomera Prohibited Area may be acceptable if the appropriate steps are taken to ensure the area remains available and suitable for testing of defence capability. This is a unique capability that we possess and it is of the highest priority that we retain that capability. At this point, it is important to note that the bill will not alter the current arrangements as they apply to Indigenous landholders or pastoralists with an established presence or to existing mining operations. The provisions of the bill and new coexistence scheme will apply to new users—a line in the sand, if you will. Existing users will have the option of voluntarily joining the coexistence scheme established by these measures. 


Given the Woomera Prohibited Area contains recognised traditional owners and significant Indigenous sites, it is appropriate the bill regulate how non-Defence users who gain access to it treat and protect those sites and comply with all relevant native title and Aboriginal heritage laws. The coalition is very comfortable with that. The bill ensures that Indigenous groups with current statutory and access rights expressly retain these rights and will not need to re-apply for permission under the bill. We support that; it is sensible. These are important points which we expect the Senate to examine in some detail when the bill is referred to have committee. But, on the surface, we accept it.


It is also important to note that the bill sets out the broad framework for the new coexistence scheme within the Woomera Prohibited Area. It enables the creation of new security provisions and powers, general rules, offences, penalties et cetera. It details how the new scheme will operate. This is contained within the rules which are currently open for public consultation. The rules will be jointly agreed by the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Resources and Energy. They will, I gather, be amended by regulation as required—and such regulation will be disallowable by parliament, I understand.


We are not opposed in principle to the new management framework for the Woomera Prohibited Area. Given it is highly prospective, given that there is an estimated $35 billion worth of mining development possible over the next decade, it would be churlish at best for us not to welcome it in principle. A draft of the Prohibited Area Rules has been published and written submissions were invited up until 12 July. Due to the ongoing process and following consultation with stakeholders, further scrutiny of the bill would be prudent and there is time to do that—so we should take that time. We do not oppose it. We will certainly seek to refer it to the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee to allow stakeholders—including Defence and the national security community—to put forward their views. 


This is a one-off area. There is nothing like this in the world. It is a phenomenal piece of Defence real estate. We should not rush into folly. We should take our time if we have it—and we do. Clearly we reserve our right to amend the bill post the Senate committee review. We are supportive of the government establishing an independent advisory board to monitor and report on the Woomera Prohibited Area and to oversee the implementation of the coexistence arrangements. This is important because the area may be utilised by the resources sector but will still be utilised as a strategic asset by Australia and its allies. As such, all care must be taken to ensure we do not do ourselves significant harm for short-term gain—with a longer term lack of gain.


The bill enjoys the coalition's guarded support. We will push it to the relevant committee and the Senate to further explore any unintended consequences or known unknowns. From there the coalition will make its decision and reserves its right in the Senate.

Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (12:50):  I rise to make some remarks on the Defence Legislation Amendment (Woomera Prohibited Area) Bill 2013. The bill, which facilitates mining exploration for between 14 and 70 days per year in the Woomera prohibited area, is being rushed through this parliament. The rush was apparent when public consultation on the bill allowed three working days for initial submissions. On Wednesday, 8 May, the defence minister and the resources minister released the draft exposure legislation to increase access to the Woomera prohibited area to miners. Three working days later, on 13 May, the submission period closed. That is just not good enough.


Lawyers representing the Maralinga people advised my colleague Senator Scott Ludlam last week that the consultation on this legislation has been deficient, despite approaching the defence minister on the issue in July 2011. The minister's second reading speech informs us that it was not until Friday, 24 March 2013, 12 days ago, that the South Australian government hosted a discussion between defence officials and traditional owners of Maralinga Tjarutja and APY lands about the legislation. Under the Maralinga Tjarutja Land Rights Act 1984 the Maralinga Tjarutja people have been managing all access and mining issues in relation to the 100,000 square kilometre Maralinga lands since 1984 and in relation to the former nuclear test sites since 2010.

Mr Shorten:
  The answer to the Honourable Members question is as follows:


(a) and (b) As part of the Future of Financial Advice reforms the Government commissioned Mr Richard St. John to undertake a review to consider the need for, and costs and benefits of a statutory compensation scheme. This review was announced in response to recommendation 10 of the report by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services Inquiry into financial products and services in Australia.


Mr St. John has since provided his final report on Compensation arrangements for consumers of financial services to the Government. On 8 May the Government released Mr St. John's report for public consultation.


Chapter 3 of that report considers 'compensation following recent licensee failures' including the compensation position of APRA regulated superannuation funds, trustees of SMSFs and of individual investors.


On 16 May the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services publically released their report following an Inquiry into the collapse of Trio Capital. This report also examines the impact on Trio Capital investors and the issue of compensation. 


The Government responded to both reports on 26 April 2013.
