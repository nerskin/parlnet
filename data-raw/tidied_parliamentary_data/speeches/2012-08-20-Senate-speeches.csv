Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (10:01):  I rise to make some comments on the Higher Education Support Amendment (Student Contribution Amounts and Other Measures) Bill 2012. There are two main parts to this bill. Obviously, as many of my colleagues have spoken to already, the first is to reinstate the student contribution amounts for mathematics, statistics and science units of study to their pre-2009 levels for domestic students. It also removes the eligibility for Commonwealth supported places and the Higher Education Loan Program schemes for Australian citizens who commence study after 1 January 2013 but do not intend to live in Australia during their courses of study.


Following the MYEFO in 2011-12 Labor announced a reversal of the then-existing policy, and the reason given was that there had not been a noticeable difference as a result in the number of the country's maths and science graduates. Certainly, from this side of the chamber, there is an acknowledgement that indeed there was not the intended result from the lower contribution that had been required. The contribution will increase from $4,691 to $8,353, but it has to be noted that there seems to be a cost-saving measure attached to this particular piece of legislation that is going to create about $1 billion in savings over four years. That is a significant saving and, given the current nature of the government's fiscal situation, it is not a surprise to see this. The assumption that it is a cost-saving measure has to be taken into account.


There is a need for action in this area—there is no doubt. There is a real lack of science and maths graduates and a dearth of students who are moving to study in that area. There is agreement with the government from this side that we need to address this shortage in maths, science and statistics. On this side we acknowledge that we need to address that. Interestingly, just nine per cent of Australian university students enrol in physics, chemistry and maths compared with an OECD average of 13 per cent and a South-East Asian average of 26 per cent. University maths majors fell by 15 per cent between 2001 and 2008. University enrolments are just one area we need to look at.


To me, it simply does not make sense to try to target students as they are entering university if we want the levels of those students doing maths and science to increase. In my view, it is simply far too late. We need to be encouraging these students way earlier—right back in primary and secondary school—and showing them the great opportunities that are available if they follow a path into maths and science. My good colleague Senator Mason made some excellent comments in his contribution about his thoughts as a young child wanting to be an astronaut. We have moved away as a culture from the aspirational ethos that Senator Mason referred to, after being focused on these types of areas. I noted that Senator Mason spoke almost derogatorily about himself becoming a senator rather than taking on those paths, but I am very glad that he did. He made the very good point that we have changed in our aspirations as young people to where we are headed, and I think it is important that that is addressed.


It is not going to be fixed, and the government tends to put forward simplistic responses. Again, with the lowering of the HECS fee, we have a simplistic response from government: 'We'll lower the costs so therefore we'll get more students.' In fact, there was a good deal of commentary at the time warning that the HECS discount policy would not actually work. Professor Bruce Chapman, from the ANU, said: 


I would expect these changes in prices to have very little effect on enrolment behaviour … People don't respond much to changes in HECS prices.


In 2007 Vice-Chancellor Steven Schwartz from Macquarie University predicted a HECS discount 'would have little effect because it was seen as too far away in the future and abstract'.


Indeed, most of these students make their decision on the course rather than a cost reduction. I would say it was a very simplistic response from the government that is not taking into account the bigger picture that Senator Mason talked so eloquently about in his contribution last week on this piece of legislation.


It is also very interesting to note that this is a combination. It is not just about the students that we need to encourage—and we do need to encourage them from a very early age. It is also the difficulty in attracting and retaining maths and science teachers. In 2006, quite some time ago, a survey was done that pointed out quite alarmingly that 75 per cent of schools were finding it difficult to recruit qualified maths teachers. Things have not really improved since then. We need to focus on this area—there are no two ways about that. The government have approached this far too simplistically. They are not thinking of the bigger picture. They are not thinking holistically about how to attract these young people and provide some incentives for them. We need to look at how to open these students' eyes to the great future in maths and science, because the current figures show that the policies in place at the moment simply are not working.


This is another example of the government's inability to properly formulate and implement policy. The Prime Minister likes to pride herself on being the 'education prime minister'. Indeed, for some time she has been talking about the education revolution: 


We’ve started the journey for the Education Revolution. We need to complete that journey for every child, in every school.


That is what the Prime Minister said at the ALP campaign launch way back in August 2010. What we are seeing again from this government, as we have seen so often, is words and not actions that actually back up those words. They throw out all the words, throw out all the trite sayings about having an education revolution and yet we look at a policy misdirection, at best, with something like this HECS reduction to try and encourage these students into maths and science. But this policy simply did not work. When we look at the inability of this government to properly formulate and deliver policy, the list is endless.


What is astonishing is that the government was trying to encourage more students to do maths and science yet, at the same time, the government cut the funding for PrimaryConnections. This is extraordinary because on the one hand the government is saying, 'We're trying to encourage students to do maths and science,' and on the other hand the government is cutting funding to one of the very programs that are instilling and inspiring a love of maths and science in young students. That is simply stupid, yet another stupid piece of policy from this Labor government. The PrimaryConnections program was initiated by the Australian Academy of Science. It established a professional learning program supported by a very strong curriculum to improve the quality and quantity of primary science teaching. In the middle of 2011, the Gillard government moved to cut funding to the program. At that time, 55 per cent of all Australian primary schools had adopted at least one of the PrimaryConnections teaching modules in their teaching programs. At the time the Australian Academy of Science said: 


At a time when Australian students’ interest in science is declining and achievement standards are slipping, it makes no sense for the Government to cut funding for primary and high school science education programs that are proven to improve teacher quality and increase students’ science knowledge and skills.


How stupid was that? Here is a government with a perfectly good program currently in place, that is shown to work and is supported across the sector, and yet the government cuts funding to it. People quite rightly get extremely frustrated and annoyed when they look at the waste and mismanagement in so many areas by this government. Yet the government cuts funding to a program for young students that was shown to work and that was trying to deliver exactly what the government was trying to do by reducing HECS debt: instilling students' interest in and aspiration to move towards maths and science. It is breathtakingly stupid! We know that Professor Brian Schmidt, from the Australian Academy of Science and the 2011 Nobel laureate in physics, saw that the worth of the program was so great that he donated $100,000 from his Nobel prize to the program. And yet we have the Labor government under the so-called 'education prime minister' with the 'education revolution' cutting funding to the program. It simply does not make sense and reflects the inability of the Labor government to properly think things through and properly come up with a process and a policy that is going to work, can be implemented and is going to be substantive. There was also a lot of concern at the time about the initial lack of commitment by the government to fund the maths and science Olympiads. Finally, thankfully, after all this period of confusion and extreme concern across the sector the government reinstated the program. All of that confusion and uncertainty was completely avoidable and completely unnecessary. The government simply made a very bad decision in moving to cut that funding when it did not have to. It was a piece of ill-thought-through policy from this Labor government.


When it comes to maths and science, these are particular concerns for me for rural and regional areas. There is no doubt there is a real disparity in the struggle that rural and regional areas, particularly the more remote areas, have to maintain the same education standards as we see in the metropolitan areas. This is particularly so in the science and maths sector. Now we have seen, from the NAPLAN results and answers to some questions on notice that I asked earlier, that regional and remote students are consistently and markedly outperformed by their metropolitan counterparts. We know it is a lot more difficult in the regions to access equity in education across a whole range of areas.


One particular inequity that still exists is for students who are trying to get independent youth allowance. The government have a $150 parental income test cap on that. Again, how stupid is that? These young students have proven themselves independent of their parents, but the government have a parental income test cap in place which precludes those students from even applying for independent youth allowance. This is one of the most stupid, inequitable pieces of policy I have seen in some time. I will continue to raise this issue until the government realise the incredibly bad impact that this is having on so many regional families.


When it comes to science and maths in the regions not only do we have to address this issue of inequity that we see in the results that are coming through; it is particularly difficult to attract and retain teachers in science and maths. In regard to filling vacant teaching positions in secondary science, ICT and maths, studies have found that schools in regional areas find it twice as likely, and remote areas four times as likely, that they will be unable to fill those vacancies compared to schools in metropolitan areas. Often this means in regional areas we are getting teachers—and I am sure they are very capable—who are not necessarily trained in maths and science to deliver those subjects. There is a whole range of areas we need to address when it comes to increasing the number of students going through the maths and science pathway. It is not as simple as just saying, 'We'll reduce the HECS fee.' That has been shown to have not been the appropriate decision to make.


The lack of attention by this government to education and university outcomes across a whole range of areas has become more and more obvious. It is not just maths and science; there is a significant lack of numbers studying agriculture and agribusiness. While the government obviously have a focus in this legislation on maths and science, I ask the government to put a similar amount of effort and focus on agriculture and agribusiness. At the moment, there are around 700 graduates in agriculture and related courses, but there are about 4,000 places in that sector that need to be filled. So the government need to start focusing on this area and making sure that this shortage is addressed. The fact that the government have not had a focus on this area just shows their complete disconnect from regional communities, whether it is what the government are doing when it comes to the Murray-Darling Basin plan or what the government are doing when it comes to the inequity for regional students trying to access university. We have seen a lack of focus from this government when it comes to education in agriculture and in agribusiness and related skills. 


The government will argue they have things in place, and I do take the point that Senator Evans has made on occasion that the government have a range of things in place. But it is not good enough. The government need to do more and to recognise it is not just the skill side of things; we need to clearly encourage more students to go to university and do those courses, to take up agriculture and take up agribusiness so that we can ensure the sustainability of the sector into the future and ensure food security into the future. One of the greatest issues for us in the future is going to be the sustainability of rural Australia, the sustainability of agriculture and making sure that we have the future food security that we are going to need. While the government are looking at maths and science, and the need to ensure that young people looking for that pathway through school and university to take on a profession in fields of maths and science, we need to be equally as focused on agriculture, agribusiness and the skills needed for that sector to thrive.


Rural and regional students are already doing it tough. While we do not oppose this legislation, we note that these students currently doing maths and science are going to face an increase from the beginning of 2013. That is particularly difficult for regional students and I make no apologies for being parochial about regional students, regional communities and regional Australia in general. But it is going to make it that bit harder for those students currently doing those courses having to face this increase because they already have to face the huge cost of relocation. It costs around $15,000 to $20,000 a year for regional students to relocate compared to city students, who do not have that financial impost. This is the point I make and have made in the past—probably to the annoyance of some because I do not stop talking about this. Regional students face this inequity because they have the cost of relocation that city students do not have to bear. For some of those students who have struggled to do that who will now face this increase in fees from early next year if they are doing those courses, we acknowledge that that is going to be difficult for them. That was unforeseen and it is something that they are now going to have to factor in. 


Having said that, we do not oppose this legislation, but we do point out the very real difficulty it is going to create for those students who are currently doing those courses. While we agree with the government that more needs to be done in this area, we ask that the Labor government focus more strongly in a broader policy sense rather than just making simplistic policy responses and take into account the very good point Senator Mason made in his speech on Friday: it is about aspiration, it is about the whole picture and changing the mindset of our young people to understand the very real opportunities that are on offer if they take the maths and science pathway.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Higher Education Support Amendment (Student Contribution Amounts and Other Measures) Bill 2012</title>,BILLS,1,1
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2012-08-20,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:21):  I rise to reluctantly support the Higher Education Support Amendment (Student Contribution Amounts and Other Measures) Bill 2012. I say 'reluctantly' because clearly there is a problem concerning the number of maths and science students. There is a problem but the solution that was advanced by the government several years ago, of rebates and HECS fees, has not worked. So the solution has not worked and we need to find an alternative solution, but it does not appear that there is a plan B with this bill. I make it clear at the outset, out of an abundance of caution, that my own son has been a beneficiary of the government's policy, which came into effect in January 2009, of a reduced unit of contributions for maths and science subjects.


It is a rare moment in politics when all sides of the political fence agree and we all agree that Australia needs more mathematics and science graduates. The government's policy, which this bill seeks to reverse, sought to address that shortage. Unfortunately, the policy proved ineffective and the government itself admits the program is not delivering value for money. My son, for example, had already planned on studying maths and science subjects as part of his double degree before the measure was introduced. The bottom line is that the policy has not seen a significant increase in enrolments in the maths and sciences.


For Australia to be able to compete in the global market, we need more mathematicians and scientists. Our skill sets in these areas are under threat if we do not find a way to attract more students to these disciplines. It is a complex issue which I believe needs a multifaceted approach, including better education at primary and secondary levels, incentives for tertiary students for tertiary studies and investment in research and development to ensure we not only have jobs for graduates in these fields but also put ourselves at the forefront of maths and science on the global stage. 


A 2010 Group of Eight universities review—the Review of education in mathematics, data science and quantitative disciplines—found maths and quantitative sciences in Australia were at a 'dangerous level'. In May this year, Australian Chief Scientist Professor Ian Chubb told the National Press Club:


The future prosperity of Australia is dependent on having a strong supply of graduates in the right areas coming through the education system.


In launching the Health of Australian science report, he said:


There are some areas of expertise that are crucial to our national interest which are lacking what they need to prosper.


The report identified mathematics and chemistry as in this group, along with agricultural sciences and physics. I note that Senator Nash in her contribution did make mention of agricultural sciences.


As well as addressing funding systems, the report said the relationships between science and industry must be strengthened. How do we achieve this? I believe we need to start at the beginning—to crawl before we can walk—and that means getting young students—primary and secondary school students—excited about maths and science. We not only need to get them excited about maths and science; we also need to give them the skills they need to go on and be confident studying maths and science at a tertiary level. This means changing the way we approach education in relation to maths and science. Even if cash bonuses were involved, which I will get to later, we are unlikely to attract more maths and science university students unless we teach them the beauty of maths and science in their formative years. Committing to a three- or four-year university course can be a daunting prospect for a young person fresh out of secondary school and it is human nature that one would only invest such time and effort in a subject that interested them. If we do not invest now in preparing our young people for careers in maths and science, Australia will be the one to suffer.


We must look to our Asian neighbours in how to go about this. We know that Asian countries continue to forge ahead of us in maths and science, so how do they do it? According to a report released by the Grattan Institute in February this year, it is not about spending more money, nor about class size or whether the school is public or private. What it comes down to, the report said, is better teaching skills that improve how students learn. When the report was released, Grattan Institute program director of school education Ben Jensen said that the results of teacher bonuses and school funding touted by the Gonski review were negligible compared to a focus on improving teaching demonstrated in Asia. According to the Asian way of educating, there should be more focus on teaching skills during university training rather than subjects like philosophy—but I am not knocking philosophy; I think it is a question of emphasis. Mentoring of teachers is also critical and teacher training should continue after university study ends. We have to wonder if this focus on teaching is at all linked to the high rates of maths and science graduates in Asia compared to Australia. In Australia in 2010, just 18 per cent of graduates came from the sciences, technologies, engineering and mathematics areas. Compare this with 64 per cent for Japan, 52 per cent in China and 41 per cent in South Korea. 


Just a moment ago I mentioned the Gonski review. I reiterate that I believe the review is an important piece of work that is a critical piece of the puzzle to improve education in Australia. In its executive summary, the review says:


In 2000, only one country outperformed Australia in reading and scientific literacy and only two outperformed Australia in mathematical literacy. By 2009, six countries outperformed Australia in reading and scientific literacy and 12 outperformed Australia in mathematical literacy.


The picture is very clear. In international terms we are going downhill, particularly when it comes to maths. Especially significant in the Gonski review findings is the gap between low- and high-performance students and the link to socioeconomic status. It is imperative that all our young people get a fair go at education and access to teaching that gives them the opportunity to develop. This applies to all areas of education, including maths and science. I urge the government not to delay its special response to the review.


While preparing our young people for possible university study is critical, we must continue to think laterally about we can attract them to professions in mathematics and the sciences. Professor Ian Chubb this year suggested $10,000 cash incentives to maths and science graduates who commit to a few years of teaching at the end of their course. That could be the answer. I would be interested to hear whether the government has a view on what Professor Ian Chubb has said about cash incentives. There is nothing quite like cold hard cash to motivate people. The trick is motivating the right people. We want people who will contribute to the maths and sciences areas in Australia for years to come—people who will share their expertise to benefit Australia in an increasingly competitive global market.


The University of Canberra just last month revealed it was considering an Australian first: a multidisciplinary faculty which would bring education, applied science, mathematics and statistics under the one roof. According to the Canberra Times, the faculty would aim to produce more maths and science skilled teachers and graduates who have the communication skills to share their enthusiasm about maths and science with others.


Dr Louise Ryan is a professor of mathematical sciences at the University of Technology Sydney and was previously chief of the CSIRO's division of mathematics, information and statistics. I am very grateful for the information and advice she has given to my office on this issue. According to Professor Ryan, we need to look at modern ways of training students. She said maths and science courses should teach students the art and importance of communication so that they learn how to engage with the real world in their chosen field. Professor Ryan spoke very highly of the Australian Technology Network's industry doctoral training centre in mathematics and statistics, Australia's first industry-collaborative doctoral-training centre, which took its first students this year. Professor Ryan was previously on the program's advisory board and says it is industry based rather than academia based doctoral training—perfect for students to learn how to apply their skills in the workplace.


I note the work that my colleague Senator Madigan has done on the parliamentary manufacturing and farming program and the importance of tying in these young people with expertise in the maths and sciences in terms of innovation for manufacturing, which is so desperately needed for our manufacturing to be able to compete on the global stage—particularly in the context of a ridiculously high Australian dollar. We need that expertise. We need to be able to harness that knowledge and expertise and those skills into our manufacturing sector, and this is one particular way of doing it.


Professor Ryan believes that if there were more training like this we could attract more people to the maths and science disciplines. Professor Ryan said that a CSIRO graduate fellows program that has been running for three years is proving hugely successful with students. This program sees honours graduates in maths and statistics get a taste for researching before they decide whether to go on to study for a PhD or go into the workforce. It is aimed at tackling the low numbers of students studying maths in Australia. Professor Ryan said it was inspiring to hear the students in the program talking about how excited they were about their work.


It is programs just like these that we must continue to support. Research and development is critical to ensuring we continue to advance in these fields, which are essential to Australia being prosperous and competitive on the global stage into the future. As the Health of Australian science report of this year says:


Basic research adds to the bank of intellectual capital on which society draws in order to progress and transform. Applied research develops this intellectual capital into new technologies and innovative processes that directly improve the health, productivity and prosperity of Australia.


I do not think you could sum up the importance of research and development any better than that.


We must continue to invest in research and development of maths and sciences through the Australian Research Council, the National Health and Medical Research Council and the Cooperative Research Centres program. We should also remember the importance of international collaboration. We have great talent here in Australia and, where possible, we should see that talent work with international minds to see us at the forefront of maths and science knowledge instead of slipping further and further behind on the global stage. And let us not forget that investment in research and development will also help ensure that there are jobs waiting for graduates.


We must also consider, as I indicated, our high Australian dollar and the impact it is having on our manufacturing industry. If we had a thriving manufacturing industry it would create much-needed jobs for maths and science graduates. The issue of closing the ever-increasing gap in our mathematical and scientific expertise is complex, and I have only scratched the surface today.


The intent of the policy of this bill was good, but the outcome is not as we had hoped. The government quite rightly identified a problem. The solution it came up with has not worked. The government needs to come up with an alternative solution. There must be a plan B, and I am not so sure that there is. I would be very grateful if, in its response to contributions in the second reading debate on this bill, the government could indicate what practical, viable measures it is proposing as an alternative to this to try to get an increase in maths and science students and graduates.


I reluctantly support this bill, but I am adamant that the issue must stay on the agenda and that we must consider other ways to redress the shortfall which, if ignored, will only get worse. Australia has many bright minds and, in the words of Professor Ian Chubb:


It is antithetical to our national interest to waste talent.

"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2012-08-20,"



Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (10:34):  I begin by thanking those senators who spoke on the Higher Education Support Amendment (Student Contribution Amounts and Other Measures) Bill 2012. The bill before the Senate amends the Higher Education Support Act 2003 to increase the maximum student contribution amount for units of study in mathematics, statistics and science. The bill removes eligibility for Commonwealth-supported places and the Higher Education Loan Program schemes for Australian citizens who will not undertake any of their course study in Australia. From 1 January 2013, all students will pay the increased maximum student contribution amount for units of study in maths and science, regardless of when they commenced their course of study.


The government believes the reduction in student contributions for maths and science that commenced for students starting a course of study from 1 January 2009 was not delivering value for money. The majority of students undertaking maths and science units in 2009 and 2010 were not enrolled in a maths or science course of study. Nor were they studying an education course. It is clear the policy was not substantially increasing the number of maths and science graduates in the workforce as intended, or improving the supply of quality maths and science teachers. Improving the supply of quality maths and science teachers is a priority for the government, which is why it announced a $54 million package in the 2012-13 budget to enhance student engagement in maths and science from primary to tertiary.


The government is removing eligibility for Commonwealth-supported places and the HELP schemes for Australian citizens who will not undertake any of their course of study in Australia. The amendment applies to Australian citizens who are living overseas on an ongoing basis. The government believes its funding priority should be to support those students who are most likely to pursue careers in Australia, repay their HELP debts and use their education to benefit Australia's workforce and economic needs. The small number of students who are not resident in Australia and who are currently enrolled in Commonwealth-supported places or who are accessing HELP will continue to be eligible for the schemes for the duration of their current course. This amendment complements last year's changes to the act, clarifying that Australian citizens are not entitled to Commonwealth support or to access HELP when they are undertaking courses of study primarily at an overseas campus.

That is a significant saving and, given the current nature of the government's fiscal situation, it is not a surprise to see this. The assumption that it is a cost-saving measure has to be taken into account.

There is agreement with the government from this side that we need to address this shortage in maths, science and statistics. On this side we acknowledge that we need to address that.

University maths majors fell by 15 per cent between 2001 and 2008. University enrolments are just one area we need to look at.


To me, it simply does not make sense to try to target students as they are entering university if we want the levels of those students doing maths and science to increase. In my view, it is simply far too late. We need to be encouraging these students way earlier—right back in primary and secondary school—and showing them the great opportunities that are available if they follow a path into maths and science. My good colleague Senator Mason made some excellent comments in his contribution about his thoughts as a young child wanting to be an astronaut. We have moved away as a culture from the aspirational ethos that Senator Mason referred to, after being focused on these types of areas. I noted that Senator Mason spoke almost derogatorily about himself becoming a senator rather than taking on those paths, but I am very glad that he did. He made the very good point that we have changed in our aspirations as young people to where we are headed, and I think it is important that that is addressed.


It is not going to be fixed, and the government tends to put forward simplistic responses. Again, with the lowering of the HECS fee, we have a simplistic response from government: 'We'll lower the costs so therefore we'll get more students.' In fact, there was a good deal of commentary at the time warning that the HECS discount policy would not actually work. Professor Bruce Chapman, from the ANU, said: 


I would expect these changes in prices to have very little effect on enrolment behaviour … People don't respond much to changes in HECS prices.


In 2007 Vice-Chancellor Steven Schwartz from Macquarie University predicted a HECS discount 'would have little effect because it was seen as too far away in the future and abstract'.


Indeed, most of these students make their decision on the course rather than a cost reduction. I would say it was a very simplistic response from the government that is not taking into account the bigger picture that Senator Mason talked so eloquently about in his contribution last week on this piece of legislation.


It is also very interesting to note that this is a combination. It is not just about the students that we need to encourage—and we do need to encourage them from a very early age. It is also the difficulty in attracting and retaining maths and science teachers. In 2006, quite some time ago, a survey was done that pointed out quite alarmingly that 75 per cent of schools were finding it difficult to recruit qualified maths teachers. Things have not really improved since then. We need to focus on this area—there are no two ways about that. The government have approached this far too simplistically. They are not thinking of the bigger picture. They are not thinking holistically about how to attract these young people and provide some incentives for them. We need to look at how to open these students' eyes to the great future in maths and science, because the current figures show that the policies in place at the moment simply are not working.


This is another example of the government's inability to properly formulate and implement policy. The Prime Minister likes to pride herself on being the 'education prime minister'. Indeed, for some time she has been talking about the education revolution: 


We’ve started the journey for the Education Revolution. We need to complete that journey for every child, in every school.


That is what the Prime Minister said at the ALP campaign launch way back in August 2010. What we are seeing again from this government, as we have seen so often, is words and not actions that actually back up those words. They throw out all the words, throw out all the trite sayings about having an education revolution and yet we look at a policy misdirection, at best, with something like this HECS reduction to try and encourage these students into maths and science. But this policy simply did not work. When we look at the inability of this government to properly formulate and deliver policy, the list is endless.


What is astonishing is that the government was trying to encourage more students to do maths and science yet, at the same time, the government cut the funding for PrimaryConnections. This is extraordinary because on the one hand the government is saying, 'We're trying to encourage students to do maths and science,' and on the other hand the government is cutting funding to one of the very programs that are instilling and inspiring a love of maths and science in young students. That is simply stupid, yet another stupid piece of policy from this Labor government. The PrimaryConnections program was initiated by the Australian Academy of Science. It established a professional learning program supported by a very strong curriculum to improve the quality and quantity of primary science teaching. In the middle of 2011, the Gillard government moved to cut funding to the program. At that time, 55 per cent of all Australian primary schools had adopted at least one of the PrimaryConnections teaching modules in their teaching programs. At the time the Australian Academy of Science said: 


At a time when Australian students’ interest in science is declining and achievement standards are slipping, it makes no sense for the Government to cut funding for primary and high school science education programs that are proven to improve teacher quality and increase students’ science knowledge and skills.


How stupid was that? Here is a government with a perfectly good program currently in place, that is shown to work and is supported across the sector, and yet the government cuts funding to it. People quite rightly get extremely frustrated and annoyed when they look at the waste and mismanagement in so many areas by this government. Yet the government cuts funding to a program for young students that was shown to work and that was trying to deliver exactly what the government was trying to do by reducing HECS debt: instilling students' interest in and aspiration to move towards maths and science. It is breathtakingly stupid! We know that Professor Brian Schmidt, from the Australian Academy of Science and the 2011 Nobel laureate in physics, saw that the worth of the program was so great that he donated $100,000 from his Nobel prize to the program. And yet we have the Labor government under the so-called 'education prime minister' with the 'education revolution' cutting funding to the program. It simply does not make sense and reflects the inability of the Labor government to properly think things through and properly come up with a process and a policy that is going to work, can be implemented and is going to be substantive. There was also a lot of concern at the time about the initial lack of commitment by the government to fund the maths and science Olympiads. Finally, thankfully, after all this period of confusion and extreme concern across the sector the government reinstated the program. All of that confusion and uncertainty was completely avoidable and completely unnecessary. The government simply made a very bad decision in moving to cut that funding when it did not have to. It was a piece of ill-thought-through policy from this Labor government.


When it comes to maths and science, these are particular concerns for me for rural and regional areas. There is no doubt there is a real disparity in the struggle that rural and regional areas, particularly the more remote areas, have to maintain the same education standards as we see in the metropolitan areas. This is particularly so in the science and maths sector. Now we have seen, from the NAPLAN results and answers to some questions on notice that I asked earlier, that regional and remote students are consistently and markedly outperformed by their metropolitan counterparts. We know it is a lot more difficult in the regions to access equity in education across a whole range of areas.


One particular inequity that still exists is for students who are trying to get independent youth allowance. The government have a $150 parental income test cap on that. Again, how stupid is that? These young students have proven themselves independent of their parents, but the government have a parental income test cap in place which precludes those students from even applying for independent youth allowance. This is one of the most stupid, inequitable pieces of policy I have seen in some time. I will continue to raise this issue until the government realise the incredibly bad impact that this is having on so many regional families.


When it comes to science and maths in the regions not only do we have to address this issue of inequity that we see in the results that are coming through; it is particularly difficult to attract and retain teachers in science and maths. In regard to filling vacant teaching positions in secondary science, ICT and maths, studies have found that schools in regional areas find it twice as likely, and remote areas four times as likely, that they will be unable to fill those vacancies compared to schools in metropolitan areas. Often this means in regional areas we are getting teachers—and I am sure they are very capable—who are not necessarily trained in maths and science to deliver those subjects. There is a whole range of areas we need to address when it comes to increasing the number of students going through the maths and science pathway. It is not as simple as just saying, 'We'll reduce the HECS fee.' That has been shown to have not been the appropriate decision to make.


The lack of attention by this government to education and university outcomes across a whole range of areas has become more and more obvious. It is not just maths and science; there is a significant lack of numbers studying agriculture and agribusiness. While the government obviously have a focus in this legislation on maths and science, I ask the government to put a similar amount of effort and focus on agriculture and agribusiness. At the moment, there are around 700 graduates in agriculture and related courses, but there are about 4,000 places in that sector that need to be filled. So the government need to start focusing on this area and making sure that this shortage is addressed. The fact that the government have not had a focus on this area just shows their complete disconnect from regional communities, whether it is what the government are doing when it comes to the Murray-Darling Basin plan or what the government are doing when it comes to the inequity for regional students trying to access university. We have seen a lack of focus from this government when it comes to education in agriculture and in agribusiness and related skills. 


The government will argue they have things in place, and I do take the point that Senator Evans has made on occasion that the government have a range of things in place. But it is not good enough. The government need to do more and to recognise it is not just the skill side of things; we need to clearly encourage more students to go to university and do those courses, to take up agriculture and take up agribusiness so that we can ensure the sustainability of the sector into the future and ensure food security into the future. One of the greatest issues for us in the future is going to be the sustainability of rural Australia, the sustainability of agriculture and making sure that we have the future food security that we are going to need. While the government are looking at maths and science, and the need to ensure that young people looking for that pathway through school and university to take on a profession in fields of maths and science, we need to be equally as focused on agriculture, agribusiness and the skills needed for that sector to thrive.


Rural and regional students are already doing it tough. While we do not oppose this legislation, we note that these students currently doing maths and science are going to face an increase from the beginning of 2013. That is particularly difficult for regional students and I make no apologies for being parochial about regional students, regional communities and regional Australia in general. But it is going to make it that bit harder for those students currently doing those courses having to face this increase because they already have to face the huge cost of relocation. It costs around $15,000 to $20,000 a year for regional students to relocate compared to city students, who do not have that financial impost. This is the point I make and have made in the past—probably to the annoyance of some because I do not stop talking about this. Regional students face this inequity because they have the cost of relocation that city students do not have to bear. For some of those students who have struggled to do that who will now face this increase in fees from early next year if they are doing those courses, we acknowledge that that is going to be difficult for them. That was unforeseen and it is something that they are now going to have to factor in. 


Having said that, we do not oppose this legislation, but we do point out the very real difficulty it is going to create for those students who are currently doing those courses. While we agree with the government that more needs to be done in this area, we ask that the Labor government focus more strongly in a broader policy sense rather than just making simplistic policy responses and take into account the very good point Senator Mason made in his speech on Friday: it is about aspiration, it is about the whole picture and changing the mindset of our young people to understand the very real opportunities that are on offer if they take the maths and science pathway.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2012-08-20,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:21):  I rise to reluctantly support the Higher Education Support Amendment (Student Contribution Amounts and Other Measures) Bill 2012. I say 'reluctantly' because clearly there is a problem concerning the number of maths and science students. There is a problem but the solution that was advanced by the government several years ago, of rebates and HECS fees, has not worked. So the solution has not worked and we need to find an alternative solution, but it does not appear that there is a plan B with this bill. I make it clear at the outset, out of an abundance of caution, that my own son has been a beneficiary of the government's policy, which came into effect in January 2009, of a reduced unit of contributions for maths and science subjects.


It is a rare moment in politics when all sides of the political fence agree and we all agree that Australia needs more mathematics and science graduates. The government's policy, which this bill seeks to reverse, sought to address that shortage. Unfortunately, the policy proved ineffective and the government itself admits the program is not delivering value for money. My son, for example, had already planned on studying maths and science subjects as part of his double degree before the measure was introduced. The bottom line is that the policy has not seen a significant increase in enrolments in the maths and sciences.


For Australia to be able to compete in the global market, we need more mathematicians and scientists. Our skill sets in these areas are under threat if we do not find a way to attract more students to these disciplines. It is a complex issue which I believe needs a multifaceted approach, including better education at primary and secondary levels, incentives for tertiary students for tertiary studies and investment in research and development to ensure we not only have jobs for graduates in these fields but also put ourselves at the forefront of maths and science on the global stage. 


A 2010 Group of Eight universities review—the Review of education in mathematics, data science and quantitative disciplines—found maths and quantitative sciences in Australia were at a 'dangerous level'. In May this year, Australian Chief Scientist Professor Ian Chubb told the National Press Club:


The future prosperity of Australia is dependent on having a strong supply of graduates in the right areas coming through the education system.


In launching the Health of Australian science report, he said:


There are some areas of expertise that are crucial to our national interest which are lacking what they need to prosper.


The report identified mathematics and chemistry as in this group, along with agricultural sciences and physics. I note that Senator Nash in her contribution did make mention of agricultural sciences.


As well as addressing funding systems, the report said the relationships between science and industry must be strengthened. How do we achieve this? I believe we need to start at the beginning—to crawl before we can walk—and that means getting young students—primary and secondary school students—excited about maths and science. We not only need to get them excited about maths and science; we also need to give them the skills they need to go on and be confident studying maths and science at a tertiary level. This means changing the way we approach education in relation to maths and science. Even if cash bonuses were involved, which I will get to later, we are unlikely to attract more maths and science university students unless we teach them the beauty of maths and science in their formative years. Committing to a three- or four-year university course can be a daunting prospect for a young person fresh out of secondary school and it is human nature that one would only invest such time and effort in a subject that interested them. If we do not invest now in preparing our young people for careers in maths and science, Australia will be the one to suffer.


We must look to our Asian neighbours in how to go about this. We know that Asian countries continue to forge ahead of us in maths and science, so how do they do it? According to a report released by the Grattan Institute in February this year, it is not about spending more money, nor about class size or whether the school is public or private. What it comes down to, the report said, is better teaching skills that improve how students learn. When the report was released, Grattan Institute program director of school education Ben Jensen said that the results of teacher bonuses and school funding touted by the Gonski review were negligible compared to a focus on improving teaching demonstrated in Asia. According to the Asian way of educating, there should be more focus on teaching skills during university training rather than subjects like philosophy—but I am not knocking philosophy; I think it is a question of emphasis. Mentoring of teachers is also critical and teacher training should continue after university study ends. We have to wonder if this focus on teaching is at all linked to the high rates of maths and science graduates in Asia compared to Australia. In Australia in 2010, just 18 per cent of graduates came from the sciences, technologies, engineering and mathematics areas. Compare this with 64 per cent for Japan, 52 per cent in China and 41 per cent in South Korea. 


Just a moment ago I mentioned the Gonski review. I reiterate that I believe the review is an important piece of work that is a critical piece of the puzzle to improve education in Australia. In its executive summary, the review says:


In 2000, only one country outperformed Australia in reading and scientific literacy and only two outperformed Australia in mathematical literacy. By 2009, six countries outperformed Australia in reading and scientific literacy and 12 outperformed Australia in mathematical literacy.


The picture is very clear. In international terms we are going downhill, particularly when it comes to maths. Especially significant in the Gonski review findings is the gap between low- and high-performance students and the link to socioeconomic status. It is imperative that all our young people get a fair go at education and access to teaching that gives them the opportunity to develop. This applies to all areas of education, including maths and science. I urge the government not to delay its special response to the review.


While preparing our young people for possible university study is critical, we must continue to think laterally about we can attract them to professions in mathematics and the sciences. Professor Ian Chubb this year suggested $10,000 cash incentives to maths and science graduates who commit to a few years of teaching at the end of their course. That could be the answer. I would be interested to hear whether the government has a view on what Professor Ian Chubb has said about cash incentives. There is nothing quite like cold hard cash to motivate people. The trick is motivating the right people. We want people who will contribute to the maths and sciences areas in Australia for years to come—people who will share their expertise to benefit Australia in an increasingly competitive global market.


The University of Canberra just last month revealed it was considering an Australian first: a multidisciplinary faculty which would bring education, applied science, mathematics and statistics under the one roof. According to the Canberra Times, the faculty would aim to produce more maths and science skilled teachers and graduates who have the communication skills to share their enthusiasm about maths and science with others.


Dr Louise Ryan is a professor of mathematical sciences at the University of Technology Sydney and was previously chief of the CSIRO's division of mathematics, information and statistics. I am very grateful for the information and advice she has given to my office on this issue. According to Professor Ryan, we need to look at modern ways of training students. She said maths and science courses should teach students the art and importance of communication so that they learn how to engage with the real world in their chosen field. Professor Ryan spoke very highly of the Australian Technology Network's industry doctoral training centre in mathematics and statistics, Australia's first industry-collaborative doctoral-training centre, which took its first students this year. Professor Ryan was previously on the program's advisory board and says it is industry based rather than academia based doctoral training—perfect for students to learn how to apply their skills in the workplace.


I note the work that my colleague Senator Madigan has done on the parliamentary manufacturing and farming program and the importance of tying in these young people with expertise in the maths and sciences in terms of innovation for manufacturing, which is so desperately needed for our manufacturing to be able to compete on the global stage—particularly in the context of a ridiculously high Australian dollar. We need that expertise. We need to be able to harness that knowledge and expertise and those skills into our manufacturing sector, and this is one particular way of doing it.


Professor Ryan believes that if there were more training like this we could attract more people to the maths and science disciplines. Professor Ryan said that a CSIRO graduate fellows program that has been running for three years is proving hugely successful with students. This program sees honours graduates in maths and statistics get a taste for researching before they decide whether to go on to study for a PhD or go into the workforce. It is aimed at tackling the low numbers of students studying maths in Australia. Professor Ryan said it was inspiring to hear the students in the program talking about how excited they were about their work.


It is programs just like these that we must continue to support. Research and development is critical to ensuring we continue to advance in these fields, which are essential to Australia being prosperous and competitive on the global stage into the future. As the Health of Australian science report of this year says:


Basic research adds to the bank of intellectual capital on which society draws in order to progress and transform. Applied research develops this intellectual capital into new technologies and innovative processes that directly improve the health, productivity and prosperity of Australia.


I do not think you could sum up the importance of research and development any better than that.


We must continue to invest in research and development of maths and sciences through the Australian Research Council, the National Health and Medical Research Council and the Cooperative Research Centres program. We should also remember the importance of international collaboration. We have great talent here in Australia and, where possible, we should see that talent work with international minds to see us at the forefront of maths and science knowledge instead of slipping further and further behind on the global stage. And let us not forget that investment in research and development will also help ensure that there are jobs waiting for graduates.


We must also consider, as I indicated, our high Australian dollar and the impact it is having on our manufacturing industry. If we had a thriving manufacturing industry it would create much-needed jobs for maths and science graduates. The issue of closing the ever-increasing gap in our mathematical and scientific expertise is complex, and I have only scratched the surface today.


The intent of the policy of this bill was good, but the outcome is not as we had hoped. The government quite rightly identified a problem. The solution it came up with has not worked. The government needs to come up with an alternative solution. There must be a plan B, and I am not so sure that there is. I would be very grateful if, in its response to contributions in the second reading debate on this bill, the government could indicate what practical, viable measures it is proposing as an alternative to this to try to get an increase in maths and science students and graduates.


I reluctantly support this bill, but I am adamant that the issue must stay on the agenda and that we must consider other ways to redress the shortfall which, if ignored, will only get worse. Australia has many bright minds and, in the words of Professor Ian Chubb:


It is antithetical to our national interest to waste talent.

Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (10:34):  I begin by thanking those senators who spoke on the Higher Education Support Amendment (Student Contribution Amounts and Other Measures) Bill 2012. The bill before the Senate amends the Higher Education Support Act 2003 to increase the maximum student contribution amount for units of study in mathematics, statistics and science. The bill removes eligibility for Commonwealth-supported places and the Higher Education Loan Program schemes for Australian citizens who will not undertake any of their course study in Australia. From 1 January 2013, all students will pay the increased maximum student contribution amount for units of study in maths and science, regardless of when they commenced their course of study.


The government believes the reduction in student contributions for maths and science that commenced for students starting a course of study from 1 January 2009 was not delivering value for money. The majority of students undertaking maths and science units in 2009 and 2010 were not enrolled in a maths or science course of study. Nor were they studying an education course. It is clear the policy was not substantially increasing the number of maths and science graduates in the workforce as intended, or improving the supply of quality maths and science teachers. Improving the supply of quality maths and science teachers is a priority for the government, which is why it announced a $54 million package in the 2012-13 budget to enhance student engagement in maths and science from primary to tertiary.


The government is removing eligibility for Commonwealth-supported places and the HELP schemes for Australian citizens who will not undertake any of their course of study in Australia. The amendment applies to Australian citizens who are living overseas on an ongoing basis. The government believes its funding priority should be to support those students who are most likely to pursue careers in Australia, repay their HELP debts and use their education to benefit Australia's workforce and economic needs. The small number of students who are not resident in Australia and who are currently enrolled in Commonwealth-supported places or who are accessing HELP will continue to be eligible for the schemes for the duration of their current course. This amendment complements last year's changes to the act, clarifying that Australian citizens are not entitled to Commonwealth support or to access HELP when they are undertaking courses of study primarily at an overseas campus.

Senator CHRIS EVANS
 (Western Australia—Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (15:01):  I seek leave to incorporate an answer to a question that Senator Milne put to me in my responsibility as representing the Minister for Resources and Energy on 14 August.


Leave granted. 




The answer read as follows— 




MILNE (14:22): When can the community expect the implementation of a national energy savings initiative?


 


As agreed by the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee, the Government is presently undertaking investigations into the merits of a national Energy Savings Initiative.


The Energy Savings Initiative Working Group released an Issues Paper and Modelling Assumptions Report for public comment in December 2011.


A Progress Report is expected to be publicly released in the near future.


No decision to implement a national Energy Savings Initiative has been taken, nor have final design details been decided.


Any final decision to adopt a national Energy Savings Initiative will be conditional on the agreement of Council of Australian Governments (COAG) members and all existing states schemes folding into a national scheme.



MILNE (14:24): Why did Minister Ferguson claim that the NEM objective is universally supported, when the evidence is to the contrary?


 


Minister, can you tell me which of the ongoing inquiries address the question of whether the national electricity objective should be amended to incorporate sustainability and climate change?


So what is the evidence for the statement and which review actually addresses the objectives of the NEM?


The National Electricity Market Objective promotes the long-term interests of energy consumers with regard to price, quality and reliability of electricity and gas services.


These are reflected within the National Electricity Law, the National Gas Law and the National Energy Retail Law.


While there are groups that have argued for change to the Objective, the prevailing outcome has always been that the Objective remains appropriate to the operation of Australia's National Electricity Market.


Most recently, the Ministerial Council on Energy considered the matter of the objective in its development of the National Energy Customer Framework.


It was noted in the Second Reading Speech for the template South Australian legislation for that framework that ""adopting an equivalent objective [to that in the National Electricity Law] for the Customer Framework will ensure that the national energy regimes remain focussed on the long term interests of consumers. This is a fundamental principle agreed between governments in the Australian Energy Market Agreement.""


In addition, the Australian Government's Draft Energy White Paper noted that ""To change or expand these now risks distorting the market by introducing unnecessary confusion for market participants. It is also far from clear how non-energy policy goals could be coherently reflected in a single set of market rules. These issues are best dealt with outside the market settings, as this allows for more targeted, and therefore more effective action.""


The Australian Government remains confident that the current Objective remains robust to provide for the effective operation of the NEM, with carbon policy and other environmental issues appropriately addressed through separate legislation and mechanisms such as the Clean Energy Act.

"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2012-08-20,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (15:01):  I rise to move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation (Senator Wong) to questions without notice asked by Senators Cormann, Sinodinos and Williams today relating to the carbon tax.


There was something which was apparent in Senator Wong's answers to questions today, that she is finding our questioning on the carbon tax a little bit tedious and a little bit wearing. I have got to be honest and say we are actually finding asking those questions a little bit tedious and a little bit wearing because we continue to get no answers from the minister. It is also a little tedious because the facts remain unchanged, that this carbon tax is a massive hit on the Australian economy and that this carbon tax represents a breach of faith with the Australian people and represents a lie. So she had better get used to getting these questions because we will continue to ask them, no matter how tedious and no matter how repetitive, because answers to these questions deserve to be on the public record.


We want to continue to make the point, as Senator Cormann did in his question, that in the first three years of this carbon tax it is going to rake in $18 billion of revenue. We want to continue to make the point that Australia's 23 million people are going to be paying on average $115 million per week in comparison to the 502 million people in the EU who will only pay $23 million per week. The carbon tax burden is five times higher in Australia than that in the 13 nations of the EU ETS, a grouping whose GDP is 14 times that of Australia's. This is comparatively a massive burden compared to what Europe is being confronted with. We also had a question from Senator Sinodinos to Senator Wong pointing out that in a survey 66 per cent of small businesses indicated that they were absorbing the cost of the carbon tax rather than passing it on to their customers. Small business is in an invidious position. Do they take it on, absorb it, reduce their profitability and reduce their own viability or do they pass the carbon tax on to their customers, potentially driving customers away, pricing themselves out of the market that they operate in and, again, potentially affecting the profitability and viability of their business? It is a very invidious position to be in.


I want to give you a bit of an indication, Mr Deputy President, of the attitude of the Australian Labor Party to business. I was at a gathering in Dandenong of the South East Melbourne Manufacturers Association last year and the guest speaker was Mr Mark Dreyfus QC on the subject of 'why the carbon tax is good for your business'. I have got to tell you the people there, the manufacturers from Melbourne's south-east, were wanting to strip flesh from the body of Mr Dreyfus but they were very restrained and they were very polite in the question-and-answer session. 


One manufacturer stood up and said, 'Mr Dreyfus, my business is that we are a manufacturer and my power bill is going to go up by $100,000 a year,' and Mark Dreyfus's response was, 'Well, that just proves my point, that the effect of the carbon tax is modest.' Mr Dreyfus was asked another question by a manufacturer of medical devices who said, 'Look, our main product costs $1,500 to produce and we only have a margin of about $15 on that and the carbon tax is going to completely wipe out our profit on this product,' and Mark Dreyfus's response was, 'Well, I think what that tells me is that your business has other problems, doesn't it?' That was the response of Mark Dreyfus QC, man of the people, in touch with local business, in touch with his constituents! He has no idea. I think Mr Dreyfus probably takes some lessons from the Senator Wong school of empathy with the Australian business community. 


Mr Deputy President, you only need to talk to Australian businesses, be they small or medium, to find out that in the real world, in the real economy where people actually employ individuals and try and make money to provide for their families, this carbon tax will have a devastating effect. We await with bated breath answers from Senator Wong to the questions we posed.

Senator CROSSIN
 (Northern Territory) (15:07):  I rise in response to the taking note of the answers this afternoon. I have to say I am a little disappointed, Senator Fifield, that you are not taking note of the answer to Senator Mason's questions, but perhaps we will get on to debate about education at some other stage because we do it much better on this side of the chamber. 


I am happy to talk about the impact of carbon pricing and particularly on small business. Senator Wong's contribution to this chamber day after day is diligent and thorough. What she does tire of is people on the opposition side continually asking her questions where the facts in their questions are inaccurate or they ask—as Senator Sinodinos did today for the modelling on small business to be tabled—and Senator Wong's response is, 'It has already been made public.' So again we get an opposition that are unprepared, have not done their research, are not really aware of what they are asking. If they had done just little bit of work with a little diligence they would have found that the modelling was a public document and perhaps would not have embarrassed themselves so badly by asking for it.


Senator Fifield stands up and gives us some examples of when he met businesses in the Dandenong region more than 12 months ago. It would be interesting, Senator Fifield, to go back and talk to those businesses now that the carbon legislation is through and those businesses are dealing with that legislation.




Senator Fifield:
  Mr Deputy President, this is not a point of order. I am just outrageously grabbing the microphone to say that I have revisited businesses and they are still unhappy.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! You have no point of order, Senator Fifield. Senator Crossin, you have the call.




Senator CROSSIN:
  I think that just reiterates and reconfirms what I have been saying for the last two minutes—that the opposition are extremely irrelevant, are totally unprepared, provide no research and knowledge in this debate, but they do provide an alternative policy. Senator Fifield, I wonder if you had enough stamina to stand up at the forum that you were in last year and explain to those small businesses that in fact your policy position was that you wanted the same outcome that we want in terms of climate change. You have the same target and period of time—five per cent by 2020. But did you actually tell those small businesses that they would be paying a higher cost than they are now, that the consumers that walked through the door and bought product would be whacked with $1,300 a year in their household budget?


At the end of the day, what you do not tell the Australian people and do not front up to and are not honest about is that not only do you want the same target in the same yearly outcome that we do but you going to do it so vastly differently that you will take from families and give that money to the big polluters in this country. You are entirely disingenuous when you talk about repealing this legislation. You are entirely disingenuous when you talk about the impact this is going to have on families and households. Perhaps Mr Windsor in the other chamber was absolutely honest and correct last week when he admitted that members of your party, Senator Fifield, came crawling to him begging to form a government, saying they would do anything whatsoever. 



Senator Fifield interjecting—




Senator CROSSIN:
  You see, at the end of the day, Mr Windsor did not believe you would be honest enough. He did not put any trust in you and wanted to ensure that this country was going to be governed by a government that he could trust and work with. So a condition of his forming government was that he wanted to see climate change tackled through a price on carbon, then a move to a trading emissions scheme. 


What you are on the other side is unprepared, unresearched and uninformed about what is in this debate. Your lines will continue despite the fact that people are now living with this on a day-to-day basis. Families are being compensated for their needs in terms of what is happening with the carbon pricing regime. What you also rely on is the front pages of the newspapers to write your questions each day for question time. (Time expired)

It is just laughable for her to suggest that Senator Fifield and the coalition are disingenuous in their protestation over the introduction of a carbon tax and our pledge—which we will live up to—to repeal the tax. The Australian public know that we are deadset and we mean this. It is not something that we support in any context whatsoever and, should we be elected into government, as our leader the honourable Tony Abbott in the other place has said, the first thing we will do is repeal this carbon tax and so we will.


The other point that Senator Crossin was foolish enough to suggest was that we will not engage with the business community. Twelve months ago, Senator Fifield went to an event. He is engaged in Isaacs and many other electorates, as am I. 


I would like to draw Senator Crossin's attention to a number of things that the local businesses in the electorates for which I am duty senator say about the carbon tax. If there is anything that the coalition does, it is that we are connected to the business community. We understand and know their challenges because many of us have not only worked in businesses but have actually run and managed them and know the challenges that are faced every day by them. I refer to a cabinet maker in Croydon, Deakin, who has worked in the industry for 18 years. I was there only two weeks ago with the Deakin candidate, Michael Sukkar. This is what we do: we actually go out and meet businesspeople when parliament is not sitting and talk to them about the things that are making their life difficult. He told us that, after having been in the industry for over 18 years, he can no longer employ apprentices because of the escalating cost of doing an honest day's work, and it is becoming increasingly harder. 


A greengrocer that I visited in Ringwood East is bracing for their next electricity bill, because the highest overhead, the most expensive overhead, in running their business is the cost of electricity. They are in fear of what that electricity bill will look like. In order to make that business viable they can no longer employ anyone. There is an incredibly fine line for a small business between not making any money, or actually making a loss, and having the books in the black. So, where they once employed casual staff, they are now reducing the number of staff whom they can employ and covering the hours themselves. This is what small business do. They set up enterprises not only to try and support their immediate families but also for their kids for times to come. 


There are a many of these small businesses. Over the last fortnight, while we were not sitting, there would have been 12 businesses that I visited with John Nguyen, the candidate for Chisholm, and Michael Sukkar, the candidate for Deakin, and the message that we were told time and time again by businesses was that they will not be able to withstand the imposition of the carbon tax. There are so many examples that I could iterate. Senator Sinodinos raised some again today that are in New South Wales. A butcher at the Oakleigh markets has the same problem with the increasing costs of refrigerants. This tax is an imposition that we will repeal. (Time expired)

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2012-08-20,"



Senator MARK BISHOP
 (Western Australia) (15:17):  Today we had a little cameo performance from Senator Fifield that was really a proof-positive demonstration of the intellectual wasteland, the intellectual desert, that the opposition chooses to inhabit with its position on the carbon tax. Senator Fifield popped up and said two things; he enunciated two sentences. Firstly, he said: 'I want to take a point of order. Then he said: 'There is no point of order.' Doesn't that exactly reflect the attitude of the opposition throughout this whole debate on the issue of carbon pricing and the introduction of a carbon price post June of this year? 


Today's questions to Senator Wong from a range of opposition senators had a set, a seriatim, of big lies that the opposition chooses to peddle post the passage of the carbon pricing legislation in late June of this year. What were the lies that they managed to put out there today? There were four in particular: firstly, Australia is introducing the biggest carbon tax in the world; secondly, it will not achieve anything in terms of a cut in emissions; thirdly, it will not achieve anything anyway because we are only a fraction of global emissions in the world; and, finally, there was the continuing generalised set of misrepresentations that occur as to price. If I have time to come that, I will highlight the error in Senator Kroger's contribution. 


The first myth that is peddled by a range of speakers is that Australia is introducing the biggest carbon tax in the world. Let me just say: not true; incorrect; factually unsound. People who make this claim, as Senator Cormann did in his lead-in to this debate, miss two things. Firstly, a whole range of countries already have carbon prices similar to but in most cases higher than that of Australia. Senator Wong took the trouble to go through eight of them in her response to Senator Cormann. I happen to have that list here, and I will again put it on the record. Norway's carbon tax on petrol is $61. Switzerland's carbon tax on certain fuels is 36 Swiss francs, which is the equivalent of A$36. Sweden has a fuel tax of $138. Ireland has a carbon tax of 20 euros, which equates to A$24. Finland's carbon tax is $36 to $72. In Canada, the carbon tax is up to $29. And the UK has introduced a floor price for the electricity sector. 


Secondly, and the more critical point made by Senator Wong in her response, is that while Australia's carbon price starts at $23 a tonne, the government is giving extensive assistance to industries that compete in international markets. Industries like steel, aluminium, oil refining, paper making, flat glass manufacturing and cement—I just note in passing that nearly all of them are based on the east coast, in New South Wales and Victoria—will effectively get up to 94½ per cent—think about that: 94½ per cent—of their carbon permits from the government for free. So free carbon permits will be issued to a range of firms that work in those industries. 


What does that mean in terms of the effective price that those firms will pay for the carbon tax? Presumably, to some degree, they will pass it on to their consumers, to their clients, to their customers. Those firms will be paying not $23 a tonne, not $15 a tonne, not $10 a tonne; they will effectively be paying $1.30 a tonne. That is the price impact on the major emitters in the major industries that I outlined on the east coast of Australia—$1.30 a tonne. For that we have had this huge debate over the last two or three years. I have only half a minute left for my contribution in this debate so I will go straight to Senator Kroger's point that the electricity cost for a retail grocer in Ringwood in Victoria is the highest cost in that grocer's business—conveniently forgetting the cost of stock, the cost of product, the cost of labour, the cost of the lease. Every time a small business organisation comes to speak to you, what do they want to talk about? 'We need labour market deregulation, the costs are high; we need you to attack the property trusts that own shopping centres; we need you to address the cost of stock that we have to purchase.' They do not mention carbon tax because it is about two per cent or less of their costs, but Senator Kroger thought it was the highest cost. (Time expired)

"Sinodinos, Sen Arthur",LP,2012-08-20,"



Senator SINODINOS
 (New South Wales) (15:22):  Lies, lies and damn statistics. Honestly, what we have just heard from Senator Bishop itself constitutes lies because he is flying in the face of the field evidence that has been provided even this very day by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry with their report on trading conditions in the small business. They talk about the trading conditions being below the average of the last five years, which also include the period of the global financial crisis. Their survey talks about the decline in various economic indicators of the health of small business. Also, Senator Bishop—through you, Mr Deputy President—the survey talks about how taxes and charges are the No. 1 issue for small business. You may be cynical and say people do not like taxes, but the fact of the matter is you are not shooting the opposition, you are shooting the messenger in small business. That shows what you think of small business. Instead of being out there giving succour to small business, instead of being out there asking, 'How can we help you to get through this?' you are blithely saying, 'Well, they're not actually subject to the carbon tax and in any case they can always pass this on.' The fact is that this survey is field evidence, it is facts not lies, and it shows that small businesses in Australia today are doing it tough—and that means they do not have the capacity to pass on big price rises.


We talk about the impact of the carbon price, including on gas refrigerant and other things that are going up quite markedly. The fact of the matter is that this is all coming at a time when other costs are going up for small businesses. They have the superannuation guarantee starting to go up. They have electricity prices also going up for other reasons, as has been mentioned. So small businesses are doing it tough at the moment. They see the carbon tax, something which is a discrete government decision, and they say to themselves, 'Why is government making it any worse for us than it already is? And government says, 'Well, you can just pass it on.' But, as Senator Kroger so eloquently indicated, if you do not understand small business you do not understand the competitive environment that small business faces. It is not easy to pass costs on. Your choices are these: lower your profits, lower your employment, lower your investment. Lower profits will ultimately lead to either lower employment or lower investment in small business, the engine room of the economy. This is the dilemma we face.


I want to take up the issue of what the modelling said or did not say about the impact of the carbon price on electricity costs and other costs facing small business. Contrary to what Senator Wong said, there was no discrete modelling of the impact on small business. I wish Senator Crossin was still here to hear that. There were estimates made through the modelling about the macroeconomic impact of the carbon tax, in terms of its impact on the CPI and the rest. There was modelling done on discrete sectors, but by firm size that modelling was not done, contrary to what Senator Wong said—and that was the point of my question.


We have to consider that small businesses are being hit by bigger businesses which are directly subject to the carbon price and are passing their cost increases back through the supply chain to their suppliers and people who are customers of theirs. That means that small businesses cop it in the neck because big businesses are asking them to take up the slack when it comes to the impact of the carbon tax. Of course, because small businesses are unable to do that or they are forced to do that in order to retain the custom of big businesses, you have this situation where small businesses are being squeezed.


I have been surprised in the time I have been here about the extent to which the government does not talk about small business in a positive way, only in a defensive way: 'We may have imposed X on them over here but we are giving this or that particular concession.' As I noted earlier, these concessions are occurring at a time when a broad range of costs are going up for small business, so the challenge that lies ahead for any future government is how to take the burden off small business in a sustainable way. The coalition have indicated that that will be done by, first and foremost, taking the carbon tax off the backs of business, including small business, but we need to go further. As my colleague in another place noted today, more than 18,000 regulations have come in since this government has been in office and fewer than 90 or so have been repealed. We have a deal of work to do in that whole regulatory space because small business does not have the overheads to deal with the burden of regulation. That regulation is at the Commonwealth, state and local levels and it is a real issue. It is not the merits of an individual regulation; it is the fact that each individual regulation comes on top of so much new regulation. The coalition are committed to finding a way through that. As I reiterate today, small business is being affected by the carbon tax. The government should not have their head in the sand.(Time expired)

Senator RYAN
 (Victoria) (15:57):  It is a pleasure to rise today to support the motion put by Senator Fifield. But it is not a pleasure because of the issue itself.


What we have seen over the last month alone is a continuation of Labor's war on small business in this country. Today we had the finance minister, Senator Wong, here in question time answering questions from Senator Cormann and others about the cost of the carbon tax on small business. But Senator Wong constantly referred to who might allegedly pay the actual carbon tax bill—the sophistry of this government that says that just because it is only limited to a certain number of payers, the costs of the carbon tax might not being borne by the millions of Australian small businesses.


Senator Wong also talked about how there are compensation arrangements: apparently there should only be a less than one per cent impact on the cost to small businesses. Yet we know now that the reality is very different. We are all hearing stories from around the country about the impact of the cost of this carbon tax on small business; the impact of costs that they cannot necessarily pass on. That is saving consumers some of the costs, at least in the short term; but in the long term we know that if you build up the costs of doing business and if you build up the costs of business inputs that those costs will be passed onto the consumer. But it is small business at the moment that is bearing the crunch.


Senator Wong was talking today, with all the sophistry of this government, about who is actually paying the tax and the alleged Treasury modelling that shows there will only be a less than one per cent impact by the carbon tax on small business. She sounded like Sir Humphrey Appleby in Yes Minister, who famously asked his prime minister: 'Very well, Prime Minister. It all works very well in practice but does it work in theory?' The problem we have with this government is that it is relying on the way it wishes the world was rather than the way the world actually is. They may have modelling that talks about the alleged savings to business; they may have modelling that talks about alleged costs to small business—but reality is interfering with that. This Labor Party has never known how important small business is to our economy in providing local jobs and services and it has never understood how important small businesses are to our communities.


As I have said before, when we go around our nation to the suburbs of our major cities and the regional towns, what we find is that our community leaders are often our small business people. When we look at who runs the Rotary and Apex clubs, who is sponsoring the local football or netball club, or who might be the captain of the local CFA or rural fire brigade, what we notice is that overwhelmingly our community leaders are our small business leaders. They are the fabric of our community as much as they are the fabric of our economy. What this government is doing to them through this carbon tax is yet another example of the assault on small business. Why is that? Because the Labor Party not only does not understand small business; it has never been interested in it. Despite all the verbiage and sophistry we hear, they do not understand what makes someone get out of bed in the morning, put their house on the line and take the risk of employing someone and expanding that business; what makes someone not see their family and do the paperwork, which this government in particular imposes, at home at the kitchen table. They do not understand what drives people to do that.


Why is that? It is the same reason we do not see a great deal of unionisation in the small business workplace. Whether it is independent contractors or the classic small business owner, they are not recruited into the union movement. They hold no interest for the ALP. I wonder whether there is anyone in the once-great Australian Labor Party that went into politics saying, 'I want to be Minister for Small Business.' I cannot imagine anyone on that side doing that. The job has been thrown around to four people in the last five years. The job of Minister for Small Business has been the leftover job that this Labor Party has thrown as a bone to someone else to fill part of another portfolio or just to keep someone busy. It is not something that someone has put their hand up for and said, 'This is the job I want.' On this side of the chamber it is what motivated so many people, whether from our regional centres, our rural businesses or our great cities, to go into business.


We have over 2½ million small business people in this country. Let us look at the record of this government when it comes to them—the record that this carbon tax is making worse. When the Howard government left office, the ABS estimated that just over five million people—5,061,000 people— were employed in small business around Australia. That was more than half of the private sector workforce or just over 51.3 per cent. Today, after nearly five years of the Labor Party, it is down to 47 per cent of the private sector economy. When I say that that is an important trend, it is because of what I mentioned earlier. It is an important trend because the small business people in our communities are our community leaders as much as they are our economic leaders.


Since Labor was elected in 2007 we are looking at more than a quarter of a million jobs gone in the small business sector. We know that over the last three or four years a substantial number of jobs created in this country have been public sector jobs. Public sector jobs are important but all public sector jobs, including ours in this very chamber, ride on the back of the private sector economy in this country. The private sector economy rides on the back of small business that once employed more than half the people in this country and now employs just under half.


Small business is the heart of innovation. It is the heart of our communities. It is often the place where someone gets their first job and their start in the labour market. I pushed trolleys around a suburban supermarket and worked in the freezer. How many people have started in their local milk bar, franchise, fast food restaurant or supermarket? That is one of the reasons that small businesses are important. Operating costs are at a 10-year high under this government and they are constantly going up. Despite the smart words and the spin from the smart politicians opposite, they will not concede the obvious: when you make the cost of energy and the cost of doing business more expensive through the carbon tax, you are only driving those costs higher. The number of small businesses that have gone bankrupt in the last 12 months has gone up by 48 per cent.


This government crows about the economy. It talks about how we are the envy of the world. It sits here in Canberra reading the latest statistics—




Senator Furner:
  We are!




Senator RYAN:
  I will take that interjection, Senator Furner, because, when you are seeing small business bankruptcies go up by 50 per cent in 12 months, you have got a problem. The reason is just as it was in 1991 during the recession we had to have. Small business is the canary in the coalmine of this economy. When small business starts struggling you know the economy has a problem. You know that the statistics you might be seeing around the cabinet table do not tell you the full story. Smart politicians and good governments know that. Good governments know that economic statistics, high-quality as they are, tell you part of the story. But when you are looking at survey after survey of collapses in small business confidence and businesses are telling you that they are seeing energy and freight costs—even for greengrocers, as we have seen in today's paper—go up by a third in two months, then you should actually take a look at the theory that is being presented to you and the modelling that you are claiming to rely upon and say, 'Where might this be wrong?'


But no: the government are like the three monkeys—see no evil, hear no evil; I just wish they spoke no evil! They sit there and say, 'No, that is not what our modelling said,' but we are seeing it out in the community. Walk along your local shopping strip and ask the people what it is costing them in their energy bills. Ask them what it is costing those who sell food—particularly those who have to run refrigerators. Ask them what it is costing them in freight deliveries and what you will see is that costs are going up. Anecdote after anecdote, story after story: reality is what is striking the government in the face. It is striking the government in the face because it is the result of the very policy they intentionally implemented. The government introduced a carbon tax. The intention of that carbon tax is to make energy more expensive. For a century we did everything we could to make energy cheaper. It was the basis of the industrial economy in my home state of Victoria.


We knew that cheap energy was a competitive advantage that this country had, that it is one of the reasons we do not have the similarly high taxes on fuels that you see in Europe. It helps everyone, from our regional economies, from our farmers, to those who are simply dropping off the kids at school or running a local courier business.


This is the intentional result of this government's policy: high energy costs, which means that the cost of doing business is higher than it would be. But, no, this government simply refuses. On the one hand it says, 'That's what we intended to do,' but, on the other hand, it says, 'It'll only be less than a per cent.' Reality is striking this government in the face. It is the same reality that we are seeing in the lack of small business confidence. I just wish this government would listen.

Senator FURNER
 (Queensland) (16:07):  There is no surprise that the peddling of the perpetual scare campaign from those opposite continues along the road of trying to scare businesses or anyone who will listen to their stories and trying to have them believed. We know, and the business community knows, that it is all spin. Telling everybody that the reason their bills are going up is as a result of the price on carbon and telling the electorate that the Labor government does not support small business could not be further from the truth.


We should reflect on the position that the Leader of the Opposition and many others in the other House have taken on this issue. Mr Tony Abbott said, 'This is an impact on the cost of living that would be almost unimaginable.' Mr Joe Hockey said that it would 'drive up the price of everything'. The Senate Leader of the Nationals, Senator Barnaby Joyce, said that it would 'force working mothers to pay over $100 for a roast'. These are all untruths, all complete lies peddled by those opposite. That is what they continue to do. They go out in public and, to whomever will listen, spin nonsense about the effects of the carbon price.


As a government we are fully committed to helping our small businesses, and this is evident through the various policies that we have introduced. With the minerals resource rent tax we delivered a $6,500 instant asset tax write-off. We have established a new loss carry back initiative which can provide tax refunds of up to $300,000 for eligible businesses to encourage them to invest and to adapt. We introduced this country's first Paid Parental Leave scheme, which enables new parents to keep their ties with their employers so that businesses do not lose skilled staff. We are rolling out the National Broadband Network, which will give small business access to quicker internet and lower phone and internet bills.


In the gym this morning, I was talking to a member from the other House. She indicated that, in her electorate in New South Wales, small businesses are crying out for the NBN. They just cannot wait for the opportunity to make sure that it is implemented so that they do not have to travel as far as Sydney and abroad to run their businesses. This is the sort of thing that those opposite will roll back and are opposed to.


The new broadband infrastructure will give business access to technology, including videoconferencing, cloud computing and virtual private networks. The clean energy future package is aimed at our biggest polluters, not at small business. That is where those opposite do not seem to get it. Whilst we acknowledge that those businesses may face indirect costs, documents presented to the government by the Council of Small Business Organisation of Australia said that electricity makes up less than two per cent of their business costs. So, there you go: you have the Council of Small Business Organisation of Australia indicating that electricity costs make up less than two per cent of their business costs.


Treasury modelling estimated that the impact of the carbon price may be about 10 per cent on a small retail business, which would be less than 0.2 per cent of its total costs. We are doing what we can to ensure that the price on carbon will not hugely impact small business. Some of the measures we have implemented include $27.5 million to extend the Small Business Advisory Services for another four years. We have also invested $40 million in an Energy Efficiency Information Grants Program, allowing small business and community groups to find out how to reduce their energy costs. We have invested $5 million over four years to provide clean energy advice to small business. We have also invested in a small business commission so as to give small business a line to the government and to ensure that the government implements policies which hold the best interests of the small business community. A grant has also been provided to the Australian Institute of Refrigeration Air Conditioning and Heating to deliver seminars through Enterprise Connect workshops and industry intelligence networks. These will inform industry of the short- and long-term carbon price impacts and opportunities for energy efficiency improvements.


Not only has the opposition been spruiking the impact of the clean energy futures package on small business; it has been spruiking the impact on businesses in general. Once again, it is blatant scaremongering. Since 1 July businesses have been taking positive steps to make their companies more energy efficient, and they have been cutting their emissions and their power bills in the process. By taking action and driving down their electricity prices, they are reducing their emissions, reducing their energy intake and assisting the environment. De Bortoli Wines in Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales has undertaken a range of measures in all aspects of its business, from production to warehousing to improved energy efficiency and the upgrading of old equipment. The Gillard government is providing $5 million to the company, which will lead to an improvement in their energy efficiency by 36.3 per cent. New South Wales food processors Crafty Chef will install a new commercial blast freezer thanks to almost $500,000 from the federal government. This will reduce the carbon intensity of its operations by 54.1 per cent, reduce energy intensity by more than 56 per cent and boost its turnover by 150 per cent. Fonterra in Wagga Wagga will reduce its carbon emissions intensity in chilling and pasteurisation by 88.9 per cent and its energy intensity by nearly 89 per cent thanks to $152,881 from the government.


The list goes on: CSR Building Products in Ingleburn will receive funding to reduce carbon emissions intensity by 18.3 per cent and CSR Building Products in Vermont will take action leading to emissions intensity reduction by 19.6 per cent. Rickety Gate in Western Australia will reduce its emissions intensity by 69.7 per cent after installation of a battery backup solar power system. A project at Ferngrove Vineyards will see improvements of 62 per cent, Kenner Foods will see a 39.9 per cent improvement and Naturaliste Vintners Pty Ltd will reduce their emissions intensity by 51.1 per cent and improve their energy efficiency by almost 49 per cent.


Really, these numbers are quite staggering and are in stark contrast to the opposition's claim that businesses will be hard done by.


It gives an excellent example of what businesses are doing across our country in respect of how they tackle climate change.


This Labor government has introduced a price on carbon, and it was the right thing to do. On reflection, we should go back in time and remember that the coalition's current opposition leader, Mr Tony Abbott, was caught out on Sky spruiking that the carbon tax is the right thing to do. In fact, he actually said:


If you want to put a price on carbon, why not just do it with a simple tax?


That is what he said on Sky News not long ago. He went on to say:


Why not ask electricity consumers to pay more, then at the end of the year you can take your invoices to the tax office and get a rebate?


So you can see the contradiction, the disingenuous arguments that those opposite are presenting here today when their leader, Mr Tony Abbott, said some time ago, 'Why not put a price on carbon through tax?' He went on further to say:


It would be burdensome, all taxes are burdensome, but it would certainly … raise the price of carbon, without increasing in any way the overall tax burden.


That interview was filmed in 2009, the same year he was given the title of the 'Weathervane'. And let us not forget that was the year he knifed his then leader, Malcolm Turnbull, in the back. So when it comes to contradiction, you only need to look to those opposite and you will find the true examples.


Not only are we salvaging a future for our next generation; we are also making sure that we will have an environment that they can enjoy. We have received huge criticism from the opposition about bringing it in, but it appears that if the coalition was in government it would have implemented one anyhow. In the past we have seen members admit that putting a price on carbon was the best way forward. This was even said by former Prime Minister John Howard and has also been said by the current Liberal leader, as I indicated when relating the Sky News interview.


Last week the member for New England, Mr Tony Windsor, said that Mr Abbott would have put a price on carbon. In the Australian on Friday, Mr Windsor is reported as saying:


The Leader of the Opposition knows that very well, because on a number of occasions he actually begged for the job.


Mr Windsor made the point:


… not only to me but to others in that negotiating period, that he would do anything to get that job.


Mr Windsor continued:


You would well remember—and your colleagues should be aware—that the only codicil that you put on that was: 'I will do anything, Tony, to get this job; the only thing I wouldn't do is sell my arse.' 


That is what Mr Tony Abbott indicated to Mr Windsor at the time of trying to form government. How hypocritical can those opposite be when they sit here and wreck small business, putting stress on households when they are all prepared to put a price on carbon anyhow? That is the hypocrisy of this argument and of this motion here today from those opposite.

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2012-08-20,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (16:17):  Madam Acting Deputy President, I would like to add to Senator Furner's comments about the member for New England. No doubt some discussions were had in confidence just after the last election, in that 17-day period, and isn't it wonderful that here is Mr Windsor now putting it all out in the open when he says Mr Abbott would have gone with a carbon tax. I can tell you that is absolute rot. If Mr Abbott was Prime Minister in a hung parliament, how would he ever get it through the parliament? I know The Nationals would not have voted for it. I know that virtually all of my colleagues in the Liberal Party would not have voted for it. Mr Windsor is not telling the truth, just like prior to the last election. Kelly Fuller was interviewing him on Tamworth radio, after Mr Windsor had put a bill into the House of Representatives wanting a 20 per cent reduction on emissions of 1990 levels by 2020 and a massive 80 per cent by 2050. Mr Windsor said: 'That wasn't my bill. No, I just put that in on behalf of some of my constituents.' It was his bill all right, and that is why he drove the carbon tax. That is why he proudly put a media release out saying, 'One of the conditions to support the Gillard government is that we form a multi-party climate change committee.'


What is the idea of a carbon tax? It is to increase the cost of electricity so that people use less. That is the whole idea of it. And now we have got the cost going around and small business—go to your local engineer, someone out in a little country town knocking up machinery, augers, field bins, groupers for the agriculture or mining industry and ask them what effect it is going to have on their industry because electricity prices go up. They are going to have to charge more. So when they build something for, say, a farmer, then what does the farmer do? The farmer pays more. But tell me this: who does the farmer hand the costs on to? Can he go to the cattle yard and say, 'I demand you pay 5c extra for this steer because I've got to pay a carbon tax'? No, they are price takers, not price makers. The primary producers are price takers; they cannot pass it on.


We have raised this issue about the cost on small business. We have this crazy situation of adding another 6.75c a litre diesel tax to our truckies on 1 July 2014 and people on the other side say, 'Just pass it on.' For Martin Group transport, based up there at Scone in the Hunter Valley, it is going to cost them an extra $1 million a year for their fuel. That is the increase in fuel tax alone—$1 million. So they pass it on to the cow cocky, to the farmer. I ask the question again: who does the farmer pass it on to? They cannot pass it on; they just suffer. So what happens then? They have less money, less profit, less to spend in the country towns at those small businesses that rely on that agricultural money going through their communities, keeping those businesses strong, keeping the jobs in place—they cannot pass it on. But those on the other side will never learn that.


When you look at the 31 Labor senators in this chamber, I think it is either 25 or 26 come from the union movement. Have they ever run a small business? The odd one might have run a small business now and then, but they are out there representing the so-called workers.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  What, you think we've done anything else, do you?




Senator WILLIAMS:
  I could take the interjection of Senator Collins and we could go down the union road. Perhaps we might talk about the Health Services Union? We might get onto the Australian Workers Union. I was a member of the Australian Workers Union for one year. I was a member for one year, in January 1978, when I was shearing at Carriewerloo Station out from Port Augusta, where they made the film Sunday Too Far Away. It was just after the state election and the then Premier Don Dunstan said, 'Unionism is not compulsory.' The rep walked into the shed and he said, 'You have a ticket?' I said, 'No'. He said, 'Do you want me to take it out of your wages, or will we take it off the boss?'


I said, 'I don't want one'. He said, 'These are your options: you buy a ticket or you leave the shed.' That was the option after the '77 drought. This is how the thuggery of the unions works. And to think that when I gave them whatever the amount of money was in those days—the only time they ever got it off me, I can tell you—I wondered what happened to that money. We could ask questions about what happened to the AWU money; there is a lot of stuff out in the media now. But let's get back to the argument about small business.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Crossin
):  Senator Williams, I was just going to remind you of the matter under discussion.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  Getting right back to the matter, Madam Acting Deputy President—I'm sure you're keen to hear what I have to say!



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Williams; let's just focus.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  Back to small business. The biggest thing that is—



Government senators interjecting—




Senator WILLIAMS:
  I'm trying to focus, Madam Acting Deputy President—directly at you!



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  Getting back to small business: the biggest thing that is lacking is confidence. You talk to anyone. I went for a walk in my home town a couple of weeks ago, down the street talking to small businesses. The thing that is lacking is confidence. And why is confidence lacking? Why aren't people spending? Because they do not trust the government. They do not trust them when they have broken promises on adding costs to small business, on bringing in new taxes—and there is a list of new taxes. They do not trust the government on managing money. I had a look at the Australian Office of Financial Management website on Friday: the debt is now $241 billion—it has grown $3 billion in just two weeks! Fourteen days and we have borrowed $3 billion. Now, who is going to pay for that?


As we know, and as Senator Ryan said, the nation's wealth is derived through the business sector. Governments do not have money; they have sold off all the assets—now governments, sadly, just have debt. So that is where the nation's wealth is derived from: the business sector. And who is the greatest employer? The small-business sector. But this government is hell-bent on destroying small business, adding more costs to them. I will quote from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry survey. Mr Greg Evans, Director of Economics and Industry Policy of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, commented:


The Survey clearly shows that trading conditions remain challenging for Australian businesses in non-mining related sectors, with small businesses reporting the worst performance.


…   …   …


It is alarming that important small business growth indicators, including sales revenue, selling prices, profit growth and investment in plant and equipment, are approaching their historical low levels previously recorded during the height of the global financial crisis


…   …   …


Small businesses are concerned that while their selling prices have fallen to record low levels, their input costs remained elevated. While growth in labour costs has slowed in recent quarters, these costs remained at high levels and have resulted in a further fall in small business employment … small business are likely to face further headwinds in coming months due to the continued economic and political uncertainties in Europe, the slowdown in China and subdued consumer sentiment.


…   …   …


Against this difficult backdrop, it is disappointing that the government has imposed further cost increases on small business with the introduction of the carbon tax, which is now particularly impacting on the more energy-intensive business operations.


Small business is the heart of our nation. There is not a large business that did not commence as a small business. They worked hard and they grew. But what we are seeing now—




Senator Birmingham:
  Now large businesses are being turned into small businesses!




Senator WILLIAMS:
  Exactly! I take your interjection, Senator Birmingham. That is how big businesses got big—they started off small and they grew big; now we are seeing big businesses winding back. We are seeing record liquidations and insolvencies. Why is that? We hear about this booming economy. The biggest issue is the lack of confidence.



Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—




Senator WILLIAMS:
  As I said, people do not trust this government. They do not trust you with your promises on your carbon tax. They do not trust you to manage money. They do not trust you to run the economy. All you know is borrow, borrow, spend, spend, waste, waste. They do not trust you to build school buildings, they do not trust you to put Pink Batts in buildings. You spent a billion and a half putting Pink Batts in and another billion pulling them out!  There's two and half billion of taxpayers' money gone.


And here is the problem that small business is facing: extra costs of doing business. You go out and talk to them. I challenge any one of you: come with me for a stroll through a country town. Stick your head in the door of a small business and say, 'Hello, I'm a Labor senator. I've come to see how business is.' You would want to be wearing a hard-hat, because I know what the small businesses think of you lot. I know exactly what they think of you: they don't trust you, they know you don't care about them and that is why, every time I walk into a small business, they say, 'When is the election? Bring it on as soon as you can; we want to have a say', especially in the seat of New England, where we saw our federal member, Mr Windsor—I live in his seat—have his rant and rave the other day, saying Mr Abbott would bring in a carbon tax. What a joke. Mr Abbott would not bring in a carbon tax. It is a big 'if' anyway—that word 'if'. If the dog didn't stop for a little squat, he'd have caught the fox. That word 'if' means a fair bit. So the situation is this: if you cripple small business, you cripple the wealth-building sector of our nation—and that is exactly what you intend to do, and that is why they don't trust you.

The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Williams, your time has definitely expired. Senator Thistlethwaite.

",Senate,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Carbon Pricing</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,11,1
"Thistlethwaite, Sen Matt",ALP,2012-08-20,"



Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales) (16:27):  I wholeheartedly agree, Madam Acting Deputy President! Thank you for the call. This is another slack, below-par contribution to policy debate in this place from those opposite. This motion talks about the 'growing evidence of the effects of the Gillard government's carbon tax on the viability of small business', and it triggered me to think about where this 'growing evidence' is coming from. Is it some sort of new robust policy analysis that has been undertaken by the coalition? I thought about that, and quickly dismissed it, because those words 'robust policy analysis' and 'coalition' are like oil and water: you cannot mix them. Could it have come from policy consultations? Well, whenever representatives of those opposite do consult with small businesses, they get a rude shock—because often small businesses will say that they have never been going any better. I will elaborate on that in a moment. So it could not have come from policy consultations. Does it come from new modelling? Perhaps some new modelling, new policy analyses have been undertaken by those opposite. Again, I quickly dismissed that, because that in itself would be a front-page headline: 'Modelling done by coalition'. It does not happen.


Then I happened to read today's Daily Telegraph and there it was on the front page. That is where this came from. That is where the questions that were asked in the chamber today, this policy amendment and this motion came from: the front page of the Daily Telegraph. That is the deep analysis on policy that we are getting from those opposite: they read it on the front page of papers and then they seek to bring it into here! It proves how out of touch they are, particularly with respect to small business and the continuation of this policy of scaremongering with the prophets of doom trying to talk down our economy.


The facts about carbon pricing are illustrative of why we are doing this. The reason why we are doing this is basically for our children because all of the credible economic evidence and the environmental studies demonstrate that global warming will have a diverse and negative impact on our economy and, the longer we wait to take action about it, the greater the cost will be. So, effectively, if we as a generation of decision makers do not tackle this problem now and do not make decisions now, we are simply passing that cost on—and a greater cost at that—to the next generation of Australians.


I offer a second point. Labor and the coalition have the exact same policy and the exact same target for emissions reductions in our economy: five per cent by 2020. So, if it is the case that both major parties have the same target for emissions reductions, the question then becomes: how do we achieve that? How do we do that by the most efficient and effective method with, importantly, the least cost for households, small businesses and large businesses? There have been no less than 37 parliamentary inquiries into this issue in this place since 1992, including the Shergold inquiry which was set up by none other than former Prime Minister John Howard. Each and every single one of those inquiries—all of them bar none—has said that the cheapest and most effective way to reduce carbon emissions in our economy is to put a price on carbon and allow the price effect to dictate where capital will flow and so behaviours will change over time. So what are we supposed to do as a government? Ignore that advice? Are we supposed to ignore the advice of 37 parliamentary inquiries, including those established by the former coalition government, taking into consideration a lot of the comments that were made by senators in former lives when they were ministers and the like and they were supporting carbon pricing? What are we supposed to do—ignore that advice? We will not because the responsible thing to do is to act in the best interests of Australians.


The third point to make is that the carbon price will be paid by the biggest 300 polluters in our economy, not by small businesses. There will be indirect costs. We have never shied away from that fact but they will be 0.7 of one per cent on the consumer price index, less than one per cent and one-fifth of the cost of the introduction of the GST when it was undertaken in 1998. It has been modelled by Treasury, the same people who modelled the GST and found that the cost effect of the GST would be 2.5 per cent. They were spot on then and they will be spot on now. The cost effect will be less than one per cent on the consumer price index. Households, small businesses and taxpayers get compensation to help them make the transition into a clean energy future. The compensation comes in the form of tax cuts. They have already been delivered in the form of increases in pensions and in the form of increases to family payments.


In terms of support for small businesses, the best thing that this government or any government could do is provide a strong economy to do business in. Let us look at the facts about Australia's economy at the moment. Take interest rates. The cash rate is at 3.5 per cent, lower than it was at any other time under the coalition government. Take inflation: 1.2 per cent, very low in relative terms. GDP is growing at 3.6 per cent. Unemployment is at 5.2 per cent. That is a miracle set of numbers for any modern economy, yet those opposite would try and hoodwink the Australian public into believing that the Australian economy is doomed.


Our policies as to small businesses stand for themselves. There is a $6,500 instant asset write-off for small machinery for small businesses, making it easier to invest in more energy efficient equipment, and there is no limit on the number of pieces of equipment for which you can claim this small business asset write-off. It is to the value of $1 billion over 2012-13 coupled with a $5,000 write-off for new vehicle purchases. So there you have great assistance for small businesses.


In terms of reducing carbon emissions, we have an energy efficiency information grants program of $40 million to assist organisations that are working with small businesses to reduce their carbon emissions over time. Take the clean technology program: $1.2 billion of assistance available for small businesses and larger businesses to install new technology to reduce their carbon emissions over time, with $27.5 million for the Small Business Advisory Service, and that program has been extended to continue providing advice for small businesses in the management of their economics, their books and their economies.


We have tried to cut the company tax rates. We tried to last financial year—again, opposed by those opposite as they turned up with the Greens that time and knocked off a reduction in company tax rates for small businesses in this country. As I have listened to those opposition senators who have spoken in this debate I have noted the one thing I did not hear from any of those opposite—and I have just outlined the government's program to assist small business, but this is the one thing that I did not hear from any of the coalition senators—was one policy. I challenge those speaking after me to just announce one policy, to give us one policy that they have got to support small business. Let us have one positive policy that they have to support small business. There are not any, Mr Acting Deputy President; you will not hear any because they do not have any. The only policy of those opposite that we know about is the cutting of $70 billion from the government's budget and that is how they are going to achieve their savings.


Senator Williams, who spoke earlier, was encouraging senators to walk down the streets of local businesses in the country. I do this regularly. In fact, I was in Orange last Friday and I did just that. I walked through Orange and spoke to a number of small businesses. I must say I was following in the footsteps of a coalition representative, because the week before Joe Hockey happened to be in Orange. He was there for a fundraiser with the local member John Cobb and he decided, after making a few outlandish statements similar to those that have been made by the senators opposite today about the effect of the carbon price on small business, that he would go and visit a few small businesses. It was reported in the Central Western Daily:


Mr Hockey accompanied by the member for Calare, John Cobb, spoke with small business owners in the main street.


Later at a press conference Mr Hockey said a combination of the carbon and mining taxes and rising electricity prices would invariably impact on the cost of living in this city.


The Central Western Daily then said;


However all the small business owners approached by the Central Western Daily declined to comment on Mr Hockey's view of the carbon tax …


They would not support it. They could not even get one of the businesses in Orange to support the view of Joe Hockey. Have a look at the photo. When he wipes the egg off his face, he has a big frown because he got stood up by the Orange small businesses. (Time expired)

"Edwards, Sen Sean",LP,2012-08-20,"



Senator EDWARDS
 (South Australia) (16:37):  I rise to speak on this matter of public importance: the growing evidence of the effects of the Gillard government's carbon tax on the viability of small business. Obviously, I must make some reference to Senator Thistlethwaite's contribution here today. He talks about his time in Orange. I would ask the senator if he would like to tell me a bit later how many empty shops he passed as he was walking down the street.




Senator Thistlethwaite:
  None actually.




Senator EDWARDS:
  Because retailers in this country are not exactly experiencing a buoyant time. I walk up and down the streets of many country towns and rural centres. In a recent food processing inquiry I walked down the streets of Shepparton in Victoria where there were some 84—and now are I believe some 130—shops vacant due to the fact that there is so much uncertainty in this electorate. Don't go now, Senator Thistlethwaite because I am going to tell you about the policy that we are going to bring to this place when the Australian people get an opportunity to go to the polls about the way in which you have been running this country for the last five to six years. We are going to axe this carbon tax which you have imposed upon the Australian people in what has to be one of the greatest electoral lies in this Federation's history.


Senator Thistlethwaite talked about a slack and below par argument. He said, 'Small business are all out there having an absolute wonderful time.' You, Senator Farrell, would know. The Clare Valley, Barossa Valley, McLaren Vale and Coonawarra great wine regions in South Australia are not having a very good time. There is the high Australian dollar. There is an inability to access capital for an industry which has been in a great deal of need for capital. Unfortunately, now what have they got? Rising energy costs because we have a carbon tax on energy. One of the biggest bottom line items for South Australia's greatest and most famous industry is energy costs going up some 18 per cent in what is a constricted market. These people work in an environment where those they sell to in this country—Coles, Metcash, Woolworths—have already said to people in these industries that they will not accept price rises on their product because of the carbon tax. So what happens?


The producers of wine in South Australia say, 'Okay, we cannot pass it on to our retailer because they have massive concentration of power, so what do we do with it now? What is the next thing? The only piece of elastic in this whole argument is the dear old farmer. Let's go and have a crack at the farmer.' Instead of getting $1,200 or $1,500 or $1,800 a tonne, the farmers are getting $800 or $600 a tonne because the wineries cannot go out of business, so they push back to the easiest possible price mechanism in their cost of goods which is the farmer. Senator Thistlethwaite, these are the small businesses you talk about? I think not.


What about the automotive parts manufacturers? Their energy costs have gone through the roof. In South Australia in my patron seat of Wakefield, where General Motors Holden and a plethora of other firms supply that important industry, an industry which your government over there has seen fit to supply with $220 million, but what compensation did the car parts manufacturers get? Nothing. They are an essential part of the chain but they did not get anything and they have just been hit with this carbon tax. Senator Thistlethwaite, is that one of the small businesses that are flourishing on this wonderful set of numbers which in any other time you would have to say are great? No, there is no confidence out there.


You talk about not being able to operate where the environment is going to take our productivity. Your own man, the Climate Change Commissioner Tim Flannery, has been on the record to say it might be 500 or it might be 1,000 years before we notice the difference. The rest of the world gets that. I have been fortunate enough to see industry in Asia in recent times. They are opening coal-fired and nuclear power stations—a power generator to the tune of one a week through those countries. What are they doing? Are they applying an emissions cost impost on business? No, they are not.


We stand out like a beacon of silliness in what was and should have been a big lesson coming from Copenhagen that the rest of the world was not prepared to take it on. Yet we stand out here because of this murky little alliance with the Greens. I know a lot of you on the other side sort of choke on this whole carbon tax thing and all you reasonable ones over there did not want it. But you had to take it because that was the cost of government. It is about trust, Senator Polley, and you know it is about trust because all the numbers look okay but business—




Senator Polley:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, the comments should be made through the chair, not directed at senators. I call on you to explain that to this new senator.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Furner
):  I remind the senator to direct his comments through the chair.




Senator EDWARDS:
  Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President: you are quite right, Senator Polley. I will do that. One day I when I am not so new I will work through those issues. It has been seven weeks since the world's biggest carbon tax began under the Gillard government. The headline on the front page of today's Advertiser—that is our home daily—reads: 'Our carbon pain: small business reeling under strain of new tax.' It states that a national survey of 186 small firms found that 50 per cent are reporting carbon tax related price hikes to power bills and other supplies. But only 33 per cent are passing their costs onto customers. Do you know why? It is because they will not let them. By the way, this paper is not exactly renowned for being all that friendly to my side of politics.


Certainly, the paper is putting it out there, right on the front page, for everybody in my state to see who is being burdened by the rising prices in South Australia, which I outlined before. They include 18 per cent on energy; 40 per cent on power bills; and, in the last generic CPI, 5.6 per cent on groceries. Goodness gracious me! And we are going to give people $10.10 in compensation. This is why there is no confidence. People are not spending their money in the businesses. They are not rushing out and buying new cars. They are not doing that. I think it is somewhat ironic that we are going to give a $5,000 benefit, an instant write-off, to business while Australian industry reels under this carbon tax. All that will do is make it more affordable for people to buy imported vehicles. The unintended consequences of this tax are profound. 


Let us have a look at some of the figures for South Australia. According to the ANZ job statistics there were 18 per cent fewer job adds last month compared to the same time 12 months ago. Last month's statistics are particularly concerning, given that South Australia's unemployment rate increased to 6.4 per cent—an increase of 1.2 per cent from June. Those figures are even worse in the seat of Wakefield. The member for Wakefield, Nick Champion, presides over an unemployment rate of 9.4 per cent. In terms of anybody's maths, that is double the average for the number of Australians out of work. And what should we do? In the heavily industrialised area of the northern suburbs of Adelaide, let us put in a handbrake, let us put in a boat anchor, let us call it a carbon price and then let us see how many jobs we can create as a flow-on of that in the industrial area of the northern suburbs of Adelaide. 


A Kalangadoo business in the south-east of South Australia, Pete's Fish Farm, produces rainbow trout. It will close in the next 12 months due to soaring electricity costs. His electricity rates jumped from 22.7c to 36.39c. This is just another nail in the coffin. The up-line buyers of his produce now say that they will not take any further price rises. This one is just a mess for Labor.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2012-08-20,"



Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (16:48):  I welcome the opportunity to participate in this matter of public importance discussion and to speak about the government's Clean Energy Future package. It goes without saying that I support the package. I support it because it will cut pollution and drive investment. It will help ensure that Australian businesses can compete and will remain prosperous into the future. 


Of course, carbon pricing is not a tax on small business. Under the carbon price, around 300 of the biggest polluters in Australia will have to pay for their carbon pollution. No small business will have to pay it directly. It is true that when big polluters pass on their costs there may be some indirect cost impact on small businesses, such as higher electricity bills; but, as we know, these are projected to be modest. 


Treasury modelling has indicated that the carbon price impact on electricity costs will be 10 per cent. The New South Wales Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal estimates that for most small businesses this will be around $5 a week. This small increase has been accounted for in the carbon price's compensation program. The fact is that electricity prices have been rising for a number of years. Electricity infrastructure established in the postwar period is coming to the end of its life and it needs to be replaced. 


We know the average electricity bill rose by at least 48 per cent in the last four years and we know that that price rise has been completely uncompensated. Mr Abbott of course calls this a 'fabrication' and 'an absolute furphy', but the fact remains that investment in infrastructure is the key driver behind electricity prices. Nothing can change that fact, regardless of Mr Abbott's wild claims that it is a fabrication and an absolute furphy.


The state based electricity regulators agree that the costs of replacing poles and wires are pushing up prices of electricity for small businesses. The national Energy Regulator agrees. These are the words I heard on the ABC's PM program on 9 August this year:


The National Energy Regulator says consumers are paying more than is necessary because of the amount that has been invested in infrastructure.


Mr Acting Deputy President, do you know who else agrees with that statement? Certainly a number of Liberal Party frontbenchers agree with that statement. One is Mr Turnbull, the member for Wentworth. I know that he has got a lot of form on disagreeing with Mr Abbott—he really disagrees with Mr Abbott any chance he can get. But let me quote what Mr Turnbull said recently:


There is no doubt the bulk of the reason for the 50 per cent, or thereabouts, increase in electricity prices for example in New South Wales over the last few years has been because of investments in poles and wires …


And as the ABC again reported on 9 August:


… Opposition energy spokesman Ian Macfarlane has admitted state government spending on the poles and wires of electricity networks has pushed power prices higher.


But do you know who else has come to the party, Mr Acting Deputy President? Do you know who else now believes that the carbon price is not the primary driver of electricity prices in this country? It is no other than Mr Abbott himself, the Leader of the Opposition, who just this morning, in a bit of a calamity for the opposition in the Senate—an own goal, given that they had already lodged this matter of public importance—said:


It's true that the carbon tax is not the only factor in the dramatic rise in power prices …



Senator Polley interjecting—




Senator FAULKNER:
  Well, Senator Polley, at last a chink of light from Mr Abbott. Even Mr Abbott himself now admits that the carbon price is not the only inflationary factor.


Climate change presents a great challenge to our nation; a great challenge to our economy and our environment. I say it is the greatest global challenge we face, but with this challenge does come some opportunity. What the government is doing is creating the conditions in which Australian innovation can thrive, in which Australia's resourcefulness and resilience can be supported and channelled to tackle this enormous challenge, this great challenge in our history. The opposition says that is not our job; that it will not make a difference; that Australia should wait, let others do the innovating, let Asia create the new jobs. But I do not think that is us. I do not think it is really in the Australian spirit to limp in. I believe that the people of Australia have the ideas, the creativity and the courage to lead the world in tackling these great changes that we collectively face. I say that a carbon price will create new opportunities for a whole range of innovative entrepreneurs and small business owners across the whole wide range of industries, including renewable energy, carbon farming and sustainable design, as just some examples. I would urge the opposition to think again and get on board.

The speeches read as follows—



FISHERIES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO.1) 2012


The Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 2012 will amend the Fisheries Management Act 1991 and the Fisheries Administration Act 1991. 


The main amendments will introduce electronic monitoring (e-monitoring) to Australian boats that are authorised to fish under concessions and scientific permits granted by the Commonwealth. E-monitoring can include cameras, global positioning systems and sensors and can generate a range of visual and non-visual information for monitoring fishing and related activities. 


Australian fisheries are a valuable natural resource and must be carefully managed to ensure sustainability. Commercial fish catch contributes more than $2 billion per year to the Australian economy. Processors, marketers, retailers, consumers and many allied small businesses benefit directly or indirectly from the industry and increase its contribution to the economy. 


As well as protecting the economic value of commercial fish stocks, Australians expect species that are valuable to the economy will not be over-exploited. Accurate scientific data is essential to set catch limits on species to protect their status and maximise the economic returns to Australia. Furthermore, Australians expect that threatened, endangered and protected species, such as sea-lions, dolphins and albatrosses, as well as the marine environment, will be protected from damage. E-monitoring of fishing activities is a cost effective way to check that fishing activities are not damaging these species and habitats.


The Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA) is responsible for managing Commonwealth fisheries, which, in general terms, are waters more than three nautical miles from the Australian coastline. The Commonwealth also manages some fisheries within three nautical miles, under agreements with the states and the Northern Territory. 


It is vital that AFMA has access to accurate, comprehensive and timely data on the state of fish stocks, and on the impacts of fishing on both fish stocks and the marine environment, to manage fisheries. AFMA also needs to have accurate data to monitor whether fishing activities meet legal requirements.


E-monitoring will provide better, cheaper data. This has been proven by trials of e-monitoring in several Australian fisheries and overseas, and by implementing e-monitoring on some boats in waters off South Australia. Trials and cost-benefit analyses have shown that the more data that is required for a fishery, the cheaper it will become to use e-monitoring systems, rather than observers. E-monitoring also has the benefit of generating more comprehensive data, which complements the information we get from observers, vessel monitoring systems and logbook reporting.


The bill formalises e-monitoring and its use as a fisheries management tool. Specifically, the bill gives AFMA an express power to impose e-monitoring obligations on Commonwealth fishing concession and scientific permit holders. In line with AFMA's legislative objectives, AFMA will be able to require concession and scientific permit holders to monitor not only fishing, but also related activities, such as the impact of fishing on protected species and the broader marine environment.


The bill makes it an offence to hinder the operation of e-monitoring equipment, or to modify, damage, or destroy e-monitoring data. These offences reflect the need to protect the integrity of the e-monitoring scheme and ensure that the data is accurate and complete.


Further to this, the bill adds to the list of matters about which AFMA can issue an evidentiary certificate. The certificates act as prima facie evidence and therefore reduce the time and costs that might otherwise be spent in proving straightforward procedural or administrative matters in court. 


Other amendments in the bill will make it clear that fishing concession holders are responsible for the actions of the masters and crew of their boats; will enable the AFMA to waive levies payable for statutory fishing rights that are surrendered; and will make provisions in the legislation about implementing fisheries closures clearer, more consistent and simpler to administer.


The bill will help to hold fishing concession or permit holders responsible for the actions of the masters or crew employed on their boats. Currently, it is too easy for corporations or other persons, such as those that hold concessions or permits for fishing, to claim they are not responsible for the actions of their directors, employees or agents. The amendments will place more responsibility on concession or permit holders to take reasonable precautions and exercise due diligence to ensure that the master and crew comply with their legal obligations.


The bill will allow AFMA to waive a levy payable in respect of a statutory fishing right if the right is surrendered without any fishing having taken place under it. This is already allowed in respect of fishing permits. In this situation, the holder has not and will not benefit from the statutory fishing right in the period to which the levy applies and should therefore be able to surrender it without payment.


The bill will also ensure that fishers are always notified in writing of decisions to close a fishery or part of a fishery to fishing, or to change or revoke such decisions. It will also clarify how a 'part of a fishery' can be defined; for example, by reference to a place, a time or a type or quantity of fishing gear. It will also allow AFMA to make emergency fishery closures without prior consultation, although, because they are legislative instruments, emergency closure directions will still be subject to parliamentary scrutiny.


The amendments in this bill will help ensure the sustainably of Australia's fisheries and will provide greater certainty for fishers and the community that Australia's fisheries are being very well managed.


I commend this bill to the Senate.


HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT (EXTENDED MEDICARE SAFETY NET) BILL 2012


More than ever before, we are making the most of every precious health dollar.


We are being guided by the evidence and investing wisely.


We are finding efficiencies and returning the benefits to patients.


Where the evidence said things weren't working, the Government's done things differently. And the bill before the house is part of this. We've looked at the evidence on how the Extended Medicare Safety Net works, and it says we need to close a loophole to protect the integrity of the system.


This bill amends the Health Insurance Act 1973 to allow the application of Extended Medicare Safety Net benefit caps to apply where more than one Medicare service is performed on the same patient on the same occasion and is deemed to be 'one professional service'.


This bill makes an amendment to the Extended Medicare Safety Net program that was introduced through the Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare) Act 2004. 


The Extended Medicare Safety Net provides individuals and families with an additional rebate for their out-of-hospital Medicare services once an annual threshold of out-of-pocket costs for out-of-hospital services is reached. 


Out-of-hospital services include GP and specialist attendances and services provided in private clinics and private emergency departments. 


Once the relevant annual threshold has been met, Medicare will pay for 80 per cent of any future out-of-pocket costs for Medicare eligible out-of-hospital services for the remainder of the calendar year, except for a number of services where there is an upper limit on the benefit payable through the Extended Medicare Safety Net, known as the 'EMSN benefit cap'. 


The Extended Medicare Safety Net program was amended through the Health Legislation Amendment (Extended Medicare Safety Net) Bill 2009, which amended the Health Insurance Act 1973 to enable the Minister to determine, by legislative instrument, the maximum benefit payable under the Extended Medicare Safety Net for a specified Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) item. 


The items that carry an EMSN benefit cap and the cap amount for each item is set out in the Health Insurance (Extended Medicare Safety Net) Determination 2009. The Health Insurance Act 1973 specifies that a determination made by the Minister to place or amend an existing EMSN benefit cap must be approved by the resolution of each House of Parliament before it can become effective. 


Since 1 January 2010, EMSN benefit caps have applied to selected MBS items. These include assisted reproductive technology services, obstetrics services, pregnancy related ultrasounds, cataract surgery, hair transplantation and varicose vein surgery. A further 16 items have since been introduced into the MBS with EMSN benefit caps. Caps were placed on these items to maintain consistency with the existing capped items, or based on recommendations made by the Medicare Services Advisory Committee regarding cost-effectiveness.


The current provisions of the Health Insurance Act 1973 do not allow EMSN benefit caps to apply where more than one item is claimed by the same patient on the same occasion and the items are deemed to constitute one professional service. An example of this occurs under Section 15 of the Health Insurance Act 1973 which describes the Multiple Operations Rule.


There are, of course, many instances where claiming for multiple operations on the same occasion is appropriate. For instance, patients can benefit from having more than one operation at the same time because they do not need to have second anaesthetic. An example is where a patient is having several skin cancers removed by surgical excision. Another is where varicose vein surgery is performed on both legs.


Under the Multiple Operations Rule there is a reduction in the amount of Medicare benefit payable where two or more operations are performed on the same patient on the same occasion, to recognise the efficiencies gained when several procedures are provided on the one occasion. Under legislation, where the Multiple Operations Rule applies, the operations are deemed to be one professional service, rather than a collection of MBS items. However, EMSN benefit caps can only apply to an MBS item and not a professional service. 


This means that under the current legislation, where doctors perform multiple procedures on the same patient on the same occasion, any EMSN benefit caps that apply to the individual MBS items that are performed within the operation do not apply, and there is no limit to the Extended Medicare Safety Net benefits that are payable for that professional service. This is not what was originally intended when Parliament approved selected MBS items to have an EMSN benefit cap.


As announced in the 2012-13 Budget, it is proposed that EMSN benefit caps be applied to a further 39 selected MBS items and all consultation services from 1 November 2012. These items have been selected to reduce the Government's exposure to subsidising excessive fee inflation by some doctors, or where there is a risk that practitioners may shift fees on to uncapped items. Thirty five of the items selected to be capped on 1 November 2012 fall under the definition of an operation for the purposes of the Multiple Operations Rule and therefore may be deemed to constitute 'one professional service'.  


Currently a doctor can avoid EMSN benefit caps by performing other operations at the same time. If the Government cannot be certain that EMSN benefit caps will apply to selected items, it may not be in a position to introduce funding for important new high cost technologies.


This bill will ensure that where items are deemed to constitute 'one professional service' and all of the original MBS items that are part of that service are capped, the EMSN benefit caps will apply. This will ensure that the full savings announced in the Budget are realised. 




Other provisions – family registration for the EMSN



This bill also includes the provision to reduce the administrative burden on patients by removing the requirement for families to confirm the members of their family for Extended Medicare Safety Net purposes in writing. Currently, when families are nearing the Extended Medicare Safety Net threshold, the Department of Human Services – Medicare, contacts the person who registered the family and asks them to confirm in writing the members of their family to ensure that the correct out-of-pocket costs have been attributed to the family Extended Medicare Safety Net threshold. Providing confirmation in writing increases the time families must wait to receive their Extended Medicare Safety Net benefits.


This amendment allows the Chief Executive of Medicare to determine the appropriate manner in which this information is provided and will allow families to confirm their family composition more quickly and easily. Patients will still be required to confirm their identity before this confirmation can take place to ensure the information provided is accurate. 


This bill will allow Government to responsibly manage expenditure on Extended Medicare Safety Net and reduce the administrative burden on families. This is important for supporting the sustainability of the Extended Medicare Safety Net so singles and families can continue to receive additional assistance with their out-of-pocket costs.


I commend this bill to the Senate.

Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales) (21:55):  I rise tonight to pay tribute to a legend of the Australian Surf Life Saving and sporting community, Dennis Heussner. Dennis passed way on 6 July 2012 after an ongoing battle with leukaemia, and I wish to offer my heartfelt sympathies to his family and friends. 


I have been fortunate in my time as a surf lifesaver, and indeed as a senator, to meet and befriend some wonderful Australians—heroes of local communities who have made our nation such a great place to live; people who dedicate their lives to beach safety, sport and healthy lifestyles; those who will risk their own life to save another; and people who coach and guide young Australians in sport and make them better people. None was finer than Dennis Norman Heussner. Dennis was a champion athlete, an Olympian, a coach and a mentor—someone who was a positive influence on people. He was also a very good mate and someone who will be sadly missed in the eastern suburbs of Sydney community.


Dennis was born in Albury on 20 October 1943. His father was in the military and was positioned in Albury at the time. The family naturally moved around somewhat and when Dennis was a child his family moved to the eastern suburbs of Sydney. When he was a teenager, Dennis, with his brother John, joined Maroubra Surf Lifesaving Club, and so began a lifelong affinity with surf lifesaving and kayaking. When Dennis began paddling longboards at Maroubra, he was quite a young fellow and quite small in stature. Consequently, often when he was carrying the very long surfboards—wooden, as they were in those days—to and from the surf, he did so by carrying them on his head. Someone once remarked that he looked like an ant carrying a piece of food—so began his nickname, 'The Ant'. That nickname would remain with him for the rest of his life.


But an ant he certainly was not. He would go on to become a giant of surf lifesaving, both in stature and in his remarkable achievements. He would become Maroubra Surf Lifesaving Club's most prolific competitor, winning more titles and club championships than any single member of Maroubra in its over a century of competition in surf lifesaving. His record speaks for itself. In the surf he was a brilliant board and ski competitor, winning 15 Australian championships and 23 state championships. Dennis won six separate Australian longboard championships and was a New South Wales ironman champion. When he had done all that he could in surf lifesaving on a board and a surf ski, he thought that he would try his hand at canoeing. He went on to win 14 Australian canoeing championships and he represented Australia twice at the Olympics.


His national representative honours include: representative of the Australian surf lifesaving team in 1965 to the United States and in 1968 to South Africa; in 1970, captain of the Australian surf lifesaving team to New Zealand; and, in 1971, captain of the Australian surf lifesaving team to South Africa. He represented Australia in canoeing at the 1972 and 1976 Olympics. He was an active participant in the administration and affairs of Maroubra Surf Lifesaving Club. He was the club's captain from 1969 to 1970 and the recipient of the Honour Blazer in 1970 to 1971.


He was also awarded a meritorious award for his involvement in the rescue of a fisherman off Lurline Bay in 1959. I would like to read to the Senate the citation associated with the award of that meritorious award:


At about 4:30 pm on 17 October 1959 a telephone call was made to Maroubra Surf Lifesaving Club to the effect that a spear fisherman, J. Boss, had been washed off the rocks at Lurline Bay near Maroubra Beach. Club members Ron Siddons, Dennis Heussner and Brian Trouville immediately proceeded by car to Lurline Bay where J Boss was 400 yards from the shore in mountainous seas. Without hesitation these three men entered the water and after an exacting and trying swim eventually reached Boss and supported him until picked up by members of Maroubra Surf Lifesaving Club on boards and skis. After about three-quarters of an hour the Coogee Surf Lifesaving Club boat crew arrived on the scene and the patient and members who participated in the rescue were escorted to Coogee Beach. The actions of Ron Siddons and particularly Dennis Heussner and Brian Trouville, who are both junior members, were of the highest standard and, having no regard for their personal safety, undoubtedly saved a life.


The remarkable thing about that award was that at the time Dennis Heussner was only 16 years old; yet in mountainous seas he risked his life to save that of another person. He was inducted into the Randwick Sporting Hall of Fame in 1979 and the Surf Lifesaving Australia Hall of Fame in 2004 and in 2009 he was awarded the Order of Australia medal for his services to surf lifesaving and canoeing.


Interestingly, in 1974 he was appointed the personal bodyguard to Prince Charles when the prince visited Sydney and went swimming at Bondi and Coogee beaches. It was up to Dennis Heussner to provide personal protection in the surf and basically make sure that the prince did not drown.


When he finished his competition years he continued to be active in surf lifesaving, particularly coaching board and ski competitors, imparting his knowledge of surf and fitness to the next generation of Australians. Two of those competitors were none other than his son Kane and his daughter Holly. Both went on to win New South Wales and Australian championships. Unfortunately I was never of the champion calibre, as many others were that Dennis coached, but in my years as a ski paddler under his tutelage, he imparted more than knowledge about surf lifesaving to me.


Dennis was also a preacher of character and discipline, lessons that apply to any walk of life and something I now appreciate, even if I did not at the time realise how important those messages he taught me were. He would often say to me and others that there are three types of people in this world: those who make things happen, those who watch things happen and those who let things happen. He would end that by saying, 'What sort of person are you?' and challenging someone to be a person who made things happen.


Dennis, like most in the eastern suburbs community, was an avid South Sydney Rabbitohs fan, and I used to enjoy seeing him on a Sunday morning at Maroubra surf club. Like typical armchair critics, we would analyse what Souths had done wrong in the game over the weekend and how we would fix it. He was always one to offer quirky advice, like how to keep the perfect head on a beer: by putting a little bit of water in the beer cup before you placed it in the freezer to freeze it. That little bit of water at the bottom would oxidise the beer and keep the perfect head on the beer whilst you drank it. He also often had logical observations about policy issues—in particular climate change and his belief that pollution was harming our environment. He could tell that by his relationship with the ocean and the horizon on a clean day.


Dennis Heussner was such a fine person—a strong person, a role model, a mentor and a good bloke. Maroubra Surf Lifesaving Club will not be the same without him. My sympathies go to his wife, Diane, and children, Kelly, Heidi, Kane and Holly.
