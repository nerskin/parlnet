"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2000-06-20,"—I have some supplementary information to a question without notice from Senator Bourne that was asked on 5 June 2000. I seek leave to have it incorporated in Hansard. 
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
Cox Peninsula Transmitter: Sale
Supplementary information to Senator Bourne's question on 5 June 2000.
As part of the tender process for Cox Peninsula, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts were consulted by the Minister for Finance and Administration on the national interest implications of the disposal of the facility. Under the licence that has been granted Christian Vision to operate Cox Peninsula, there is a national interest assessment procedure which enables the Minister for Foreign Affairs to determine whether any of Christian Vision's services are contrary to the national interest. In reaching such a determination, the Minister will have regard to the effect of the service on Australia's international relations. This procedure is similar to that in the Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1999, which was reported on by the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee on 4 April. Once this Bill is enacted, it will apply to Christian Vision's broadcasts from Cox Peninsula.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Cox Peninsula Transmitter: Sale </title>,Questions Without Notice,1,1

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2000-06-20,"—Madam Deputy President, I seek leave to make a short statement on a motion that went through, in connection with which there was a misunderstanding in terms of the government's position.
Leave granted.
—My statement is with regard to the motion put forward by Senator Murray on British child migrants. Whilst the government acknowledges that it does not, or did not, have the numbers in the chamber to deny formality of the motion, we do however want it recorded in Hansard that we oppose this matter being referred to the Community Affairs References Committee for inquiry.
The government would have sought to oppose this motion for a parliamentary inquiry into former British child migration as the issues have already been extensively covered in the British inquiry and by inquiries conducted in Australia by state governments. The government's views on an inquiry as well as on other matters canvassed in this motion have been outlined in the Australian response to the UK response to the House of Commons inquiry tabled on 27 January.
Successive Australian governments have sought to help former child migrants deal with the consequences of their experiences through financial assistance to the Child Migrants Trust—about $760,000 since 1990—and by assisting them in other ways such as to access their records through the National Archives of Australia and waiver of citizenship fees. State and territory governments have also provided counselling and health services, which are also available to the general population.
The travel fund established by the UK government is an initiative of that government, and it covers child migrants to Canada and New Zealand as well as Australia, and the British response does not seek an Australian contribution to it. So we have provided our own financial support in response to the needs of former child migrants for some years in advance of the British initiative. They were the reasons why we were opposing this motion on the voices, although our comments were not made at the time.

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2000-06-20,"—The Indirect Tax Legis-la-tion Amendment Bill 2000 is another ex-ample of the incompetence of the gov-ern-ment and in particular of the minister respon-sible for the detailed implementation of the GST, Senator Kemp, the Assistant Treasurer. Sena-tor Kemp continues to display, in his approach, a lack of understanding of what is in-volved in the implementation of the GST and to propose that this is an easy and simple thing to do. Here we are just days before the GST is implemented and the government is introducing another 211 amendments to its own legislation. This is the government that said it was introducing a new and simple tax; yet here we are again dealing with something like 211 amendments on top of the already 1,700 GST and related amendments the Senate has already dealt with since the passage of the primary bills last year. 
This is typical of the way, though, in which the government and Senator Kemp in particular have botched the implementation of the GST. As I have said before, we on this side expect nothing more from Senator Kemp, because his incompetence in our view knows no bounds. What these amendments further demonstrate is that if this government does not understand its own tax system, how does it expect ordinary Australians to understand it? We have seen the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, Mr Hockey, in the other place trying to comprehend all of this, but he cannot even explain how his own tax system works. If he cannot understand how it works, again I ask the question: how can he expect ordinary Australians and businesses to cope? We had Senator Kemp in question time yesterday not able to tell us why salted peanuts are taxed while unsalted peanuts are not and why sushi is taxed but sashimi is not. It is all in the simple 29-page food index, Senator Kemp told us. So if Senator Kemp cannot explain how his new, simplified GST will work, again we have the question: how can ordinary Australians be expected to understand? And if not understanding the law is not a defence against the law, what defence do they have in these circumstances?
What Senator Kemp has also failed to tell us is why food is taxed at all. The 29-page simplified food guide is a guide to the broken promises of Mr Howard and Senator Lees. Look at all of the food items that are GSTable. What happened to the promise that food would be GST free? Obviously this became a joint Democrat and coalition non-core promise, because we know where the Democrats and the coalition priorities are: million-dollar tax breaks for casino owners and high rollers at the expense of making food GST free as was promised. We have here a government that have not got a clue about their own tax which is being implemented by a minister who has no clue about his own tax. Senator Kemp follows in the footsteps of the other minister who also has no clue about the GST, Minister Hockey. What we have here with Minister Hockey and Senator Kemp is Tweedledee and Tweedledum, although I am hard pressed to know who is dumber—Minister Hockey or Senator Kemp—when it comes to explaining how their new, simple, easy to understand GST will work.
—I raise a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President. That is a reflection on a member of the other place.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—You should withdraw that comment, Senator Cook.
—I withdraw that comment. But I do recall that in January Minister Hockey said, `No price can be rounded up beyond 10 per cent.' We then had the Treasurer say, `No price will go up by 10 per cent.' Mr Costello also said that he knows of no circumstances in which a price will go up by 10 per cent, but Mr Hockey said that they cannot go over 10 per cent. Yet the opposition have demonstrated time after time that prices are going up by either the full 10 per cent or beyond 10 per cent. Everyone knows that prices are going up already, ahead of the GST. The people of Australia already know that prices are going up and that they will go up even further when the GST comes in. Just as prices will go up, so will interest rates, because we all know that higher prices means higher inflation which ultimately leads to an increase in interest rates.
 Let us understand the dimensions of what this government is trying to foist upon the nation. Let us be reminded, each time we have these amendments coming before us, of just how hopeless this government has been at the implementation of the GST but, more importantly, how deceitful it has been in explaining to the Australian public what the full impact will be. The people of Australia were told in January that the government had issued instructions to the ACCC to ensure that no prices went up by more than 10 per cent; but, when we asked to see those instructions and sought from the ACCC an assurance in evidence before the Senate estimates committee, they said no such instructions existed. Here we had the government caught red-handed, engaging in wilful and deliberate deceit, seeking to mislead the Australian public. If only the government itself could be referred to the ACCC for investigation!
In terms of deceit, we saw only recently that workers compensation premium increases in New South Wales,approved by the ACCC, were going up by 12.4 per cent. When the government was asked how this could be so, the government's defence was that, of the 12.4 per cent, only 10 per cent was due to the GST directly and the other 2.4 per cent was due to other matters, including supplier costs. As we understand it, the supplier costs in question relate to the fact that the liabilities that the insurer—in other words, to use the definition in the act, the supplier—is up for in the future will increase because of the broader tax package in terms of payouts. In other words, the 2.4 per cent is due to the government's tax package. Whether it is due specifically to the GST or not does not matter. If it is due to the tax package, it has gone up by more than 10 per cent. Yet the ACCC said that, if these future contingent liabilities are taken into account, then the premiums going up by more than 10 per cent to 12.4 per cent can be justified.
But remember, this is something the government promised could not happen. This is something that the government said by law would never happen. The Treasurer himself said he could not think of anything that would go up by anything even near 10 per cent—but it has happened. The deceit, the untruths, the deliberate misleading are all part and parcel of the government's attempts to hose down the GST bushfire that is now running out of control across Australia. Speaking of the bush, we have the National Party. As I said recently, the National Party are like that old, obedient and trusty sheepdog—
—Not the tail that wags them.
—Not the tail that wags the dog. The dog is being wagged by another tail. And haven't the events of the weekend and the last few days proven that statement to be true! They are there, ready and willing to be trodden on and kicked about by their Liberal Party masters, led by the Treasurer and now by the Prime Minister. The Treasurer, and now the Prime Minister, tell the National Party when to stand, when to sit, when to speak and—on that increasingly rare occasion when they speak out—when to shut up. And haven't the National Party been told to shut up over the issue of the GST on caravan parks!
Despite the rhetoric, despite the threats of resignation by the likes of Minister Anthony, the good old National Party have been told by their Liberal Party masters to roll over, and that is exactly what is happening. The leader of the National Party in this chamber—he is present as I speak—has led the roll-over, and cannot stand up to the Treasurer or the Prime Minister, even when his own rank and file members have unanimously called for the removal of the GST on caravan parks. I say to Senator Boswell as leader of the National Party in this chamber, `What are you going to do to represent the views of your own National Party constituency in this place?' The answer, sadly, seems to be nothing—absolutely nothing. This has led to the charge that, as the leader of the National Party in this place, Senator Boswell obeys his Liberal Party masters, taking whatever policy scraps they throw at him off the Liberal Party policy table.
The bottom line is this: in the eyes of the Liberal Party, the National Party are a joke, a nuisance that is tolerated but not respected, and used but not valued—but who, importantly for the Liberals, will roll over when told to do so. That is the bottom line for the Liberals: the National Party will roll over and do as they are told. When the Treasurer or the Prime Minister click their fingers, the National Party come to heel. Just as a cocky would click his fingers to bring his trusty old sheepdog to attention, the Liberal Treasurer and Prime Minister click their fingers and the National Party roll over—as and when required. And haven't they done that in regard to the issue of the GST and long-term caravan park residents!
Let us look at that rollover in detail, as outlined by Minister Anderson's press release of 19 June. This is the big win the National Party had. This is how the National Party stands up to the Liberal Party. This is how, in the words of Minister Anthony, the National Party `punches above its weight.' Certainly, he has a keen sense of irony. Well, what was the substance of their `big win' over the Liberals? According to Minister Anderson, the National Party's `big win' was that the ACCC would `pay special attention' to the situation of long-term caravan park residents. I do not know where the Deputy Prime Minister has been, but isn't that what the ACCC has been doing anyway—or is supposed to have been doing? Everywhere we turn, the ACCC is paying `special attention' to businesses by threatening them with $10 million fines. So what Mr Anderson has basically secured is a promise that the ACCC will now be used to harass and threaten caravan park landlords into keeping down caravan park rents or face the prospect of having their businesses destroyed by way of a $10 million fine.
Let us look at another `big' National Party win. The New Tax System Advisory Board will enter into discussions with representatives from tenants associations to ensure that the option of using input taxing is simple and clearly understood. So what we have here is an admission by the minister that the GST is not simple and not clearly understood. Further, it is an admission by the National Party that the government's $430 million propaganda campaign has been an absolute failure. So we finally have, from no less than the Deputy Prime Minister, an admission that the GST is horrendously complex and that the government has wasted $430 million of taxpayers' money on a propaganda campaign that has failed.
 If the GST on caravan parks were simple and fair, why does it now require the New Tax System Advisory Board to explain the input tax option to ensure that it is clearly understood and simple? We have always said that the GST is a dog's breakfast of a tax, and this just proves it.
So we have the National Party securing a win that the ACCC will be used to harass and threaten caravan park landlords and a commitment that, after the expenditure of $430 million on a so-called information campaign, the New Tax System Advisory Board will be required to explain how simple and clear the GST is for long-term caravan park residents. But what about a commitment that the GST will be removed from the rents of long-term caravan park residents? Did the National Party secure that win? Of course, they did not. Despite all the bluster and rhetoric at the National Party conference, when push came to shove the Nationals did as they always do: rolled over, lay down and did as they were told by their Liberal Party masters. I mean, why do the Nationals bother even having a leadership team? Why don't they lead? Er, why don't they lead?
—You should have practised the speech!
—They are followers, and they follow Liberal Party orders to a T, sadly led by, well, the interjector.
—You haven't even read the speech! You don't know even what it is about! Now go out and practise it before you come in!
—Thank you for the interjection—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, to Senator Boswell. It is clear that the point is beginning to irk him. All I suggested is that he should stand up to the Liberal Party on behalf of his members. He should not proclaim as wins the things that the ACCC are supposed to do anyway but actually make the effort to represent people in caravan parks and change this dog's breakfast of a tax and, when the Liberals say `Jump!', he should not ask the question, `How high?' It is pitiful to witness the once great National Party being led not by Senator Boswell or Mr Anderson but by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister. 
Let us look at exactly what happened at the New South Wales National Party conference. Mr Gary Nehl, the Deputy Speaker of the House, implored the National Party conference to keep the promise that the National Party had made at the last election: that there would be no GST on residential rents. In fact, Minister Anthony even circulated an election pamphlet to that effect in his seat of Richmond only to come to Canberra and vote in favour of taxing long-term caravan park residents. So Minister Anthony misled and deceived those 6,000 caravan park residents in his seat of Richmond. Somehow I do not think they will be as easily deceived at the next election. 
Lastly, on this issue, I want the National Party to explain why part of the $430 million being spent on a propaganda campaign could not have been used to take the GST off caravan park residents, why $2 million being spent by the PM to go to London to have tea with the Queen could not have been put towards taking the GST off caravan park residents, and why spending $30,000 on Thai silk curtains in the Prime Minister's office is more important than taking the GST off caravan park residents. These are questions that the residents of caravan parks want answers to. They want them from all politicians but, more particularly, they want them from the National Party that has claimed that they will do it.
The Indirect Tax Legislation Amendment Bill 2000 contains no less than 11 separate schedules constituting a further 211 amendments to the new, easy, simple-to-understand GST. It covers changes to charities, agents, financial suppliers, insurance and alcoholic beverages, just to name a few. This bill is just another testimony to the increasing complexity and cost of the GST that is being foisted on Australian businesses and charities. With just days to go before the GST, the government, along with the Democrats, is forcing more costs and disruptions onto charities, as if charities have not had a hard enough time as it is coping with this dog's breakfast of a tax. 
But today was very illuminating for this chamber because we saw for the first time the Democrats trying to distance themselves from their own GST. We had Senator Lees try and distance herself from the fact that she is responsible for the imposition of the GST on two of the most vulnerable groups in society: boarding house residents and long-term caravan park residents. Senator Lees is now trying to walk away as fast as she can, but in reality she cannot. This GST is her GST, and nothing she does, or pretends to do by way of feigned concern for boarding house residents, will change that fact. The bottom line is that, when Senator Lees had a choice, she chose millionaire casino high-rollers over boarding house residents. Senator Lees chose the rich over the poor and now, along with the Prime Minister, she will be happily residing in a luxury London hotel when low-income boarding house residents and caravan park residents start paying the GST. I conclude my contribution to the second reading debate by indicating that we will not oppose this legislation.",SENATE,<title>INDIRECT TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,2000-06-20,"—The Indirect Tax Legislation Amendment Bill 2000 is actually a further 211 amendments to the GST, which was supposed to be the `very simple tax system'. I have got the explanatory memorandum here—I think this is the most up-to-date one—and it is 75 pages long. There some points in it that I will go to shortly. This was supposed to be a simple taxation system. The ANTS booklet says:
Once fully implemented, the Government's tax reform plan will, in fact, reduce the tax take but collect revenue in a fairer, simpler and more open way. It will do so in a way that benefits families, businesses and the wider community.
I am yet to find the families, businesses and wider community that think the tax reform this government is proposing to be simpler, easier, more beneficial or more open. It is simply not the case.
The piece of legislation that we are considering at the moment has 211 additional amendments and 75 pages of explanatory memorandum, but regarding this piece of legislation the Treasurer said back in January that there would be no more amendments. He said there would be no more changes to the legislation. That is the reality, and yet on a daily basis we are seeing more changes being proposed because this is such a big mess. This very simple process, this very simple new tax—sorry, it is a new tax system, not a new tax—is so simple and so fair and is going to be so readily accepted by the community that we have had to spend $430 million in promoting it. Not that that is enough. Each and every day that the parliament sits, and even outside of the parliamentary sitting periods, we have government ministers promoting this tax system and supposedly delivering a better outcome for Australians. We know that is simply not the case because of the processes that have been put in place in terms of business confidence. Whilst businesses were probably initially cajoled by the government into believing that there was a greener paddock on the other side of the hill, that we could make a change to the tax system and that all would be better, I think it has now been consistently shown, and the Yellow Pages Small Business Index shows, that business confidence is at an all-time low.
I know that in my own state six businesses have already closed and say it is as a result of the GST. It might be that the GST was going to be the last straw for them. I acknowledge that some small businesses have been confronting difficulties, but many of them have said—indeed, all six of these have said—that the reality is that they were just not prepared to cop the additional cost of dealing with this new simpler, fairer tax system and, as a result, have closed their doors. I will quote a media release which came out with the February 2000 Yellow Pages Small Business Index. It says:
The survey covering 1,200 small businesses across Australia and completed two weeks ago found that over the past quarter regional proprietors'—
and these are the ones I am talking about from my state—
confidence about their business prospects for the year ahead fell 27 percentage points to a six-year low of a net 21 per cent. The previous lowest confidence figure was 39 per cent recorded in July 1997.
Those things must tell the government a story. 
As I said, this process is so simple that we have the Australian Taxation Office putting out—and I do not know whether I have page numbers for this—a substantial document called the food index. This is on top of the ACCC's consumer guide. By the time you get all this paperwork in your shopping trolley, there will be no room for groceries. I think it was summed up pretty well by a cartoon I noticed in one of my local papers in Tassie which went to the very question of how the poor old punters will have to deal with this new tax system. It displays a shopper who has their accountant in the shopping trolley. He has the books, and he is advising the consumer which products to buy. I will quote in part from the comic strip—
—You should incorporate it.
—I should actually seek leave to have it incorporated, Senator Forshaw, because it would be a very good example.
—I might seek leave in a minute. I know Senator Boswell would support it!
 (Senator Lightfoot)—Perhaps you might be kind enough, for the sake of Hansard, to say what paper you are quoting from and what date it is.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President, I will do that. It was the Hobart Mercury of Friday, 16 June this year. It is a cartoon by Polly. Looking at the shelf behind the shopper, you have products with `a bit of GST'. There are some with `definitely no GST, we think'. Then we have `GST with sauce', `more GST for your dollar', `a smidge of GST maybe'. This bloke has really caught the feeling about this tax. There is also `plus GST' and then he has `GST free'. How confusing can you be!
—What about shaving cream? Has it got a good lather?
—Yes, there is lather with GST. What I find interesting about the food guide is that if you buy live fish it is GSTable, except if it is a crab. You can get live crabs GST free. I find that very interesting. Live sheep are taxable. Live cows are taxable. Live salmon, live trout and other live fish are taxable, but live crabs are GST free. I am curious about that. I wonder whether it is a mistake or not. Of course, we have had a whole range of other interesting comparisons pointed out with regard to this particular food index. If you want to buy a few old bones for the poor old dog you have to pay tax on them, but if you buy the same bones to make soup there is no tax. I know my dog is going to be eating soup bones because I am not going to pay GST on the bones, particularly if GST has already been paid on the live animal. It is a very interesting set of circumstances. This document is about 50 pages in total. This is one I got straight off the Net, so I have not got it in book form.
We then have the consumer guide from the ACCC. That is supposed to help the poor old shopper determine whether he is being ripped off or not. He is going to have this little booklet and he is going to have to ask, `What is the price, and what is the GST on it?' You are going to have to sit down with your long shopping docket outside the shop to try and work out whether you have been ripped off with the products that you have bought—if you can work out which ones were GSTable and which ones were not and, of course, you have to take your food index for that. I cannot see how that is a simple process for the poor old shopper.
If this were a simple process, you would have defined very clearly the tax movements. We would not have had to give the ACCC extraordinary powers, which they are never going to be able to implement anyway. The government is now considering a set of circumstances put up by the business tax reform coalition which limit the ability of the ACCC to do anything about price exploitation matters to a period of four weeks after a complaint. If the government now puts in place a mechanism where it restricts the ACCC's investigations—and actually doing something about price exploitation—to four weeks from the time of receiving a complaint, they have no hope. They are literally going to be inundated with thousands of complaints.
This was for a simple tax system. If it is so simple, why do we have all of these problems? As Senator Cook said, why do the National Party have such a problem with the poor old mobile home and long-term caravan rentals? What a ridiculous situation for them to be in. The National Party allowed the Democrats to negotiate an arrangement for tax on food. Mrs Helen Dickie, the President of the National Party—and Senator Boswell might be able to confirm whether she is the national president or the New South Wales president—
—Both.
—Even better. She was right when she said that the National Party had become irrelevant in a sense. It had no capacity to go and argue for its constituency in a government in which it is supposed to be an equal partner. It is no wonder that the cockies' corner up here has been shrinking away, and it will continue to shrink away to non-existence.
—Where are they?
—There is one over there. The Leader of the National Party in the Senate, Senator Boswell, is across the chamber. I did not catch what Senator Boswell said when he had the microphone and when he was trying to placate the poor old long-term residents of caravan parks and the like. But, Senator Boswell, those people are looking to you for a bit of leadership.
—You should address your comments to the chair, Senator Murphy.
—Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President: Senator Boswell, those people are looking to you to take up the argument on behalf of those who the National Party claim are their constituents. They stumbled on Telstra. They could not get up. They were down on their knees, and Senator Alston got his foot on Senator Boswell's throat on Telstra and kept him down there.
—$740 million.
—Well, I never. Isn't that an amazing thing! We know that $740 million is going to disappear into thin air. The other aspect of the GST that is very important to the consumer is the price of petrol. What have we had on the price of petrol? We have had the one-time Acting Treasurer—I do not think he has acted as Treasurer since this statement—Mr Joe Hockey saying that petrol prices would go down, we have had the Prime Minister saying that they would not go up and we have had the Treasurer saying that no petrol price anywhere would rise at all. Then we have had the Assistant Treasurer, from time to time, come in here and say that petrol prices need not rise, whatever that means. But we know petrol prices will rise as a result of the GST. There is no question about that.
—Petrol prices do not rise with the GST. They go down 7c.
—I would like to be as sure of winning Tattslotto, Senator Boswell, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President. In fact, I would like to challenge you on a Tattslotto ticket.
—Are you talking about challenging me, Senator Murphy?
—No, Mr Acting Deputy President, but if you want to take some on the side, you can.
—I would suggest you direct your comments through the chair, Senator Murphy.
—Petrol prices will go up as a result of the GST. There is no doubt about that. The inflation that will occur with the GST will guarantee that. Yet what have we heard from the government about that? The same old rhetoric, going nowhere. The one thing that seems to be left for the government to cling to is the tax cuts that are supposed to cover everything. These cover-all tax cuts for the people are going to cover the increase in the prices, cover the increase in the cost of petrol, cover the increase in the cost of services and cover the cost of increases in rent, whether in long-term caravan parks or not.
There is no way that the tax cuts you are talking about are going to do that. That is the only thing you have going for you; that is the only thing you seem to be mentioning nowadays. Everything else is gone. To back that up the government say, `We will keep the GST.' I do not know whether that means you think it is so terrible that you are trying to lump it onto us. That is the endgame for the government. You just want to hang on and say, `Look, don't blame us because they will keep it too.' What an extraordinary set of circumstances! If you thought this was so good, you would not have to say anything about what we might or might not do. The government would not have to say anything about that. That is the whole process that you are going through. You have had to roll this tax back because you know that it is a bad tax. You know that you have stuffed this up monumentally.
—I raise a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President. I draw your attention to that word and I ask: is that an appropriate term to be used in the parliament?
—I am advised that it is an accepted part of Australian colloquialism, Senator Boswell, but I thank you for drawing my attention to it.
—As I was saying, nothing is greater evidence for the fact that this has been stuffed up monumentally than if you read the 75-page explanatory memorandum. I find it interesting in terms of the 211 amendments this represents. I was curious about the explanations to some of those amendments. In the short time that we have available, I wondered whether or not they help clear up the confusion that might exist across a range of businesses and even non-profit bodies. It says here in schedule 1, relating to non-profit bodies:
Date of effect: Various.
... 		... 		...
Financial impact: Negligible.
Compliance cost impact: Most amendments will reduce compliance costs, others will have no impact.
That is about as clear as mud. If you go over the page, it states:
Proposal announced: The amendments to education goods and sewerage services were announced in the Treasurer's Press Release No. 37 of 2000. The other measures have not been announced.
That is very informative. It then states:
Financial impact: Minimal.
Compliance cost impact: Nil.
I can go over a few more pages to read some more examples:
Proposal announced:—
this is administration—
Not previously announced.
Financial impact: The impact from the crediting and interest measures is unquantifiable.
That is all very interesting, but I do not know how helpful it is. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>INDIRECT TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-06-20,"—I want to reiterate that the Greens have always been and remain totally opposed to the GST because of the unfair impact it will have on Australians, particularly the way in which it will widen the already increasing gap between the haves and the have-nots in this country. This piece of legislation, which is one of many pieces of legislation coming before the Senate to tidy up all the anomalies and inconsistencies of what was supposed to be a simple tax system but has turned out to be a mess, leads to a particular set of circumstances which cannot be allowed to go unnoticed—that is, the potential, under the legislation as it stands, for political parties to get charity status and therefore escape the GST on fundraising activities. Questions about this have been raised in the past, not least by a study from the Australia Institute, conducted by Institute tax specialist Julie Smith, called Defining charity in a new tax system. The result of that was flagged by the director of the Australia Institute, Dr Clive Hamilton, on 24 May. He said:
“Our study exposes a loophole allowing political parties to claim the same GST-free status as charities running a soup-kitchen or a women's refuge. Political parties will enjoy a tax break at the expense of other groups.”
He went on to give this example:
“Caviar served at a political party dinner for corporate donors will be GST-free whilst the snags at the local child care centre's regular Saturday morning sausage sizzle and handmade furniture from a sheltered workshop will attract the new tax.”
Ms Smith, who did the study, said:
... political parties were classified as gift-deductible entities under a broad and arbitrary income tax definition. Under GST legislation, gift-deductible entities—
and that includes political parties, as she points out—
were eligible for GST-free treatment as charities if they charged their clients cheaply enough for the goods and services provided.
She continued:
“Community childcare centres are not counted as charities, and there is even legal doubt about whether some bodies including advocacy and self-help groups for the disabled are considered charitable.
“The result is that the restrictive pricing rules for determining GST-free activities of charities are likely to cause significant damage to some genuine charities relying on various sales activities to finance their work, while treating organisations such as political parties to unwarranted tax breaks ...”
Ms Smith said:
“For example, sheltered workshops who use their profits to support the employment of disabled workers pay full GST on what they sell ...”
The Prime Minister was asked about this on ABC Radio in Hobart on 27 May, a couple of days after the Australia Institute raised the question. He was being interviewed by ABC Radio's Tim Cox and was asked why political parties will get charity-like status under the GST. His reply was: 
... because they're not-for-profit organisations—I can assure you the Liberal party does not make any money—
Whatever one might think about that opinion from the Prime Minister, inherent in those words is corroboration that political parties will get this tax-free status. I should in fairness say that the Assistant Treasurer and an opinion from the tax office that were consequent on that discussion said that that is not the case. So what we have is confusion reigning in this situation.
I want to help the Senate and, indeed, the Prime Minister to end that confusion, because I think it will bring politics into unnecessary disrepute if we do not clear it up. Why should political parties in certain fundraising activities get tax deductible status that does not apply to little athletics, let alone to child-care centres? I want to flag that, in the committee stages, I will be moving an amendment to schedule 1 on page 12 of this bill to add the following to the definition of a `gift-deductible entity': 
... provided that the entity is not a political party that is registered under Part XI of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918.
I put it to the Senate that this ought to get unanimous support. On the one hand, we have organisations like the Australia Institute—and, indeed, I share their concern—saying that there may be a loophole here for political parties; on the other hand, we have the Assistant Treasurer and the tax office saying that there isn't a loophole. What we do know is that there is some confusion and that my amendment will end that confusion. It is certainly not going to go against the clear intent of the Assistant Treasurer when he said that political parties are not going to be treated as charities. I think it is very important that we clear the matter up.
Mr Acting Deputy President, you will be aware that in question time today I asked the Assistant Treasurer whether the public funding of political parties—which you get, as you know, after an election—would be tax deductible, and he did not know. I asked that question because of a letter to Margaret Blakers in my office, going back to last January, who had sought advice from the tax office on just that matter. I should reiterate that, after the last election, political parties in this country were paid $33 million in public funding—that is, taxpayers' money—to reimburse them for their political campaigns. When you apply the GST to that amount, over $3 million will be deducted at the next election from the $33 million. So it concerned me. The Deputy Commissioner of Taxation said, `Yes, the GST will apply,' and so it should, of course, because it will apply to a whole range of other public entities, including farmers and authors who get payments from government in return for giving up certain rights. It did worry me when the New South Wales Greens sought a ruling from the Electoral Commission and were told, `No, the GST won't apply to public funding; the $3 million in tax won't be taken out.' The Electoral Commission said that it was relying on information or advice from the tax office.
Once again, we have got confusion here. We have two pieces of apparent Taxation Office advice saying diametrically opposite things. What I am hoping is that, when the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, acquaints himself with this issue, he will come back to the Senate and make it clear that the electoral funding is subject to the GST, just the same as the public getting money from government is subject to the GST—the dairy structural assistance program being one. Lots of money there is earmarked to go to dairy farmers under structural assistance, but they are going to be GSTed. Authors who give up their right to exclusively sell books in bookshops and allow them to go to libraries, where they are read more cheaply by the public—what a great institution libraries are—get what is called public lending rights as a result of that. That public lending right is going to be GSTed. 
So political candidates who stand for election and get funded afterwards through public funding should in fairness expect that that funding will also be GSTed. We might not like it, but this has been approved by the parliament so we have to pay up, the same as everybody else. I was very alarmed to see that there was a ruling coming from the Electoral Commission based on tax office advice which said, `No, you won't have to,' particularly as that came just three months after the tax office had told us, `Yes, you will have to.' I can see only two reasons for this apparent conflict in advice: either the left hand of the tax office does not know what the right hand is doing, or there has been political pressure brought to bear on the tax office in those three months to get it to reverse its advice so that the political parties and politicians will be exempt from having their public funding GSTed. We wait to see what the Treasurer has to say on that matter. But here is the opportunity to clear up the question as to whether political parties should be treated as charities in some of their fundraising activities and therefore made exempt. Of course they should not. I hope that I will have multipartisan support for this simple amendment to at least put that confusing matter to rest.",SENATE,<title>INDIRECT TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-06-20,"—The Indirect Tax Legislation Amendment Bill 2000 we are dealing with is further legislation in respect of the so-called new tax system, the goods and services tax. The legislation we are considering contains over 100 new amendments to the goods and services tax, the GST. Specifically, a total of 145 amendments are contained in 11 schedules. What is important about these 145 amendments is that they continue the Liberal-National Party government's rollback of the goods and services tax whilst, of course, pretending that it is not rolling it back. And there have been other examples of legislation in this regard. The Liberal-National Party government will also use this bill to make, effectively, a number of other amendments to the GST prior to its commencement on 1 July. The significance of the new amendments is that they build on top of the 1,026 amendments to the goods and services tax that have been moved since last year and the many hundreds of new tax system amendments—for example, those relating to the ABN and the PAYG system—that are still before the parliament in other legislation.
The bill, in respect of the 11 schedules we are considering, deals with charities and some non-profit bodies—expanding the range of GST-free supplies in areas relating to water, health and education, supplies involving non-residents; simplifying the way the GST applies between principals and agents; the financial supplies for entities which are not financial institutions; the precise rules for calculating the goods and services tax—for example, rounding; some technical matters concerning joint ventures; various technical insurance issues; the administration of the GST between the tax office and taxpayers; an anti-avoidance provision concerning the stockpiling of alcoholic beverages; and other subjects relating to livestock, housing and second-hand goods. If we look at the detail of the legislation, as I have said earlier, it represents significant change in a number of critical areas. The amendments represent, in a variety of forms, the government's response to the various complaints from industry groups and individuals in respect of the goods and services tax.
There is one area of important complaint that has received a significant degree of media coverage over the last few weeks in relation to caravan parks that is not contained within this legislation. But I will say a little bit about that later on. According to a colleague of mine in the other place, Mr Craig Emerson, the member for Rankin—remembering that this is the so-called `streamlined new tax system for the new century'—the weigh-in of GST legislation and explanatory material is now up to 5.1 kilograms.
—That's astounding!
—It is astounding, Senator Bolkus. The new simplified tax system now weighs in at an additional 5.1 kilograms. I understand that, should we finish this legislation in this fortnight of sitting before that crucial date of 1 July, the weigh-in for GST legislation will be 6.1 kilograms. One of the arguments for this so-called new tax system was that it would be made simpler, but instead we are seeing amendment after amendment. Quite frankly, that is not unusual in respect to legislation. But we are not just seeing a few amendments; we are seeing hundreds of amendments that are supposedly attempting to simplify the application of the goods and services tax.
Before I touch on a couple of specific issues, I want to draw to the Senate's attention the Commonwealth government's principal revenue raising estimates as outlined in Budget Paper No. 1. With the implementation of the goods and services tax, the income tax collected from individuals in the year 1999-2000 will be approximately $75,694 billion. With the much trumpeted tax cuts, that decreases to $68,109 billion in the year 2000-01.
Then there is revenue from a range of other indirect taxes, excluding the GST. One of the arguments is that we should simplify the indirect tax base and have a GST; that is one of the central themes of this government. But, despite the introduction of a GST, there are government and Treasury projections for tax from other sources. Let's take excise duty on petroleum products and crude oil. This financial year it is projected to be $11,419 million and increasing to $12,968 million in the year 2001; that is an increase of 13.6 per cent. Other excise is projected to increase from $2,783 million to $6,810 million in the year 2000-01; that is an increase of 144.7 per cent.
If we go to this in a little more detail, page 513 of Treasury paper No. 1 refers to other excise including beer. The revenue collected from excise on beer is currently $892 million, increasing to $1,441 million—an increase of 61.6 per cent. That is a staggering increase in indirect tax in respect of excise on beer. The revenue collected from excise on spirits will increase from $152 million to $245 million. The revenue collected from excise on tobacco products will increase from $1,740 million to $5,124 million—a staggering increase of 194.5 per cent. The revenue collected from excise duty on unleaded petrol will increase from $5,044 million to $5,993 million—an increase of 18.8 per cent in revenue collection in this particular area.
The argument was that the GST was to replace the existing indirect tax base in order to simplify the tax system. Of course there is a whole range of other complications, but in this one very important area the GST does not do this. The revenue from the other areas of indirect taxation, specifically excise tax—after income tax and after the GST—will still be a total of $26,168 million in the year 2000-01. How does this come about? Aside from the obvious—that the goods and services tax is not replacing other indirect taxes within our tax system—there is a double whammy in respect of the goods and services tax because excise is indexed against the consumer price index. Within that CPI increase over the next year will be a significant component relating to the introduction of the goods and services tax. It varies—we have had different figures put forward. We accept that it may be four or five per cent. Effectively, the government is getting a bonus in revenue through the indexation of the excise tax to the consumer price index because of the GST. It is getting billions of dollars in additional revenue because of the GST. 
If this government were fair dinkum about the introduction of a goods and services tax, it would exclude the inflationary component of that from the CPI. This is why the beer industry, for example, are absolutely outraged, and rightly so, about the treatment they are receiving in respect of the introduction of a goods and services tax. Not only that, it is well known in respect of beer and excise that the Prime Minister misled the people of Australia, and that is putting it mildly, when he claimed in a number of radio talkback shows that the beer price increase would be 1.9 per cent. Of course, it turns out that he was referring to packaged beer, not to beer sold by the glass in clubs and hotels. Not only are beer drinkers and the breweries outraged, but so are people who live in rural and regional Australia in particular, who will have to pay higher petrol taxes as a result of the introduction of a goods and services tax. I know the government argue that they are introducing a subsidy to be paid to petrol station proprietors. It will be interesting to see whether that works, but that is another issue. However, for that subsidy to be effective and for petrol prices in rural and regional Australia not to increase as a result of the GST, the government will need to make a much greater subsidy payment than they have so far indicated.
I have two other points about the wholesale sales tax and the GST. I have made a number of comments about the wholesale sales tax in debate in this chamber before. But we note that on many occasions the Assistant Treasurer triumphantly rises to his feet in question time usually in answer to a so-called dorothy dix question from his own side—in other words, he has prepared the question for the person who has asked the question—to outline the success of the Australian economy. We hear figures about declining unemployment and very solid growth, and I acknowledge that in a number of areas the economy is doing well. But the principal argument that this government has fallen back on in terms of supporting the GST is that it is good for the country, it is good for the economy. But I put it to the Senate: how will the economy perform any better than it is at the present time with a GST? We have not had the introduction of a GST yet. 
This wholesale sales tax, which is so often derided by the government, is one of the most important areas of revenue collection for government at the present time. So we have the economy doing well with a wholesale sales tax which is often criticised because it is a 1930s tax. So what? The wholesale sales tax was introduced back in the 1930s, approximately 70 years ago. But the GST is not a new tax. I think the GST was invented by the French and was introduced into France approximately 20 years after the wholesale sales tax was introduced into the Australian economy and, regrettably, the GST has spread throughout most OECD countries, except for the United States—one important exception. There again is an interesting comparison with Australia. Look at the strength of the US economy, and they do not have a GST. 
So to the argument that the wholesale sales tax is old and outdated, so what? The Australian economy is booming with the wholesale sales tax. It is absolutely booming. I think that is a point that should not be lost in this debate. Senator Kemp talks about a number of characteristics of the Australian economy, but he never mentions the wholesale sales tax. He always talks about how great the economy is going to go after 1 July with a GST, but he never mentions one of the critical taxation ingredients to the equation—the wholesale sales tax, that tax that is so often incorrectly derided and criticised by this government. The GST might be replacing the wholesale sales tax, but it is not replacing a whole range of indirect taxes, particularly the excise taxes that I referred to earlier.
We have had a number of other controversies about the GST in recent weeks. We had the controversy about caravan parks. I am sure no-one would have missed hearing about the National Party's 80th birthday celebrations at their national conference last weekend. Issues relating to beer, dairy deregulation and caravan parks were raised—in fact they are all we heard of during the National Party conference and their 80th birthday celebrations. At that conference, Ms Helen Dickie, the Federal President of the National Party, indicated that the National Party are in some trouble. There have been a range of other people within the National Party, including Mr Causley, Minister Anthony and a number of others, who have indicated that they are very concerned about the GST. But Ms Helen Dickie has hit on the solution. She said, `Well, for a start, let's stop using the word “coalition”. It does not help us. We must talk about the National Party, be it in government or in opposition.'
The National Party must go down in history as one of the silliest parties in terms of the GST. The National Party has signed up to a GST. It has signed up to higher prices in rural and regional areas. It has signed up to more paperwork for small business and farmers. It has signed up to tax cuts. Half of the farmers in this country do not earn any income, so what use are income tax cuts to them? Yet the National Party has signed up to it. It has signed up, effectively, to higher petrol prices in rural and regional Australia. And then, of course, there is the issue of caravan parks, and there is a whole host of other policy matters and outcomes that relate to the GST that are much more magnified in their consequences and hurt much more in rural and regional Australia. The National Party has signed up to it. It just shows how much it is in the control of the Liberal Party that represents the interests principally of urban big business.
The National Party president's solution is that the National Party has to start calling itself by its own name—the National Party. I suggest to the National Party, which has ignored the interests of people in rural and regional Australia—its own base—that it is going to have to do a lot more than call itself `National Party' if it is to overcome its neglect of the interests of people living in rural and regional Australia. It is not just in respect of the GST—it has neglected service areas such as education and health, and it has neglected investment in infrastructure and roads. All of these areas have been ignored by this Liberal-National Party government. I will not use the word `coalition'. The National Party has been in it up to its neck with the Liberal Party. It has been the doormat of the Liberal Party. The Liberal Party gives it a few bickies occasionally to try to keep it happy. I note some interesting analysis: the National Party represents the six seats with the lowest income in this country.
—Not for very long.
—Exactly, Senator Bolkus—hopefully, not for long. Mr Howard has gone on record and said that he is not going to back down on the issue of caravan parks. At a committee hearing I was at yesterday—and it has been reported in today's press—I heard that the government is proposing to do a U-turn on the taxation treatment of artists. We had a very effective presentation from artists, who want exemption of areas of their income from the impact of the new business system. So the Liberal Party is going to back down in respect of the way the new tax system applies to artists—I think the National Party will be interested in that. The poor old National Party—the government is not going to back down in respect of caravan parks. I am sure the National Party must be thrilled to hear this. The government, rightly so, is taking up the concerns of artists and doing another backflip, another roll-back, of the tax system. (Time expired)
Debate (on motion by Senator Herron) adjourned.",SENATE,<title>INDIRECT TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-06-20,"—The Social Security and Veterans' Entitlements Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Matters) Bill 2000 gives effect to a range of 1999 budget savings measures by making various amendments to nine acts. The specific changes relate to international payment rules, including portability and qualifying residence; changes to the use of tax file numbers, with the objective of strengthening compliance with social security laws; changes ensuring the four per cent pension increase is extended to those participating in the pension bonus scheme; and technical changes to associated social security changes. The majority of amendments are of a technical or consequential nature and are supported by the opposition. However, in outlining our position I wish to focus on three issues which have implications for contemporary debate on welfare reform. The issues I wish to address relate to, firstly, standardising the overseas portability of social security and related payments; secondly, datamatching in social security payments using tax file numbers; and, thirdly, extending portability to payments made by the Department of Veterans' Affairs.
The international portability provisions of the Social Security Act deal with the rules for the payment of social security benefits and allowances when a beneficiary leaves Australia on a temporary basis. Currently, each payment has its own international portability rules and there are many inconsistencies. For example, the age pension, bereavement allowance and the disability support pension—if the recipient is severely disabled—are completely portable for up to 12 months. After this time they continue to be portable but at a reduced rate proportional to a person's working life residence. At the other end of the spectrum, Jobsearch, Newstart, carer allowance and sickness allowance are among the payments portable for a maximum of three months at the present time. The proposed amendments will standardise these rules in a central area of the act with a standard maximum portability period of 26 weeks. It should be noted that the portability of payments is subject to the beneficiaries remaining qualified for them. For example, the Newstart allowance is not portable unless the person complies with the government's increasingly onerous activity tests. The government has framed its case for change by extolling the virtues of a standardised and simplified system. These terms are the government's euphemisms for measures that generate savings. Changes to international portability will lead to annual administrative savings of up to $10.7 million.
We acknowledge that standardising the 26 weeks will advantage recipients of payments currently portable for three months. However, the conditions attached to payments such as Newstart, carer allowance and youth allowance mean that it is unlikely that a person can fulfil activity tests and other eligibility criteria while absent from Australia, thus the extension of portability is unlikely to apply in practice. On the other hand, the opposition is concerned that these changes will reduce the capacity of the system to support Australian residents with special needs. For example, a disability support pensioner who seeks treatment overseas will now lose the benefit after six months. It should be noted that we are debating this bill less than three months after the release of the interim report of the welfare reform reference committee. This report stressed the importance of developing a more responsive, flexible welfare system that can tailor programs and payments to individual circumstances and need, yet the minister is already pushing through changes in legislation that make the system less flexible—changes which standardise rather than individualise the system. The minister may have endorsed the report in principle, but the government clearly is not interested in practical measures that will realise the committee's vision for reform. This would require investment, imagination and sensitivity to the complex barriers which exclude some Australians from participation in our economic and social life. I point out that the opposition will soon move amendments to address our concerns about the proposed international portability rules. I understand the committee stage of the bill will not be dealt with today.
The submissions received by the Senate Community Affairs Committee from the National Welfare Rights Network and the Department of Family and Community Services have helped flesh out the arguments and the dimensions of the debate. After close consideration of the submissions Labor remains unconvinced that the administrative gains from streamlining provisions and the small number of people who will be affected by changes are sufficient reasons to justify reducing entitlements and reducing flexibility and responsiveness in portability. If, as FACS argues, the numbers taking advantage of more generous portability provisions for disability support pensioners are few, there is little chance retention of portability of 12 months will see a flood of individuals using the period to relocate overseas for long periods of time. In addition, the legislation is structured to ensure that participatory obligations override portability.
FACS claims that less than 100 wife and widow B pensioners will be affected by the proposed reduction in maximum portability periods to 26 weeks. It should also be noted that these payments will soon be phased out. It is Labor's view that the demand for consistency is not as strong as maintaining certainty of entitlement for the affected few. Nor is Labor convinced by the department's argument for doubling the period before which a person re-entering the country can be eligible for further portability. We are not convinced that the integrity of the system is threatened by the current arrangement as the present system provides an adequate test of a person's commitment to this country. Similarly, we see no compelling arguments to remove the opportunity for people to return overseas within the prescribed period due to unforeseen circumstances. Given that the measure allows discretion on humanitarian grounds, is a low volume transaction—Centrelink reports only 16 cases a year—and has been stringently enforced, it would appear to be a weak case to remove the provision. The purpose of our amendments will be to ensure a system that is sufficiently flexible to support and meet individual needs while allowing for the consolidation and centralisation of portability rules. We will not be sold a piece of legislation that uses what is an otherwise noble exercise to reduce the entitlements of a small number of our citizens.
I turn now to data matching. It was a previous Labor government that initiated the process of data matching in order to enhance the integrity of the social security system. We remain committed to a system which ensures that payments are the province of those who are eligible and that people receive what they are entitled to. Currently, reliance on identity data such as name and date of birth makes it difficult to identify persons who inadvertently or deliberately provide different details to agencies such as Centrelink and the Australian Taxation Office. The amendments will allow tax file numbers to be used as the primary data-matching tool. It is a change the opposition supports.
The provisions will empower the secretary to obtain information, including tax file numbers, from the Commissioner of Taxation for the purposes of establishing or verifying a claimant's or recipient's qualification, payment rate or entitlement to be paid. I note that the government's second reading speech in the House assured the parliament that the Privacy Commissioner's office was consulted in the development of this proposal and that all data matching will be undertaken in strict observance of the commissioner's guidelines. Accordance with privacy guidelines will require behavioural adjustments on the part of the Australian Taxation Office. Breaches of the kind observed in recent weeks will not be tolerated.
While the opposition is supportive of measures that address welfare fraud, we hope that the minister and her colleague Mr Abbott will not use savings made from improved data matching to brand all welfare recipients, and particularly those on unemployment benefits, as cheats. This is our hope, but I suspect it is a forlorn one. This government has shamelessly used the issue of welfare fraud to drive its tough and punitive approach to welfare reform. The language of `cheats', `bludgers' and `job snobs' has been used as a political weapon to harden community attitudes towards the disadvantaged.
—By the press, not by the government.
—I am glad you interjected, Minister. For the minister to object, particularly when we have the minister in the lower house, Mr Abbott, at times wallowing in press comments, in radio interviews, using those phrases consistently—
—No.
—He does use those phrases, Minister. I beg to differ.
—We don't talk about `bludgers'. We don't talk about `cheats'.
—Minister, I stand to be corrected and so on, but all I can say is I believe that this minister, Mr Abbott, wallows in the image of being tough on people in the welfare area, and he does use those phrases—remember, these are Australian citizens—and uses them, as we say, for the political purposes of this government. It is called wedge politics in America, and it is a feature this government has taken up here with a vengeance.
—Rubbish.
—You may say `rubbish', Minister, but it is true. This Liberal coalition government has been advised by Republicans from the Republican Party in America, who have been past masters of wedge politics in the last 20 years. And this is wedge politics of the worst order, when you have remarks made by Mr Abbott in particular. The government has created an environment where the genuinely needy, the honest and those who make honest and inadvertent mistakes are all under suspicion. I am proud to say that that is not the Labor way.
I turn to portability of Veterans' Affairs benefits. As shadow minister for veterans' affairs this is my own area. Schedule 3 amends the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 to extend the changes relating to the portability of Department of Family and Community Services, FACS, benefits and allowances to payments made by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. This involves changes to the administration of rent assistance, telephone allowance, pharmaceutical allowance and remote area allowance. The opposition believes it is important to remove disparities between the portability provisions applying to FACS and DVA pensioners.
At the present time, rent assistance, telephone allowance and remote area allowance are not payable when a DVA pensioner is temporarily overseas. The opposition supports the payment of rent assistance and telephone allowance for a maximum of 26 weeks upon temporary absence. We also support the portability of remote area allowance for a maximum of eight weeks. As remote area allowance is paid to assist with the high cost of living in remote areas, we do not think that it is appropriate to continue paying the allowance for extended absences when the additional expenses are not being incurred.
A more vexed issue concerns the proposed changes to the portability requirements for pharmaceutical allowance. This amendment would limit its payment for temporary absences to a maximum of 26 weeks. Under the current rules, pharmaceutical allowance was payable until the following 1 January after the person left Australia. This means that the period of payment could vary from two weeks to 12 months, depending on when the recipient taxied down the runway. The opposition recognises that a person who temporarily leaves Australia in the first half of the calendar year will, under this amendment, receive their pharmaceutical allowance for a reduced period. Nonetheless, we support this amendment. There is no reason why time of departure is an appropriate means of determining length of portability.
While this section of the bill will benefit Australian veterans, the opposition is appalled by the government's failure to provide a comprehensive response to the validation study on morbidity of Vietnam veterans and their children. I do acknowledge that in the budget there are a number of areas where the government has made a number of changes. I would have hoped that maybe amendments to this omnibus bill, which contains amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Act, would implement initiatives in those areas that the government has accepted from the validation study on the morbidity of Vietnam veterans and their children. I hope that during this debate, Minister, you can give some indication to the Senate of when the government will introduce legislation to take effect in those areas which you announced in the budget relating to the morbidity study.
I want to take this opportunity to again point out that the major report in this area found, for example, that suicide is three times more prevalent amongst children of Vietnam veterans up to the age of 35 and that there is also a significant increase in the levels of spina bifida, cancer, cleft lip and cleft palate amongst the children of Vietnam veterans. There are still some areas where parts of the veteran community want more response, but the major response they want is to get the legislation in so the benefits can be made available. We accept, Minister, that in some areas we are moving into uncharted or new areas when we pay benefits to the children of veterans because of genetic defects such as spina bifida, cancer, cleft lip and cleft palate. This will establish new principles under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. But as these veterans and their children have waited a long time to prove the point that there is a case—and it has now been accepted by the government—the veteran community would like to see that legislation promptly introduced. The opposition will do everything to facilitate the legislation going through the parliament rapidly to ensure that those veterans and their children get a speedy as possible remedy for the distress they have been suffering for many years. This government likes to speak of mutual obligation, but its obligations are narrowly conceived and based on spending less not more. The government will extend portability requirements to veterans—
—Not true; not correct.
—Well, Minister, I think that is correct. Thank you for your interjection. The government will extend portability requirements to veterans but will not address the urgent physical and psychological health needs of their children. I hope the minister can respond here to give us an indication of when that legislation will be before us. Minister, it is not as though this report on the Vietnam veterans has just suddenly appeared. There have been several morbidity studies and the validation of them has been going on now for several years. When the final validation report came out six months ago and we asked the government to immediately announce what measures it would take we were told to wait until the budget. So there was at least six months for DVA to prepare the appropriate legislation. So I am a little disappointed—unless you can give me a compelling reason why my disappointment is unreasonable—that the legislation will not at least be introduced before we rise for the winter break at the end of this month.
I accept that this issue in relation to the Vietnam veterans has gone on for a long time when both parties have been in government. There is no doubt that at long last we have to accept that there are unique circumstances affecting the Vietnam veterans and their children. Although the recommendations in the report that have been accepted by the government go into new areas, it will mean that these children in particular will now get the care that they require. Even though that may be costly on a per capita basis, we certainly should not begrudge spending that money on these veterans and their children. We look forward to not only the care being provided to those who have suffered spina bifida, cleft palate, et cetera but also the effective measures that can be taken to counsel adult children of Vietnam veterans who have been committing suicide at nearly double the rate of suicide in the normal population. This is a real tragedy. In a week in which this parliament has been in a very sombre mood due to the suicide of one of our own members, the issue of suicide is very contemporary with us all.

 (Senator Murphy)—Before I call Senator Bartlett, I would like to remind senators that, when a quorum has been called, senators are not able to leave the chamber until such time as a quorum has been reached. It is obligatory upon the President or Acting Deputy President, if a senator does leave the chamber, to request the Black Rod to go and bring them back. I am sure that is not a situation that many senators would enjoy. So to avoid that in the future, we hope that senators will remain in the chamber when quorums are called.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MISCELLANEOUS MATTERS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-06-20,"—Mr Acting Deputy President, being in the chamber is so much fun that I do not know why anyone would ever want to leave! In the debate on the Social Security and Veterans' Entitlements Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Matters) Bill 2000, I am speaking on behalf of the Australian Democrats. It is another social security and veterans' entitlements amendment bill. As is often the case, it contains a variety of amendments, most with similar themes surrounding issues of portability of payments when people are overseas or returning from overseas. It amends a number of related acts: not just various social security acts but also taxation, health insurance and, of course, the Veterans' Entitlements Act.
The bill seeks to streamline the administration of international portability of these payments. Streamlining, simplification and clarification are always a worthy goal in any legislation and particularly in social security and veterans legislation. Of course, in doing that, one has always to ensure that people's entitlements are not unreasonably reduced as part of that streamlining process. That is the issue in relation to some aspects of this bill. Certainly, the Welfare Rights Centre have highlighted a number of areas where they have concerns. As the Democrat spokesperson in this area for a few years now, and a researcher into it before that, I certainly pay a lot of attention to the views of the Welfare Rights Centre in terms of social security and other legislation, because these are people who work with this act and with people affected by it, day in and day out. They often see the people who are crunched between some of the anomalies and who are let down by the legislation and fall through the cracks. They are probably the best in the country by a long way at identifying potential problems with amendments, as well as problems with existing arrangements.
They have certainly expressed concerns, through the Senate inquiry process and their submission, about the reduction of portability periods for disability support pensioners; about the extension of the period for which a person re-entering Australia can be eligible for further portability; and, in particular, about the removal of the unforeseen circumstances exception. They also have concerns about the imposition of proportionality portability after 26 weeks on age, wives' and widow B pensions, and also about the insertion and removal of specific visa types by ministerial determination. As the Democrat spokesperson also on immigration issues, I am aware of the enormous number of visa types and, indeed, the wide variety and ever-changing nature of those, and I can understand the difficulty in keeping the Social Security Act and related acts up to date all the time, with the various changes that are often being made by the immigration minister. Sometimes I wonder how much some of those changes from the immigration side of things are thought through in terms of their impact on the entitlements of people, but that is probably a separate issue and a separate debate that I will not go into at length now.
In a number of those areas that I have outlined, the concerns that have been expressed by others are concerns that the Democrats also share. I do think that there is justification for the provision in this bill for enabling specific visa types to be put into the bill by ministerial determination, but some of those other areas that reduce entitlements are of concern. Certainly, the Democrats will be listening closely to any further rationale that the government may put forward as to why they are desirable and necessary. The opposition, through Senator Schacht, have indicated that they will be circulating some amendments, obviously, before we get to the committee stage of this bill, and we will look at those closely as well.
It is worth noting that this legislation was listed for Thursday and we are now dealing with it on Tuesday—following on from the Sydney Harbour Trust Fund Bill, which was listed for Monday of next week and which we started dealing with yesterday. It does not necessarily make life easy in terms of ensuring that we have adequate time to consider things; nonetheless, I think we will be able to do that with this particular piece of legislation. Certainly, those issues that I have outlined are ones which we will be paying attention to.
Another amendment that I will be moving in the committee stage is one which has been circulated for a day or so and it relates to the treatment of the wartime disability pension under social security income testing arrangements, as against the veterans affairs arrangements. An anomaly has existed there that I am sure all speakers in this debate are aware of, and it has existed for some time. I will not speak on that at length now; I will wait until I move my amendment. Given that this is a bill dealing with veterans' entitlements and, indeed, a bill that aims to streamline administration, it is an ideal bill in which to try to remove the anomaly that treats some veterans unfairly. The Democrats will seek to have that positive change made through this particular piece of legislation. I will move an amendment in that regard and talk to it further during the committee stage of the debate. I will leave further comments on it until then.
Other than the particular aspects that I have mentioned as being of potential concern, the Democrats are supportive of the remainder of the bill. We do think that the enabling of ministerial determination to insert and remove visa types is something which is appropriate in the circumstances. As always with moving something to a mechanism of ministerial determination, it reduces the accountability of the parliament. There is no doubt that there is less automatic scrutiny of ministerial determinations of delegated legislation than there is of full legislation—despite the fine work of the regulations and ordinances committee, I might add. It does reduce the opportunity for scrutiny and also obviously reduces the ability of the parliament to amend determinations that they do not like. It is a less desirable mechanism but, in this case and with this particular issue, the Democrats do think it is one which is worth making that sacrifice over, for ease of administration; and so we will not be opposing that aspect of the bill.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MISCELLANEOUS MATTERS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,2000-06-20,"—I thank senators for their contribution to the debate. Firstly, I make it clear for the benefit of Senator Schacht, who has an interest in other veterans affairs legislation, that the advice I have just received from the Minister for Veterans' Affairs is that the budget legislation for veterans affairs is to be introduced next week into the House of Representatives.
—Very good!
—Thank you. I turn to the issues that are particularly important in this debate and that have attracted the most attention from the senators opposite. I just want to emphasise some points. The simplification of the portability provisions is going to benefit about 90,000 customers every year. The simplification will improve service delivery and benefit customers only if the new rules are consistent. As I said in a debate yesterday on social security legislation, simplicity is a vital element in people being able to know what their entitlements are, to access them and to have staff administer them efficiently and properly, according to their entitlement. The consistency of the new rules is a vital element of the simplification process. The proposed changes to the bill, which have been flagged by the Democrats and are apparently being considered by the opposition, undermine the purpose of simplification. I do not know how many more times I am going to have to stand up here in this place to talk about the need for simplification of what is a very complex system that we have tried hard to make simpler. The purpose of trying to increase simplification was acknowledged by the committee as a commendable purpose, and I see these proposed changes, in undermining the purpose, as a very backward step.
A longer short-term portability period for the disability support pension for the non-severely disabled wife and widow B pensions is unjustified because a small number of customers travel for periods longer than 26 weeks and the payment of ancillary benefits such as rent assistance and pharmaceutical allowance will help many tens of thousands of customers who travel, including migrants. As most honourable senators will know, it has been an issue on which we have been lobbied for many years. I am sure those who are able to travel will be very appreciative of the payment of ancillary benefits. In addition, the longer short-term portability period would be inconsistent with the residence based Australian welfare system, and it would be reasonable if the community questioned a policy that allows people on social security benefits to remain overseas for a prolonged period of time. 
The retention of the non-proportional period of 12 months is not justified because, under Australian social security agreements with the major migrant source countries, the portable rate for permanent absences starts immediately—this has not had any effect on the number of people wanting to settle in agreement countries—and absences longer than 26 weeks are considered long term and subject to a proportional rate. Further, availability of the ancillary payments for the first 26 weeks will assist many migrants while they are making up their mind as to whether they settle in their country of origin. In addition, the retention of the 12 months non-portability period for former residents and the reinstatement of the secretary's discretion is unjustified because the proposal is consistent with the residency principles of the Australian social security system, it requires a former resident to manifest a commitment to resume residence in Australia, it will prevent former residents returning to Australia only to obtain an indefinitely portable pension and return overseas and it will prevent abuse of the secretary's discretion power.
Let me also emphasise that all customers who are overseas on 20 September this year will be fully protected. All customers on allowances will be subject to the old rules until they return to Australia. All pensioners—wife and widow B, DSP and age—who are overseas at the time of implementation will be protected until they return to Australia for longer than 26 weeks. This means that many of those who are constantly commuting, such as some wife and widow B pensioners and some disability pensioners, will be able to preserve their old portability rules forever, provided they spend less than 26 weeks in Australia every time they return. The saving provision would therefore preserve the old 12-month portability period for all wife, widow and DSP pensioners currently overseas until they return to Australia for longer than 26 weeks. For example, if a widow B pensioner returns to Australia on 21 September and goes overseas again in February the following year, she will get another portability of 12 months. Also, the 26-week saving provision will preserve the old non-proportionalised period of 12 months and other portability benefits, including the right to use the spouse's working life residence in Australia for the calculation of the proportionalised rate for all pensioners on long-term portable benefits—DSP for the severely disabled, aged, wife and widow entitled persons—currently overseas until they return to Australia for longer than 26 weeks. For example, an aged or severely disabled DSP pensioner who is overseas on 20 September, returns to Australia on 21 September and goes overseas again in February the following year will get the non-proportionalised rate for the full 12 months, as per the old rules. In other words, the people who are overseas at 20 September will be fully protected. Although this was evidence that was given to the committee, it did not seem to feature at all in the minority report or be taken into account at all. In other words, this is going to apply to people going overseas in the future. I do not think grandfathering those who are currently using the system is an unreasonable way to introduce new rules.
It is a matter of some concern to me personally that, by agreement with the ALP, this bill was referred to a Senate committee with a report date of 5 June. That was so as to expedite the passage of the legislation before the end of June, as there is a compensation measure relating to the new tax system attached to this bill. Labor, not being ready to proceed, puts the passage of the bill in jeopardy.
—We were told it was going to be Thursday. It's come forward two days.
—You had a report back on 5 June, Senator.
—Why did you tell us Thursday?
—We have got changing priorities in legislation. There were other people who were—
—You're a disgrace! Why don't you get out of our way?
—It is all very well for you to—
—You said Thursday. You bring it on today; we agreed to come on today—
—I am very happy that you agreed to come on today, but I would have thought you have had enough time to know whether you are going to support amendments or produce amendments. You have had a committee system. The committee system was introduced to reduce the amount of time in the committee of the whole. You may not have been here long enough, Senator Schacht, or you may have forgotten the history of the committee system. It was to avoid long debate in the committee of the whole.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Maybe the minister does not appreciate that Senator Hill should have been here for the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust debate. But he has more important things to do than this parliament. Senator Newman ought to recognise that.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—What is your point of order? There is no point of order.
—I am simply making the point that the senators opposite could have been and should have been ready to proceed with this bill from the moment the Senate received the committee's report. You have had plenty of time to be ready, and you are still not. You are ready to come in here and take the part of the shadow minister. I am very appreciative of your coming, Senator Schacht. It was very nice to hear your views about a number of veterans matters.
—Senator Schacht, how many more times do I have to speak to you?
—We could have told you to stick it until Thursday.
—Senator Schacht!
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. It is nice to have silence. I am pointing out once again that this is not a brand-new bill which has suddenly been dropped into the lap of the opposition. It is a bill which has been around for a considerable amount of time and which has been before a Senate committee, and the committee has produced two reports on the matter. The opposition put down a minority report, and I would have thought that at that time they would prepare their amendments, ready for the debate whenever it was brought on. The noise and cackle from the other side of the chamber is just sound and fury. It produces nothing.
—It is your pathetic performance. Tell your Manager of Government Business to get his act together.
—Senator Bolkus, your party does not seem to think too much of your performance, so let us not have anything about mine.
—You are having an enforced retirement, as I understand it, Senator.
—Yes? Who told you that?
—Some of your friends.
—Look at the little smirk on her face. Isn't it pathetic?
—It is a pity that the opposition do not like it when I smile on them, but I am perfectly happy to scowl if that is what they prefer. Nevertheless, I have said all that I intend to say at this stage. I thank the other parties for being prepared to come in two days earlier than was originally down on the Notice Paper.
—I have said thank you for that. I am only sorry that you were not ready to bring in your amendments, fresh from the committee's minority report. I would have thought that was the efficient thing to do if you were an efficient opposition. Nevertheless, we wait with keen interest to see your amendments.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-06-20,"—I suppose my first question is: where is the minister?
—He is here.
—Madam Chairman, this is not a minister, as we know. This is Senator Campbell. Are you filling in for this debate, Senator?
—Your manager agreed to this arrangement.
—We do have a particular problem, one that I need to place on the record. We were advised that the minister could not be here for this debate. We are dealing with a very important and substantial piece of legislation, one which deals with the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust and the continuing care in the future of some pretty important land around Sydney Harbour. We are at the committee stage. We started the committee stage last night with the relevant minister, Senator Hill, in place. I think it shows the greatest disrespect to this issue, if not to the Senate, that Senator Hill has decided that there are more important things for him to be doing at this stage than to be here to handle this legislation.
This is an action which comes at the end of a series of actions which really are quite dismissive to those who have an interest in this legislation. This is a promise that was made by your Prime Minister; a promise that was followed up by pretty empty legislation in terms of meeting the commitments that the Prime Minister made. There was no meaningful consultative process, so we had a Senate committee do what the government should have done, and that was consult with all the interested parties to this debate. That process has come up with some 99 amendments from us and the Australian Democrats. This is not in recognition of the role that the opposition parties play in the Senate but in recognition of the work done by people in the community—people like Tom Uren, who is sitting up in the gallery at the moment and who has been working with community people around Sydney Harbour. We wanted them and their views to be taken seriously. The fact that the minister is not here is another sign that this government is not taking this issue seriously.
Last night, we went through the part of the debate which went to the objects clause and the purpose of the legislation. I think we had a pretty exhaustive discussion in respect of that. Though there are a number of issues that can be pursued and should be pursued with the minister, it seems we are not going to get the opportunity to do that during the course of the debate this evening. I would like to place on the record a request for the minister to look at the batches of amendments that are going to come up in this debate both this evening and tomorrow and to take them seriously. This government should have no concern about adopting amendments or developing amendments which, for instance, govern the conduct of the trust, issues of pecuniary interests, the establishment of community advisory committees, the tenure of trust members, the definition of the land and so on. Many of the amendments that we are putting up offer protection and good policy processes, and those are the sorts of amendments that the minister and the government should be flexible enough to pick up.
The other point I make to the minister is: your government have made some commitments, and this is an opportunity to meet them. It is too late in the day to come into the parliament and say, `While we said that the land, or part of it, would be transferred to the Sydney Harbour trust and, from there, to the New South Wales government, we have now come up with another option for the land, and we're not going to guarantee that the land will go as we promised it would go.' It is an opportunity for them—and they should seize it, once this bill is amended—to keep the faith with people in and around Sydney. We are not just talking about North Shore Sydney here; we are talking about a lot of people in New South Wales who have an eye to the significance of this land environmentally, historically and in terms of the interests, history and connection with the land of indigenous Australians.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-06-20,"—I take this opportunity to table a supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government amendments to be moved to the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust Bill 1999 [2000] and inform honourable senators that the memorandum was circulated in the chamber on 20 June 2000. I also want to respond briefly to Senator Bolkus's comments on the presence of the Minister for the Environment and Heritage in the chamber for this debate. Senator Bolkus would respect the fact that the minister has a close personal involvement in this bill. We did inform the Manager of Opposition Business that, if it were to be brought on in this timeslot, the minister would be very briefly delayed. I said that we would not bring it on if it caused an issue for the opposition—in other words, if they were not happy for it to be handled by me then we would find some other bill to do. Clearly, there has been a communication breakdown. But I said that I would be happy to handle the bill. Senator Hill is just briefly delayed and is expected to be here. We do regard this legislation as very important and, furthermore, we share Senator Bolkus's sense of the importance of Sydney Harbour and its environs not only for the people who live around Sydney Harbour but for other people as well. He and others would agree that, with the exception of the Swan River, it is probably one of the most important waterways on the globe.
—You haven't been to Hobart!
—I have been to Hobart—from Sydney, on the water, Senator Brown. It is an important bit of water for all Australians. I would encourage all Australians to visit Sydney at some stage in their life, because it is one of the most beautiful cities in the world and one of the great natural harbours of the world.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 1999 [2000]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-06-20,"—It should also be noted that the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust Bill 1999 [2000] was scheduled to come on straight after question time today. It was only because the Minister for the Environment and Heritage could not make it that we agreed for it to be deferred—at that stage, we thought until another day. Let us also put it in that sort of context, Senator Ian Campbell: that we are trying to accommodate your leader's other priorities. We are in the position we are in now because Senator Hill is out there trying to sort out cabinet problems he has with his colleagues.
—We are doing this because you guys don't want to do workplace relations, if you want the full truth, if you want to have a debate about managing government business in the Senate. We are doing this because you don't want to do workplace relations and you won't cognate.
—We have here a situation where we should proceed with the amendments. I seek leave to move opposition amendments Nos 15 and 16 on sheet 1778 together.
Leave granted.
—Also on behalf of Senator Bartlett, I move:
(15)	Clause 6, page 4 (lines 19 to 31), omit the clause, substitute:
6  Objects
The objects of the Trust are the following:
	(a)	to acquire, hold and preserve Trust land for the benefit and inspiration of present and future generations;
	(b)	to remediate, rehabilitate, conserve and interpret that land in accordance with appropriate conservation and management plans;
	(c)	to protect and conserve the environmental significance of Trust land, including its natural, heritage, historic, indigenous and cultural significance;
	(d)	to ensure public ownership and control of Trust land;
	(e)	to maximise public access to Trust land;
	(f)	to conserve and manage Trust land consistently with such land becoming a national park, and in accordance with New South Wales law;
	(g)	to transfer right, title and interest in all Trust lands to New South Wales within 10 years for no consideration for inclusion in Sydney Harbour National Park or retention in public ownership by New South Wales for the benefit of the people of Australia;
	(h)	to cooperate with the Commonwealth, New South Wales, local government bodies and community groups in furthering the above objects.
(16)	Clause 7, page 5 (lines 1 to 23), omit the clause, substitute:
7  Functions
The functions of the Trust are the following:
	(a)	to carry out the objects of the Trust;
	(b)	to develop and implement plans relevant to Trust land in accordance with the objects of this Act and with the Natural Heritage Charter, the Burra Charter and the Guidelines for the Protection of Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Places.
	(c)	to remediate, rehabilitate, conserve and manage Trust land consistent with such land becoming a national park;
	(d)	to remove buildings and structures on Trust land that are not of heritage value and that have been identified in an approved plan as not to be retained because of the natural significance of the Trust land;
	(e)	to undertake community consultation relevant to the conservation and management of Trust land;
	(f)	to apply such money as is appropriated by the Parliament, or otherwise received in accordance with this Act, in furtherance of the objects and functions of the Trust;
	(g)	to promote appreciation of Trust land and its environmental and heritage significance.
	(g)	to carry out functions incidental to or conducive to the performance of its other functions.
We detail here two pretty important amendments which go to both the objects, in amendment No. 15, and the functions, in amendment No. 16, of the trust. In terms of objects, we do what the government will not do with their legislation—that is, give some real structure to the operation of the trust. We give to it a medium- to long-term vision and assign to it, through these two particular amendments, medium- to long-term functions as well.
Amendments agreed to.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 1999 [2000]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-06-20,"—by leave—I move, also on behalf of Senator Bartlett, opposition amendments Nos 17 and 18 on sheet 1778:
(17)	Clause 8, page 5 (line 24) to page 6 (line 5), omit the clause, substitute:
8  Powers
	(1)	The Trust has power to do all things necessary to carry out the objects and perform the functions of the Trust.
	(2)	The Trust's powers include, but are not limited to, the following powers:
	(a)	manage Trust property in accordance with plans prepared under this Act;
	(b)	negotiate and enter into agreements with the Commonwealth, New South Wales, local government bodies and other bodies;
	(c)	acquire and hold real and personal property;
	(d)	enter into such short-term leases or licence agreements as are in accordance with the objects and functions of the Trust, for a period of no longer than 10 years from the commencement of this Act, inclusive of any options clauses;
	(e)	enter into agreements or contracts not involving an interest in land;
	(f)	form, or participate in the formation of, companies;
	(g)	accept gifts, grants, bequests and devises made to it;
	(h)	raise money, by borrowing or otherwise, but not on the security of Trust land.
	(3)	The Trust has no power to sell or transfer an interest in Trust land otherwise than to New South Wales in accordance with the objects, functions and powers of the Trust.
	(4)	The Trust has no power to enter into leases or licence agreements except in accordance with paragraph (2)(b) and once a plan is approved any such agreements must accord with that plan.
(18)	Clause 9, page 6 (lines 6 to 11), omit the clause, substitute:
9  Minister may give directions
	(1)	The Minister may give written directions to the Trust in accordance with the objects of the Trust and the provisions of this Act as follows:
	(a)	where the Trust fails to perform its duties in relation to the objects, functions and powers of the Trust; or
	(b)	where it is reasonable for the Minister to give such a direction.
	(2)	The Minister, in giving such directions, must have due regard to any New South Wales or local government laws that apply to any Trust land.
	(3)	The Minister must give reasons for any such direction, by public notice as soon as practicable after the direction is given.
	(4)	The Trust must comply with any direction of the Minister in a way that is consistent with its objects, functions and powers.
The government is trying to do something similar to what we are doing with these two amendments, but we do not find the government's amendments adequate. Amendment No. 17 assigns to the trust a range of powers to fulfil and perform the objects and functions that we have already assigned to the trust in the previous vote. Amendment No. 18 details—and, in fact, constrains—the manner in which the minister may be able to intervene in the operation of the trust. The government's proposal allows ministerial discretion to ride at will. We do not think that is appropriate. Through amendment No. 18, we provide a process whereby the minister gets involved only where the trust fails to meet the objects or functions.
As I say, if the minister were here at the moment, we would sequentially go through every part of these subclauses and ask him what in particular he has problems with and why he cannot adopt them. This is a question that I place on notice to the minister: what problems does he have with each of these particular subsections, are there any that he can adopt—any that he can accept or any that his cabinet colleagues will allow him to accept—and can he seriously look at them with a view to trying to get something workable out of this process after this legislation is amended?",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 1999 [2000]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-06-20,"—These amendments are quite a considerable improvement on the legislation. However, they leave open the potential for the minister to give directions that would not result in the outcome that the Greens believe there should be, and that is that all of these lands become part of the Sydney Harbour National Park. We have agreed to objects which allow the transfer of lands to New South Wales for retention in the public ownership and for the benefit of the people of Australia but not necessarily as national park. That leaves the option open to the New South Wales state government to accept lands over the next 10 years—and there will be a number of governments involved in this—and, while retaining the lands in public ownership, to look at alternatives to national park status. I am a little concerned that it says here in the amendment from the Democrats and the opposition that the minister, which in this situation would be Senator Hill—
—Senator Minchin.
—Senator Minchin or Senator Hill?
—Who rules the roost?
—Ultimately cabinet, of course, and that is what this amendment means—that the Prime Minister, the minister or whoever is giving directions to Senator Hill `may give written directions to the Trust in accordance with the objects of the Trust'. These objects include transferring land to New South Wales, where it may not necessarily become a national park—and I am looking here to governments other than the Carr government, although it is included in this—`where it is reasonable for the Minister to give such a direction'. The first section here states:
(a)	 where the Trust fails to perform its duties ...
The second section states:
... or
(b) where it is reasonable for the Minister to give such a direction.
I wonder why that subclause is there. Should the `or' not be `and'? Section (b) seems to me to either be redundant or weaken section (a), which says that the minister can intervene if the trust is failing to perform its duties and can make it do so.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 1999 [2000]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-06-20,"—That does raise a point that needs to be addressed. In addressing it, I point out to Senator Brown that the driving force for this particular subclause was the recognition that there may be instances in which the minister may need to give a direction. But in recognising that, there was also recognition that the minister can give such a direction in certain circumstances only. One of those circumstances is where the trust fails to perform its duties in relation to the objects, but section (b) is subject to the introductory part of that subclause. That introductory part states:
	The Minister may give written directions to the Trust in accordance with the objects of the Trust and the provisions of this Act ...
So in a sense the minister's directions have to be in accordance with that. There has to be due regard to any New South Wales or local gov-ernment law that applies to any trust. `Due regard' should in fact be taken to mean that those directions should not be in contraven-tion of those New South Wales government or local government laws that apply—other-wise, if they were to be in con-tra-ven-tion, you cannot say that an otherwise illegal direction should be seen to be legally valid. Finally, clause (3) also requires that those directions must also, by public notice, be publicised. So essentially you do have some constraints on the minister's power of intervention, the last of which is a need for the minister to publicly notify people as to the direction. That of course will ensure there is accountability as well in those circumstances where his direction is valid for the reason that it is within the objects of the trust.

[interpretation]

	(1A)	The Minister must not appoint a member of the Trust unless the Minister has first:
	(a)	sought expressions of interest from suitable persons by public advertisement; and
	(b)	considered any expressions of interest lodged in accordance with the advertisement.
[appointment of members]
(21)	Clauses 13 to 19, page 8 (line 9) to page 9 (line 18), omit the clauses, substitute:
13  Terms of office and conditions of appointment
	(1)	A member is appointed on a part-time basis, and holds office until the end of a period of 3 years after appointment, or until the repeal time, whichever occurs first.

	(3)	The Minister must not terminate the appointment of a member appointed on the recommendation of New South Wales without first consulting New South Wales.
These amendments go to aspects of the trust membership. In amendment (8) we talk about who a public employee may be—we need a definition of `public employee'. In amendment (10) we define what a `relevant local government body' is in terms of the requirements or disqualification provisions for trust membership. In amendment (11) we define the `state minister'. Amendment (12)—and this is probably the most critical part in terms of the sorts of prerequisites, the sorts of identities, we think would be suitable for the trust—defines a `suitable person'. A `suitable person' is defined, in respect of a member or nominated person, as a person with considerable experience or qualifications relevant to either the natural environment, conservation and heritage, indigenous culture, history or maritime services.
Amendment No. 20 ensures that the selection or appointment of a member of the trust is governed by a process which ensures public advertisement. The minister may not appoint a member of the trust unless the minister has first sought an expression of interest from suitable persons by public advertisement and has considered those expressions of interest. Amendment No. 21 goes to the terms of office and conditions of appointment. We think it is important for a body such as this—a body which may find itself from time to time in conflict with a government minister—to have some security of tenure. In amendment No. 21 to clause 13, we provide for a three-year term of appointment, we provide for reappointment and we also introduce the concept of conflict of interest.
Amendment No. 22 is a technical amendment. Amendment No. 23 ensures that a member must disclose a pecuniary interest. Amendment No. 24 provides for a process for resignation. We also need to have some security in terms of the members appointed on the recommendation of the New South Wales government, and amendment No. 25 ensures that the minister must not terminate the appointment of a trust member who has been appointed on the recommendation of the New South Wales government without first consulting New South Wales.
As I said, these are important amendments in that they do provide a structure, they provide security and they provide some sense of independence of the trust from government. We think these are amendments that quite simply could be adopted by the government, but we just cannot understand the level of intransigence that has been brought to this debate, with the government not even prepared to pick up amendments such as these.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 1999 [2000]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-06-20,"—These amendments make a great improvement to the make-up of this very important trust which is going to oversee the transition of these former Defence lands to a part of the great Sydney Harbour National Park. I will support them. Senator Bolkus knows that I always have some concerns about the lack of definition of `environmental qualifications' in the appointment of people to trust boards and so on. During the Franklin River campaign in Tasmania, the Chief Commissioner of the Hydro Electric Commission was an environmentalist; you will not find a logging authority around the country which does not have as its head somebody who claims to be an environmentalist with long environmental experience; and you will not find anybody in industry who does not claim that they themselves are environmentalists, no matter what they are doing to the environment and what extractive activities they are in. So when it comes to a definition here saying that a suitable person— 
—Bob, you're an environmentalist, I hope.
—I would claim to be. I am no different in that sense, but I do not have an environmental qualification. Mr Temporary Chair, the interjection from the government was that I claim to be an environmentalist, and I am agreeing with the government, as I find myself doing from time to time. This definition of a suitable person to be on the trust states that they must be:
... a person with considerable experience or qualifications relevant to one or more of the following:
	(a)	 the natural environment;
	(b) conservation and heritage;
	(c)	 indigenous culture;
	(d) history;
	(e) maritime services.
I would have preferred to have seen a much clearer definition than having `considerable experience'. I can name any number of environmental defaulters who would claim to have experience in the environment. In such matters as indigenous culture, for example, I would like to see an indigenous person specifically appointed to represent the indigenous people of the Sydney region. But, as I said, this is a very great improvement on the appointment by direction of the minister that was in the original government legislation, and I therefore support it.
Amendments agreed to.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-06-20,"—by leave—I move, also on behalf of Senator Bartlett, opposition amendments Nos 27 and 29:
(27)	Clause 22, page 11 (lines 9 to 13), omit the clause, substitute:
22  Vesting of Trust land
	(1)	From the beginning of the day on which this Act commences, all right, title and interest that the Commonwealth holds in the land specified in Schedule 1 vests in the Trust without any conveyance, transfer or assignment.
	(2)	The regulations may prescribe any additional Sydney Harbour land that is a Commonwealth place as land to be vested in the Trust.
	(3)	The Minister must, by notice published in the Gazette, specify:
	(a)	that land prescribed by regulations under subsection(2) is to vest in the Trust; and
	(b)	the day from which the land is to vest.
	(4)	From the beginning of the day specified in the notice, all right, title and interest that the Commonwealth holds in the land vests in the Trust without any conveyance, transfer or assignment.
(29)	Clause 24, page 12 (lines 1 to 6), omit the clause, substitute:
24  Transfer of Trust land
	(1)	The Trust holds the land for and on behalf of the Commonwealth.
	(2)	Subject to subsection(3), the Trust must transfer an interest in any Trust land to New South Wales on completion of remediation and rehabilitation in accordance with an approved plan.
	(3)	The Trust may transfer an interest in any Trust land to New South Wales before the completion of remediation and rehabilitation, with the consent of New South Wales.
	(4)	The Trust must transfer the freehold or other interest of all Trust land to New South Wales before the tenth anniversary of the day on which this Act commences.
Amendment No. 27 vests the land in the trust. It will provide that, from the commencement of this legislation, all right, title and interest that the Commonwealth holds in the land specified in the schedule—and unlike the government, we attempt to specify the land—vests in the trust. We provide that the regulations may prescribe that any additional Sydney Harbour land is a Commonwealth place as land to be vested in the trust. We provide for publication in the Gazette of the land prescribed by regulations. We also provide that, from the enactment of the legislation, in essence the trust can basically handle and take care of the land in accordance with its objects and functions.
As it now stands, there is no requirement on the Commonwealth to vest any land in any particular time frame. There is nothing to force it, and there is nothing to stop the Commonwealth not vesting the land at all. This goes back to that commitment that the Prime Minister made in 1998, where he made it clear, for instance, that some land on the harbour would be transferred. He said that the trust:
... will have 10 years to complete the task and after that time the Commonwealth will transfer North Head, Middle Head and Georges Heights for inclusion in the Sydney Harbour National Park.
He provides that the trust will have a certain period to take care of and remediate the land. But this legislation does not fulfil the Prime Minister's promise. This legislation breaches the faith that the Prime Minister tried to establish between himself and those to whom he was talking, the stakeholders and the broader community of Sydney and New South Wales. What we are tying to do here is vest the land. What clause 29 is doing is ensuring that, for instance, the trust holds the land for and on behalf of the Commonwealth. But we provide a mechanism whereby the trust must transfer an interest in any trust land to New South Wales on completion of remediation and rehabilitation, in accordance with an approved plan.
There is no reason to keep the land in Commonwealth ownership longer than is required for the remediation and rehabilitation. That should be reflected in legislation, and that is what amendment No. 29 seeks to do. We do provide that the trust may transfer an interest in any trust land to New South Wales before the completion, with the consent of New South Wales. We also provide that the trust must transfer the freehold or other interests of all trust land to New South Wales before the tenth anniversary of the day on which this act commences. Basically, we provide a mechanism through which the Prime Minister's promise and commitment that he gave before the election in 1998 can be met, and that is through amendment No. 29, clause 24, subclause (iv). Ultimately, by the tenth anniversary the land must be transferred.
You have to ask yourselves why the government is not prepared to do this. Why isn't the government prepared to meet the commitment made by the Prime Minister? Why is this one of those non-core promises? No matter how often you ask that question, no matter how often people involved in New South Wales—people like Tom Uren, who is still here in the gallery listening to the debate—ask that question of government and of government representatives, we still cannot get an answer. We think that is not good enough. We think the parliament should provide for a transfer of land in accordance with the commitment, but we also think that there is no reason to keep the land in Commonwealth ownership after it has been rehabilitated.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—I would like to acknowledge the Hon. Tom Uren, who is in the gallery this evening.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY HARBOUR FEDERATION TRUST BILL 1999 [2000]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-06-20,"—I support this amendment. It is crucial, as Senator Bolkus says, and it is really fundamental. If this legislation gets through as other amendments would reshape it, it will lead to a piece of legislation which really does give the green light to a fantastic amenity for Sydney, for New South Wales, for Australia, for the world. This is the right way to go. It takes the worry out of this legislation to a big degree and converts it into exciting legislation indeed. The opposition and the Democrats are to be congratulated for that. I wholeheartedly support these particular amendments which, as Senator Bolkus has said, are the heart of the restructuring of this legislation to make it very special indeed.

These amendments all go to the preparation of management plans by the trust. During Senator Brown's last contribution, I could not help thinking that not only are we seeing legislation being processed in this place but also we are witnessing the makings of a lost opportunity, a real lost opportunity, for this country. We are talking about land that, over the next few months with the Sydney Olympics, will be seen by millions and millions of people. We are talking about land that is important in terms of its historical significance, in terms of the making and the developing of this nation. We are talking about land that has history before the arrival of white settlers. We are talking about land that has ongoing value both heritage and environmental wise. Also, we are talking about an opportunity for this nation to be proud of what it is doing with this land and to present what it is doing to the rest of the world as a showcase of environmental, heritage and indigenous concern.
But, instead of that, we have a government that is not prepared to look at even the most minute detail that, in its coming together with others, may present some vision for the future for Sydney and for the land we are talking about here. We could be presenting ourselves to the world as a nation that does know how to take care of some of its most important and valuable assets. But because of shortsightedness, because of pig-headedness, because of whatever it might be, we have a government that is incapable of designing legislation to protect this monument of Australian history.
We find that again with these clauses that I am moving now. Through these clauses, we provide for the trust to develop plans for the land as identified, for the preparation of those plans to be with public scrutiny, for plans to be developed in the broader context of the significance of the trust lands. We are talking about implanting in the legislation more comprehensive requirements to ensure good planning. We are talking about public participation, access to the public to be involved in this. We are talking about, in essence, ensuring that a process be put in place to provide for good management in terms of remediation, rehabilitation and establishment for the future. It is a real pity that this government cannot see the value of amendments such as this. It is a pity that this government cannot see the value of doing this properly.
Amendments agreed to.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-06-20,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I rise to speak on the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report Access to electronic commerce and new service information technologies for older Australians and people with a disability. I think it is important to start by noting that access to information of government services without discrimination on grounds such as age and disability is a human right. This is the context of the report and of responses to the report. The report tells us something we already know: digital technology offers people with a disability and the elderly access to information and services that have previously been unavailable due to inappropriate formats or inaccessible locations. For example, the availability of information of goods and services over the Internet offers improved access to people who cannot turn pages, who cannot see or read print, who cannot hear, who cannot read English. Given the significance of these benefits, it is of concern that ABS data cited by the commission highlights a digital divide with substantially lower access to the Internet and technologies such as EFTPOS and phone banking for people over 55 than for younger people. Focus groups, as part of this research, also found that accessibility of equipment and information formats across most electronic commerce technologies and affordability and equipment access barriers were problems for people with a disability. 
Labor is concerned that people with a disability and older Australians are unable to access key services at a time when the government shift to automated services, including interactive voice response systems and telephone bill payment, continue apace. This is not to say that the increasing use of Internet services by agencies such as Centrelink is not an important and positive development. Rather, we are concerned that key client groups, such as recipients of the disability support pension or the age pension, are not receiving appropriate levels of service. Labor thus supports the commission's call to ensure as far as possible that `online and automated services are used to complement and enhance availability of direct human services rather than completely substituting for it'. 
The commission found much to criticise in terms of the accessibility of the Commonwealth government's own web sites. It was pleasing to learn that cabinet had recently taken a decision to evaluate web site accessibility by June 2000 and achieve W3C standards compliance by December 2000. However, a decision is one thing; evidence and implementation is another. If the government is to consider implementing the commission's thorough and thoughtful recommendations, it will require a major change in attitude. It will require a real commitment to the development, ratification and implementation of disability standards to ensure equal access to existing and future technologies. The government's record on disability standards does not make me hopeful of forward movement, embracing universal design and developing accessibility benchmarks. 
 For example, cabinet is yet to ratify the accessible public transport standards under the Disability Discrimination Act, which were signed off by the states and the Australian Transport Council more than 12 months ago. The minister did not release the interim report of the Welfare Review Committee in formats accessible to people with disabilities. This was in contravention of the department's inclusive consultation guidelines and was of particular concern, given the report's focus on participation requirements for disability support pensioners. Appropriate formats only became available after the National Council on Intellectual Disability instigated legal action against the minister, the department and the committee under the Disability Discrimination Act.
To achieve international best practice on technology accessibility will require leadership from the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth must first get its own house in order before moving to ensure that state and local government, industry and community organisations address access issues. The commission has set out a way forward that will require specification of clear accessibility benchmarks, not presently provided in government policy, and recognition of these standards in the Disability Discrimination Act. If the Commonwealth fails to follow this path, it will remain the case that everyday technology, such as ATMs, will be inaccessible to people with physical disabilities or vision impairment simply because the keypad, the card and money slots are positioned too high, the screens lack contrast and there are no tactile indicators on the keys. We have learnt today that this is the state of play in Australia. We must now move swiftly to ensure that all Australians can participate in, and benefit from, technological developments.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission</title>,Documents,20,1
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2000-06-20,"—I want to add some points to what Senator Evans said. On page 9 of this report, some figures set out the position of those who use the Internet in Australia: 73 per cent of those aged from 18-to 24 years-old use it, 56 per cent of those from 25-to 39 years-old use it, 44 per cent of those from 40 to 54 years-old use it and 16 per cent of those aged 55 and over use it. The Internet and other electronic equipment are growing apace, and we in the more mature part of the community ought to keep up with it. As Senator Evans said, we should be able to keep up with it, but we should get help in doing that—help in the sense of accommodating the electronic equipment to suit those who are disabled and those who are aged. Those who are disabled are not necessarily aged and those who are aged—or most of us—are not disabled, or in any event do not have disabilities that stop us living a full and exciting life.
There should be things in place to give us confidence to use electronic equipment, such as the Internet and computers, and the way forward should be cleared. Yesterday at Melbourne airport, I met an old friend of mine, Tom Hogg, who said that he, in the old days—two or three years ago—did what I now do, that is, write out my reports in longhand and get someone else to key them in and put them on the Internet. He said, `No, no, no.' He has now gone into consulting, and he said that, in consulting, you have to be able to use a computer, and he is now able to do that. He said that time and attention to the detail has enabled him to do that. He got the right equipment but, even more important than that, he devoted himself to the task of learning.
—What is your word speed?
—I have not got a word speed—that is exactly it. I have to get a word speed. I can with some help type with two fingers: one finger from the left hand and one finger from the right hand. But I intend to go ahead and try to achieve what Tom Hogg has done. My wife, similar to me, is now in her sixties and is able to achieve this. She has more ability and probably more intelligence—
 (Senator Lightfoot)—Is this relevant to the motion, Senator Cooney?
—I am talking to the motion. I am talking about that which has not hit you yet. When you get a bit older, Mr Acting Deputy President, you will probably understand what I am talking about. But no doubt, by then, you will be able to cope with all these things. When I was in Culgoa in the Mallee many years ago, I remember when electricity was brought in, then the radio came in and then more cars came into the area. So there have been big changes in my lifetime.
—And then the new tax system came in.
—You talk about the new tax system, but one of the things about the new tax system is that it should be of a nature that can be understood by people who have disabilities and who are aged. Unfortunately, I do not think it has yet got to that stage.
I stand up now to speak on behalf of people who are getting older and those who have disabilities. I commend the commissioning of this report, and I commend the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission for producing this and for bringing forward an issue that is going to become more important as the population gets older and more of us live for longer than ever before. People with disabilities need to be able to use this equipment, and it should be, as Senator Evans said, equipment that is made in such a way that people like me and people with disabilities can use it.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission</title>,Documents,20,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-06-20,"—I would like to briefly add to the comments made, particularly those made by Senator Cooney. This government is very committed to increasing access to the Internet, and creating and improving access to electronic commerce, particularly for older Australians and people with disabilities. One of the great things that Senator Cooney will find is that, if he buys his computer after 1 July, the 22 per cent tax imposed by the Labor government on computers, modems and any other bits of hardware that he needs to get to access the Internet will be abolished. As a result of the commitment of this government and the decisions of this Senate, that iniquitous tax on people trying to get involved in the information economy will be abolished and a GST of 10 per cent will be imposed, which will reduce the cost of computer equipment and all you need to get onto the Internet by somewhere between eight and 15 per cent at the retail level. It is a huge win for people who want to get into the information economy and who want to take advantage of the very things that Senator Cooney was saying. I am glad that he will personally benefit from the savings delivered to people who buy computers and other bits of equipment after 1 July.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2000-06-20,"—I want to talk a little bit tonight about reconciliation. With the spotlight focused so firmly on reconciliation with indigenous Australians, it is, I believe, incumbent on each of us to search our hearts and our consciences and to ask: what does reconciliation mean to me? I accept that reconciliation means different things to different people. For some it means accepting collective responsibility for past wrongs, expressing that regret and making reparation in a treaty. For others it means addressing the profound disadvantages of today's Aboriginal people in practical ways so that we can move forward together and build a nation as one Australia.
The local community at Moree in the federal electorate of Gwydir in north-west New South Wales has already taken some significant steps towards achieving its own version of reconciliation. Known in the past for racial tensions, Moree has now staked a claim as a rural township leading the way in reconciliation. In something of a bold social experiment, the Moree community is actively engaged in grassroots reconciliation. I had the opportunity to visit the town of Moree just last weekend, which allowed me to examine some reconciliation measures at first hand. The spotlight has certainly been on Moree of late, with a delegation of federal cabinet ministers, led by the Prime Minister, visiting a few days before the weekend. The Prime Minister was in town to attend the Croc Eisteddfod Festival, which has a strong reconciliation and indigenous theme modelled on the successful Rock Eisteddfod. It encourages high school children to explore their creative sides in a drug and alcohol free environment. According to Gwydir Valley Cotton Growers Association Chairman, Dick Estens, the Prime Minister's visit gave Moree the incentive to drive the reconciliation cause further.
Perhaps the most visible and successful manifestation of practical reconciliation in Moree is the initiative of the Gwydir Valley Cotton Growers Association—the Aboriginal Employment Strategy. This is a truly inspiring initiative in which local Aboriginal people have been able to tap into the commercial prosperity of the community. Indeed, that has been considerable. The success of the cotton industry and that of local growers is very impressive in itself. Australia is in fact the word's third largest cotton producer, with the Gwydir region being one of the country's major production areas. The success of the cotton industry is the same success that started the Aboriginal Employment Strategy that has employed 270 local Aboriginal people in the past two years in full-time and part-time jobs in cotton, in related farm sector services and in retail. The coalition government has committed over $600,000 towards this project as part of the Community Development Employment Project aimed at improving social cohesion and building self-esteem and skills among indigenous communities.
In May last year the coalition announced its indigenous employment policy: a new $52 million indigenous employment program, effectively doubling existing funding, and an indigenous small business fund, providing $11 million over three years. Altogether $115 million per year will go to improving employment outcomes for indigenous Australians. The emphasis will be on private sector opportunities and support for indigenous small business. Major features of the program include a strategy to encourage CEOs to recruit and train indigenous staff, private sector structured training and a national cadetship program for cadets in the private sector. This scheme, along with its practical implementation in Moree, demonstrates the commitment of local business, industry and the community to turn around the divisions of the past.
I also had the opportunity to visit Forward Personnel, an employment placement and support agency for indigenous and non-indigenous people with disabilities. This is another program where the mutual commitment of community leaders and business makes it such a success. I met with some of the clients, two of whom rode into Moree on their horses. Indeed, they were placed in employment because they were capable of riding. They had horses, they had not been able to get jobs and they were given jobs on stock routes. 
On visiting Moree last weekend the contrast between that forward looking community today and the Moree of the past could not be more pronounced. As recently as the 1960s a virtual apartheid existed, with Aboriginal people barred from certain areas in the town. Now there is a real commitment to breaking down even subtle barriers to Aboriginal advancement, with employment and educational opportunities becoming the tools for bridging the racial divide. Warren Barnes, Aboriginal Employment Strategy manager, has been quoted as saying:
Apologies and treaties are important steps in the reconciliation process, but what often goes unnoticed are the achievements that go beyond words to real outcomes for aboriginal families. Three years ago, Moree was demanding that the Government fix its problems and calling for more punishment for the crimes, but we've shown the town can fix its own problems.
One of the most proactive agencies for reconciliation is the Moree Plains Shire Council, whose general manager, Vince Paparo, insists that reconciliation is a mainstream issue for the community. At the heart of the council's approach is the recognition that Moree could not and cannot achieve its full economic potential without reconciliation. The council is currently developing a proposal to establish a working facility for practical reconciliation to highlight the importance and dignity of employment as well as the symbolic and spiritual significance of the indigenous population's cultural heritage and shared history.
The initiative has the potential to become a centre of national significance, to provide a practical program, projects and training to assist other communities in Australia faced with the need to address Aboriginal unemployment and achieve reconciliation. The aim of the proposal is to build on and expand the grassroots initiatives of community groups in Moree in a unique centre of excellence in business opportunity and enterprise, research and education as well as history and culture. These are worthy objectives that have my full support.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank Councillor Tony Dennison for his facilitation of my visit to Moree and my wonderful hosts Neil and Ann and David and Danielle Statham of Keytah for their hospitality. It was also my great pleasure to meet with many locals who contribute so greatly to the ongoing process of reconciliation. No-one would suggest that all of Moree's difficulties have been solved, but brave and important first steps are being taken, and I believe that they need recognition. It is essential that the momentum build and continue. Moree has much to look forward to as the effects of practical reconciliation heal the divisions of the past.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders: Reconciliation</title>,Adjournment,21,1
