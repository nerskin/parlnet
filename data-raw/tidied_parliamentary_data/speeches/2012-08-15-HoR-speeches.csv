"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2012-08-15,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (13:30):  I move Greens amendment (1):


(1)   Schedule 1, item 25, page 10 (after line 8), after section 198AD, insert:


198ADA  12 month limit on transfer to offshore processing country


(1)   The Minister must ensure that a person who is transferred to an offshore processing country under section 198AD is transferred to Australia no later than 12 months after the day on which the person arrived in the offshore processing country.


(2)   Subsection (1) does not apply in relation to a person who is not in the offshore processing country 12 months after the day on which the person arrived in the country.


(3)   Section 198AD does not apply in relation to a person who is transferred to Australia under subsection (1).


The amendment that I have moved would limit the amount of time that someone is able to be held in detention on an island prison, subject to this act, for a period of 12 months. We are in the extraordinary situation where we are being asked to approve legislation that will allow someone who makes their way to Australia by boat to be taken to another country and to be put in what is effectively a prison for an indefinite and unspecified period.


This parliament and this House should not be asked to approve a piece of legislation before we know for how long a refugee is able to be detained under any of the arrangements struck under this new law. We have heard it said that the period for which someone will be detained may be or is intended to be equivalent to the length of time that it would otherwise have taken for their claim to be processed. We have heard the member for Cook, the shadow minister for immigration, say that that could be 10 years. We have heard other people say that, in some instances, because there is no queue in some of these places it could be a lifetime.


Given that we do not know the length of time, this House should take a very strong stand against the indefinite detention of vulnerable refugees. The amendment I have moved will limit the amount of time that someone can spend in detention to 12 months. I would prefer that mandatory detention did not exist; I would prefer that we had a much speedier process for processing people's asylum claims. But I would hope that 12 months represents a reasonable time that all members of this House could agree to as being an acceptable limit. One reason why 12 months is picked is that we know from the mental health experts that, after that time, there is an extraordinarily high risk that people who have been in detention will self-harm or commit suicide. So if we are concerned, as we have been told we are repeatedly over the last few days, about saving lives of refugees then we should save their lives when they are in detention centres as well. We should put a limit of 12 months detention into the legislation. That is not perfect, but it is a compromise that I hope will be acceptable.


I might also take this opportunity in the consideration in detail stage to ask the minister when he will put before the House the documentation required in this legislation regarding the designation of Nauru and Manus Islands and to explain what arrangements have been reached with Nauru about the number of refugees who will be detained there, and the length of time and the conditions under which they will be detained. I also ask the minister for an indication as to when the other elements of the expert panel's proposal will in fact be implemented. It may not be clear to members of the community, but the proposed safeguards that are spoken about in the Houston report do not form part of this legislation; they form part of an instrument that is meant to be tabled before this parliament. We are told that work will commence as early as this Friday and we are told that people will be moved to these camps, potentially in tents and other temporary structures, as a matter of urgency. Given that that will happen immediately, the parliament is entitled to know before passage of this legislation what the conditions are of the agreements that have been reached and when we will see the disallowable instrument.

Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (13:41):  On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economics, I present the committee's report, incorporating a dissenting report, on the exposure draft of the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission bills 2012, together with the minutes of proceedings.


In accordance with standing order 39(f), the report was made a parliamentary paper.




Ms OWENS:
  by leave—The bills will establish an independent national regulator for the charities and not-for-profit sector. The not-for-profit sector plays a major role in Australian society. It comprises 600,000 entities that provide services in education, sports, welfare, arts, religion, culture and community wellbeing. The sector plays a major role in the Australian dollar economy. Even excluding where the sector charges a fee for service, it comprises $40 billion annually. Adding revenues for fee for service brings the sector up to $100 billion annually. It contributes five per cent of Australia's GDP and eight per cent of employment.


The Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission will become a one-stop shop. Charities and not-for-profits will provide streamlined information to the commission, which will determine their charitable status and pass on officially required data to other Commonwealth agencies, including the tax office. It will implement flexible, proportional regulation in accordance with an entity's size and through graduated enforcement powers, such as warnings and enforceable undertakings.


These bills have been a long time coming. The current regulatory framework for the sector is fragmented, inconsistent and uncoordinated across a range of government agencies. It meets neither the sector's needs nor those of the wider community. A national regulator for the sector was first proposed in 2001 and has been a consistent theme in reviews of the sector since then. Charities and not-for-profits have been subject to an inefficient regulatory framework spread across many agencies and more than one level of government. The bills offer a way to remedy this. The sector itself supports the change. Bodies in the sector must prove their bona fides each time they deal with government and they anticipate the day when this information is located in one easily accessible place.


Broadly, the committee covered three major policy areas in the inquiry. The first is the capacity of the commission to reduce red tape. Some in the sector were concerned about reporting and governance standards and how the commission's requirements would interact with those of other state and federal bodies. Given the red tape burden that the sector currently faces, it is understandable that there is some scepticism along with the hope. However, work has really begun. The Commonwealth is seeking to turn off any duplication such as reports to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission or other Commonwealth agencies. It is also discussing whether states and territories might wish to do the same with their associations legislation to the extent that these organisations are covered by the bills. This is a long-term project but the committee is confident that there will be immediate benefits and substantial improve­ment over time.


The committee has made a number of recommendations in response to sector concerns. Firstly, we have recommended that the objects of the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Bill 2012 explicitly include the reduction of red tape. Secondly, we have sought to increase flexibility for the commission and the sector as they negotiate their way through the process of rationalising reporting and reducing red tape, and we have recom­mended allowing the commission to accept reports and materials from other agencies for a limited time. We have also recommended providing additional flexibility by allowing for selected existing and sector developed governance standards to be incorporated into the bill by regulation. In the area of liability of directors, trustees and management committees, we have recommended redrafting of the provisions for clarity. We have also made changes relating to procedural fairness and recommended a review after a five-year period. I commend the report to the House.

Mr SIMPKINS
 (Cowan) (13:46):  I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Centre for Cerebral Palsy WA for all the work they do for the 1,700 people living in WA with cerebral palsy and their families. They do great work in highlighting and supporting the needs of those with cerebral palsy and their families. Cerebral Palsy Awareness Week was held from 30 July to 5 August this year. It celebrated the achievements in this area and also highlighted the requirement to maintain support for those with cerebral palsy.


I received the honour of a Community Excellence Award for my support of the Cerebral Palsy Centre. I was nominated by Jen Prior, whose daughter Emily was a telethon child in WA. Emily has cerebral palsy but she is irrepressible. I am also involved with the Tasseff family in Madeley—Steve, Geraldine and Tayla. I believe Tayla last year visited the parliament with her primary school, Madeley Primary School. I would again like to thank the Centre for Cerebral Palsy for the great work they do for those with cerebral palsy in WA and also Jen Prior for nominating me for the award that I received.

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:00):  I rise to remark in this House on the return of our athletes this morning from the London Olympic Games. This morning, the Leader of the Opposition and I, together with our Minister for Sport and the shadow minister for sport, had the very great privilege and opportunity to be there, when the Qantas flight came in, to welcome our athletes home. Our athletes descended the stairs to see a crowd of well-wishers and family members ranging from grandmothers—some older Australians were there to cheer them on—to young babies, godchildren and family members. All joined there with a sense of joy and anticipation wanting to commend their family member for their efforts in London. Here in this House today we can join our voices with the voices of those family members and friends and say to each athlete who has returned home today: we are proud of you and what you have achieved.


Australia can be very proud to be a nation that came 10th out of 204 nations in the medal tally; we can be proud of some of the remarkable individual performances that we have seen; but we should also express a sense of pride in the achievement of every athlete. Going to the Olympic Games to represent your nation is the result of remarkable hard work, discipline and perseverance. Our athletes—each and every one of them—are to be congratulated.


Inevitably, after the Olympics there will be a time of reflection about how we have achieved at the Olympics and what lessons are to be learned. But today is not the day for that. Today is the day to say 'Well done!' to each athlete and to thank them for their efforts and to say 'Thank you very much' to each and every one of the family members and friends who have supported the athletes on their journey as well as to all of the people in school sports and community sports who first said to one of those athletes, 'You are a person of talent,' for their contribution to our nation's achievement.


Given the comparative youth of our team, what I think we can certainly look forward to is that we will see a number of those who have achieved at the London Olympics go on to Rio tough, fit and hungry for more achievement. We are seeing out of this games that some of our athletes have announced that they have been to their last games, and we thank them for their contribution too.


If anybody is feeling any sense of withdrawal from being able to stay up very late at night and cheer our Australians on, we are looking forward to the start of the Paralympics, where we will get the opportunity to do it all again.

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (14:03):  I rise to support the remarks of the Prime Minister and to say with her that it was a tremendous honour to be able to welcome back our champion Olympic athletes. It was also great honour to be with the parents and families of our Olympians, because every champion athlete invariably has a champion parent who was the unpaid taxi driver and unofficial cheerleader for years and years while that athlete prepared for his or her moment of glory.


Yes, there will be time enough in the future to reflect on how we went and whether we could possibly go better, but I just want to make one point: no-one is tougher on an athlete's performance than the athlete himself or herself, and I am sure that the deepest and most perceptive post-mortems of this Olympics will be done by the athletes and by the various athletic organisations, because the one thing they want to do is give of their best. I am sure that they did, each of them individually and collectively, give of their best at London.


As the Prime Minister has said, were now prepare for the Paralympics. We will be cheering our Paralympians with the same enthusiasm with which we cheered for our Olympians, and we want to assure all of our Olympians that we will be right behind them as they prepare for Rio.

That this House:


(1) notes that:


(a) the inaugural international parliamentary conference on 'Parliaments, minorities and Indigenous peoples: effective participation in politics' was held in Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas, Mexico from 31 October to 3 November 2010;


(b) the conference was organised jointly by the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), the Mexican Congress of the Union and Government of the State of Chiapas, in partnership with the United Nations Development Program, the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the United Nations Independent Expert on minority issues and the Minority Rights Group International;


(c) the conference heard that many situations around the world demonstrate that an adequate representation of minorities and Indigenous peoples in policy and decision-making is instrumental in breaking the cycle of discrimination and exclusion suffered by members of these groups, and their ensuing disproportionate levels of poverty and related impediments to the full enjoyment of many civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights, and yet, minorities and Indigenous peoples often remain excluded from effective participation in decision-making, including at the level of the national parliament;


(d) the conference adopted the Chiapas Declaration, which urges every parliament, within the next two years, to inter alia, hold a special debate on the situation of minorities and Indigenous peoples in their country, recognise the diversity in society, and adopt a 'plan of action' to make the right to equal participation and non-discrimination a reality; 


(e) the Chiapas Declaration recommended that at a minimum the following elements are contained in the 'plans of action':


   (i) ensure that the right to free, prior and informed consent is observed in every step leading to the adoption of legislative and administrative measures affecting minorities and Indigenous peoples, and hold government to account for the implementation of such measures;


   (ii) require of government that all submissions to parliament of draft legislation and the national budget include an assessment of their impact on minorities and Indigenous peoples;


   (iii) make regular use of plenary sessions in parliament and other parliamentary fora to discuss minority/Indigenous matters in order to raise awareness and combat prejudice in society, organise awareness-raising sessions for all parliamentarians so as to increase their knowledge of minorities and Indigenous peoples and the particular problems they face, and ensure that minority and Indigenous issues are mainstreamed into parliamentary work, especially at the committee level;


   (iv) allocate sufficient resources to the task of establishing dialogue between minority/Indigenous peoples and public institutions and to parliamentary committees to allow them to carry out effective outreach activities such as public hearings with minority and Indigenous peoples; and


   (v) increase parliaments' familiarity with work being done within the United Nations system so as to equip them better to hold governments to account for their international commitments, including the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, urge ratification of International Labour Organisation Convention 169 on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples, hold debates in parliament on the conclusions and recommendations made by the United Nations human rights treaty bodies and special mechanisms with regard to minority and Indigenous peoples' rights;


(f) the Chiapas Declaration also affirmed the responsibility of political parties to promote the effective participation of minorities and Indigenous peoples, and address their concerns in their party programs; and


(g) the IPU will facilitate networking among parliaments on this issue, monitor the implementation of the Chiapas Declaration and convene a follow-up meeting within two years to discuss progress and set targets for future action;


(2) urges the Government, parliamentarians, and political parties to familiarise themselves with the Chiapas Declaration; and


(3) calls upon the Government to facilitate a roundtable discussion with representatives of Australian Indigenous communities on issues arising from the Chiapas Declaration. (Notice given 19 June 2012.)

   Mr Gibbons: To move:


That this House:


(1) acknowledges that a vibrant, independent news media is an essential component of a healthy democracy; and


(2) considers that:


(a) the democratically essential concept of an independent news media not does equate to the unrestricted right of specific media owners, or the industry in general, to manage their businesses without a social licence to operate;


(b) recent developments in Australia, and in other democratic countries, including inappropriate relations between media owners and politicians, socially unacceptable methods of news gathering, socially unacceptable standards of factuality and veracity in news reporting, a failure to distinguish between factual news reporting and editorial opinion, falling circulations, declining sales revenues and failed business models, are all evidence, prima facie, of an industry that has lost its social licence to operate;


(c) market competition can be a valuable mechanism for maintaining general, socially acceptable standards of journalism, but the concentration of news media ownership in the hands of a few represents, prima facie, a competitive market failure requiring compensatory regulation to ensure socially acceptable outcomes; and


(d) as the only representative body democratically elected by all citizens of Australia, the Parliament of Australia is the appropriate body to determine what socially acceptable standards are expected from news media in this country and to legislate appropriately to ensure adherence to them; and such legislation should include:


   (i) the appointment of a politically-independent regulatory body to oversee adherence to statutorily-defined standards of news media behaviour;


   (ii) commercially significant sanctions for failures to comply with relevant statutory regulations; and


   (iii) adequate resourcing for such a regulatory body to enable it to enforce statutorily defined sanctions against financially and politically powerful news media owners. (Notice given 18 June 2012.)

That this House:


(1) notes that:


(a) the inaugural international parliamentary conference on 'Parliaments, minorities and Indigenous peoples: effective participation in politics' was held in Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas, Mexico from 31 October to 3 November 2010;


(b) the conference was organised jointly by the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), the Mexican Congress of the Union and Government of the State of Chiapas, in partnership with the United Nations Development Program, the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the United Nations Independent Expert on minority issues and the Minority Rights Group International;


(c) the conference heard that many situations around the world demonstrate that an adequate representation of minorities and Indigenous peoples in policy and decision-making is instrumental in breaking the cycle of discrimination and exclusion suffered by members of these groups, and their ensuing disproportionate levels of poverty and related impediments to the full enjoyment of many civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights, and yet, minorities and Indigenous peoples often remain excluded from effective participation in decision-making, including at the level of the national parliament;


(d) the conference adopted the Chiapas Declaration, which urges every parliament, within the next two years, to inter alia, hold a special debate on the situation of minorities and Indigenous peoples in their country, recognise the diversity in society, and adopt a 'plan of action' to make the right to equal participation and non-discrimination a reality; 


(e) the Chiapas Declaration recommended that at a minimum the following elements are contained in the 'plans of action':


   (i) ensure that the right to free, prior and informed consent is observed in every step leading to the adoption of legislative and administrative measures affecting minorities and Indigenous peoples, and hold government to account for the implementation of such measures;

   (iv) allocate sufficient resources to the task of establishing dialogue between minority/Indigenous peoples and public institutions and to parliamentary committees to allow them to carry out effective outreach activities such as public hearings with minority and Indigenous peoples; and

"Burke, Anna (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)",ALP,2012-08-15,"



The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
) (15:11):  I have received letters from the honourable member for Kennedy and the honourable Leader of the Opposition proposing that definite matters of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion today. As required by standing order 46(d), the Speaker has selected the matter which, in his opinion, is the most urgent and important; that is, that proposed by the honourable member for Kennedy, namely: 


The need for urgent federal government intervention to divest the two supermarket giants and give owner operated business, Australian farmers and customers increased competition, greater choice and a fairer deal.


I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places.




More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places—


",HoR,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Supermarket Competition</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,11,1
"Katter, Bob, MP",AUS,2012-08-15,"



Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (15:12):  In 1991 in Australia, two supermarket giants had 50.5 per cent of the food market. In 1999, John Howard, the Prime Minister, agreed to an inquiry. By that time the market share of the two supermarket giants had risen to 65 per cent. Everybody knew that their market share was shooting through the roof. The inquiry, comprising all parties, including the Australian Democrats, effectively recommended that nothing be done. 


There were three alternatives. One was, as the National Association of Retail Grocers of Australia, or NARGA—the independents—asked for, a capping at and divestment down to 22 per cent of market share for each of the giants. A second was to go to American trust laws. The third alternative was to considerably strengthen the Australian Consumer and Trade Practices Act. Not one of the three alternatives was adopted by the committee. No-one can read their report—an excellent report, I might add—and not understand that the major parties in Australia are controlled by Woolworths and Coles. 


No other country on Earth would accept this situation. Let me give you the figures for other countries. The report I am referring to, Fair market or market failure, gives the figures for other countries. There is not one other country on Earth where the big three have even 25 per cent. But in Australia, when this report came out, they had 65 per cent. 


Franklins and Davids have vanished into the mouths of the two giant whales—and when the last report was done in 2002 by AC Nielsen, which tracks the figures, they were on 72 per cent of market share. So when should we act—when they have 100 per cent of market share? But in every report—the AC Nielsen series, the ABS series and this report here—every single one of them, including Woolworth and Coles, claims they have two per cent annual market growth. They had 74 per cent in 2002—I think most people can add up—and we are now talking about 90 per cent.


In America there are 22 books on the shelves about Wal-Mart because there is a huge outcry in America. Wal-Mart and their nearest competitor have 23.1 per cent of the American market. Americans are screaming blue murder over that 23.1 per cent. But our two giants have 90 per cent. What is the result of that? What happens if you give two giants ownership of your liquor, petrol and food? There are only two people for farmers to sell to and there are only two people for consumers to buy from.


I have spoken thousands of times in this place about the horrors of deregulation. I will go through them. The milk industry was the first to be deregulated. Let me go through the figures. I must emphasise that these are not my figures; they are ABS figures. The price of milk was 59c a litre under an arbitrated price system—the famous tribunal. The day after deregulation we were paid 42c a litre. Was that difference passed on to consumers? No. The price for consumers went up by over 25 per cent over the next two years. So Woolworth and Coles—there were others too, but it was mainly them—took away from the table an extra $1.3 billion of profit a year. That is what they got; that is what we delivered to them through deregulation.


I say to the people in this place who have advocated national competition policy that the one thing it never delivered was competition. It delivered monopoly powers. Every day that goes by, more and more Australians are destroyed by it. After deregulation, the price of eggs to the consumer rose from 185c a dozen to 293c, almost a doubling in price, the price to farmers went down by 12c a dozen, and the boys in the middle got $240 million extra. When we deregulated the sugar industry and removed the tariffs, we got wiped out to the tune of $360 million. That extra profit went to Woolworth and Coles. Again, the price in the stores went up by 20 per cent.


We have had inquiry after inquiry. I do not understand this and I will never understand this: each inquiry says there is no problem. When two people own 90 per cent of the marketplace they tell us there is no problem! After the last inquiry, I went down to Coles at Manuka and bought a one kilogram bag of sugar for $1.35. The price paid to the processor and the farmer was 39c. They get 40c and Woolworth and Coles get $1.35. Packaging must cost a lot! For eggs, the farmer was paid $1.40 and the price there was $4.85. I have the dockets. For milk, 65c went to the farmer and the processor, and the cost to the consumer was $1.99 a litre. Coles are making a big deal about cutting that down to $1, but for 11 years we were talking about $2. Here is my docket—at Coles it was $2. Well, they made plenty. If they are getting a little bit back which they are not giving back, it is over the dead bodies of the farmers—quite literally. Within two years of dairy deregulation there was a farmer committing suicide every four days in this country.


Finally, potatoes—and you can really justify a lot of processing with potatoes! The farmers got 62c a kilo and Coles were charging $2.46 a kilo. I can continue to reiterate these prices, but everybody in this parliament knows Coles and Woolworths are quite literally having a picnic over the dead bodies of our farmers, and it will continue until there are no farmers left.


Coles and Woolworths are buying from overseas, and our chances to get the message through are very limited when the Fairfax press is controlled by Roger Corbett, the chairman, who was head of Woolworths. He is also on the board of Wal-Mart in the United States. They have got unlimited trading virtually everywhere in Queensland. They can wipe out the after-hours stores—so there are no ma and pa stores. How the single mothers and retired people in the suburbs get to supermarkets now I do not know. It is very difficult for them to go shopping now because they have got no local store.


The service stations were not allowed to have groceries when we were in government in Queensland. That was specifically to keep the oil companies out of—and to protect—owner-operated businesses. That has been abolished, of course. The service stations are now controlled and owned by Woolworth and Coles. So all of that after-hours trade has moved completely over to them—and what they haven't got they are going to get by 24-hour trading wherever they go.


We cannot sell on the world market because of the massive subsidies from the other countries. It is almost impossible for us to compete on the world market. So we come back to the Australian market, and week after week, day after day, product is brought in from overseas. Hardly a week goes by where there is not something in the papers about some new commodity coming in from overseas. I am told that Woolworths has a whole three-storey building employing people doing nothing else except sourcing cheap food from overseas.


We cannot compete in apples. I said, 'Hold on, it's America and New Zealand,' and they said, 'Yes, $9 an hour.' We would pay $19 an hour, and so we should, but the wage in the United States in California is $9 an hour, and in New Zealand it is $9 an hour. The apples will also be coming in from China, where the average income is $5,000 a year. How can we compete against those apples? Everybody knows they have fire blight. You had the reason to keep them out, but you did not. You are so in love and enamoured with and obsessive about free trade that you will bring those apples in knowing that they have been sprayed with streptomycin, antibiotics, to get rid of the disease. You know that.


So I will be moving legislation in this House so that, if you want to bring an apple in from those three countries which have fire blight and spray with streptomycin—because we have no way of checking whether it is sprayed with streptomycin—every apple will have a marker on it. We heard the minister stand up today on cigarettes. There is a serious danger to our health from these apples. Every one will have a marker: 'This product has not been grown or processed under Australian health and hygiene standards and may be injurious to your health.'


I say with very great pride that, as the minister, I have been attributed with the creation of the prawn- and fish-farming industries of Australia—and no doubt my department played a very key role in the establishment of those industries. Prawn and fish farming in Australia rose up to $600 million at one stage. We have virtually no prawn farming at all now in Australia. We thought we would catch Thailand at $2,000 million. Thailand has gone up to $8,000 million; we have gone down to nothing. And that is because Woolworths and Coles are bringing their prawns in from Vietnam, China and Thailand.


In Vietnam they actually use raw sewage in the ponds. In Thailand, they put the raw sewage in the river, and in China they put raw sewage in the river and take raw sewage out. We have to have pure, bacteria-free water going in and pure, bacteria-free water going out, which is impossible, so forget about any prawn farming in Australia. But those prawns are coming in, and we know they are carrying diseases. They have to be. They are being brought up in a bacterial environment. So once again, as far as I am concerned, every single little box of prawns anywhere in Australia will carry that label on it. At the very least, that will slow Woolworths and Coles down from bringing them into Australia.


Every other country has laws protecting against monopolistic powers—oligopolistic, if I want to be technical. Every country on earth has that. We have no laws that protect. Clearly, they rose from 50.5 per cent in 1991, after inquiry after inquiry after inquiry, up to 92 per cent—and these are their own figures, not mine; they are not my figures. Every year they claim they have a growth in market share, and I have been tracking them since the ABS series was discontinued and the AC Nielsen series was discontinued. There was to be a review in 2002. Both series were discontinued in 2002, so we could not prove anything because there were no series there anymore. I am not a conspiracy theorist, Madam Deputy Speaker, but it is pretty difficult to write around that one in 2002. But, since 2002, Coles and Woolworths have skited to their shareholders about their growth in market share. Add that to the 74 per cent they had in 2002 and you have 92 per cent, and we are still doing nothing in this place.


I formed a political party—and I will probably conclude on this note. A newsagent, Roger Piagno, in Mareeba, jumped out and said, 'What've you formed a new political party for?' I said, 'How many shops have we got in the main street of Mareeba, Rog, do you reckon?' He said, 'Oh, about 150, I suppose.' 'How many are we going to have in 15 or 20 years time?' He said, 'Two.' I said: 'Good. That's why I formed a political party!' And he walked inside. You have to seriously contemplate forming a new political party in this country to get a little bit of justice for every single person. There will be no newsagents. There will be no chemists. There will be no florists. There will be no bakers. There will be nothing. They want it all, and this place has facilitated giving them it all.


Forget about mixing with powerful people. You do not have to mix with powerful people. Mix with Australians and be proud of it and do the right thing by them. Woolworths and Coles must be acted upon. Every four days, a farmer in Australia commits suicide. And that is the note upon which I conclude.

"Bradbury, David, MP",ALP,2012-08-15,"



Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (15:27):  I appreciate the opportunity to contribute to this debate and thank the member for Kennedy for bringing this important matter of public importance before the parliament. I know that the member for Kennedy is a very passionate advocate of people in his part of the world. Certainly much of the passion that we have come to see from him in the past was evident in that contribution today.


I would like to address the issue that underlies the matter of public importance today. I begin by saying that, whilst I think there is a general acknowledgement of some of the concerns that are raised in relation to the use of market power generally across various markets in this country from time to time, it is the government's position that the existing competition framework is adequate to deal with many of these challenges. Certainly we stand ready to consider any evidence that might suggest that there are other alternatives, more appropriate means, through which better outcomes can be achieved. When we ask the question about what those better outcomes might be, we must bear in mind the question, obviously, of the interests of producers, but ultimately we need to ensure that we have an efficient and productive economy and one that is giving consumers a fair go and a fair deal. That is ultimately at the heart of our approach to competition policy.


When you look at the major supermarket chains and the supermarket sector, you see that upon coming to office this government directed the ACCC to undertake a specific inquiry into the major supermarket chains and the retail sector. There were a number of findings that came out of that review.


In particular, that review found that there was workable competition within the supermarket sector. The review did indicate that, in particular, smaller players like ALDI were playing an important role in introducing competition into this sector. It is worth noting that ALDI represents a very small part of the overall market, as do some of the other independent operators and some of the smaller players, like IGA. I think it is worth noting the respective market shares of the major supermarket chains. Here I am citing data from the IbisWorld Supermarkets and Other Grocery Stores in Australia report, which indicates that Woolworths has approximately a 40 per cent market share and Coles has approximately a 31 per cent market share.


Inherent in this matter of public importance that has been brought forward is the clear suggestion that there should be some divestiture of the market share that those players currently hold. What is unclear, and what is a difficult question for proponents of divestiture to answer, is what might be an appropriate threshold for market share to be set at. Indeed, just as difficult a question to ask and to answer is how one might determine and define that market share. One of the things the ACCC's inquiry into the retail sector showed was that for an overwhelming majority of consumers—in particular in metropolitan areas, where it was more than 90 per cent of consumers—most of their shopping is done within five kilometres of where they live. This gives rise to the very question of market definition: what is the market? If the test here is one of market size or market penetration, then obviously one needs to go through that exercise of defining what the market is.


More broadly, the approach this government has brought to competition policy—which is consistent with approaches that have previously been taken—has been to say that market share, on its own, is not determinative of whether or not a competitive framework exists. You need to have a look at the full range of factors. People talk about monopolies, but clearly we do not have a monopoly. I am not trying to be technical about it, but we do not have a monopoly. There are people who call it a duopoly, but we do not have a duopoly. We have a market in which two major supermarket chains have very significant market shares; there is no question about that. But I will make this observation: it would be fair to say that in recent times we have seen more robust competition in the grocery sector than we have seen for a very long time. This is feedback that I get in my community, and I know many others get it elsewhere. The very vigorous competition that is currently in play in our major supermarket chains is on display for all to see. I would not entirely attribute the current price deflation to that competition, but I think anyone who brought any serious analysis to the price deflation that has been experienced in recent times would have to acknowledge that the aggressive competition that has been occurring between Coles and Woolworths has contributed in part.


That leads to all sorts of debates. One of the debates we have had before committees and in the public more generally has been around milk prices. Two parliamentary committees have looked at this. The first parliamentary committee looked at it because milk prices were too high; the second parliamentary committee looked at it because prices were too low. That raises all sorts of very serious questions about what we are hoping to get out of these inquiries and, ultimately, what type of marketplace we are looking to operate within. The government takes the view that competition policy is always about a balance. It is about ensuring that we have a set of rules and a framework in place that allows serious competition to exist between competitors but, at the same time, makes sure that ultimately the best outcomes are being generated for consumers.



Mr Katter interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  The member for Kennedy will remain quiet or will find himself out of the chamber.




Mr BRADBURY:
  Perhaps I could address the issue of divestiture, which is at the heart of this matter of public importance. There are a whole series of very difficult questions that proponents of divestiture have to answer. I have heard many discussions, but I have not heard too many answers to these questions. The first one, which I have already identified, relates to market definition: what is the market? Secondly, what percentage of market share is appropriate, and what is not? I have just gone through the figures: 40 per cent for Woolworths and about 30 per cent for Coles. Let's just say, for argument's sake, that someone says 25 per cent is the appropriate figure.




Mr Katter:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, a point of order: he claims 40 or 30 per cent. That was in 2002—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  No, there is no point of order. You are debating the minister.




Mr BRADBURY:
  I am not seeking to engage in argument on this. The figures I quoted were from the IbisWorld Supermarkets and Other Grocery Stores in Australia report from this year.


Let's assume for just one minute that proponents of divestiture are arguing that 25 per cent is the cap—that that is the limit on what market share should exist. That means anyone who has more than that in market share is going to have to forgo stores all around the country. One has to ask the question: where are the first stores that are given up going to be? Are they going to be the most profitable stores? I suspect they will not be the most profitable stores; I suspect they will be some of those stores in poorly serviced areas, often in rural and regional communities. It is worth noting that we are talking about companies that employ a significant number of Australians; in fact, the numbers are in the thousands, if we put the two major supermarket chains together.


If we are to force divestiture, which is the proposition we are talking about here, that would mean Coles and Woolworths would have to basically sell some of their stores. I put it to you that it would be the least profitable stores that they would be willing to sell. I also ask the question: who is going to buy these stores? Quite often the people who are most in favour of divestiture are the people also most opposed to foreign investment. It is most likely that the lack of capital that exists within this country means that foreign capital will come in and pick up those stores. I assume that we are happy with that foreign investment, but I understand that is not without contention in this place. The ACCC report indicated that ALDI, which is foreign owned, was a force that was bringing competitive pressure into this sector. So we see that the complex dynamics of divestiture are not as simple as the suggestion that you simply divest.


I put it to you all that there are legitimate concerns being raised in relation to market power. There are a number of changes that have been made to our competition laws in recent times, many of which have not been tested before the courts. The ACCC Chairman, Rod Sims, has indicated that the ACCC are undertaking very, very robust inquiries in relation to some of these matters. I think it is important, and the government believes it is important, that we give the regulator the opportunity to test the laws that have already been introduced. If it is the case that there are suggestions that the laws are ineffective or inadequate to address clearly identified problems, then of course the government will consider what action that requires.


Can I make some further points in relation to the lack of alternatives to the approach that the government has outlined. I know that the opposition will have their opportunity to contribute to this debate. I was really interested to find out what their position on competition policy was. I had a look at the coalition speakers notes that were leaked a bit earlier this year. There are about 140 pages, and I searched the notes page by page from front cover to back cover and I could not find anything about competition policy. I then thought that it must be in there under consumer policy. Well, there was nothing under consumer policy either. In fact, I was alerted to this by an article, an opinion piece, that I saw in the paper this morning from Peter Costello, who said:


Recently, Nationals senator John ''Wacka'' Williams called for an ombudsman to be given the power to force supermarkets to increase prices.


… …   …


But a statement like that should draw a response from political leaders lest people start thinking it is serious.


… …   …


A government has to decide whether it is for the consumer or the producer.


… …   …


The Coalition has committed to a ''root and branch'' review of competition policy. This will be another showdown between rational economics and rural populism.


We know who has the balance of power over there at the moment—it is the rural populists. The rural populists are in control. Well, at least in opposition the rural populists are in control. When I heard about this root and branch review I thought that maybe there is a policy. So I went to the website of the member for Dunkley, who is the shadow minister in this area. I thought that perhaps he had set out some of the problems that they have identified and need to be assessed in this root and branch review. When I looked at the website the word 'competition' only appeared in the headline. There was no reference to competition. In fact, the Competition and Consumer Act, the relevant piece of legislation, was not mentioned. The only thing I could see a reference to was the Australian Accounting Standards Board. I have been scratching my head all day trying to understand what connection that has with competition policy.


Let's not forget that there have been two major reviews of competition policy in the last 20 years—the Hilmer review and the Dawson review. And let's not forget that neither of those reviews recommended divestiture powers. Indeed, the last root and branch review, which was the Dawson review, recommended a couple of interesting things like the criminalisation of cartel conduct, which is something that the former government sat on for year after year and did nothing about. It took this government to come into power and to introduce legislation to criminalise that conduct.


We will continue to monitor developments within the marketplace. To the extent that evidence emerges that there is misuse of market power that extends beyond those powers that the ACCC currently has, we will stand ready to consider any future changes. (Time expired)

"Billson, Bruce, MP",LP,2012-08-15,"



Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley) (15:42):  There you have heard it. There you have heard the Labor line that there is no problem to be found anywhere in our competition laws. It is quite remarkable to hear the Assistant Treasurer. I remember having a debate with his predecessor in the then Prime Minister's seat when I was outlining the coalition's policy dealing with the need for a root and branch review of the competition framework and that was extremely well received. Then Dr Emerson, who was my opposite number at the time, ran the same line. He said that there was no problem to be found and that the Labor government was perfectly happy with the current set of arrangements. And there you have heard it again today from the Assistant Treasurer. He said: 'The existing framework is adequate.'


I cannot agree with that. In fact there are two absolute certainties in this competition space that I think we all might be able to agree on. One is that everything is not okay. I think we can agree on that. I think that is pretty clear. We see pressures in our marketplace day in and day out and some of those have been touched upon by earlier speakers. I think we can also agree that there is no single silver bullet to fix this. The member for Kennedy has outlined the etymology, if I can use that language, of some of the challenges that he sees, and I would like to add my account of some of the challenges that are also there.


I am absolutely certain that there is no single action that will address the issues that are here now. I think we can agree on those two things: that Labor is absolutely wrong in saying everything is peachy sweet about the current competition laws in Australia, that there is no problem to be found anywhere in the economy. I think we can also agree that there is no simple, single solution that will remedy the pressures and tensions that the coalition sees and has been identifying. That, I think, we can agree upon.


The proposition that is being put forward today by the member for Kennedy is that the government should be given some powers to intervene to divest in the two, as he calls them, supermarket giants. I should help the Assistant Treasurer: there already are powers in the competition law of Australia to deal with divestiture. They already exist. They exist to the extent that a merger or acquisition has been transacted without receiving the appropriate approval from the ACCC and that that would amount to an adverse impact on competition. 


There are a whole lot of legal definitions that sit around it but if someone proceeds with a merger and acquisition and it has the effect of substantially reducing competition then there is a divestiture power available. So that power already exists. If an approved merger or acquisition proceeds, but some of the undertakings or terms under which it was given approval—given consent—are not adhered to then there is also a power for the ACCC to instigate divestiture.


So for those who are talking about divestiture power, there are already mechanics in the current law to deal with those things. That is not dissimilar from the laws that exist in other jurisdictions. There has been some talk about what happens in the UK. There is the same arrangement: if a merger or acquisition that has been progressed with has a detrimental impact on competition then there is a divestiture power. Under the antitrust laws in the United States it is the same as well. In that respect we are not so different.


Where we are different, though, is in the way in which two very dominant players in this supermarket space are able to work within the railroad tracks of the current law—therefore, not break the law—but, in effect, put pressure on a pro-competitive, pro-consumer, pro-economic prosperity future that we would hope for for the country. That is real. We see those pressures popping up in a number of places: the growing market concentration in key areas and the key impact these dominant players can then have over suppliers, where they exert pressure and have an influence that leads suppliers to make, in some cases, decisions that are against their own economic self-interest. Why? Because there is nowhere else to go. 


That is not against the law. It is not helpful for our economy. It is not helpful for innovation and diversity and choice in our supply chain. I think it is not helpful for the durable interest of consumers in Australia, but at the moment it is not against the law. That is a problem with the law. It shows that the Labor reassurance that the existing framework is adequate is simply not right.


The provisions in section 46 relate to the misuse of market power. For those who want to lie awake at night, have a read of section 46. It was the provision that those reviews that have been relied upon by the Assistant Treasurer said would catch everything. If there was a kind of mischief going on from a dominant player in the market place, section 46 would be the answer. Yet reality has shown us that you need to be asleep to break those laws. The requirements to offend those laws are so steep, so demanding and so difficult to prove that there are very rare cases where a prosecution has been successfully brought. And where a prosecution has been brought the penalty is to be slapped with a wet lettuce leaf. So this omnipotent provision under section 46 dealing with misuse of market power, which promised so much, has not delivered what was promised. We think that requires examination.


Look at some of the mandatory codes. I concur with some of the views that the member for Kennedy pointed out. The horticultural code is a piece of fiction. It just does not achieve what it aims to achieve. We have seen problems with the grocery code and we see this in the franchising area as well. They have not lived up to the ambition that led to their formulation. In reality they have not had the impact that people had hoped for.


If you are a small business, a grower or a family enterprise seeking to access some of the remedies and sanctions to draw upon and activate some of the provisions in the current consumer law, your simple size can make that out of reach. You can be faced with a goliath of another party that you have some grievance with, and frankly you will run out of money before you get your case considered. This is unsatisfactory.


Aficionados can even look further. Some of the access regime that is currently in place does not lend itself well to trade exposed issues. Some 20 years ago this framework that we operate within now was formulated, and it has largely been unchanged since. Yet the marketplace has changed. Some of the ideas that Professor Hilmer contemplated two decades ago he thought would have certain effects when, in reality, they have proven not to perform in the way that he though they would.


The market share of the supermarket chains has been touched upon. That has continued to grow and it has created new challenges to the competitive landscape in Australia. It has put pressures on suppliers. It has enabled those dominant players to encourage people contributing supplies, services or goods to do things they otherwise would not do. They are now up against price points from international competitors. 


I saw this when I was up to my calves in cow poo down near Colac talking to a dairy farmer. He was telling me, 'Bruce I've got the carbon tax and all these other pressures putting upward pressure on my costs, yet I have been told by my milk processor that I'm going to get 10 to 15 per cent less for my milk next year.' Why less? Because the supermarkets wanted to go down, down on their prices. What that was representing was down, down pressure on what the milk processor was being paid. And the milk processor, in turn, was passing that through to the dairy farmer. 


What was the price point? The price point was an overseas competitive supply option. So they are basically being told, 'We'd love to keep taking your Australian grown stuff; we'd love to keep taking your milk, but for us to do so you need to compete with imported dairy inputs that really are your price point regardless of what it costs you to survive.'


Hilmer did not anticipate this. Twenty years ago you could not see those pressures. Twenty years ago you saw people advocate that section 49, the price discrimination period, be repealed. Why? Because section 46 would be the answer: it would solve all of these problems. You did not expect that a big business would go to their suppliers and say, 'We don't think Christmas is going to be as good for us as we thought. How about you take five per cent off your invoices? We'll pay you in three months.' They said—I am quoting them—'That will be an investment of mutual benefit to both our organisations.' What choices do you have? Where do you go?


This is where fair competition supports a productive and efficient economy. We are seeing behaviour at the moment that is not unlawful—it does not breach our highly prescriptive laws in this country—but it is certainly not pro-competitive. I have my doubts about whether that will support the long-term economic prospects of our nation and  the durable interests of consumers to support innovation and choice. Surely, that is what competition laws should be supporting. We have highly prescriptive laws, some of the most codified laws anywhere on the planet. As long as businesses know those laws and work them hard—and in some cases game them—to stay between the railroad tracks of what is lawful and what is not, they can push on. 



But is that what is going to support our long-term economic interests and durable benefits for our consumers? The coalition does not think so. That is why we needed a sober, objective, evidence based examination of the pressures on our competition laws in Australia—to look at what might work so the remedies are fit for the purpose and do what we anticipate, and to test what is going on internationally. In other jurisdictions the laws have the capacity to deal with these pressures; our laws do not. Laws in other jurisdictions are sharper and reflect the longer term interest. That is what the coalition is all about and that is what we should be supporting. (Time expired)

"Neumann, Shayne, MP",ALP,2012-08-15,"



Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (15:52):  Listening to the member for Dunkley you just do not know whether the coalition is Arthur or Martha on this issue. In fact, I found two quotes from their spokespersons in relation to this issue which demonstrate the failures of the coalition when they were in government, including their failure to put forward a consistent narrative on this issue. Senator Barnaby Joyce in a media statement on 15 July this year said: 


Over the past 30 years—


during which both sides of politics were here—


food prices in Australia have increased by 189 percent. Much higher than many others, in the UK and US food prices have increased about 120 per cent, while in Canada they have only increased by 90 per cent.


Then you have the Leader of the Nationals, when he was a minister in the previous government, launching a report, Price determination in the Australianfood industry, explaining the differences between farm gate, wholesale and retail prices and talking about the fact that the report found that the relatively low grocery sector profit margins in Australia were largely a result of strong international and national brand presence together with 'a highly competitive retail sector'. That was in his speech to the ABARE Outlook 2004 conference. So you just do not know where the coalition stands on this particular policy.


I believe the member for Kennedy is sincere and genuine in what he says. We saw that in the passion that he displayed here today. But he claimed that the major political parties were controlled by Woolworths and Coles. During the last state election in Queensland—and I happen to represent an electorate in south-east Queensland—you had bunting, posters and advertisements saying that Woolworths and Coles ran the country. Woolworths and Coles do not raise taxes, they do not declare war and they do not run schools or hospitals, and I have never seen the CEO of Woolworths or Coles sitting at the dispatch box on either side of the chamber.


The truth is that Woolworths and Coles are an important part of the Australian economy. As the Assistant Treasurer said, they control about 71 per cent of the food and grocery sector. IGA control about seven per cent and ALDI control about four per cent. The member for Kennedy actually talked about his position. He wants to divest, and the government intervened. I had a look at the policies on the website of Katter's Australian Party. There is a piece about this issue headed 'Fair Food'. It is less than a page and there is nothing there about the impact on jobs, on profitability of companies or on the impact on regional, rural and suburban communities. It is just a bold statement about what they might do, claiming:


… consumer prices are inflated, meaning higher grocery bills.


That is inconsistent with the reports, as the Assistant Treasurer has outlined.


I do not know where the member for Kennedy has been, if he has watched TV or received any of those brochures in his home, because competition is really quite strong, and you can see that. How much more does he want consumers to pay? If he wants to get rid of what he thinks is an oligopolistic practice, how much more does he want Australian consumers to pay for bread, butter, milk, cheese et cetera?


He also says he does not know how people actually get to the grocery stores or supermarkets. But the ACCC, in their 2008 grocery inquiry, found that almost 90 per cent of consumers living in metropolitan regions travel fewer than five kilometres to their regular supermarket. In regional areas—and I represent a regional and rural seat—consumers tend to travel further to do their supermarket shopping, with 23 per cent travelling more than 10 kilometres. I have 6,500 square kilometres in my electorate, and if you drive for five minutes in your car from my electorate office you get into cattle country. That is the truth. The truth is that rural and regional areas also want Woolworths and Coles.


I know from when I have done mobile offices in Esk, a rural community north-west of Ipswich, that they have been crying out for a Woolworths shop to be created there. I know that in places like Fernvale, Woolworths has acted as an incubator to attract more retail. When I spoke to the manager of the Ipswich Region Business Enterprise Centre of the Ipswich and West Moreton region, Tony Axford, he talked about the impact of those facilities and consumer outlets in those rural areas.


If you want to talk about why Woolies and Coles are important across the country, let me give you an illustration from my community. I represent Ipswich and the Somerset region. During the floods last year, we saw Coles in Ipswich decimated. One of the pictures many people in this place and listening on the radio would have seen was Coles decimated by the floods. All around that area we saw retail outlets like Ace Computer World suffer as a result of the loss of Coles. Coles are going to build a $25 million facility. It is going to be above the flood line and 350 people in the Ipswich area are going to get jobs. Does the member for Kennedy say that they should not do that? Should they divest themselves of that particular site and lose 350 jobs in that community? Does he want to damage the retail outlets in that area—the newsagents, the little shops in that area, Ace Computer World? Is that what he wants them to do? That is what he seems to be proposing.


What about Woolworths? He is critical of them. He claims, for example, that Woolworths and Coles control the major political parties. For many years, until very recently, I was on the state administrative committee of the Australian Labor Party in Queensland. I cannot remember Woolworths or Coles ever being mentioned at any stage. They are not an affiliated body to the Australian Labor Party's Queensland branch or to any other branch of the party across the country. The claim that somehow Woolies and Coles control the Labor Party—and I do not believe for a minute they control the Liberal Party or the National Party either—is not true at all. They do not. 


The truth is that Woolies and Coles are an important part of regional and rural areas. I know how important they are in my communities, in the country towns and also in Ipswich.


I mentioned the flood. During the flood Woolies provided enormous help to my communities. Does the member for Kennedy propose, in respect of the mall site of the Ipswich CBD, that Woolies divest itself of that particular site? It is the anchor of the mall in Ipswich. During the flood, I organised—and Woolies did this—thousands and thousands of dollars worth of groceries, fruit and vegetables, household goods and cans and packages of food, including spaghetti, for flood evacuation areas in the Ipswich region. We had convoys of utilities and trucks going to evacuation centres at places like Riverview Neighbourhood House. Does he propose that we divest that? What is he suggesting for communities like Ipswich and Fernvale? We know these places are important. We know they attract business.


I will talk about Ipswich again and about the suburb I live in. Down the road from me in Flinders View we have an IGA at Winston Glades Shopping Centre. Less than three kilometres down the road, in the Yamanto Village, we have a Woolies. It is the hub of the Yamanto Village. About 200 metres down the road, along Warwick Road, there is an ALDI. They all exist there and they compete. I have lived in that particular part of Ipswich for about 27 years and I know that people in my community know they compete as they get the brochures.


Consumers make choices. They make choices about where they will go to shop. We do not live in a Stalinist economy, a command economy. Sadly, although the member for Kennedy seems to have the best interests of people at heart, somehow I think he would be happier in a command economy, even though he wants to say it is in the best interests of free enterprise. He is so critical of free enterprise and he is so critical of free trade. But these particular enterprises actually form the base of a community.


In the Yamanto Village, for example, right beside the Woolies there is a butcher and beside it there is a greengrocer. Seriously, what is he going to suggest about the impact on the greengrocer and on the butcher if you get rid of Woolies and they divest themselves of the site in one of the biggest suburbs in Ipswich? Is that what he is suggesting we do? I think it is nonsense. I have given those examples in my community to show the consequences and to talk about the 'beware factor' here as to the member for Kennedy's proposal. It is not thought through. That is all his policy document is about, with no dollars and sense, no thinking about the economic consequences in regional and rural areas, no thinking about the consequences for consumers and no thinking about the consequences for local jobs. It sounds good if you are in a pub up at Hughenden or somewhere like that but it does not work in reality. He knows it is not realistic. It is great publicity but it is not realistic. It is not good for jobs, it is not good for consumers and it is not good for communities like mine. (Time expired)

"Cobb, John, MP",Nats,2012-08-15,"



Mr JOHN COBB
 (Calare) (16:02):  I rise to speak on the very important issue of supermarket power. While I do not support the member for Kennedy's remedy for the current situation, I am concerned—indeed the whole coalition of the National Party and the Liberal Party is concerned—about the capacity of the current situation to nurture a healthy competition. The one thing that without doubt is true is that a productive and efficient economy does need competition—fair competition. The market should be a dynamic system both domestically and internationally. However, the two systems are different. I think we are constantly challenged as politicians and as businesses by different sectors of the marketplace to get that fair and balanced system. However, quite obviously the Assistant Treasurer and the member for Blair believe otherwise.


There are pressures in the economy that are testing the capacity of current laws to support and nurture healthy competition. These pressures include the fact that there is a growing market concentration in key areas, the impact  of dominant players on supply chains, the responsiveness of current laws or systems to deal with abuses of market power, and the effectiveness of mandatory codes. The horticultural code was mentioned earlier by the shadow minister. I have met with representatives recently and some of the people worried about that are from the member for Kennedy's own electorate. There is the accessibility and effectiveness of sanctions and remedies, and also the suitability of infrastructure access regimes, particularly for export orientated industries but actually more for domestic ones. It has become increasingly evident in the last couple of years that there is a lack of confidence in the system to provide balanced outcomes but, as you have already heard, the Labor government—in particular the Assistant Treasurer and member for Blair—do not believe that that is so.


It has been 20 years since there has been an objective, evidenced based assessment of how well our competition framework works. As has already been mentioned, obviously Professor Hilmer did not or could not contemplate that 20 years down the track there would be almost a doubling of the major supermarkets' market share. I guess he could not have anticipated that. In 1993, who might have anticipated that what were thought to be broad and inclusive prohibitions, such as those in section 46, on misuse of market power, would be read down and rendered almost useless when faced with practical examples of the muscle-flexing of a big business against a small business that occurs in our economy?


In the last two years there has been a very significant increase in traffic of processors and growers coming through my office door to highlight these issues and how hard it is for them to do business. Since then the $1 a litre milk price campaign has been introduced and retail prices are back to what has not been seen for 15 or 20 years. That has underlined that the system does need some rebalancing and, as the shadow minister has already said, we are committed to a review of what used to be the Trade Practices Act.


Dairy farmers, like the rest of the agricultural industries, have rightly highlighted that farmers are price takers in the economy and cannot pass any cost increases through to consumers. But, once again, the Labor Party do not seem, at the prime ministerial or ministerial level, to understand that farmers do not pass on cost increases, whether it is the carbon tax or anything else. The carbon tax highlighted their ignorance about processors and farmers. Minister Combet just last month claimed on ABC radio that farmers are entitled to pass on the cost increases of carbon pricing. His words were, 'But where there are costs incurred, it is valid to pass it through.' Is he that naive? Certainly the Prime Minister is. Twelve months before, when discussing the costs of the carbon tax on the dairy industry, she said on Adelaide radio, 'You will pass any additional costs through.' That highlights her ignorance. She said the same thing when it was mentioned to her that the carbon tax was being passed straight onto the cost of aviation fuel. When she was asked how those who muster and crop dust would be able to avoid it, she said, 'They'll pass it on, like everybody else.' This highlights the compound nature of the problem and the ignorance of the government to deal with it. 


The coalition has promised a review of the Competition and Consumer Act, and that is something we will follow through. The current market has thrown up some interesting and surprising circumstances. You would expect, for example, that some of our agricultural industries production is dominated by a couple of big players and that that would give them more market power, but it has had the reverse effect. As there are only two supermarkets servicing 80 per cent of the market, some producers are too big to be able to sell to anyone except those two supermarkets. Whether it is tomatoes, mushrooms, eggs or dairy, they do not have any choice of competition beyond those two supermarkets, simply because they are too big for any other market.


Another issue not envisaged is the home brand issue, where supermarkets have the power to get superior shelf space. This is pertinent when dealing with the ability of a branded product to compete with a product of the supermarket itself. Nothing demonstrates the problem more than when you consider that broadacre industries like grain and meat, which are basically export based, do not have anything like the same problem that intensive domestic industries like horticulture and others have in dealing with supermarkets, because their market is really only within Australia. They have awful problems in dealing with the power of the big buyer, whereas the export based industries do not have to sell domestically; they have a far greater ability to go elsewhere. 


There are some things we can do. In America, any significant movement of agricultural produce has to be reported, as to quantity and price, to the Department of Agriculture. There are penalties if that is not done. Whereas this in itself does not threaten the buyers or the consumer and it is in-confidence, it does give government power to know if there are competition issues involved. 


We have committed to a review of the system. When industries, be they agriculture or otherwise, have to go up against far bigger markets, government has to make sure that competition is fair and equal. I respect the fact that the member for Kennedy has seriously and genuinely brought this issue before parliament. It is one that the coalition is dedicated to looking at. I do not agree with his solution but I do believe it is one we have to look at. I am sorry, as he is, that the current government is not willing to do that. We certainly acknowledge the problem and we are dedicated to dealing with it.

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2012-08-15,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (16:12):  I rise to speak on this matter of public importance relating to supermarket competition, with a particular focus on the importance of maintaining lower prices for consumers. Much of Australia's economic history in the postwar decades is characterised by a somewhat unholy alliance across the major parties to protect producer interests at the expense of consumer interests. So much of the 'protection all round' that prevailed in the 1950s and 1960s meant that Australians paid high prices and that there was less foreign investment. We were less exposed to trade. Our firms were less competitive and our consumers suffered for that. One of the great achievements of the last generation of economic policymakers, thanks to people on both sides of the House, is that we have put the consumer first. 


On the issue of food prices, I want to draw the House's attention to rates of food inflation. As it turns out, the series starts in 1974, when the member for Kennedy first entered politics. I note that in that year the rate of annual food price inflation was 20 per cent, and throughout the ensuing decades it has never been that high. 


Rising food prices have never been a worse problem for Australia than they were at the time that the member for Kennedy began his political career as a National Party member in the Queensland parliament.


Indeed, if we look over the series of figures we can see that in the last two quarters—the March 2012 and June 2012 quarters—food price inflation has been negative. This means that Australians are paying less for the same food items than they were paying a year before. We should be celebrating this fact—it is a huge win for Australian consumers. We do not only see this with food prices; the past 20 years have seen real prices for imported furniture, handbags, clothing, shoes and medical products roughly halved, and prices of computers, telephones and other electrical goods have fallen by about two-thirds. To a large extent it is the opening-up of the market that has kept prices low across the board. Inflation was 6.7 per cent in the 1950 to 1985 period; since then, it has averaged just 3.7 per cent. The rise of China has been a major dampening force on global price inflation.


The matter of public importance today looks in particular at the role of supermarket competition and its price impacts. On this question it is worth referring to the ACCC's inquiry of July 2008 into the competitiveness of retail prices for standard groceries. The report notes, as the member for Kennedy has pointed out, that Coles and Woolworths account for approximately 70 per cent of packaged grocery sales in Australia and approximately 50 per cent of fresh product sales of goods such as meat, fruit and vegetables. But the report also notes:


There is little evidence to suggest that Coles and Woolworths have simply ‘bought out’ the competition.


Millions of Australian consumers shop at Coles and Woolworths in preference or addition to a number of alternatives—the local independent, the specialty bread shop, the Saturday market and/or the corner shop. High concentration levels alone do not dictate the nature of competition. There are other markets internationally that are more concentrated but appear to be more competitive.


It goes on to say:


… ALDI has been a significant influence on Australian grocery retailing. ALDI has forced Coles and Woolworths to react by reducing prices—specifically in States and localities where ALDI is present. Even if a customer does not shop at ALDI, they obtain significant benefits from having an ALDI in their local area or state, as the Coles and Woolworths stores price more keenly.


ALDI has now opened more than 250 stores across Australia. Costco has committed $140 million to ramp up its Australian operations. The government recognises that competition in the grocery retail sector is absolutely critical to making sure that Australians have a good range and cheap prices when they shop in their stores. It is important to constantly return to the facts when we are speaking about prices, not just of food and groceries but also of items across the board. Those opposite have been banging the cost-of-living drum but are unwilling to level with the Australian people about the fact that the inflation rate is the lowest it has been in the decade.


I am pleased in my own electorate to have opened the Bonner Woolworths, which is one of the smallest stores in Australia, and the Canberra Airport Woolworths, which is one of the largest stores in Australia. The Canberra Airport Woolworths will go head to head with Costco. It will have some of the cheapest prices available to consumers, and that means that Canberra families will find their household dollar going further. In Dickson, where there is now a Woolworths, there will soon be an ALDI, and the ACT government has opened up a space for a third supermarket to be determined in February next year.


We are introducing additional measures to bring more competition to the grocery retailing industry and to reduce barriers to entry; we are extending the timeframe for the development of vacant commercial land from 12 months to five years to bring new competitors into the market; we are clarifying the predatory pricing and misuse of market power provisions in the Competition and Consumer Act 2010; we are clarifying the operations of the mergers and acquisitions provisions in the act on creeping acquisitions; and we are introducing a mandatory, nationally consistent unit pricing regime, because we recognise that unit pricing allows Australians to shop around.


There are two schools of thought in this parliament on economic policy. There are those who largely support the market oriented, liberalising economic reforms of past decades, and there are those who are willing to go for the populist grab every chance they get. When the member for Kennedy left the National Party in 2001, it was the National Party of Tim Fischer and Mark Vaile, which was committed to these liberalising market reforms. We now see a struggle for the soul of the National Party, and frankly I think that the National Party is coming back after the member for Kennedy. We hear quotes from Senator Joyce that, for example, the carbon price would raise the cost of a leg of lamb to $100. This is the same Senator Joyce who gets his millions and billions mixed up; the same Senator Joyce who, as the member for Blair has pointed out, is in direct contradiction of the Leader of The Nationals on the issue of comparing farm-gate and retail prices for major grocery items.


We also see a struggle for the soul of the National Party in the current debate over foreign investment. I will be clear: I support foreign investment. It increases the number of jobs and increases wages in the Australian agricultural sector. I pay tribute to some of those opposite, who have been willing to be very clear about the facts in this debate. Former Treasurer Costello even has an opinion piece in the Sydney Morning Herald today making the case for foreign investment. If all Australia's foreign investors were to pull out tomorrow, we would lose one in eight jobs—one in eight workers are directly employed by a foreign owned firm.


So it is important to realise the fire the coalition are playing with as the Nationals return to the party of economic populism, rather than being the party of national interest as they were under Mark Vaile and Tim Fischer. The Leader of the Opposition seems to be flirting with the same tendencies. He said:


I have never been as excited about economics as some of my colleagues; you know, I find economics is not for nothing known as the dismal science.


Let me be clear why economics is known as 'the dismal science'. 'The dismal science' was the tag that Thomas Carlyle gave to economics because it held what he thought was the 'dismal' notion of racial equality. Frankly, I am happy to hold to the notion of racial equality, I am happy to be a practitioner of 'the dismal science' and I am happy to be standing on the side of consumers today.

"Marino, Nola, MP",LP,2012-08-15,"



Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Opposition Whip) (16:22):  I am pleased to speak on this matter of public importance. I was really interested to hear the Assistant Treasurer say that there is no problem and I am interested to note that none of the recent speakers mentioned the words 'producer' or 'farmer'. Obviously they have no idea and no interest. I am a dairy farmer and, as I have said in this House before, a proud one. I have had to deal with the very issue that is before us today. I know exactly what it is like to be the small cog in the big wheel, having to deal with a much larger market player. I put that on the table for members opposite who have not even mentioned producers.




Mr Ian Macfarlane:
  Real life experience.




Ms MARINO:
  I have real life experience, that is true, and I have very real concerns, as do the opposition, who have a willingness to work on this issue—the effectiveness of the competition laws in the current situation. We know that competition in Australia in the supermarket sector is paramount. It is important for consumers to keep the prices down, but it is also important for producers, suppliers and farmers because they need to be without the risk of being held to ransom.


We talk about market concentration and bottlenecks in business throughout Australia and the things which basically limit or restrict production. There is a real issue of dominant players in the supply chain through the retail level, which is really where market control is felt. We know about the two food retailing businesses which account for well over 70 per cent of the grocery market—which, by default, gives them extraordinary market power which is felt right down at the grassroots level. 


In my experience, the use of this power has fallen on deaf ears at the ACCC. I know what the ACCC's job is, but what really concerns me is that part of its role should be to consider market forces. Surely you cannot maintain an effective supply if there are not commercial forces right throughout the supply chain. In my dealings with the ACCC, I found there was no willingness to deal with this issue or anything to do with market power. As dairy farmers, it is very real and in our faces. We are seeing this with the current issue, milk pricing. The imbalance of market power is felt right at the agricultural level and has been for a long time. The member for Dunkley acknowledged that there are problems and we are going to look at them. 


I will never forget the first inquiry that I was part of. A supplier to one of the majors was so worried about the impact of Coles and Woolworths in the market that, to pass evidence on to me, he would meet me only in a car park in Perth where he handed over what were four breaches of the Trade Practices Act. Do you think anything was done about those? No. The ACCC did nothing.


The onus of proof which exists on a small business person like me is to give evidence. I went out and took statutory declarations from every dairy farmer I could get hold of about what was happening. Those statutory declarations all meant nothing as well. And this government says there is not a problem, that there is not an issue. There is a problem and there is a problem with the process as well.


I remember fronting up, as a member of Dairy WA and as a farmer, to the ACCC and saying, 'We really need to develop a milk negotiating agency in Western Australia where it is such a small industry and there are so few farmers.' I remember the absolute contempt with which I was held when I sat in that inquiry with the ACCC on the other side of the table and with 300-odd dairy farmers at my back. They said, 'We're pretty disappointed in the application you've made. We were expecting an application along the lines of what we have had from Air New Zealand and Qantas on a previous matter'—and they were dealing with a group of dairy farmers! Yet those on the other side of the House say there is not a problem, that there is not an issue. I am here to tell you that there is.


Even at recent Senate inquiries there were those who supply the supermarket sector who were not able to give evidence because the very nature of the information they would have given would have identified the contracts they have and they are concerned about retaliation. The concentration of the market gives the large market players power as to whether or not businesses survive. That is what we are dealing with here. So we have some producers who will not front up. It is very difficult to get to the heart of the problem when the very weight of market concentration and market power prevents that from happening.


In the Economics Committee report The impact of supermarket price decisions on the dairy industry we see a statement by National Foods that margins on Home Brand milk are close to zero, with overall profitability on their milk sales, including generic and branded milk, at approximately two per cent.


I would really like to know—and I have asked this question previously—whether there is any cross-subsidisation between the price being paid for generic milk and the price being paid for a branded product. This is just an example. We have heard from the other side that there is no problem, but I would say to you, put yourself in my position. I am a dairy farmer with a perishable product. I do not have a choice to store this product and be able to sell it where and when I like, to whomever I like. There are limited buyers. There are two major supermarkets that buy the product that I have via a processor. But my milk has to be picked up every day. Let me tell those of you who might be thinking maybe there is an issue at the grower level—no, there is not. We have some of the most efficient dairy farmers in the world in Western Australia and they are producing some of the best quality milk in the world most efficiently. So, that is not the issue and yet they are struggling to stay in business.


We have seen the impact of that $1 milk, and we saw it quite strongly in Queensland—the impact was direct and immediate. I look at my fellow dairy farmers and it bothers me—and I know it does not bother the other side—that we are seeing an exodus of great young people with incredible intellectual property built up over generations out of a great industry. There is no value in that from the other side, and so there is no problem. I am here to say that there is a problem, and I am really pleased that we on our side are prepared to look at this and deal with this issue. That is what the member for Dunkley said directly when he was here. 


One other thing that bothers me is that we have a National Food Plan, released by the other side, and yet there is no mention of producers or producer viability. It ignores the price-taking nature of the industry—the fact that there are few buyers and market concentration. It ignores the extreme vulnerability of the grower and the small business person. That is what we are as farmers and producers—we are small business people and we are operating in a market where there is market concentration and associated market power.


As I say, when you get those who cannot afford to give evidence because they are scared of retaliation and those who choose to meet me to pass on some information but will only meet me in a car park in Perth, then we do have a problem. I am pleased that on this side of the House we are prepared to look at that problem in a genuine sense. I have fruit growers say to me: 'The price that I am getting currently is barely covering the boxes that I am packing the fruit in.' Those on the other side have said to date that there is not a problem. Well, you try putting yourself in the position of being the price taker at the bottom of the rung—the small business person—and see if there is not a problem with this whole process.

Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter—Chief Government Whip) (16:33):  I congratulate the member for Kennedy for raising the topic of supermarket competition for discussion this afternoon. Everyone who has made a contribution has been very sincere—the member for Kennedy talking about his potato farmers, amongst others; the member for Forrest talking about her dairy producers, in particular; and the member for Fraser advocating very strongly on behalf of consumers. This is the very nature of this debate: the argument on the side of the producers, who are obviously doing it tough, and the argument on the part of consumers, who benefit from low prices and very competitive arrangements. 


There is no doubt, though, that there is something wrong. Sometimes the evidence is hard to find, but producers are doing it tough for a whole range of reasons—including drought and oversupply in a particular industry. For example, we have an oversupply in the wine industry in my electorate because of excessive planting of vines. The list goes on and on, but life on the land is particularly tough. I was just having a conversation with the Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries on this very issue. 


I was elected into this place in 1996 and in 1999 I was delighted when the Howard government established the Joint Select Committee on the Retailing Sector. It came after enormous pressure from the National Association of Retail Grocers of Australia, who represent the independent supermarkets and were concerned about the growing market power of Coles and Woolworths. There are a number of factors in this debate. One, of course, is that we do have a very high market concentration in this country of somewhere between 70 and 80 per cent, depending on the subsector you are talking about—whether it is fresh fruit or other goods. There is no doubt about that, even though we have had the injection of Costco and ALDI into the marketplace. That has been very welcome. Market concentration remains very high, but it is a bit like comparing apples and oranges when you compare Australia with our 22 million people with the United States where there are in excess of 300 million people. The second matter of fact is one I have already mentioned, and that is that farmers are doing it tough. There is no doubt about that.


The third fact is that consumers are enjoying, generally speaking, lower prices. The fourth is that, when you have a look at the annual reports of Coles and Woolworths, you will find that the shareholders are enjoying a return of between six and seven per cent, which challenges the idea that because of their monopsony power—their purchasing power—Coles and Woolworths have a licence to print money. It simply is not true. Unless those two organisations are charged with lazy inefficiencies, you ask yourself: are they benefiting at the expense of rural producers? I do not know the answers, and no one has really proffered any logical answers here this afternoon. But it is a debate that we need to keep having in this place. There is too much evidence of people in the agricultural sector doing it tough, partly because of the market power of the likes of Woolworths and Coles.


In 1999 we had that inquiry. I went into it very enthusiastically with the interests not only of producers but also of the smaller players in the retail sector in mind and determined to do big things. We did do a few things: we recommended and had adopted some reasonably modest changes to the Trade Practices Act, to the capacity of rural producers to bargain collectively and an amendment to section 50, which allowed the definition of a market to be extended to a regional market. There were changes to section 46 of the Trade Practices Act—that is, the abuse of market power. They were not large but they were changes nonetheless. We got an industry code of conduct and we got an ombudsman. The list goes on and on. It is evident, given some of the concerns being expressed by members from both sides, that not much has changed.


In my own electorate, I get so frustrated with the plight of those in the dairy industry, but there are myriad reasons why the dairy industry is doing it tough. I get particularly frustrated by the plight of my vignerons, who cannot sell their wine at the cellar door these days more cheaply than Dan Murphy's in Sydney can. Whereas once upon a time Sydney residents took a drive to the Hunter for the unique cellar door experience and for some cheap wine, they can now buy it more cheaply in Dan Murphy's in Sydney, in their home town. Nothing illustrates better than that the sheer market power of the Coles and Woolworths of this world, which represent about 80 per cent of the liquor market. I talk to people in this place all the time and to producers all the time—I listened to the member for Kennedy this afternoon—and I ask: what is the solution? No-one this afternoon offered any. No-one in my electorate offers one either. Divestiture is possible, actually, following some changes to the Trade Practices Act. The ACCC does have the capacity to force divestiture in the event of a very deliberate abuse of market power.




Mr Craig Kelly:
  Not now, Joel!




Mr FITZGIBBON:
  If it has been changed, I acknowledge that; I did not know it. I do know that no-one really acted upon it when it was in place. It did not work. There are shareholder interests too, of course. Tell the shareholders of Coles and Woolworths that the government is going to move in and force their company, the company they have invested in, to divest itself of part of its operations. Again, we have very significant competing interests.


We do have a problem, and I acknowledge that. I want to be part of the process of working towards some assistance for these industries. I am thankful that the parliamentary secretary was in the House when I arrived, because he was able to confirm that about 60 per cent of our agricultural output is exported. It is hard to argue that the impact of the monopsony is huge on our agricultural sector when the real market for our agricultural sector is our export markets, where the power of Coles and Woolworths is not relevant.


The best way that government can assist the agricultural sector more generally is of course in innovation, export assistance and opening new markets in areas where they are not necessarily subject to the monopsony power of the Coles and Woolworths of the world. I acknowledge that many of my agricultural producers, including wine producers, are doing it tough, but the answers are very hard to find.

Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (16:42):  On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economics I present the committee's Advisory Report, incorporating supplementary remarks, on the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 4) Bill 2012, together with the minutes of proceedings.


In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.




Ms OWENS:
  by leave—The Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 4) Bill 2012 is similar to other tax amendment bills in that the three schedules are designed to finetune and improve the tax law. The report being tabled today focuses on schedule 1 of the bill and relates to changes to the taxation treatment of living away from home allowances and benefits. The amendments seek to address concerns that the current concessions are being misused, resulting in a significant and growing cost to revenue.


The committee supports the schedule's intent to compensate employees for the additional expenses associated with living away from home at the request of their employer. However, the committee believes that the living away from home allowances and benefits were not designed to provide a wage subsidy for workers in certain industries and that as a general principle if employees are not incurring extra costs as a result of a temporary relocation they should not receive the tax concession.


After scrutinising the bill the committee has recommended a number of measures aimed at improving the application of the legislation. The bill aims to limit the exploitation of the tax concession. In this regard the committee supports the introduction of tightened eligibility criteria which impose a 12-month time limit per location and the maintenance of a usual place of residence within Australia. The committee noted industry's concern that the 12-month limit will not provide coverage for the duration of all projects. However, the tax concessions for living away from home allowances are intended to be temporary and are not designed to support workers who have essentially moved residence. The committee recognises the unique nature of remote construction sites and supports the decision to exempt fly-in fly-out and drive-in drive-out workers from the 12-month limit. It is recommended that drive-in drive-out workers who use their own transport to access their place of work should also be exempt from the time limit. Furthermore, it is recommended that the definition of FIFO and DIDO workers be expanded to include workers who do not meet the test of maintaining a usual place of residence within Australia. The committee has also sought clarification from Treasury on the circumstances in which the 12-month time limit will be paused.


The committee is supportive of the proposed stipulation that an employee must be maintaining a primary residence. However, it should be noted that the committee believes that the definition of an employee's 'usual place of residence' and 'ownership interest' must be broadly interpreted and clearly articulated.


To access the tax concession, all accommodation expenses will need to be substantiated, while food and drink expenses will only need to be substantiated if they exceed the amount prescribed by the Commissioner of Taxation. The committee has recommended that Treasury investigate whether there are any substantive impediments to allowing partners or spouses to incur deductible expenses on behalf of an employee where all other eligibility requirements are met.


While the intention of the schedule was to bring the majority of a living-away-from-home allowance under the income tax arrangements, 'ordinary weekly food and drink expenses' and living-away-from-home benefits are still treated under the fringe benefits regime. The committee strongly supports the single taxation treatment of a living-away-from-home allowance and believes that it may be prudent for it to continue to be treated under the fringe benefits regime.


The reforms will generally apply from 1 October 2012. However, there are transitional provisions for employees who entered into employment arrangements prior to 8 May 2012. Temporary residents who are not maintaining a primary residence in Australia will not be eligible for the transitional provisions. The committee has had to rely on the guidance of Treasury and its advice that the schedule and the ensuing transitional provisions are compatible with Australia's human rights obligations and do not breach any double taxation agreements. Submitters were concerned that if a contract is materially altered then the transitional arrangements could be negated. The committee has sought clarification as to what constitutes a 'material variation' as a matter of urgency.


I would like to thank the organisations and individuals who assisted the committee during the inquiry through submissions or by participating in the hearing in Canberra. I would also particularly like to thank the secretariat, who had two major reports to do in the last few weeks. I did not have the opportunity earlier today to thank those who were specifically involved in the report into the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission bills, but I would like to acknowledge them all now. Stephen Boyd, David Monk, Philip Hilton and Natasha Petrovich worked on the charities commission bill, and Zoe Smith and Shivaun Coughlan worked so very hard on this one. I also thank my committee colleagues for their contributions to the report.

Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff) (16:47):  by leave—Coalition members on the committee made supplementary comments on the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 4) Bill. In broad terms, we were supportive of the recommendations of the committee. However, there were aspects of the government's changes to the living-away-from-home allowance that raised concerns with the coalition members on the committee.


Although we are not opposing the recommendations and are not opposing schedule 1 in the bill in particular, there can be no doubt based upon the clear testimony of a number of witnesses before the committee that the ramifications in particular for 457 visa holders are significant. 457 visa holders, of which there are approximately 90,000, make a very substantial contribution to the skilled labour force that Australia enjoys. 457 visa holders make a very significant contribution to ensuring that the skilled worker gap that exists within this country both currently and previously has been met by the ability to attract foreign workers to Australia on a competitive remuneration basis.


The changes that Labor is proposing to the living-away-from-home allowance have a very profound impact upon the ability of Australian employers and more broadly the research and education sectors as well as the more traditional 457 industry—that is, the mining and resources industry—to create an attractive compensation package to attract those skilled workers that Australia vitally needs. In the absence of the government having any clear program to ensure that skilled labour will be available in plentiful supply in the future, the simple and inescapable fact of the changes to the living-away-from-home allowance is that this government, without having transitional arrangements, has immediately made 457 visa workers disadvantaged, made Australia less competitive when it comes to attracting skilled workers and fundamentally made a profound change to the landscape when it comes to our national ability to attract the best and the brightest to a number of jobs where there is a skilled labour shortage.


In addition, I would also highlight, though, that we strongly endorse the committee's position with respect to recommendation 5—that it be handled under one tax regime specifically. I would simply bring those two matters to prominence.


I also seek indulgence to make some comments about the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission report which was tabled by this committee earlier in the day to which the Deputy Speaker indicated I would be able to make some comments, and I will do so very briefly. Coalition members lodged a dissenting report with respect to that inquiry because we did not agree with the recommendations of the committee. In fact, coalition members had the view that the bill ought not to be passed. The objectives through the establishment of the ACNC are certainly objectives that we would support. However, the reality is that the not-for-profit sector is likely to be faced—the evidence was very clear on this—with a significant increase in the amount of red tape and compliance regulations as a consequence of the creation of Labor's bill and its passage, as expected, through the parliament. The reality is that, although it is designed to maintain and protect public trust and confidence, there has been no clear example provided by the government of the way in which these matters have already been diminished or eroded. There continues to be in the not-for-profit sector strong public trust and confidence. Most importantly, there was no compelling argument put forward about the way in which this will overcome the red tape and compliance aspects that were raised by so many witnesses before the inquiry. For that reason, we lodged a dissenting report.

(1) notes that:


(a) the inaugural international parliamentary conference on 'Parliaments, minorities and Indigenous peoples: effective participation in politics' was held in Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas, Mexico from 31 October to 3 November 2010;


(b) the conference was organised jointly by the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), the Mexican Congress of the Union and Government of the State of Chiapas, in partnership with the United Nations Development Program, the United Nations Office of the High Commis­sioner for Human Rights, the United Nations Independent Expert on minority issues and the Minority Rights Group International;


(c) the conference heard that many situations around the world demonstrate that an adequate representation of minorities and Indigenous peoples in policy and decision-making is instru­mental in breaking the cycle of dis­crimination and exclusion suffered by members of these groups, and their ensuing disproportionate levels of pov­erty and related impediments to the full enjoyment of many civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights, and yet, minorities and Indigenous peoples often remain excluded from effective participation in decision-making, in­cluding at the level of the national parliament;


(d) the conference adopted the Chiapas Declaration, which urges every parlia­ment, within the next two years, to inter alia, hold a special debate on the sit­uation of minorities and Indigenous peoples in their country, recognise the diversity in society, and adopt a 'plan of action' to make the right to equal participation and non-discrimination a reality; 


(e) the Chiapas Declaration recommended that at a minimum the following elements are contained in the 'plans of action':


   (i) ensure that the right to free, prior and informed consent is observed in every step leading to the adoption of legisla­tive and administrative measures affecting minorities and Indigenous peoples, and hold government to account for the implementation of such measures;


   (ii) require of government that all submissions to parliament of draft legislation and the national budget include an assessment of their impact on minorities and Indigenous peoples;


   (iii) make regular use of plenary sessions in parliament and other parliamentary fora to discuss minority/Indigenous matters in order to raise awareness and combat prejudice in society, organise awareness-raising sessions for all parliamentarians so as to increase their knowledge of minorities and Indigen­ous peoples and the particular prob­lems they face, and ensure that min­ority and Indigenous issues are main­streamed into parliamentary work, especially at the committee level;


   (iv) allocate sufficient resources to the task of establishing dialogue between minority/ Indigenous peoples and public institutions and to parlia­mentary committees to allow them to carry out effective outreach activities such as public hearings with minority and Indigenous peoples; and


   (v) increase parliaments' familiarity with work being done within the United Nations system so as to equip them better to hold governments to account for their international commitments, including the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, urge ratification of International Labour Organisation Convention 169 on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples, hold debates in parliament on the conclusions and recommendations made by the United Nations human rights treaty bodies and special mechanisms with regard to minority and Indigenous peoples' rights;


(f) the Chiapas Declaration also affirmed the responsibility of political parties to promote the effective participation of minorities and Indigenous peoples, and address their concerns in their party programs; and


(g) the IPU will facilitate networking among parliaments on this issue, monitor the implementation of the Chiapas Declaration and convene a follow-up meeting within two years to discuss progress and set targets for future action;


(2) urges the Government, parliamentarians, and political parties to familiarise themselves with the Chiapas Declaration; and


(3) calls upon the Government to facilitate a roundtable discussion with representatives of Australian Indigenous communities on issues arising from the Chiapas Declaration. (Notice given 19 June 2012.)

(c) the conference heard that many situations around the world demonstrate that an adequate representation of minorities and Indigenous peoples in policy and decision-making is instru­mental in breaking the cycle of dis­crimination and exclusion suffered by members of these groups, and their ensuing disproportionate levels of pov­erty and related impediments to the full enjoyment of many civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights, and yet, minorities and Indigenous peoples often remain excluded from effective participation in decision-making, in­cluding at the level of the national parliament;


(d) the conference adopted the Chiapas Declaration, which urges every parlia­ment, within the next two years, to inter alia, hold a special debate on the sit­uation of minorities and Indigenous peoples in their country, recognise the diversity in society, and adopt a 'plan of action' to make the right to equal participation and non-discrimination a reality; 


(e) the Chiapas Declaration recommended that at a minimum the following elements are contained in the 'plans of action':


   (i) ensure that the right to free, prior and informed consent is observed in every step leading to the adoption of legisla­tive and administrative measures affecting minorities and Indigenous peoples, and hold government to account for the implementation of such measures;


   (ii) require of government that all submissions to parliament of draft legislation and the national budget include an assessment of their impact on minorities and Indigenous peoples;


   (iii) make regular use of plenary sessions in parliament and other parliamentary fora to discuss minority/Indigenous matters in order to raise awareness and combat prejudice in society, organise awareness-raising sessions for all parliamentarians so as to increase their knowledge of minorities and Indigen­ous peoples and the particular prob­lems they face, and ensure that min­ority and Indigenous issues are main­streamed into parliamentary work, especially at the committee level;


   (iv) allocate sufficient resources to the task of establishing dialogue between minority/ Indigenous peoples and public institutions and to parlia­mentary committees to allow them to carry out effective outreach activities such as public hearings with minority and Indigenous peoples; and


   (v) increase parliaments' familiarity with work being done within the United Nations system so as to equip them better to hold governments to account for their international commitments, including the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, urge ratification of International Labour Organisation Convention 169 on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples, hold debates in parliament on the conclusions and recommendations made by the United Nations human rights treaty bodies and special mechanisms with regard to minority and Indigenous peoples' rights;


(f) the Chiapas Declaration also affirmed the responsibility of political parties to promote the effective participation of minorities and Indigenous peoples, and address their concerns in their party programs; and


(g) the IPU will facilitate networking among parliaments on this issue, monitor the implementation of the Chiapas Declaration and convene a follow-up meeting within two years to discuss progress and set targets for future action;


(2) urges the Government, parliamentarians, and political parties to familiarise themselves with the Chiapas Declaration; and


(3) calls upon the Government to facilitate a roundtable discussion with representatives of Australian Indigenous communities on issues arising from the Chiapas Declaration. (Notice given 19 June 2012.)

"Cobb, John, MP",Nats,2012-08-15,"



Mr JOHN COBB
 (Calare) (18:38):  I rise to speak on the Illegal Logging Prohibition Bill 2011. The coalition is committed to addressing the trade of illegally sourced timber and timber products—in fact, it was coalition policy at the 2010 election. The need for action is driven by a number of factors, including environmental concerns regarding indiscriminate or poorly controlled logging activities. In addition, under the current legislative regime the Australian forest sector, which is globally recognised for its forest management regulation and practices, suffers a competitive disadvantage through compliance costs borne locally but not observed by illegal loggers. So the intent of this bill is well placed. But, not surprisingly, the government has again bungled the delivery of the policy on which both sides of politics agree.


It is not reasonable for the government to bring these measures into law without giving our trading partners, our domestic timber industry and timber importers the time they were promised to design and implement appropriate systems. So, as a result of the government's incompetence, I am forced to move an amendment. I foreshadow that the coalition will do so at the consideration in detail stage. This amendment will delay the commencement date of the legislation and regulation making power to 1 July 2015. The additional time is needed to satisfy the concerns of six of Australia's major timber trading partners that the subordinate regulations are not available to scrutinise at the time of the legislation passing. This will allow sufficient time for parliamentary scrutiny of the regulations before they take effect; scrutiny of the regulations by trading partners before they take effect; trading partners to implement systems to allow traceability and achieve compliance with the regulations and legislation; and Australian importers to design and implement processes for traceability and to demonstrate due diligence.


It is critical that we manage this transition through working closely with our trading partners. Unfortunately, the government plan to impose this arrogantly on our trading partners, in the same way they imposed the live export ban on Indonesia without any consultation, let alone adequate consultation. It is important to note that the current timber certification programs do not yet provide due diligence elements to their traceability certifications. For example, PEFC, the Program for the Endorsement of Forestry Certification, have announced that there are due diligence provisions being designed for their program. Therefore, current systems cannot simply be put in place to meet the requirements of the legislation and regulations.


The flawed consultation process has led to concerns amongst significant trading partners. The minority report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade confirms two major issues previously raised through the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee—concerns regarding the detail of the regulations. Hence the coalition position requiring the regulations to be referred to the RRAT for review. There has also been inadequate consultation with key stakeholders; hence the coalition position on extending the time of the onset of the legislation. Concerns regarding the ability of the government to develop the regulations in a timely manner and with adequate consultation were also raised in the minority report. The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry estimate that they can produce the regulations within six months, yet evidence submitted to the inquiry indicated that little progress had been made on the content of the regulations and that fundamental issues remain unsolved.


Internationally, a number of initiatives are currently in place, or under development, to assure the legality of international trade in timber and timber products. Work is being undertaken at the importation and exportation ends of the supply chain. Information on these initiatives was provided in the report by the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee on the exposure draft and explanatory memorandum of the Illegal Logging Prohibition Bill 2011. The United States and the European Union have developed policies and regulations to combat illegal logging and associated trade. A number of key producer countries, including Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, are developing legality certification, chain-of-custody and forest certification schemes in response to mounting pressure from consumer countries to demonstrate the legality of their timber products.


By way of background as to the intent of the bill, the bill prohibits the importation and sale of all timber products containing illegally logged timber; prohibits the processing of illegally harvested, domestically grown raw logs; requires importers of regulated timber products and processors of raw logs to comply with due diligence requirements; requires the accurate description of legally logged timber products for sale in Australia; establishes enforcement powers and offences and imposes penalties; and provides for a review of the first five years of the operation of the act.


Turning to the proposed amendment to the legislation and issues raised by the coalition in the committee report, it is recommended that the legislation be amended to state that the legislation not take effect until the regulations are tabled and accepted by the parliament. The time afforded by delaying the enactment of the legislation could be better utilised by the government to complete what have been inadequate negotiations with our timber trading partners, develop capacity building measures in developing nations in particular, and provide clarity around the regulations, assessment of products and a list of regulated products.


We should increase Australia's outreach support for prohibiting the importation or processing of illegally logged timber. The coalition believes efforts must be intensified to effectively build capacity in countries supplying our markets. The coalition acknowledges the initiatives of countries such as Indonesia where legality assurance programs have been developed, and acknowledges Australian funded programs such as the Asia Pacific Forestry Skills and Capacity Building Program, but more must be done. The coalition maintains that, without support and ongoing diligence, the integrity and reach of verification programs may suffer. It is sobering to consider the World Bank's advice that most illegally logged timber has legitimate documentation attached to it.


The recommendation to actively pursue nation-to-nation arrangements to minimise the impact of the legislation on trade and cost highlights the need for the government to undertake high-level negotiations with countries currently exporting timber products to Australia to identify and recognise legislation or certification or other processes which contribute to the demonstration of due diligence as required by the legislation. I refer to the article 'Jakarta tires of Canberra's ""dysfunction""' in the Australian Financial Review of 6 March 2012.


Specific attention must be given to aged stock, bespoke, antique and recycled materials. There is potentially significant complexity around these materials, and the legislation does not currently consider how they will be handled. If these items are to be included as regulated products, a clear demarcation is required to permit products made or timber harvested before a specified date. I commend the bill.

"Chester, Darren, MP",Nats,2012-08-15,"



Mr CHESTER
 (Gippsland) (18:47):  I take pleasure in joining this debate on the Illegal Logging Prohibition Bill 2011 and particularly in following on from the member for Calare. As the member correctly indicated, it is unreasonable of the government to seek to bring changes into law without full consultation with our domestic timber industry and also our trading partners. Like the previous speaker, I believe that more time is required to get these changes right. As the member correctly indicated, the policy position taken to the last election by the coalition was that we supported efforts to reduce the impact of illegal logging, particularly on the Australian domestic timber industry. But out of respect to our international trading partners but also—and more importantly, from my personal perspective—out of respect for the domestic industry we need to take time to get this right. As we have found with this government, the devil is always in the detail. There is no argument on this side of the House, I believe, with the principle of pursuing the noble goal of eliminating or at least reducing the impact of illegal logging, but there is concern that we still have not seen any of the details in relation to the regulations and how these will impact on our trading partners and the domestic industry.


There is a great interest in my electorate in this issue because my electorate of Gippsland is one of the few remaining communities in Australia which has survived the death of a thousand cuts imposed by state Labor governments and their partners in the Greens. I do not say that lightly and I do not say it, in any sense, as a way of trying to score political points. But the Greens' influence on the Labor Party at state level has devastated the Australian native hardwood timber industry, and the community of Gippsland, in East Gippsland in particular, has suffered more than most.


Yet, throughout almost 20 years of what I would argue have been unreasonable cuts in relation to access to the resource, the industry has managed to survive, and in small pockets it has managed to prosper. I can report quite favourably in relation to several of the operators in my electorate that I have had the recent opportunity to inspect—both with the Leader of the Nationals and also, just a couple of weeks ago, with the Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, the member for Braddon. I would like to report to the House that, far from the image of the timber industry that the Greens and some of the inner-city lefties in the Labor Party like to portray, and far from the image they would like to portray of it destroying massive swathes of the Australian wilderness for the sake of creating paper, the reality of the Australian timber industry is something far different. The modern timber mill, for example in my electorate—



Mr John Cobb interjecting—




Mr CHESTER:
  and also in the member for Calare's electorate, is a mix between a processing facility and a manufacturing facility. In my electorate, there is enormous effort being put in by the timber industry to focus on adding value to this precious natural resource, and there have been major investments made over many years to secure the best possible outcome for the Australian people from the resource that we have available to us. The examples in my electorate to which I would like to draw the attention of the House are the Fenning mill in Bairnsdale, which I visited quite recently with the Leader of the Nationals, and also the Australian Sustainable Hardwoods mill at Heyfield, to which the member for Braddon accompanied me quite recently.


These timber mills now operate in a way which I think would take many people by surprise. There are members of the workforce in these mills who hardly touch a log. These are quite high-tech operations now. They have invested enormously in modern technology, to the extent that they are getting the greatest possible yield out of every piece of timber and there is very little waste whatsoever.


One of the innovative techniques which I have been privileged to inspect in my electorate was a finger joining process. It is hard to describe in words, but it involves very short pieces of timber which, in the past, would either have been chipped or thrown into the furnace as wood waste. We are talking about quite short pieces—maybe even less than 50 centimetres—being, effectively, glued together into longer pieces of wood. The end product offers all the characteristics of—in fact it is stronger than—beams made out of a single piece of wood. It is quite extraordinary to see the process. It involves a range of robotics and production line techniques which I am not doing great justice to with my words. I encourage people to go and see how these finger joined products are put together.


That is just an example of how, in a mill such as that of Australian Sustainable Hardwoods in Heyfield, the industry is getting maximum value from this precious natural resource. There are a whole range of products being taken direct to market in finished form. For things such as staircases, the modern builder can rely on a timber mill providing them with the treads and rises to the exact specifications required. It is only then a matter—much like the IKEA flat pack—of going home and putting it together. The modern builder gets it pretty easy when products such as that are coming out of timber mills. The Australian timber industry is operating differently from the way the Australian Greens and some logging protesters would have you believe they operate. They are trying to add as much value as possible to this precious resource. 


That industry is operating right now in a very heavily regulated environment. There are exhaustive certification processes through which they can prove the sustainability of the resource they are harvesting. But they are often competing against imported products made from timber which is, to say the least, of dubious origin. It might come from illegal harvesting in foreign nations or it might involve a process which is not environmentally sustainable. So I do support, in principle, the efforts to tighten up the trade in illegally harvested timber. I think there would be many benefits to the domestic market. Having said that, I repeat my initial concerns and those aired by the member for Calare, that this government has failed to consult with the industry and has failed to produce the regulations or give any detail whatsoever about how this legislation will operate in the real world. 


This issue of cheap imported products is only one of the challenges facing the Australian timber industry. As I mentioned earlier, the policy directions taken by state governments, influenced by the extreme views of the Greens, have been an issue. But resource security is, I think, the key issue facing the industry. I reflected just before on the amount of investment which has occurred in the Gippsland timber industry in recent years. The continuation of that level of investment will require resource security. The people who are going to invest in the future of the timber industry need to know they are going to be able to access this resource for many years to come. You cannot make business decisions based on resource allocations which might change at the whim of a government influenced by the latest protest activity of the Greens. 


I think the Australian Labor Party would do well to reflect tonight on their relationship with the Australian Greens, particularly when it comes to the issue of the Australian timber industry. The workers in the timber mills throughout Australia expect more from the Australian Labor Party on resource security. I say to the Labor Party that, if you cosy up to the Australian Greens, you will never have a place in the hearts and minds of the working people of Australia, particularly those in our traditional industries—those in Australian timber mills. I call on the government to reflect for a moment at least on the legislative arrangements they have put in place at state level which have compromised the timber industry throughout Australia. 


I note the arrival in the chamber of the member for Braddon. I take this opportunity to thank him for visiting Gippsland. I mentioned just before, Member for Braddon, that you had been to my region and had been to the Australian Sustainable Hardwoods mill in Heyfield. I greatly appreciated the time you put into coming to Gippsland. Your visit was appreciated by the workers and I think the mill owners in particular appreciated your enthusiasm for the activities going on there. 


The mill at Heyfield now processes 150,000 cubic metres of hardwood timber per year. For those who do not follow the timber industry closely, that amount could end up being the entire annual production out of Tasmania if the current agreement goes through. That is a disturbing trend. I worry about the future of industries in Tasmania when we get ourselves in the position where one mill in Gippsland is going to produce output equivalent to that of the entire state of Tasmania.


The opposition is not being churlish in objecting to this legislation or in putting forward the amendments which will be distributed. We are not being churlish—we are concerned that the government is expecting this side of the House to take them on trust. But I am afraid the well has run dry. There is no reservoir of trust or goodwill to draw on anymore for those on this side of the House when it comes to this government. This is, after all, a government led by a Prime Minister who said before the last election that there would be no carbon tax under a government she led.




Mr John Cobb:
  She didn't say that, did she?




Mr CHESTER:
  Yes, Member for Calare, that is correct. She did say that. 




Mr Kelvin Thomson:
  He has run out of things to say.




Mr CHESTER:
  I cannot believe that the government would expect this side of the House to take them on trust when they are led by a Prime Minister who was prepared to rule out a carbon tax before the last election—to say one thing before the election and do the complete opposite afterwards. 


I note that the member for Melbourne, I believe, suggested I had already run out of things to say. That is an interesting comment from a man who is cosying up to the Greens and prepared to sacrifice jobs in traditional industries in communities like Gippsland but who then seeks to come in here and have a go at a member who actually represents workers in the timber industry.




Mr Sidebottom:
  He is the Greens member.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  Order! Please continue, Member for Gippsland.




Mr CHESTER:
  I am sorry, I think—




Mr Sidebottom:
  He is confused.




Mr CHESTER:
  I must correct my error from my moment of confusion. It was not the member for Melbourne at all. It was the member for Wills. Is that right?




Mr John Cobb:
  He is just about a Green.




Mr CHESTER:
  The member for Wills could not make it in time to join in the debate but now criticises those who seek to fill in when the Labor Party cannot furnish a speaker for this debate. I do find it amusing that anyone on that side would criticise a member on this side for being prepared to speak on their behalf.

For those who do not follow the timber industry closely, that amount could end up being the entire annual production out of Tasmania if the current agreement goes through. That is a disturbing trend. I worry about the future of industries in Tasmania when we get ourselves in the position where one mill in Gippsland is going to produce output equivalent to that of the entire state of Tasmania.


The opposition is not being churlish in objecting to this legislation or in putting forward the amendments which will be distributed. We are not being churlish—we are concerned that the government is expecting this side of the House to take them on trust. But I am afraid the well has run dry. There is no reservoir of trust or goodwill to draw on anymore for those on this side of the House when it comes to this government. This is, after all, a government led by a Prime Minister who said before the last election that there would be no carbon tax under a government she led.




Mr John Cobb:
  She didn't say that, did she?




Mr CHESTER:
  Yes, Member for Calare, that is correct. She did say that. 




Mr Kelvin Thomson:
  He has run out of things to say.




Mr CHESTER:
  I cannot believe that the government would expect this side of the House to take them on trust when they are led by a Prime Minister who was prepared to rule out a carbon tax before the last election—to say one thing before the election and do the complete opposite afterwards. 


I note that the member for Melbourne, I believe, suggested I had already run out of things to say. That is an interesting comment from a man who is cosying up to the Greens and prepared to sacrifice jobs in traditional industries in communities like Gippsland but who then seeks to come in here and have a go at a member who actually represents workers in the timber industry.




Mr Sidebottom:
  He is the Greens member.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  Order! Please continue, Member for Gippsland.




Mr CHESTER:
  I am sorry, I think—




Mr Sidebottom:
  He is confused.




Mr CHESTER:
  I must correct my error from my moment of confusion. It was not the member for Melbourne at all. It was the member for Wills. Is that right?




Mr John Cobb:
  He is just about a Green.




Mr CHESTER:
  The member for Wills could not make it in time to join in the debate but now criticises those who seek to fill in when the Labor Party cannot furnish a speaker for this debate. I do find it amusing that anyone on that side would criticise a member on this side for being prepared to speak on their behalf.

"Baldwin, Bob, MP",LP,2012-08-15,"



Mr BALDWIN
 (Paterson) (19:00):  It is with great sadness that I advise the House of the death of Stephen Forgacs, managing director of Forgacs, from a melanoma related cancer on Tuesday, 24 July 2012.


Stephen's life is an amazing story of determination and dedication. As a young man, in 1956, Stephen was forced to flee from his native Hungary, which had just been invaded. Soldiers from the Soviet Union surrounded the huge engineering factory in Ganz where he worked as fitter and turner. All Stephen could hear was the sound of random gunfire as Soviet tanks rolled through Hungarian streets.


At the age of 20, Stephen and his soon to be wife, Gizelle, with only the clothes on their backs, joined the mass exodus as thousands headed for the Austrian-Hungarian border—14,000 Hungarians were killed and 200,000 were injured. In the Austrian refugee camp it was survival of the fittest. Along with Gizelle, Stephen had a simple but defining choice to make—Canada or Australia. His life defining moment was to board a ship headed for Australia.


From the Bonagilla refugee camp near Albury, Steve hitchhiked to Newcastle, an industrial town, trying to get work to feed his family because by now the couple's first child, Pam, had been born. Despite speaking no English he secured a job at BHP. He had no role models, no benefactors and no mentors. He was his own man and he lived life his way.


He joined Ullman Engineering in Newcastle as a machinist, and in 1962 Stephen bought Ullman and went on to build Forgacs Engineering, a business which is today one of Australia's largest privately owned shipbuilding, repair and heavy engineering companies. It is a company we are rightly proud of in the Hunter, an internationally competitive company headquartered in Newcastle.


The business that Stephen built went on to acquire some of east coast Australia's most sought after marine sites and infrastructure in the 1980 and 1990s. Today it employs 1,250 people at seven major industrial sites and shipyards in New South Wales and Queensland. Forgacs refits super cruise liners at its Brisbane graving dock and manufactures mining truck bodies in Gladstone and rail locomotive underframes in Newcastle. It is also a major supplier of Air Warfare Destroyer modules to the Australian Defence Force.


Stephen understood that the key to a successful business is to reach the optimum balance between the best possible working conditions and remaining internationally competitive. When Forgacs took over the Newcastle shipyard and floating dock in 1987, several unions represented workers there. Stephen negotiated with the Painters and Dockers Union and others so that it would become a one union site—a groundbreaking move that ensured the most efficient way forward.


Stephen never forgot his early days as a tradesman. His mantra was: 'Nothing works like hard work, but everyone needs an opportunity.' This commitment of Stephen's is evidenced by Forgacs now indenturing approximately 120 apprentices company-wide—more than 10 per cent of the company's workforce.


As per Stephen's wishes, the company is taking a 'business as usual' approach, driving forward to continue the significant company growth we have seen in recent years. Projects such as the building of 44 Air Warfare Destroyer modules at Newcastle and Tomago for our ADF will see Forgacs extremely busy for the foreseeable future.


Often considered a nonconformist by his peers, Stephen was an individual with strong convictions and high principles. He saw opportunities where others had failed. Stephen's secret was to keep it simple—and it succeeded. Stephen never sought recognition. However, in 2010 he was honoured with both the Manufacturer of the Year award and the Manufacturing Person of the Year award.


While Stephen has given much to Newcastle and Australia, he was always a proud Hungarian and a strong advocate for his country of birth and its people. Stephen and his wife, Gizelle, had nothing when they came to Australia in 1956 except energy and a burning desire to improve their lot. Over many years Stephen has gone out of his way to ensure many of his Hungarian countrymen in Australia had a better start in this country than he and Gizelle had to endure. Again, he sought no praise for this assistance.


One of Stephen's last plaintive requests of the doctor was to make him better so that he could go to work again. Stephen maintained his dignity and quiet resignation to the end. Stephen is survived by his wife, Gizelle; their three children, Pam Farragher, Elizabeth Burgess and Stephen Peter Forgacs; and his grandchildren. May he rest in peace. He has been an outstanding contributor to the Hunter.

Mr BALDWIN
 (Paterson) (09:31):  I rise to draw attention to an opportunity for tourism and hospitality businesses to finally get a straight answer on the carbon tax. After wasting $50 million on propaganda to sell its deeply unpopular and damaging carbon tax and refusing to allow Tourism Research Australia to undertake sector-specific analysis, the government has agreed to let the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission host an interactive webinar on the carbon tax. The online webinar will take place tomorrow, Thursday, 16 August, between 10 and 11 am AEST, and will be hosted by the ACCC Deputy Chair, Dr Michael Schaper. The commission's media release, issued three days ago, states:


The ACCC is encouraging small business owners to get their questions ready and sign-up now at www.accc.qov.au/carbon …


The ACCC will be providing guidance on carbon price claims and addressing some of the key small business issues which have arisen since 1 July.


This is welcome news indeed, albeit with three days notice. My advice to the ACCC is to prepare itself for some seriously challenging questions from a range of industry segments such as: restaurateurs, who need advice on how they 'pass on' the carbon tax input costs where they dispose of spoiled food that never reaches a plate; adventure tourism operators such as dolphin-watching vessel operators in the seat of Gilmore using diesel fuel, but with no subsidy like that given to the Great Barrier Reef operators; heavy-vehicle users such as tour groups and caravan owners, who are worried about the scheduled end to the exemption for private vehicle fuel in 2014; hotel operators, who are expecting significant increases to costs related to air-conditioning, cleaning and lighting; regional airlines, who are concerned about the combined cost of the carbon tax with loss of the Remote Air Subsidy Scheme and increased airport security costs; bus operators, who have a compelling case for exemption from this counterproductive tax since a full bus can take scores of cars off the road. Big business can usually employ corporate social responsibility managers to investigate best practice and drive outcomes through crossfunctional teams. It is much harder for the 90 per cent of Australia's 350,000 tourism businesses who are either sole traders or small business operators. I note the ACCC's claim in its news release that it is 'generally confident businesses understand their obligations'. The special carbon tax edition of the Gold Coast Business Bulletin, published only last month, should encourage the ACCC to rethink its perception. This edition was published, in the editor's words, specifically because of 'the dark shroud of uncertainty and misunderstanding that has cloaked the introduction of the carbon tax'. I seek leave to table this document. (Time expired)

Mr DREYFUS (

Isaacs

Cabinet Secretary, Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and Parliamentary Secretary for Industry and Innovation
) (
09:40
):  I rise today to express my disappointment at the savage cuts to TAFE and technical education currently being implemented in Victoria. The Baillieu Liberal government is cutting $300 million from TAFE—




Mr Broadbent interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The member for McMillan is being disorderly.




Mr DREYFUS:
  at a time when it is more important than ever to invest in technical education. These cuts are so harsh that even the responsible Victorian minister, Peter Hall, said that he considered resigning in protest of his own government's decision. The short-sightedness of these cuts is staggering. Cutting training and technical education at a time when business and manufacturers need skilled workers is a false economy. The estimated job losses for TAFE institutes may be as many as 1,500 positions, with many more across the training sector. 




Mr Broadbent interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for McMillan might be heading out of the Federation Chamber if he continues to interject.




Mr DREYFUS:
  Losing these dedicated and experienced staff members, some of whom have been teaching for decades, is a real blow to the quality of our technical education. As these cuts are implemented and technical education is stripped back to a bare minimum, business may have to look overseas to find the workers that they need. The cuts include the complete removal of the funding differential paid to TAFEs. This funding provided essential community services, support for TAFE's large infrastructure costs and essential training to small rural communities. Funding rates for all training providers have been slashed from between $6.50 and $8 per student hour to less than $2 in courses such as business, hospitality, retail, customer service and event management. The Liberal minister has refused to rule out campus closures.


The savagery of these cuts is a taste of what will happen if the Liberal Party takes power nationally. The Liberals have already announced that they would cut $1.1 billion from trades training centres despite the member for Dunkley, Bruce Billson, apparently supporting the establishment of the Frankston trade training centre, saying, 'I believe the local community is going to benefit greatly from this technical college.' Despite his comments, the member for Dunkley has shamefully voted in this parliament against our government's investment in education and has supported the opposition's cuts to educational programs.


Last week at the local Chisholm TAFE in Frankston, students and teachers rallied against the Baillieu government's savage cuts and called on the local Liberal members of parliament to stand up for their community and support investment in technical education. Chisholm faces cuts to their bottom line of up to $25 million and many courses will be axed. When I visit schools in my electorate I meet bright young students who want to be nurses or electricians or carpenters or business managers, and the Baillieu government's decision is going to make it tougher for them to realise their dreams. The investments in skills and training that our government has made will continue, but it is heartbreaking to see TAFEs in our state damaged by the reckless and short-sighted policies of the Baillieu government and I call on that government to reverse these cuts.

"Truss, Warren, MP",Nats,2012-08-15,"



Mr TRUSS
 (Wide Bay—Leader of The Nationals) (10:03):  The Maritime Legislation Amendment Bill 2012 implements three unrelated changes to maritime regulation in Australia. Firstly, the bill amends the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983 to implement amendments to annexes IV, V and VI of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, better known as the MARPOL convention. Australia has been a member of the IMO since it was established in 1948 and has played an active role in the development of its conventions and treaties over many years. The six annexes to the MARPOL convention and their amendments have been implemented in a bipartisan way over many years. On 15 July 2012 the Marine Environment Protection Committee of the IMO adopted the amendments which we are presently considering, and I understand that they will come into force internationally on 1 January 2013. The three annexes amended by the current legislation involve prevention of pollution by sewage, annex IV; the prevention of pollution by garbage, annex V; and the prevention of pollution by air, annex VI.


Dealing first with annex IV of the MARPOL convention, these amendments impose new restrictions on the discharge of sewage from passengers ships in special areas of the sea which are particularly sensitive or vulnerable to pollution. Under annex IV, only the Baltic Sea is considered a special area, and so that is the area affected by this change.


Annex V deals with the prevention of pollution by garbage. This second group of amendments impose restrictions on the discharge of garbage by ships of any nationality in the parts of the sea that are within Australia's territorial jurisdiction, and on the discharge of garbage by Australian ships in all seas, in accordance with the changes to annex V of the convention. The new annex V has not been changed in terms of the types of vessels it applies to but has been strengthened, particularly for garbage discharge in special areas, and broadened to prohibit discharge of plastic.


Special areas in relation to annex V are the Mediterranean Sea, the Baltic Sea area, the Black Sea area, the Red Sea, the gulfs area, the North Sea, the wider Caribbean region and the Antarctic area. Common sense exceptions are permitted in certain circumstances and include: water used for washing the deck of external surfaces if the cleaning agents are not harmful to the environment; cargo residues; and animal carcasses. It should be noted that Australia already has mandatory requirements for livestock management in shipping, including requirements for the disposal of animal carcasses. Fishing equipment may also be discarded where it is for the protection of the marine environment or the safety of the ship or the crew. It should be noted that many Australian shipowners and operators already follow a policy of not discharging waste at sea other than food waste in some circumstances. This practice is fully consistent with the revised annex V. The amendments also expand the requirement to hold a garbage management plan and the garbage management book to fixed and floating platforms.


Annex VI deals with prevention of pollution by air. The bill makes mandatory the current voluntary energy efficiency design index for new ships of 400 gross tonnes and over that are engaged in international trade. This will only apply to new ships on 1 January 2013, or to certain ships that have undergone a major conversion. All existing ships will require a ship energy efficiency management plan, which is an operational document that can be implemented at little cost to industry.


The second element of the bill deals with so-called rollback provisions. The Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983 includes rollback provisions in relation to offences committed under the act within the sea under the state and territory jurisdictions. To clarify the operation of rollback provisions in the act the bill proposes to distinguish between two areas of the territorial sea by amending the act to stipulate that the area from three to 12 nautical miles off the territorial sea is termed the 'outer territorial sea'. This is the area for which the states and territories have no power to legislate in relation to an incident. The landward side of the outer territorial sea that covers the area from the territorial sea baseline to the first three nautical miles out to sea is called the 'sea near a state', the 'sea near the Jervis Bay Territory' and the 'sea near an external territory'. This is the area for which the states and territories will be able to exercise jurisdiction. If they have no applicable laws, the Commonwealth will have jurisdiction. The amendment will clarify which level of government has jurisdiction over particular sea areas and will prevent Commonwealth legislation from prevailing over state and territory jurisdictions.


Finally, schedule 2 of the bill repeals the Stevedoring Levy (Imposition) Act 1998 and the Stevedoring Levy (Collection) Act 1998, which are redundant as the stevedoring levy ceased in May 2006. The stevedoring levy was introduced during the waterfront dispute in 1998 to help facilitate the restructure of our ports, to improve productivity and to address overmanning. The government of the time established a wholly owned Commonwealth company called the Maritime Industry Finance Company, or MIFCO, which established a $250 million loan facility to pay stevedoring employees their redundancy entitlements.


This loan amount was then recovered from P&O Automotive & General Stevedoring and Patrick through a levy on the loading and unloading of containers and vehicles in Australia.


Successive independent reports to the former coalition governments, including by the Productivity Commission and the Industry Commission, concluded at the time that stevedoring was an impediment to our competitiveness as a nation. Our wharves were an international embarrassment and the prior Labor government had simply allowed our waterfronts to be the fiefdom of the union movement. Strong action was necessary to turn our waterfront into an efficient and reliable workplace. The coalition government backed employers who also wanted changes. Strong action was certainly needed. As a result of this action, waterfront productivity was greatly improved, with crane movement rates rising from 16.9 per hour in 1996 to 27.7 in June 2007. We moved from the bottom area of developed countries in efficiency on our wharves to close to the top.


Sadly, however, productivity on our wharves has now waned again, with container loading rates again in decline. The government has again surrendered to the union bosses and so it is no real wonder that the productivity level is again on the decline. Is it any wonder that port authorities are now resorting to automated and driverless unloading systems? An independent report released in June 2012 found that wages in Australian ports have been increasing ahead of productivity. The data suggests that the productivity gains which occurred under the former coalition government between 1998 and 2003 have largely dissipated—and that is tragic. This echoes the ACCC's advice from November 2011 that the benefits of labour market reforms are likely to have been exhausted several years ago.


As I noted earlier, the stevedoring levy ceased operation in 2006, with its task completed, but our focus on waterfront productivity and reform should not cease. Our ports are our gateway to the world market, and it is vital that they are productive, efficient and internationally competitive. I thought about whether we should keep MIFCo for another round of reform but I concluded that the next round of reform will probably need to be done differently and a MIFCo structure is unlikely to be necessary. The coalition has taken time to consult with industry about their views on the bill, and industry have raised no objections. The measures contained within the Maritime Legislation Amendment Bill 2012 are largely uncontroversial and as such the coalition will be supporting the bill.

Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (10:13):  I thank the member for Wide Bay for some parts of his contribution, but I certainly would take issue with some of this earlier comments. I do agree that productivity for a trading nation is most important and it is something I particularly worry about. As every economist would say, with productivity flatlining for the last 10 to 12 years—and productivity is a real indication of whether the engine of the nation is humming—we do need to do more. I also acknowledge Deputy Speaker Scott sitting in the chair. It is always good to speak before you and I hope you continue in that seat for a long time.


I rise to support the Maritime Legislation Amendment Bill 2012. This year the federal Labor government has introduced into the parliament a suite of bills that represents the most significant overhaul of Australia's maritime industry since 1912, which I think might be before the member for Longman was born, but I am not sure. This side of the House has introduced the national law bills to establish a single national marine safety regulator in Australia, and the government's Stronger Shipping for a Stronger Economy legislative reforms. From 1 July, we have seen the commencement of this legislation, which is revitalising Australia's shipping industry. Furthermore, since coming to power in 2007, the Labor government has significantly improved the protection of Australia's marine environment.


The bill before the chamber is another substantive legislative instrument that is part of the government's record of ensuring that the laws that protect Australia's precious marine environment are up-to-date and remain in step with international developments. The bill also clarifies the application of federal laws in the parts of the territorial sea that lie between Australian baselines, which are generally at or near the shore, and three nautical miles out to sea from those baselines. For students of politics, a former member for Moreton back in the sixties spent a lot of time talking about this particular topic, but it is only a brief blip in today's legislative agenda.


In addition, the bill will repeal the Stevedoring Levy (Imposition) Act 1998 and the Stevedoring Levy (Collection) Act 1998 which relate to the former stevedoring levy. Payment of this levy in accordance with the two acts ceased in May 2006 and the two acts will no longer have any effect. The main amendments in this bill protect the marine environment and encourage energy efficiency in the shipping industry. The amendments will help achieve cleaner seas and fewer CO2 emissions from ships.


The federal Labor government has increased penalties for the discharge of oil or oil residues by ships in Australian waters from $220,000 to $11 million, banned the carriage or use of heavy grade oils on ships in the Antarctic area, legislated practices for ship-to-ship transfers of oil carried as cargo, and implemented incremental changes to the maximum sulphur level of marine fuel oil. All of these are important environmental advances. Like most Queenslanders, the protection of marine environments and marine life, both now and into the future, is something I am passionate about. In the 2010 election we saw, I would suggest, a misleading fear campaign about people's ability to fish. I have seen comments already indicating, because of the Coral Sea campaign, that there is going to be a campaign around this again at the next election. The reality is that the Labor government is protecting and nurturing fish and therefore protecting the jobs of the fishers but also the ability for recreational fishers to throw a line in.


The Coral Sea is globally recognised as an extremely important marine region, not only because of its unique biodiversity but also because of its important place in World War II history. Recent international studies have highlighted that the Coral Sea is one of the last remaining areas of the world's oceans where large-scale and biologically rich ecosystems remain relatively intact. I have been contacted by numerous groups and many of my constituents urging me to support increased protection for the Coral Sea. In fact, there is a postcard campaign throughout my electorate on this particular topic, so the people of Moreton realise that our precious oceans need to be protected. Preserving the Coral Sea is a rare opportunity for our generation and for this parliament, and this bill is another step to further protect our marine environments. Sadly, as the billions of people in the world have taken over lots of spaces, there are not too many protected and biologically unique places in the world anymore. This bill continues the government's comprehensive marine pollution prevention strategy. I commend the minister for his initiative and the great work that he has been doing in the maritime area generally. That is why I commend the bill to the House.

"Hunt, Greg, MP",LP,2012-08-15,"



Mr HUNT
 (Flinders) (10:18):  I am delighted to lend my support to the Maritime Legislation Amendment Bill 2012. This bill is the latest in a succession of steps for Australia to participate in and give effect to international provisions regarding the prevention of pollution from international and domestic maritime industries. Only last week I was at Phillip Island, in my electorate, meeting with people from the Phillip Island Nature Park. They have done work which is the practical face of the items intended by the bill.


The nature park, in conjunction with Victoria University, has developed what may well turn out to be the world's leading system for care, prevention and recovery of seabirds and other marine creatures that have been affected by the discharge of oil, diesel or other fuels. So, in the event of an accident, in the event of an incident, the fine grain ionic particles which they have developed would be sprinkled on a bird or animal where they are covered in oil or diesel or other maritime fuels. These are magnetic in nature and the university has developed a short magnetic stick or, as they call it, a wand, which they would then wave over—I participated in these trials—the skin or fur of the animal. The magnetic particles are in turn lifted off and, with that, bring the offending oil or diesel or other maritime fuel with them. This technology is the living embodiment of everything that these bills are meant to support and encourage, which is the care, protection and maintenance of our marine environment. 


I am completely supportive of, and utterly committed to, the broader notion of marine protection. I played a small role whilst we were in government in helping to advance this cause and also, more broadly, to look at cases such as those currently being developed by the Phillip Island Nature Park in conjunction with Victoria University. I happen to think that, if this technology is given support, it has the capacity to be a 21st century stump-jump plough for Australia. It will be Australian technology being used to try to deal with the consequences of marine accidents wherever they occur around the world. 


This bill is about preventing those sorts of incidents. To the extent that it extends and advances the implementation of the MARPOL convention and the entire marine apparatus, I am delighted to support it, but it is one part of three elements going forward. Firstly, we implement the conventions. Our approach has been well elevated and set out by the Leader of the National Party, Mr Truss, this morning. Secondly, we need to have these measures in place, particularly for care and maintenance where there are spills. Thirdly—and this is the last thing that I want to address so as not to detain the chamber—we still have an issue of ongoing shore based pollution, which is an extraordinary element of legacy waste in the 21st century. 


We use our coasts as dumping grounds for sewage around the country. We have well over 1,500 billion litres of waste water discharged off our coasts each year, every year. In Sydney, that includes primary treatment at Malabar Headland off Bondi and off the northern shores. We are effectively using our coasts as sewers, and that is a 19th century concept in the 21st century, and it simply cannot stand. We need a national ocean outfalls plan. This is something to which I have now been committed for many years. If we are in a position in government, we will work with the states to develop an ocean outfall plan so that each of these outfalls is cleaned up to an acceptable standard and that water is progressively recycled for industry and agriculture around the country. We are in a wet period at the moment, but the dry times will come again soon enough. To be wasting that water and to be discharging pollution off our coasts completely undermines, I think, the intention of this bill. How can it be that we are taking steps to ensure, as we should, that our maritime operations do not despoil the seas whilst, at the same time, discharging 1,500 gigalitres, 1,500 billion litres, of sullied water off our coasts each year, every year, forever?


I am delighted that the Gunnamatta outfall is about to be treated to tertiary level. Within the next year that process should be completed. In my own electorate, 150 billion litres of waste water have been discharged at a very polluted and unacceptable level. That is multiple times greater than any ship discharge. 


We can see that we have to take steps to prevent pollution occurring at sea, steps to allow for the clean-up and care and maintenance of those animals affected by sea-borne pollution and then we have to address the third part of the process—the extraordinary damage caused by 1,500 gigalitres, as well as the waste of water from that 1,500 gigalitres of sewage discharge around our oceans. We need to set time frames and targets to end that waste. I commend the bill and I thank the minister. It has our support but there are broader steps which we also need to take.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (10:25):  I thank members for their constructive comments on this legislation, including the contribution just made by the member for Flinders. This is important legislation. Pollution from ships is indeed a significant threat to our pristine marine environment. Shipping is a crucial part of the Australian transport system. Each year almost 4,000 ships transport goods to and from Australia, carrying 99 per cent by volume of Australia's imports and exports. This constitutes the world's fourth-largest shipping task. The increase in demand for Australia's exports and new resource developments means that Australia's sea freight task is likely to double by 2025. Ensuring that shipping can meet these demands safely and efficiently is crucial to Australia's economic prosperity.


This bill continues the government's efforts to protect the marine environment by enacting revised measures adopted at the Marine Environment Protection Committee of the International Maritime Organisation on 15 July 2011. Just last week I had the pleasure of having dinner with the new Secretary-General of the IMO in welcoming him to Australia. It was indeed an important recognition in the visit of the Secretary-General of the role that Australia plays in international maritime. 


The amendments in this bill reflect international best practice. The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships—MARPOL—is the key international convention addressing issues around the marine pollution from ships. It has six technical annexes dealing respectively with oil, noxious liquid substances in bulk, harmful substances in package forms, sewage, garbage and air pollution. The amendments to MARPOL, which enter into force on 1 January 2013 and which are reflected in this bill, will impose new restrictions on the discharge of sewage from passenger ships in special areas of the sea which are particularly sensitive or vulnerable to pollution, strengthen the regulations relating to the disposal by ships of garbage at sea by updating definitions and including new discharge requirements, and make mandatory an energy efficiency design index for new ships of 400 gross tonnage and over that will be built on or after 1 January 2013 for international trade, and a ship energy efficiency management plan from that date for all ships of 400 gross tonnage and over that are engaged in international trade.


The bill also clarifies the application of federal jurisdiction in the parts of the territorial sea that lie between Australian baselines which are generally at or near the shore and three nautical miles out to sea from those baselines, and repeals the Stevedoring Imposition Act 1998 and the Stevedoring Levy Collection Act 1998. These acts impose the stevedoring levy and are redundant as the stevedoring levy ceased in May 2006. This bill and others already before the parliament position Australia to make the most of our future as a shipping nation while ensuring that safety and the protection of our treasured marine environment is paramount. I commend this bill to the House.

"Truss, Warren, MP",Nats,2012-08-15,"



Mr TRUSS
 (Wide Bay—Leader of The Nationals) (10:03):  The Maritime Legislation Amendment Bill 2012 implements three unrelated changes to maritime regulation in Australia. Firstly, the bill amends the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983 to implement amendments to annexes IV, V and VI of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, better known as the MARPOL convention. Australia has been a member of the IMO since it was established in 1948 and has played an active role in the development of its conventions and treaties over many years. The six annexes to the MARPOL convention and their amendments have been implemented in a bipartisan way over many years. On 15 July 2012 the Marine Environment Protection Committee of the IMO adopted the amendments which we are presently considering, and I understand that they will come into force internationally on 1 January 2013. The three annexes amended by the current legislation involve prevention of pollution by sewage, annex IV; the prevention of pollution by garbage, annex V; and the prevention of pollution by air, annex VI.


Dealing first with annex IV of the MARPOL convention, these amendments impose new restrictions on the discharge of sewage from passengers ships in special areas of the sea which are particularly sensitive or vulnerable to pollution. Under annex IV, only the Baltic Sea is considered a special area, and so that is the area affected by this change.


Annex V deals with the prevention of pollution by garbage. This second group of amendments impose restrictions on the discharge of garbage by ships of any nationality in the parts of the sea that are within Australia's territorial jurisdiction, and on the discharge of garbage by Australian ships in all seas, in accordance with the changes to annex V of the convention. The new annex V has not been changed in terms of the types of vessels it applies to but has been strengthened, particularly for garbage discharge in special areas, and broadened to prohibit discharge of plastic.


Special areas in relation to annex V are the Mediterranean Sea, the Baltic Sea area, the Black Sea area, the Red Sea, the gulfs area, the North Sea, the wider Caribbean region and the Antarctic area. Common sense exceptions are permitted in certain circumstances and include: water used for washing the deck of external surfaces if the cleaning agents are not harmful to the environment; cargo residues; and animal carcasses. It should be noted that Australia already has mandatory requirements for livestock management in shipping, including requirements for the disposal of animal carcasses. Fishing equipment may also be discarded where it is for the protection of the marine environment or the safety of the ship or the crew. It should be noted that many Australian shipowners and operators already follow a policy of not discharging waste at sea other than food waste in some circumstances. This practice is fully consistent with the revised annex V. The amendments also expand the requirement to hold a garbage management plan and the garbage management book to fixed and floating platforms.


Annex VI deals with prevention of pollution by air. The bill makes mandatory the current voluntary energy efficiency design index for new ships of 400 gross tonnes and over that are engaged in international trade. This will only apply to new ships on 1 January 2013, or to certain ships that have undergone a major conversion. All existing ships will require a ship energy efficiency management plan, which is an operational document that can be implemented at little cost to industry.


The second element of the bill deals with so-called rollback provisions. The Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983 includes rollback provisions in relation to offences committed under the act within the sea under the state and territory jurisdictions. To clarify the operation of rollback provisions in the act the bill proposes to distinguish between two areas of the territorial sea by amending the act to stipulate that the area from three to 12 nautical miles off the territorial sea is termed the 'outer territorial sea'. This is the area for which the states and territories have no power to legislate in relation to an incident. The landward side of the outer territorial sea that covers the area from the territorial sea baseline to the first three nautical miles out to sea is called the 'sea near a state', the 'sea near the Jervis Bay Territory' and the 'sea near an external territory'. This is the area for which the states and territories will be able to exercise jurisdiction. If they have no applicable laws, the Commonwealth will have jurisdiction. The amendment will clarify which level of government has jurisdiction over particular sea areas and will prevent Commonwealth legislation from prevailing over state and territory jurisdictions.


Finally, schedule 2 of the bill repeals the Stevedoring Levy (Imposition) Act 1998 and the Stevedoring Levy (Collection) Act 1998, which are redundant as the stevedoring levy ceased in May 2006. The stevedoring levy was introduced during the waterfront dispute in 1998 to help facilitate the restructure of our ports, to improve productivity and to address overmanning. The government of the time established a wholly owned Commonwealth company called the Maritime Industry Finance Company, or MIFCO, which established a $250 million loan facility to pay stevedoring employees their redundancy entitlements.


This loan amount was then recovered from P&O Automotive & General Stevedoring and Patrick through a levy on the loading and unloading of containers and vehicles in Australia.


Successive independent reports to the former coalition governments, including by the Productivity Commission and the Industry Commission, concluded at the time that stevedoring was an impediment to our competitiveness as a nation. Our wharves were an international embarrassment and the prior Labor government had simply allowed our waterfronts to be the fiefdom of the union movement. Strong action was necessary to turn our waterfront into an efficient and reliable workplace. The coalition government backed employers who also wanted changes. Strong action was certainly needed. As a result of this action, waterfront productivity was greatly improved, with crane movement rates rising from 16.9 per hour in 1996 to 27.7 in June 2007. We moved from the bottom area of developed countries in efficiency on our wharves to close to the top.


Sadly, however, productivity on our wharves has now waned again, with container loading rates again in decline. The government has again surrendered to the union bosses and so it is no real wonder that the productivity level is again on the decline. Is it any wonder that port authorities are now resorting to automated and driverless unloading systems? An independent report released in June 2012 found that wages in Australian ports have been increasing ahead of productivity. The data suggests that the productivity gains which occurred under the former coalition government between 1998 and 2003 have largely dissipated—and that is tragic. This echoes the ACCC's advice from November 2011 that the benefits of labour market reforms are likely to have been exhausted several years ago.


As I noted earlier, the stevedoring levy ceased operation in 2006, with its task completed, but our focus on waterfront productivity and reform should not cease. Our ports are our gateway to the world market, and it is vital that they are productive, efficient and internationally competitive. I thought about whether we should keep MIFCo for another round of reform but I concluded that the next round of reform will probably need to be done differently and a MIFCo structure is unlikely to be necessary. The coalition has taken time to consult with industry about their views on the bill, and industry have raised no objections. The measures contained within the Maritime Legislation Amendment Bill 2012 are largely uncontroversial and as such the coalition will be supporting the bill.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2012-08-15,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (10:13):  I thank the member for Wide Bay for some parts of his contribution, but I certainly would take issue with some of this earlier comments. I do agree that productivity for a trading nation is most important and it is something I particularly worry about. As every economist would say, with productivity flatlining for the last 10 to 12 years—and productivity is a real indication of whether the engine of the nation is humming—we do need to do more. I also acknowledge Deputy Speaker Scott sitting in the chair. It is always good to speak before you and I hope you continue in that seat for a long time.


I rise to support the Maritime Legislation Amendment Bill 2012. This year the federal Labor government has introduced into the parliament a suite of bills that represents the most significant overhaul of Australia's maritime industry since 1912, which I think might be before the member for Longman was born, but I am not sure. This side of the House has introduced the national law bills to establish a single national marine safety regulator in Australia, and the government's Stronger Shipping for a Stronger Economy legislative reforms. From 1 July, we have seen the commencement of this legislation, which is revitalising Australia's shipping industry. Furthermore, since coming to power in 2007, the Labor government has significantly improved the protection of Australia's marine environment.


The bill before the chamber is another substantive legislative instrument that is part of the government's record of ensuring that the laws that protect Australia's precious marine environment are up-to-date and remain in step with international developments. The bill also clarifies the application of federal laws in the parts of the territorial sea that lie between Australian baselines, which are generally at or near the shore, and three nautical miles out to sea from those baselines. For students of politics, a former member for Moreton back in the sixties spent a lot of time talking about this particular topic, but it is only a brief blip in today's legislative agenda.


In addition, the bill will repeal the Stevedoring Levy (Imposition) Act 1998 and the Stevedoring Levy (Collection) Act 1998 which relate to the former stevedoring levy. Payment of this levy in accordance with the two acts ceased in May 2006 and the two acts will no longer have any effect. The main amendments in this bill protect the marine environment and encourage energy efficiency in the shipping industry. The amendments will help achieve cleaner seas and fewer CO2 emissions from ships.


The federal Labor government has increased penalties for the discharge of oil or oil residues by ships in Australian waters from $220,000 to $11 million, banned the carriage or use of heavy grade oils on ships in the Antarctic area, legislated practices for ship-to-ship transfers of oil carried as cargo, and implemented incremental changes to the maximum sulphur level of marine fuel oil. All of these are important environmental advances. Like most Queenslanders, the protection of marine environments and marine life, both now and into the future, is something I am passionate about. In the 2010 election we saw, I would suggest, a misleading fear campaign about people's ability to fish. I have seen comments already indicating, because of the Coral Sea campaign, that there is going to be a campaign around this again at the next election. The reality is that the Labor government is protecting and nurturing fish and therefore protecting the jobs of the fishers but also the ability for recreational fishers to throw a line in.


The Coral Sea is globally recognised as an extremely important marine region, not only because of its unique biodiversity but also because of its important place in World War II history. Recent international studies have highlighted that the Coral Sea is one of the last remaining areas of the world's oceans where large-scale and biologically rich ecosystems remain relatively intact. I have been contacted by numerous groups and many of my constituents urging me to support increased protection for the Coral Sea. In fact, there is a postcard campaign throughout my electorate on this particular topic, so the people of Moreton realise that our precious oceans need to be protected. Preserving the Coral Sea is a rare opportunity for our generation and for this parliament, and this bill is another step to further protect our marine environments. Sadly, as the billions of people in the world have taken over lots of spaces, there are not too many protected and biologically unique places in the world anymore. This bill continues the government's comprehensive marine pollution prevention strategy. I commend the minister for his initiative and the great work that he has been doing in the maritime area generally. That is why I commend the bill to the House.

"Hunt, Greg, MP",LP,2012-08-15,"



Mr HUNT
 (Flinders) (10:18):  I am delighted to lend my support to the Maritime Legislation Amendment Bill 2012. This bill is the latest in a succession of steps for Australia to participate in and give effect to international provisions regarding the prevention of pollution from international and domestic maritime industries. Only last week I was at Phillip Island, in my electorate, meeting with people from the Phillip Island Nature Park. They have done work which is the practical face of the items intended by the bill.


The nature park, in conjunction with Victoria University, has developed what may well turn out to be the world's leading system for care, prevention and recovery of seabirds and other marine creatures that have been affected by the discharge of oil, diesel or other fuels. So, in the event of an accident, in the event of an incident, the fine grain ionic particles which they have developed would be sprinkled on a bird or animal where they are covered in oil or diesel or other maritime fuels. These are magnetic in nature and the university has developed a short magnetic stick or, as they call it, a wand, which they would then wave over—I participated in these trials—the skin or fur of the animal. The magnetic particles are in turn lifted off and, with that, bring the offending oil or diesel or other maritime fuel with them. This technology is the living embodiment of everything that these bills are meant to support and encourage, which is the care, protection and maintenance of our marine environment. 


I am completely supportive of, and utterly committed to, the broader notion of marine protection. I played a small role whilst we were in government in helping to advance this cause and also, more broadly, to look at cases such as those currently being developed by the Phillip Island Nature Park in conjunction with Victoria University. I happen to think that, if this technology is given support, it has the capacity to be a 21st century stump-jump plough for Australia. It will be Australian technology being used to try to deal with the consequences of marine accidents wherever they occur around the world. 


This bill is about preventing those sorts of incidents. To the extent that it extends and advances the implementation of the MARPOL convention and the entire marine apparatus, I am delighted to support it, but it is one part of three elements going forward. Firstly, we implement the conventions. Our approach has been well elevated and set out by the Leader of the National Party, Mr Truss, this morning. Secondly, we need to have these measures in place, particularly for care and maintenance where there are spills. Thirdly—and this is the last thing that I want to address so as not to detain the chamber—we still have an issue of ongoing shore based pollution, which is an extraordinary element of legacy waste in the 21st century. 


We use our coasts as dumping grounds for sewage around the country. We have well over 1,500 billion litres of waste water discharged off our coasts each year, every year. In Sydney, that includes primary treatment at Malabar Headland off Bondi and off the northern shores. We are effectively using our coasts as sewers, and that is a 19th century concept in the 21st century, and it simply cannot stand. We need a national ocean outfalls plan. This is something to which I have now been committed for many years. If we are in a position in government, we will work with the states to develop an ocean outfall plan so that each of these outfalls is cleaned up to an acceptable standard and that water is progressively recycled for industry and agriculture around the country. We are in a wet period at the moment, but the dry times will come again soon enough. To be wasting that water and to be discharging pollution off our coasts completely undermines, I think, the intention of this bill. How can it be that we are taking steps to ensure, as we should, that our maritime operations do not despoil the seas whilst, at the same time, discharging 1,500 gigalitres, 1,500 billion litres, of sullied water off our coasts each year, every year, forever?


I am delighted that the Gunnamatta outfall is about to be treated to tertiary level. Within the next year that process should be completed. In my own electorate, 150 billion litres of waste water have been discharged at a very polluted and unacceptable level. That is multiple times greater than any ship discharge. 


We can see that we have to take steps to prevent pollution occurring at sea, steps to allow for the clean-up and care and maintenance of those animals affected by sea-borne pollution and then we have to address the third part of the process—the extraordinary damage caused by 1,500 gigalitres, as well as the waste of water from that 1,500 gigalitres of sewage discharge around our oceans. We need to set time frames and targets to end that waste. I commend the bill and I thank the minister. It has our support but there are broader steps which we also need to take.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2012-08-15,"



Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (10:25):  I thank members for their constructive comments on this legislation, including the contribution just made by the member for Flinders. This is important legislation. Pollution from ships is indeed a significant threat to our pristine marine environment. Shipping is a crucial part of the Australian transport system. Each year almost 4,000 ships transport goods to and from Australia, carrying 99 per cent by volume of Australia's imports and exports. This constitutes the world's fourth-largest shipping task. The increase in demand for Australia's exports and new resource developments means that Australia's sea freight task is likely to double by 2025. Ensuring that shipping can meet these demands safely and efficiently is crucial to Australia's economic prosperity.


This bill continues the government's efforts to protect the marine environment by enacting revised measures adopted at the Marine Environment Protection Committee of the International Maritime Organisation on 15 July 2011. Just last week I had the pleasure of having dinner with the new Secretary-General of the IMO in welcoming him to Australia. It was indeed an important recognition in the visit of the Secretary-General of the role that Australia plays in international maritime. 


The amendments in this bill reflect international best practice. The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships—MARPOL—is the key international convention addressing issues around the marine pollution from ships. It has six technical annexes dealing respectively with oil, noxious liquid substances in bulk, harmful substances in package forms, sewage, garbage and air pollution. The amendments to MARPOL, which enter into force on 1 January 2013 and which are reflected in this bill, will impose new restrictions on the discharge of sewage from passenger ships in special areas of the sea which are particularly sensitive or vulnerable to pollution, strengthen the regulations relating to the disposal by ships of garbage at sea by updating definitions and including new discharge requirements, and make mandatory an energy efficiency design index for new ships of 400 gross tonnage and over that will be built on or after 1 January 2013 for international trade, and a ship energy efficiency management plan from that date for all ships of 400 gross tonnage and over that are engaged in international trade.


The bill also clarifies the application of federal jurisdiction in the parts of the territorial sea that lie between Australian baselines which are generally at or near the shore and three nautical miles out to sea from those baselines, and repeals the Stevedoring Imposition Act 1998 and the Stevedoring Levy Collection Act 1998. These acts impose the stevedoring levy and are redundant as the stevedoring levy ceased in May 2006. This bill and others already before the parliament position Australia to make the most of our future as a shipping nation while ensuring that safety and the protection of our treasured marine environment is paramount. I commend this bill to the House.

"Moylan, Judi, MP",LP,2012-08-15,"



Mrs MOYLAN
 (Pearce) (11:22):  Sadly, on Monday 2 July 2012, Australia lost one of it finest young men when Sergeant Blaine Flower Diddams was killed in action in Afghanistan. Sergeant Diddams was doing what he was trained to do as a Special Air Service Regiment patrol commander in the Special Operations Task Group. He was deployed many times to several countries including Somalia, East Timor, the Solomon Islands and Afghanistan, and to Perth during CHOGM.


He was a career soldier and, indeed, he was on his seventh tour of duty to Afghanistan since 2001. In his short life, he had received many honours and awards. Those honours and awards include the Australian Act of Service Medal with Clasp Somalia, International Forces East Timor Medal, Afghanistan Campaign Medal, Australian Service Medal with Clasp Solomon Islands, Defence Long Service Medal, the Australian Defence Medal, NATO ISAF Medal, Meritorious Unit Citation, Infantry Combat Badge and Returned from Active Service Badge.


It was a sad and deeply moving occasion to attend the funeral service of Blaine Diddams and to hear the outpouring of love and affection from his family and friends. Although Blaine Diddams was born in Canberra, he was a member of the Special Operations Task Group from the Perth based Air Services Regiment, and he and his family lived in my electorate of Pearce.


I was not privileged to have personally known Sergeant Diddams but I did know some of his colleagues in the SAS and I know that he was held in the highest regard by all those who knew him and worked with him. I felt deeply moved by the tributes to Sergeant Diddams and the depth of concern his friends showed towards his family. Everyone who spoke at the funeral talked of his zest for life and he certainly achieved much and did a lot of living in his too-short life. I know his death was deeply felt by the SAS Regiment in Swanbourne. I express my deepest sympathy to the regiment and to the many other SAS colleagues who came from all over Australia to pay tribute to their mate.


Blaine Diddams was devoted to his loving family and is deeply mourned by them. Their loss is profound. Once again, I extend my heartfelt condolences to his wife, Toni-Ann; his children, Elle-Lou and Henry; his parents, Peter and Cate; and his sisters and brothers, Nikki, Sian, Christian and Luke. Lest we forget.

"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2012-08-15,"



Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter—Chief Government Whip) (11:26):  I join with the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, the Minister for Defence, indeed, the member for Pearce and all those who have made or will make a contribution to this condolence motion in extending my sympathies and condolences to the family of Sergeant Blaine Flower Diddams. We have now lost 34 Australians in Afghanistan—one serving with the UK forces, who gave his life in the period when I was defence minister—and it is 34 too many. We are, and will be, forever grateful for what Sergeant Diddams and those who fell before him have done in our uniform, in the name and in the interests of our country.


I still remain a firm believer in the Afghanistan mission. We are there for the right reasons and we are making real progress. The mission is not without its critics and, given the history of Afghanistan, the complexity of the campaign and the difficult challenges of the campaign, we are making a real difference. We are making a real difference on the security front, the governance front, building capacity in the justice system, building a police force as well as an Afghan National Army. We continue to build schools, bridges, roads, hospitals and things that make living in Afghanistan better and we are, of course, building a democracy, generally speaking, in that country. The work is far from complete. It will be a long time before we can claim that what we set out to achieve in Afghanistan is complete, but what is complete is the initial mission to ensure that Afghanistan no longer provides a safe haven and training ground for terrorists to perpetrate their acts of terror around the globe on all people living in our community of nations including, of course, Australians.


Sergeant Diddams, like every member of the ADF I have met, was obviously a committed person, obviously a very courageous person. As a member of the Special Operations Task Force, he was highly trained and very, very capable, a soldier with a lot of experience in the ADF and a person who had effectively given his life—not just literally but before the loss of his life—to the Australian Defence Force. We need to be very sure in this place that the life of Sergeant Diddams and those who have fallen before him have not been given in vain. We owe it to them and their families to continue the mission, to see the mission through and to complete all the objectives we set down for ourselves, not just when we first went into Afghanistan but those broader ambitions like capacity building that we embraced some time thereafter.


Again, my condolences go Blaine's widow, Toni-Ann; his daughter, Elle-Lou; his son, Henry; his parents, Peter and Cate; his siblings, Christian, Luke, Nikki and Sian; and all those who served closely with Sergeant Diddams throughout the course of his time serving the Australian Defence Force. We in this country owe him a great debt and today, in this place, we bestow upon him a great honour and say, 'Thank you, Sergeant Diddams, for your service.'

"Tudge, Alan, MP",LP,2012-08-15,"



Mr TUDGE
 (Aston) (11:30):  The toughest of tough soldiers, known as a hard hitter, Special Air Services Regiment Patrol Commander Sergeant Blaine Flower Diddams was also a tender, loving husband and father to his wife Toni-Ann, daughter Elle-Lou and son Henry. He was a valued friend who is sadly missed. His family and friends were of greatest importance to him. Described as totally devoted to his wife, children and extended family, Blaine's brothers and sisters also looked up to him as their hero long before he became a national hero. Didds, as they called him, was all that we cherish about the Australian spirit—a man who stood by his mates no matter what. The men who served side by side with him in the SASR were his brothers in every sense of the word. He was unreservedly dedicated to his mates and to his country. Known for his outgoing personality, quirky sense of humour and infectious enthusiasm, he was held in the highest regard by his mates and comrades alike. His friends became part of his family. Their loss, too, is acute and we in this place stand with them as well as Blaine's family as they seek to come to terms with their loss.


Raised in Canberra, Sergeant Diddams was a career soldier. He enlisted at 18 and by 24, when many are starting careers, he had passed the gruelling SAS selection course and been posted to the West, in Perth. As a Special Air Services Regiment patrol commander, Sergeant Diddams was a member of the Special Operations Task Group. The professionalism and the experience they built up working with other countries over many years is valued by coalition partners as they seek to bring security and stability to Afghanistan and the region.


I recently had the opportunity to observe firsthand the rigorous training that these cutting-edge forces undergo, and I can say without doubt that they are fit and capable in the extreme. 


One of their best, and a many times decorated SAS veteran, Blaine served his country in Somalia, East Timor and the Solomon Islands and did no fewer than seven tours of Afghanistan—leading with courage, skill, humour and balanced good sense.


Early on Monday morning, 2 July 2012, Sergeant Diddams was leading his Special Operations Task Group against insurgents when a round from an enemy AK47 took his life. Family and friends declared that Blaine Flower Diddams made the ultimate sacrifice doing what he truly loved. We thank him for his service to our nation and our deepest condolences go to his family.

"Kelly, Mike, MP",ALP,2012-08-15,"



Dr MIKE KELLY
 (Eden-Monaro—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (11:33):  We are again paying tribute to one of the proud and wonderful soldiers who have sacrificed their lives for our country in this difficult conflict in Afghanistan. It is one of the most important conflicts of the modern era and is in our national interest and the interests of our region. We have heard references to Sergeant Diddams's biography and background. He is a proud son of the ACT, born in the ACT in 1971. I served with Didds in Somalia. He was first and foremost a straight-legged infantryman who joined the Defence Force back in 1990, and his first posting was to 1st Battalion. He was deployed to Somalia with True Blue, 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment. He served there with great distinction, as did his comrades in 1RAR.


Even then, Didds was always known for his sense of humour. We take their military skills for granted—these are exceptional professionals—but if there is one quality that is extremely important in these types of environments it is the one Australians have long been known for and have long known: that sense of humour. He was an invaluable member of every unit, every subunit and every team he worked with because of that sense of humour.


Didds had an amazing career, serving not only in Somalia but in the Solomons and East Timor and in multiple deployments in Afghanistan. I have often thought when we have reflected on these lives that have been cut short, and when I have reflected on friends and colleagues that I myself have lost, that you do not judge the value of a life by its length. You judge the value of a life by how well it was lived, and by that standard Blaine Diddams lived a wonderful life, a life of great value. We should not believe that there was any waste to his life because it was cut short. On his last day he would have been able to say proudly to the world and to himself: 'I made a difference.' There is no more important thing you can say at end of a life than that.


There are many people alive today—men, women and children—in Somalia, in the Solomons, in Timor and in Afghanistan who all have cause to be grateful for the sacrifices, the effort and professional execution of his duties that Blaine Diddams managed to perform in all those environments. That is something that I think is not always greatly appreciated. We often see reports in the news of incidents in these places. You do not often see the effects, the results on the ground, that these service men and women are generating and have generated in those operations.


For Blaine, his time has ended. We know that the effect of these deaths on the families is huge, of course, and today we think of his wife, Toni-Ann, their daughter, Elle-Lou, and their son, Henry. Blaine was the eldest son of his parents, Pete and Cate, and a great brother to his siblings, Nikki, Sian, Christian and Luke. For them, the battle will just be beginning: to live with this loss.


We often neglect the side of the story about those who were wounded and did not lose their lives and about families who have to deal with that experience. I urge people to read a recent book written by David Finkel called The good soldiers, which really brings home the whole experience of the families and the wounded soldiers returning from, in that case, the Iraq war. It is something that motivates us to reach out to those families, to those members who have been wounded or who are suffering in other ways. In that sense I commend the work of a couple of fine young officers, John Bale and Cavin Wilson, who have set up a new venture called Soldier On, which is doing a wonderful job encouraging the community to reach out and play its part in supporting families and wounded soldiers to find endeavours they can engage in within the limits of their incapacities or injuries. It is doing a wonderful job, so I encourage all people to either donate to or get involved with this Soldier On venture.


But, as I say, Sergeant Blaine's family were proud of him and were able to say that Sergeant Blaine—Didds—died doing what he loved, what he believed in and in the company of those with whom he shared a special bond. I do not think there is any better way to go if you do meet your end. Certainly his comrades are going to struggle with his loss, but they are entirely motivated and dedicated to paying tribute to him by their continuing efforts in Afghanistan.


At this point in time I am the parliamentary secretary for the transition in Afghanistan, so I think it is important to reflect for a moment on the success that Sergeant Blaine Diddams and his colleagues, the men and women who are serving over there, have achieved. It is an incredibly difficult and challenging environment. It is challenging from the point of view of the physical environment and maintaining your basic health, but obviously there is also the challenge posed by the enemy, the Taliban, and the broader challenges of trying to stabilise a nation so that it will not be a threat to security in our region.


In that effort I have spent quite a bit of time on the ground in Afghanistan and in places like Washington, engaging with many experts and people who have been in the field, forming the best way forward not only to achieve success in Oruzgan but to make sure their efforts in Oruzgan and the immediate region that the special forces operate in is not wasted because of the deterioration of the national situation. We have often had this historical experience of Australians having provinces and doing a brilliant job, such as in Phuoc Tuy in Vietnam, in the Bay province that I was in in Somalia, in Al Muthanna in Iraq and now in Oruzgan in Afghanistan. We are determined to try to make sure that those sacrifices, those efforts, are not in vain. 


In these environments we know that it is not just a question of security operations; it is very much a matter of social, economic and political issues as well. We have committed not only to support security sector capacity building in Afghanistan but also, in these critical other areas of that social, economic and political space, to engage in the things that will be critical to stabilising this nation: road building, building of governance and rule of law capacity and ensuring the 2014 election goes smoother than the 2009 election, to build faith in legitimacy. In key areas we will ensure that the aid and development contributions we make from here land well in Afghanistan and are not subject to distortion or corruption and the like. That is going to be a critical challenge moving forward. 


Afghanistan is a country with great mineral wealth, worth between $1 trillion and $3 trillion, which will produce revenue to the government coming onstream in the next eight to 10 years. The challenge will be to help mentor them through that period to that point and also to make sure that the revenue that comes from those resources goes to the benefit of the Afghan people. 


I have a degree of optimism about the progress that is being made in other areas. The Afghan National Army has been the most successful piece of the national central governance story. It is performing much better than I think a lot of people would have expected. It is not just in Oruzgan province that that is a good story; it is right across the country. Certainly there are major threats that still remain to destabilise the situation—not just the Taliban. I really do not think that in the future they will pose an existential threat. There are issues internally in Afghanistan that will have to be managed through actors that sit outside the formal structures, and how that evolves in the future will be critical. 


There are quite a few success stories across the space of education, health and attitudes. When I was in Washington recently we were very fortunate at the Pentagon to get a briefing from the President of the Asia Foundation, David Arnold, who has produced the most extensive survey of Afghan attitudes ever undertaken—a face-to-face survey, approaching something like 7,000 Afghans. The interesting thing was that that survey of the population indicated that 82 per cent of respondents support the government's attempts to address the situation through negotiation. So they do support that effort. The level of sympathy for opposition groups has dramatically fallen over these last few years. Whereas there was some degree of sympathy, which amounted to something like 56 per cent in 2009, that has now fallen to about the 29 per cent mark, so the vast majority of the population have completely lost all sympathy for those who are opposing the government and ISAF. The majority of respondents are also very pleased and satisfied with the progress in areas of education for children and basic services—water for drinking, the ability to move safely in local areas, the availability of clinics and hospitals. But there are remaining concerns in relation to employment and levels of corruption. 


It is interesting to note that 73 per cent of respondents say that the government is doing a good job. That is quite an amazing statistic in the circumstances. Eighty-five per cent of them say the government is doing a good job in education, 68 per cent say health care is going well and 62 per cent say security is going well. This is very important. It obviously remains for us to address these key economic areas of employment and corruption, and that is very much of concern to them. They are very happy with governance not only at the national level but at the provincial level, although their concerns remain in relation to the municipal level of governance. 


So the challenge is there in that respect, but I think most pleasing were the attitudes revealed about women. Support for the principles of gender equality remains high, including equal rights under the law regardless of gender, ethnicity or religion—82 per cent was the figure there. Equal educational opportunities for women show 85 per cent support and there is 79 per cent support for women being allowed to stand up for their individual rights. While there are still pockets of conservatism, there has been great progress in human rights. I met with the Afghan head of their human rights organisation, Muhammad Musa, who has lived through the worst of things. He is a Hazara, and he is very pleased with the progress in that space and believes that Afghans really want to hang on to the gains they have made in human rights.


The only area where attitudes still lag in relation to women is in the employment of women. That is probably an attitude associated with the high levels of unemployment in Afghanistan. So there is a great deal to be satisfied with in the way things have evolved and matured in Afghanistan from the efforts of our outstanding soldiers, soldiers like Blaine Diddams.


Didds is someone who we are going to miss. There is no question about that. His skills and experience are not easily compensated in the value of what his career achieved on the ground. The motivation that he leaves behind for his colleagues will drive us to further success in Afghanistan. He now has contributed his own page to the most magnificent story that this nation has produced—the Anzac story. I am very pleased to see that the record of our SAS, which has long been unknown, has been the subject of a very extensive DVD production which we launched the other day over at the War Memorial. I think all Australians will be very proud, pleased and surprised at some of the information contained in there. It will be a great tribute to Didds and his colleagues in the regiment. We salute you, Didds. You will not be forgotten. We will take your example as a motivation for what we do from here.

Mr BALDWIN
 (Paterson) (11:47):  I join with the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and other distinguished colleagues in this House in commenting on the passing of Special Air Services Regiment Sergeant Blaine Diddams, who was tragically killed in Afghanistan on 2 July 2012. It was not until yesterday afternoon that I realised that Sergeant Diddams's parents, Peter and Cate, are from my electorate in Smiths Lake. I rang them, offered my sincere apologies for not contacting them earlier, expressed my condolences and asked if they could pass those on to his wife Toni-Ann, to his daughter Elle-Lou, to his son Henry, and to his siblings Nikki, Sian, Christian and Luke. 


This was a young man who led from the front. This was a young warrior who joined the Australian Defence Force at 19 years of age. This was a young warrior who saw more battle and conflict than most others. His contribution to the Australian effort on the broader international stage, like that of his colleagues, should never be underestimated.


One of the key things that people need to understand is that there is no braver action than to lay down your life for others. Sergeant Diddams joined our Defence Force and went into theatres of operation knowing full well the risks to him, the risks to his mates and, more importantly, the risk to the nation which houses his children, and he did so very distinguishably. I want to put on the record his operational record and his honours and awards so that in years to come his children in particular—his young daughter Elle-Lou and his son Henry—can look back and know this nation has honoured his personal sacrifice. His operational record started in January 1993 when he went on Operation Solace in Somalia. The Parliamentary Secretary Mike Kelly pointed out that he served with him in that process. From there Sergeant Diddams went to Operation Warden in East Timor in 2000, Operation Tanager in East Timor in 2000, then to Operation Trek in the Solomon Islands in 2002. 


He went to Operation Slipper in November 2001, and again in May 2007, again January 2008, again in May 2008, again in June 2009 and again in January 2011. He was involved in Operation Amulet for CHOGM in Perth in 2011 and then he returned to Operation Slipper in Afghanistan in February 2012.


For his very distinguished career, he has been awarded the Australian Active Service Medal, with Clasp Somalia, Clasp East Timor and Clasp ICAT. He has been awarded the International Forces East Timor Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the Australian Services Medal with Clasp Solomon Islands, Clasp CT/SR, the Defence Long Service Medal, the Australian Defence Medal, the NATO ISAF Medal, the Meritorious Unit Citation, Infantry Combat Badge and Returned from Active Service Badge. 


By any measure, this is a distinguished military hero. This, as I said, is a man who led from the front. He was not one to take a back seat. When he died on 2 July, he was in the processes in the Chora Valley where he led his team, which had just been dropped by helicopter, for a mission against an insurgent commander's compound in the Chora Valley in the Qala-e-Naw district. He was about 20 kilometres north of the provincial capital, Tarin Kowt, when, unfortunately and sadly, a high-powered round from an enemy AK-47 penetrated his chest armour and killed him.


As my colleague, the shadow minister for defence personnel, Stuart Robert, an ex-serving man himself, said, 'This was a soldier's death.' But death is never easy. It is never acceptable, but those in the military go into combat full knowing what the ramifications will be. But they go in with a very proud chest, knowing they are doing what is right and knowing they are making a contribution to making this place so much better.


Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to put on the record the family statement on behalf of Peter and Cate Diddams. When I spoke to Pete yesterday he said that all that they want to say has been posted on the Defence website, and they just need time to grieve. So the following statement is released at the request of Peter and Cate Diddams, the parents of Sergeant Blaine Diddams, who was tragically killed on operational service with the Special Operations Task Group in Afghanistan, on Monday, 2 July 2012. It says:


Today we lay to rest our eldest son Blaine, who died doing what he loved, what he believed in, in the company of those with whom he shared a special bond.


To Blaine he couldn't imagine doing anything else, he was living his dream and living it with pride and distinction.


Whilst we are devastated at his loss, we lovingly remember the man who was absolutely focused and driven to be the best he could be in everything he pursued, yet always with that wonderful sense of humour, boundless enthusiasm and perspective that will be sorely missed.


Blaine was totally devoted to his wife and children, to his extended family, and unreservedly dedicated to his mates and to his country.


Blaine's brothers and sisters all looked up to him as their hero long before he became a national hero.


As parents we are so very proud of Blaine; proud of what he stood for; proud of what he had achieved; proud of who he was.


Our grief has been tempered by the overwhelming expressions of sympathy and support we have received, and we are steeled to face the difficult days ahead by the knowledge that we do not grieve alone.


We would like to thank the Australian Defence Force for their efforts in supporting us through this traumatic time, and in particular the regimental family of the Special Air Service Regiment—the military family Blaine loved so much, and whose support has been unstinting.


Finally we ask that out of respect for Blaine and in recognition of the ultimate sacrifice he has made for his country, you grant his family and friends complete privacy as we all come to terms with his loss


The second piece I would like to read into the record is the statement on behalf of Sergeant Blaine Diddams' immediate family. Defence released the following statement on behalf of Mrs Toni-Ann Diddams, wife of Sergeant Blaine Diddams, and their children Elle-Lou and Henry:


Didds passed away on 2 July 2012 in a place very foreign to most of us, surrounded by his mates, and doing what he truly loved. He was without doubt a ""hard hitter"".


Given how he passed, it would be easy to define him as just a soldier, but to those that knew him he was so much more. Didds was the most loving of husbands and a devoted and very proud father to our children, Elle-Lou and Henry. Whenever he could, he loved watching the kids play sport and taught them at a very young age to ski. Skiing was a passion for Didds and each year our family would take a ski trip together come hell or high water! We will look back at these holidays and cherish the moments we shared with Didds.


Friends and families were so very important to Didds. His mates really became members of our family, and I know just how hard his loss is for them also. In this difficult time the support they have shown to the children and I has been unwavering. Didds was a man who stood by his mates no matter what and I know he will be sorely missed and well remembered by them all. The men he stood side by side with in the SASR were his brothers in every sense of the word.


He lived his life to the fullest, his enthusiasm and humour were utterly infectious, if you were around Didds you were having a good time. Everyone has a 'Didds story'.


We would like to thank family, friends and the defence community for their support, and finally we would like to thank those sectors of the media community who have respected our request for privacy and hope this will continue during this difficult time.


To his parents, Pete and Cate, I repeat my apology for not knowing as soon as my constituents that this was your son, and I expressed that yesterday. His father, Peter, understood full well the trials, the challenges and the risks associated with going to war to defend your nation, as Peter was a young officer in Vietnam with the 104 Signal Squadron in 1969. When I spoke to Peter yesterday he said one of the best things that we can do to remember the sacrifice of his son is to make sure our serving men and women are taken care of. I had dialogue sometime ago with Peter in relation to the DFRDB increases. Here is a man who served his nation well, went to Vietnam and did not leave the army until 1988, but he is also a man who struggles to survive on his military pension.


I say to my colleagues on the benches opposite that here is an opportunity to look at the service of our defence men and women of this nation, pay them due respect and compensate them as they truly deserve to be. This man, Sergeant Blaine Diddams, is a national hero. In putting the record of this fine Australian on the Hansard of this House, I know his children can be truly grateful for the contribution and the sacrifice their father made to this nation, standing up for children like them in a foreign country so that they can enjoy the freedoms and the democracy that his children have. Sometimes, whilst the personal loss is very deep, as the children in particular grow older and learn more about their father from his actions, his mates and his colleagues, they will understand the difference this man made in leading from the front. They will get to know their father even more and they will get to respect the sacrifice that he made for them and for this nation. This man is gone. There is no braver action than laying down your life for others, and that is not to be taken for granted by anyone in this nation.

Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (11:58):  It is with great sadness that I rise this afternoon to offer the condolences of the people of Canberra to the family and friends of Sergeant Blaine Flower Diddams. Sergeant Diddams was born in Canberra in 1971. He was a member of the Special Operations Task Group and was from the Perth based Special Air Services Regiment. He was employed as a Special Air Service Regiment Patrol Commander.


The ADF touches the lives of many Canberrans every day. Canberra is home to the headquarters of the Defence Force and there is a very strong defence presence here. We have a deep affection and respect for all those in the ADF who serve their country, which is why this loss is so great.


Sergeant Diddams enlisted in the Army in 1990 and after completing his initial employment training for infantry was posted to the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment in Townsville. He successfully completed his SASR selection course and was posted to the regiment in 1995. This was his seventh tour to Afghanistan since 2001, which is an extraordinary achievement by an extraordinary soldier. But Sergeant Diddams was well seasoned in operations. He had been deployed on four occasions to Somalia, to East Timor and to the Solomon Islands. 


He was also a highly distinguished soldier. He had been awarded the Australian Active Service Medal with clasp Somalia, clasp East Timor and clasp ICAT; the INTERFET Medal; the Afghanistan Campaign Medal; the Australian Service Medal with clasp Solomon Islands and clasp CT/SR; the Defence Long-Service Medal; the Australian Defence Medal; the NATO ISAF Medal; the Meritorious Unit Citation; the Infantry Combat Badge; and the Returned from Active Service Badge—an extraordinarily distinguished soldier.


Our thoughts and prayers are with Toni-Ann, Elle-Lou and Henry, Sergeant Diddams's parents, Peter and Cate, and his siblings, Nikki, Sian, Christian and Luke. While I did not know your husband, your dad, your son, your brother, he sounds a wonderful man, and the tributes that we have heard over the last few days testify to that. On behalf of all Canberrans we honour his sacrifice.

Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong) (12:01):  I join with colleagues on both sides of this House in this condolence motion to pay tribute to Sergeant Blaine Diddams, otherwise known as 'Dids' to his mates, a soldier's soldier. Forty years of age and born in Canberra in 1971, Sergeant Diddams was killed on 2 July this year, the 33rd Australian soldier to be tragically killed in Afghanistan and the fifth SAS officer to be killed in Afghanistan. He was a 17-year SAS veteran. He joined the Army when he was just 18 years of age. He was on his seventh tour of Afghanistan since 2001. He had been deployed as a regiment patrol commander with a special operations task group in Afghanistan. He was a member of the elite Swanbourne based Special Air Services Regiment.


Sergeant Diddams had previously been deployed to Somalia, East Timor and the Solomon Islands. He had been decorated many times, including by US forces in the wake of the fierce Battle of Anaconda in Afghanistan in 2002. I would like to list for the House some of Sergeant Diddams's awards and honours as they pay tribute to his contribution. He was awarded the Australian Active Service Medal with clasp Somalia, clasp East Timor, clasp ICAT; the International Force East Timor Medal; the Afghanistan Campaign Medal; the Australian Service Medal with clasp Solomon Islands, clasp CT/SR; the Defence Long-Service Medal; the Australian Defence Medal; the NATO ISAF Medal; the Meritorious Unit Citation; the Infantry Combat Badge; and the Returned from Active Service Badge. This is a long list of citations, honours and awards that went to Sergeant Diddams for his bravery and for his contribution.


He will be remembered by his wife, Toni-Ann, daughter, Elle-Lou, son, Henry, parents, Peter and Cate, and siblings, Nikki, Sian, Christian and Luke. We cannot give them comfort at this time that we will bring Sergeant Diddams back, but we can tell the family that his life was not lost in vain. I went to Afghanistan last year and met with the Australian men and women who were serving in uniform. Their contribution there is significant. Their contribution is helping make Australia a safer place. Their contribution is helping to bring stability and prosperity to Afghanistan. They are performing an important job in protecting our freedoms.


Finally, I would like to end with the words of Commanding Officer Lieutenant-Colonel J who said of Sergeant Diddams:


… he was humble, loyal to the end and respectful of all who contributed to the delivery of operational capability.


His pursuit of professional excellence, his devotion to his family, his dedication to his mates and to his country will always be remembered by an eternally grateful regiment, defence force and nation.


On behalf of my many colleagues in this House, I say to the family of Sergeant Blaine Diddams that his sacrifice was not in vain. On behalf of a grateful nation, we say thank you. Lest we forget.

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (12:05):  I thank the member for Kooyong for his heartfelt and very sincere contribution to this condolence motion. I too would like to add my sympathy and condolences at the death of Sergeant Blaine Diddams. I express my great respect for his sacrifice and our great sorrow to his parents, Peter and Cate, his wife, Toni-Ann, his children, Elle-Lou and Henry, his extended family and his comrades.


We now know, because of the contributions to this debate, of Sergeant Blaine Diddams' record as a serving person. He was born here in Canberra, enlisted at a young age and then, I think at the age of 24, passed SAS entry. Those of us who have not worn the uniform in battle—that is, most of us—cannot imagine what confronts Australian serving men and women when they go overseas to face the possibility of death as a result of being sent there by us. We cannot imagine the risks that are taken by individuals, teams, units and battalions when they go out and do what we require of them to safeguard our national interests. Those of us who have not experienced the training or the personal development that comes with being a member of an elite fighting force, such as the Special Air Service Regiment, cannot contemplate the hardship and sacrifice that leads the person in this position, such as Sergeant Diddams, to achieve the great things they achieve.


I can say to you, with the greatest of respect to our athletes who have come from the Olympic Games, that surely there are no finer athletes, in many respects, than our elite fighting men and women. We need to understand how elite they really are. In the context of our community, they are wonderful people. They are brave, they are intelligent, they are courageous to a fault and they would sacrifice themselves for their mate at a blink. It is hard for us to contemplate, but such is our military tradition, which goes back so many generations. We see it in the service of Sergeant Diddams. All of his service exemplifies that great military tradition: his courage, his bravery, his sacrifice for us. I have stood here on many occasions—this is the 33rd person killed in action in Afghanistan—and have spoken about how difficult it is for us to really understand the battle, to really know what people confront on a minute-by-minute basis.


In the case of the Special Forces, they are doing the business of facing the sacrifices, the threats and the unknowns. These are highly trained men and women. The Special Air Service is particularly well trained and very well led. They know the risks involved in what they do, yet they do it. They know the challenges involved, yet they do it. They understand the magnitude of the threat, yet they do it—and they do it for us. There can be no finer tribute to a nation than the sacrifice of its service men and women. 


Here we see a family who will suffer forever as a result of this very sad death, but their sacrifice was not in vain. We need, as a community, as a nation, as a parliament in particular, to acknowledge that that contribution will be respected. We need to know that we can enforce with all our will the view that this contribution, this sacrifice, will be forever remembered and forever valued for what it does for us. It protects us and it saves us in an ephemeral way, not directly in this room but in terms of our national priorities and national interests. In this case, it is protecting us from acts of terror in the long term. There can be no finer contribution. 


This is no consolation to Peter and Cate, his dad and mum, to Toni-Ann, his wife, or to his beautiful children, Elle-Lou and Henry. This is no consolation at all, really. I am a parent of a daughter who is 25 and of a son who is 23. This is the age when these people go to fight. This man had seven tours of duty, seven tours of fighting for us through what would have been horrendous sets of circumstances that are for us too difficult to imagine. We can see all manner of television but the reality of battle is so hard for us to imagine. There is not a lot we can do to console those who now grieve, but we can say thank you and make sure that this man's life is never forgotten, because he has made an extraordinary contribution to our lives by the sacrifice of his own. Lest we forget.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2012-08-15,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (12:12):  Sergeant Blaine Diddams was gunned down during a mission against an insurgent commander's compound near Tarin Kowt in Afghanistan on 2 July. The 40-year-old father of two was a Special Forces soldier and a member of the Perth based Special Air Service Regiment. Canberra born, Sergeant Diddams was a career soldier, described by the shadow minister for science, technology and personnel as a 'soldier's soldier'—a leader who led tough men, who fought tough fights and who paid a tough price. Indeed, he paid the ultimate price. Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. 


'Dids', as he was affectionately known, joined the Army in 1990 when he was just 19—he was only 19. In 1995, at the age of 24, Sergeant Diddams joined the Special Air Service Regiment. He was deployed on many operations during a decorated and gallant career, and these operations were the toughest test of all. His career spanned more than 20 years. His final tour was his seventh to Afghanistan over an 11-year period. He was the 33rd Australian soldier killed in Afghanistan, the fifth from his regiment. 


At Sergeant Diddams' funeral on 14 July, Special Operations Commander 'Gus' Gilmore told the gathering that the Army had lost a distinguished soldier. He said:


The scale of our loss of Sergeant Diddams is perhaps only surpassed by our recognition of his contribution to Australia over so many years in so many places and at such a consistently high standard.


Australia is truly lucky to have men such as Sergeant Diddams fighting for our freedom, fighting for peace and fighting for the freedom of the Afghan people so they can hopefully one day live in peace as we so fortunately do here in Australia.


Wagga Wagga, in my electorate of Riverina, is a city which proudly has Blamey Barracks at Kapooka, home of the Australian soldier, on its outskirts. The officers at Kapooka train the recruits to carry on the outstanding work of those serving in Afghanistan and they know how important it is for our troops to be physically and mentally equipped for the challenges which lie ahead. It is during these sad times that we are reminded of the sacrifices that men and women make, and make selflessly and willingly, in order to bring peace and stability to a country so that in it one might live a life as good and democratic as ours. Sergeant Diddams died doing what he loved and in the only way he knew how—leading his men from the front. A man described as living life to the fullest, Sergeant Diddams was widely respected for his command, his leadership and his acumen.


He leaves behind a loving wife, Toni-Ann, two children, Elle-Lou and Henry, his parents, Peter and Cate, and four siblings. May their pain be comforted by the knowledge that Blaine Flower Diddams made a difference in his life and by his legacy. We salute him. We remember this warrior's sacrifice. We thank him for his service and may he rest in peace. Lest we forget.

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (12:16):  I rise to pay my respects to Sergeant Blaine Flower Diddams who has paid the ultimate price fighting for Australia, fighting for all Australians. This is also an opportunity to honour all those Australians who have served in our military forces and to honour all those who have died while serving. Sergeant Blaine Diddams is the 33rd Digger who has been killed while on deployment to Afghanistan. His death is a timely reminder of the risks that our servicemen and women face, and the honour and bravery of all Australian soldiers, and the sacrifices they make knowingly and willingly in defence of our country.


Sergeant Blaine Diddams served in the Special Air Service Regiment as a patrol commander. He served for our country on 12 deployments, including seven tours of Afghanistan. I did not know Sergeant Diddams personally but I was recently in Afghanistan with the Australian Defence Force and the serving members with whom I spoke told me that the death of Sergeant Diddams in the Chorah Valley was as a result of a fluke shot—a fluke shot that had tragic consequences. They spoke of Sergeant Diddams's unwavering dedication to Australia's cause in Afghanistan, his professionalism and also his kind-hearted spirit.


As his parents Peter and Cate Diddams said in their statement, 'Blaine's brothers and sisters all looked up to him as their hero long before he became a national hero. As parents, we are so proud of Blaine, proud of what he stood for, proud of what he had achieved, proud of who he was.'


Sergeant Diddams's colleagues and senior officers with whom I spoke in Afghanistan were understandably upset that a journalist who was there at the time broke a long-held agreement and ran the story of his death before all his family could be contacted and, subsequently, some heard the tragic news through the media. The way in which Sergeant Blaine Diddams conducted himself is a reflection of all Australian soldiers who are known to be among the most professional in the world and, indeed, the most courageous. As the Chief of the Defence Force, General David Hurley, so eloquently expressed to Sergeant Diddams's family and friends:


Words cannot ease the overwhelming grief they feel today but I hope they can find comfort in the knowledge that this soldier served his country with pride and distinction.


This distinction was reflected in the many honours and awards Sergeant Diddams received from the ADF, including the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, International Force East Timor Medal and the Australian Defence Medal, among many others.


Sergeant Diddams was dedicated to his cause—our cause—and the country is justifiably proud of him. On behalf of the residents of Ryan, as we continue to keep our other Australian soldiers serving in Afghanistan and around the world in our thoughts and prayers, I extend my condolences to the family of Sergeant Blaine Diddams. We will remember him. Lest we forget.

I also pass on my condolences to his wife, Toni-Ann, his daughter, Elle-Lou, his son, Henry, his parents, Cate and Peter, and his siblings, Nikki, Sian, Christian and Luke.


Sergeant Diddams joined the Army as a 19-year-old and was the son of a Vietnam veteran. He joined the SAS as a 24-year-old. He has served with distinction in Somalia, East Timor and the Solomon Islands, and he has done seven tours of duty in Afghanistan. I repeat the words of the shadow minister, Stuart Robert, when he said:


Today we honour one of the toughest of the tough, 'a soldier's soldier' whose uniform guarded us while we slept. Today we honour Sergeant Blaine Diddams and we humbly thank him and his family for the burden they have borne for the freedom we enjoy.


I never served—and I would never even think about putting my hand up for SAS training. I do not know the toughness required for that. I do not know the toughness needed to leave your wife and kids and risk your life so that others can sleep safely and soundly. I come from the city of Townsville and we are home to 3rd Brigade, which are ready-deployed. They talk about the level of training they have to do, and it becomes instinct—they have what they call muscle memory. They have to train to become so attuned that when something happens they automatically go into the correct position. Extrapolate that out to what it must take to become a sergeant in the SAS and do seven tours of duty in Afghanistan. We can never know the toughness, the athleticism, the grit and the determination that Sergeant Diddams must have had.


To his wife Toni-Ann, his daughter Elle-Lou and his son Henry, I say thank you—you are grieving so that others can be saved. I do not have the toughness to do what you have endured and will endure. May god bless you.


I take this opportunity to say a few words about those who do come home. They do not get condolence motions if they come home with a limp or they come home with post-traumatic stress disorder. We must understand the damage that these actions do to people; we must understand that people will come home and they will not be obviously injured but they will carry a heavy toll nonetheless. We must understand and we must support, and as Australian people we must be prepared to pay for that support. We have sent these people to these places; they have defended our rights and our way of life and tried to establish a better way of life for others. There is a price to pay for that and we as a nation must be prepared to pony up for it. 


To Sergeant Blaine Diddams, I say thank you—thank you for a life well lived—and I say sorry for a life cut too short. To all of us I say, 'Lest we forget'.

In 1770 Captain James Cook had made landfall on the unexplored east coast of this utterly enigmatic continent, stopped for a short while at a place named Botany Bay and gone north again. Since then no ship had called: not a word, not an observation, for seventeen years, each one of which was exactly like the thousands that had preceded it, locked in its historical immensity of blue heat, bush, sandstone and the measured booming of glassy Pacific rollers.


Stirring stuff, wonderfully woven—there is nothing better than excellent writing. It compels you to read on and on. This book is one of those you cannot put down, even though it is a weighty tome. It tells the tale of the brutal transportation of men, women and children from Georgian Britain—and being a staunch advocate for the Australian Republican movement, Hughes would probably prefer that to 'Great Britain'—into a harsh, cruel, penal system. This was the origin of modern Australia.


Published in 1987, The Fatal Shore was a prize-winning epic and a No. 1 international bestseller. I know Hughes's works are immensely enjoyed by the many book clubs throughout the Riverina and are regularly borrowed from regional libraries. Hughes contributed much more than just this cleverly crafted account of the historical, political and sociological reasons which prompted British settlement of our great country.


Sydney born Robert Studley Forrest Hughes AO died on 6 August, aged 74 years. He was an iconic art critic, author and maker of television documentaries. The member for Wentworth, husband of Hughes's niece Lucy, did marvellous justice to Hughes's well lived life in our parliament yesterday. We pay condolences to those Robert Hughes has left behind. We mourn his passing and we thank him for the extraordinary gift he left us in the form of his works, which will be read, reread and treasured for as long as the written word endures.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (12:25):  on indulgence—Robert Hughes's life is a difficult one to sum up: 74 years, 15 books, multiple TV series, three wives. The member for Wentworth yesterday in the House spoke on Robert Hughes's passing with wonderful eloquence, as he so often does. I suggested to him afterwards we should create a post of parliamentary eulogist and make it his in permanence.


So many aspects of Robert Hughes's life could attract mention today: The Fatal Shore, inspired by EP Thompson's The Making of the English Working Class, or his tome on Barcelona, which was an extraordinary piece of work. But I want to focus today on his role as an art critic—I think the leading art critic of a generation—because it was in that capacity that he so much inspired me. It has been noted that Robert Hughes became an art critic by accident. In 1958 he was working as a cartoonist in Sydney for the fortnightly magazine the Observer, then edited by Donald Horne. He recounted that Horne had sacked the magazine's art critic and snapped at Hughes, 'You're the cartoonist—you ought to know something about art.' And so a career began.


Robert Hughes was himself an artist, not of the ranks of those whose work he analysed but enough to know something of the craft. In an interview with Peter Craven, Craven described Robert Hughes's own creative work in the following words:


He's pleased that he knows enough about making things to appreciate greatness when he sees it, and to understand the sheer difficulty of creating something that looks simple.


He left Australia in the 1960s. His friend the writer Alan Moorehead counselled: 'If you stay here another 10 years, Australia will still be a very interesting place, but you will have become a bore, a village explainer.' So off he headed, first to Europe and then to the United States.


His tongue could be sharp. American Visions, I think possibly his greatest work, contains some examples of where he could take on those who displeased him. In writing of the work of Barnett Newman, he said the following:


At one point Newman said, with a straight face, 'I thought our quarrel was with Michelangelo.'


Hughes's deadpan reply:


It was not a quarrel anyone could win with a stripe.


Speaking of Julian Schnabel, one of his great nemeses, Hughes described him as:


a roundly self-admiring painter who once compared himself to Duccio, Giotto and Van Gogh. Not very close, and no cigar'. Schnabel was 'a perfect painter for a culture of replays'.


But for those whose work he loved he wrote in glowing terms. Writing of Lucian Freud, he said:


Every inch of the surface has to be won, must be argued through, bears the traces of curiosity and inquisition — above all, takes nothing for granted and demands active engagement from the viewer as its right.


Of Goya he wrote his genius lay in his 'vast breadth of curiosity about the human animal and the depth of his appalled sympathy for it'. Of Caravaggio he wrote:


Caravaggio was one of the hinges of Art History. There was Art before him, and Art after him, but they were not the same.


Sebastian Smee, the Pulitzer Prize winning expatriate Australian who is now the art critic for the Boston Globe and perhaps one of those who will pick up Hughes's mantle, wrote:


Robert Hughes, more than any other critic, played an enormous role in converting people to take pleasure in it and to be discerning about it, rather than to feel that sense of suspicion.


Sebastian Smee pointed out that Hughes helped to create a sense of enjoyment of modern art, 'to make many of us feel that we could approach it and like it and, most importantly, not like it'. As the National Gallery of Australia director, Ron Radford, said:


I had known Robert Hughes since the mid-70s and will miss his eloquent, thought-provoking writing and commentary on Australian art in a national and international context.


He touched so many Australians through his writing. His great work, particularly on the fine arts, will live on for decades and perhaps centuries to come.
