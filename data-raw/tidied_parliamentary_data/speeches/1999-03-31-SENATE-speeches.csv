"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-03-31,"—I would like to ask the minister why those two bills which are subject to the cut-off order are being promulgated at this stage.
—The minister is just introducing them. They will all be automatically adjourned at the appropriate stage but they have to be introduced before the cut-off can operate. You have a valid proposition, but we have not got to the point yet.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Motion (by Senator Ian Campbell) agreed to:
That these bills may proceed without formalities and be now read a first time.

"West, Sen Sue",ALP,1999-03-31,"—In rising to speak on the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 1998-99  and other appropriation bills this morning, I do so mindful of the amendment that I know my leader, Senator Faulkner, is going to move shortly when he speaks—that is, that the Senate is of the view that the $19.433 million spent on the community education and information program on the tax system is an improper use of public money. That indicates to everybody that the Labor Party has problems with and opposes the GST. But the GST information and community education program is actually bringing to the minds of people the fact that they do not like it and the fact that they have concerns.
I have a letter from the North West Magazine, which is an insert magazine that goes into most of the local newspapers in the north-west of New South Wales. It is written 
 by John Richard of Coolah. It is actually in response to a column of Senator Brownhill's on 1 March where he had written something about the Senate select committee on the GST and the impact on beef producers. Mr Richard is very concerned. He draws Senator Brownhill's attention to the submission to the Senate select committee by the Australian Beef Association on the impact of the GST on beef producers. He says:
Senator Brownhill said he has ""heard no compelling argument against the Government's (tax) proposals as they were originally put to the Australian people.""
Mr Richard goes on to say:
The Australian Beef Association last week submitted that an increase in the price of meat has traditionally led to a decrease in consumption.
That is something that all farmers and primary producers are certainly aware of. They know that when the price of the commodity goes up in the markets, there is a drop in consumption. That drop in consumption leads of course to a decline in the income levels of the producers. Mr Richard goes on to say:
After 15 years of declining domestic consumption and low returns to producers, the ABA submission called for $200m compensation to beef producers if 10 percent GST is applied to meat.
No-one has worked out the logistics of applying and collecting GST in the saleyards when exports are exempt.
Which stock will go entirely into export and which stock will be broken up into domestic and export boxes?
That is a very sensible and appropriate observation on behalf of Mr Richard and the Australian Beef Association. When lots go in for sale, they can be broken up or they can be sold in groups. But it is possible to sell certain stock out of the groups. Mr Richard says:
Whatever the outcome, the farmer will have 10 percent discount applied to the stock in case somewhere along the line, the processor or retailer has to pay 10 percent tax.
He maintains that the `buck always stops at the farm gate'. All farmers that I know of would certainly agree with him.
It is of concern to those primary producers who are producing commodities that may or may not end up being for export. They do not 
 know when they are selling or preparing their produce for export precisely in most cases if it is going to be for export or not. They therefore do not know what the impact is going to be or how the person who is buying the product from them will be dealing with the 10 per cent GST. He goes on to say:
Farmers who now buy equipment sales tax exempt, will have to pay 10 percent GST and apply for the rebate. On a purchase of say, a $100,000 tractor a farmer would have to pay $10,000 GST and apply for a refund.
Nobody will disagree with that. That is the correct way that a farmer is going to do it. But Mr Richard goes on to say:
Farmers who have battled with Diesel Fuel Rebate for years will know how cumbersome the system is and how successive governments and self interest groups have argued that farmers should not have the `rebate'.
It is not an uncommon complaint in my office from farmers and those in the primary production area that they have to remember to actually apply for the diesel fuel rebate and that they have to wait. But first of all they have had to expend the money before they can get the rebate back. That certainly has an impact upon their cash flow.
Mr Richard goes on to talk about the Ralph report:
. . . it not only suggests tax cuts but has many implications for family farms operated as partnerships and trusts and changes to depreciation that could impact badly on rural enterprises.
Crop planting expenses to be deductible only once the crop is harvested is anomalous and treating fuel and fertiliser as trading stock would increase compliance costs.
It is quite obvious from Mr Richard's letter that he has looked very closely at the changes that this government is planning with the new tax, and also as a result of the Ralph report, to see what the impact will be on those in primary production. I think it would do people the world of good to actually look more carefully at the finer detail and at the actual implementation and administration costs and pressures that this GST is going to place on primary producers. If they look more closely at the issue, they will find that the amount of book work that primary producers 
 are going to be required to undertake will be increasing quite significantly.
I would commend everybody to look at the submission of the Australian Beef Association to the select committee and also to look at Mr Richard's letter in the North West Magazine. He has outlined very clearly the issues that are of concern to people in the primary production area and in the north-west of New South Wales, who are significant producers of crops, livestock, beef and wool.
While talking about the GST, it is also important to note that yesterday was very much a red-letter day in the saga of the introduction of the new tax. The government wants to call it a new tax system and gives it the acronym of ANTS. Of course, everybody in the community knows it as the GST. Yesterday we saw a media release headlined `Unprecedented church, community alliance calls for tax changes'. This is the alliance of a great number of charitable, church, community and consumer organisations who released a joint statement—and had a joint press conference—rejecting the government's tax package and calling for major changes to improve its fairness and protect those on low incomes.
It is vitally important that when the government gets groups of organisations, individuals and community groups together making submissions and comments like this, it actually listens to them. This is a group of people that represents a diverse range of organisations representing a significant number of Australian people, particularly those who are less fortunate and less well provided for than the big end of town.
It is important for people to recognise the signatories to the community call, as they call it, announced on 30 March 1999. They include Anglicare Australia, Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission, Australian Catholic Health Care Commission, Australian Consumers Association, Australian Council of Social Service, Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Association, Australian Youth Policy and Action Coalition, Brotherhood of St Laurence, Centacare Australia, Society of St Vincent de Paul, Salvation Army (Southern Command), Salvation Army (Eastern Com 
 mand), Secretariat of National Aboriginal and Islander Child Care, Uniting Community Services Australia and the Women's Electoral Lobby. It also includes the following organisations representing people with disabilities: Head Injury Council of Australia, National Council on Intellectual Disability, Women with Disabilities Australia, Physical Disability Council of Australia and the Australian Psychiatric Disability Coalition.
From listening to those names it is obvious and very apparent that they represent a significant cross-section of the service providers in the not-for-profit sector in this country. These are the people with expertise in the provision of services to people on low incomes or people with disabilities. The opinions and voices of these people should be heard and should be taken note of because they represent a significant cross-section of people. They have expertise that the government says does not matter because the government has done modelling. But we know that the government has not done GST modelling on a number of areas.
It is of vital importance that the government take cognisance of the calls of these groups of people. They have concerns about the additional costs that a service charge will impose upon people. This is not just a charge on goods; this actually introduces a services charge. The individual members of these organisations are people who have a significant use for these services which, up until now, have not attracted a tax. But after the introduction of the GST they will certainly attract a tax. That is an issue of major concern.
When we look at the things that the government is headstrong about doing, we also need to remember that another issue that the government has taken up with great relish is privatisation. In the first term of the government, we saw the privatisation of the first third of Telstra. We now have before us the additional sale of the remaining part of Telstra. I urge the government to closely look at the results of the election in New South Wales last Saturday. It is very clear that one of the major issues in that election was the privatisation of electricity. The ALP came out 
 very strongly in opposition to that. That position was arrived at after a lot of input from the rank-and-file members of the ALP.
The coalition went to this election with a strong policy to privatise electricity. Mind you, some of them were not totally sure about how much they were going to privatise; some thought they were not going to privatise the distribution network but they were quickly corrected on that. I think of one Richard Mutton in Dubbo who ran an ad saying that they were not going to privatise the distribution network. That caused both parties in the coalition some embarrassment when he had to be corrected. But it is very interesting to look at the results, and the results speak louder than words.
In the seat of Bathurst, which has two electricity generating stations—Mount Piper and Wallerawang—we saw a swing to Labor of about 12 per cent. We took it from an ALP seat with a margin of 0.6 to one in excess of 13 per cent. It is now over 63 per cent Labor. That is an indication of what the people in New South Wales think about privatisation. I had some people say to me on Sunday that they hoped that Telstra would not be privatised because they had grave concerns about what that meant for them in the future. These are small business people. They are not from a group that this government would say were archetypical Labor Party supporters. These people are small business people. When I made the comment that I thought privatisation was a major factor in the previous day's election results, both of these people agreed with me wholeheartedly. I think the government needs to stop being so arrogant and so out of touch with what people want and recognise that the people in New South Wales spoke loud and long when the issue was placed before them as a key issue in the election campaign.
We now notice from headlines appearing in regional media in New South Wales that the National Party has taken the privatisation of electricity off the agenda. I am not quite sure what the Liberal Party has done. We also see headlines where the National Party, Mr Armstrong in particular, is calling for a severing of the coalition—the Liberal Party 
 and the National Party—while they are in opposition. It is pretty obvious why Mr Armstrong is calling for that, particularly when you look at the results in rural New South Wales. The National Party vote dropped markedly. It had big swings against it. On the whole, a lot of the votes went to One Nation. The Liberal and National parties need to be very careful about what is happening. They are disillusioning their voters. Their voters are turning away from them and turning to ultra right-wing parties who put forward and promote simplistic and opportunistic policies that are not necessarily in the best interests of this country. I think Mr Armstrong has become aware of the need for the National Party to renew its identity with people in rural areas.
If we think there is squabbling in New South Wales between the National Party and the Liberal Party, then there is obviously a fair bit of squabbling going on within the Liberal Party. An article in a Bathurst newspaper, Western Advocate, on Monday of this week about the state election wrap-up is headlined `Berry fuming as Libs fail to back him'. The article says:
The fate of the seat of Bathurst was inexorably entwined with the fate of former Liberal Party leader Peter Collins, according to local candidate David Berry.
Yesterday Mr Berry laid the blame for his defeat squarely at the feet of the Liberal Party state director Remo Nogarotto.
`I was pre-selected when Peter was still Opposition leader and, at that time, I was given an absolute undertaking of what the party would do for my campaign,' he said.
`I was promised comprehensive resources to help wrest Labor's most marginal seat back to the Liberal fold.
`I was very enthusiastic about the sort of campaign we would be able to put together, it would be a very professional effort.
`Financially we would be well resourced, as well as having up to the minute details on polling, significant research available and a large number of shadow ministers touring the electorate.'
Well, let me tell you there were not too many shadow ministers that came to Bathurst during this last election campaign.
—I do not think it would have mattered.
—I do not think it would have mattered either, Senator Faulkner, because we had a very good candidate in the Mayor of Lithgow, who will be a credit to the Labor Party and to the district that he is going to represent. Mr Berry said he:
. . . first realised something was wrong in early February, two months after Mrs Chikarovski toppled Mr Collins for the leadership, when campaign support was not forthcoming.
He actually did consider resigning from the candidacy but decided not to:
`It was quite apparent that none of the undertakings were going to be met and it put me in a difficult position.
`I had a string of commitments that I'd identified as being great steps forward for the electorate, and I had to advance these on behalf of the party with the knowledge that they were not honouring their commitments to me.'
He says he ended up running his campaign on $12,000. I think it is pretty indicative of the fact that there are problems within the party as well. As an aside, I would also say that I know that, in the Wagga Wagga campaign when a shadow minister went to visit, both the Liberal candidate and the National Party candidate turned up and because the shadow minister was a Liberal Party member, the National Party candidate was fairly unceremoniously told to make themselves scarce and go some place else. So relations within the two parties are not good and relations within the Liberal Party itself internally, I would suggest, are even worse.
—Bad and getting worse.
—I think so, because Mr Berry's outburst is obviously an indication of not just sour grapes because he lost, having been a member before, but how strongly he feels about the problems there are within that party. As I have said, Mr Armstrong has said quite publicly that the Nationals should leave the Liberal Party.
—Who is this Mr Berry?
—I do not know. A Victorian wicket-keeper?
—You can keep cricket out of this, Senator Faulkner, thank you. I know that you are hurting because you were unable to watch or listen to the last part of the test match in the West Indies.
—Also because we lost.
—We lost, but it was not on radio after six o'clock this morning. There is also another issue that I would like to canvass, hopefully very quickly, and that is speculation in the media recently that during the Olympics regional airlines will be diverted to Bankstown airport. These rumours are alleged to have come from Commonwealth organisations. That is something that I will speak about at a later time. But I would just flag to people that, if the government think that they can get regional airlines in New South Wales landing at Bankstown airport, then they will be having a lot of trouble and a lot of complaints from the rural areas of New South Wales. It will just reinforce, in the minds of rural people, how out of touch they are with what are the needs and desires of people who live in rural Australia.
—Before calling Senator Faulkner, I should inform the chamber that the cricket was in fact broadcast beyond 6 a.m. this morning.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No. 2) 1998-99</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-03-31,"—Thank you for your editorial comment, Mr Acting Deputy President. I commend the matter of public importance which will be debated in the Senate later today, for the edification of all senators and other Australians interested in these issues. Today I rise to speak on a specific appropriation in the bills before the Senate. That is the appropriation, in Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1998-99, of $19.433 million for the community education information program on the new tax system. I move:
At the end of the motion, add:
""but the Senate is of the view that the $19.433 million spent on the community education and information program on the tax system is an improper use of public money"".
I am moving this second reading amendment today because the Howard government has 
 blatantly and deliberately misused public moneys for party political purposes. It has consciously abused the process of the Advance to the Minister for Finance and Administration for political ends, in order to ensure that parliamentary scrutiny of the expenditure of $20 million can only be achieved after the event. Most seriously of all, the Howard government has perhaps irrevocably damaged public trust in the proper operations of the public institutions of this nation, the apolitical Public Service, reasonable expenditure of taxpayers' funds and the proper role of parliament. In our view, the Howard government should stand condemned for these deliberate acts of sabotage.
In the 15 days leading up to the announcement of the federal election, the Commonwealth government spent more on their tax advertising campaign than Toyota, Coca-Cola and McDonald's combined, in a flagrant misuse of taxpayers' money for political benefit. Tracking data suggests that the television campaign alone cost more than $5 million in the metropolitan markets, but this does not count the advertisements splashed heavily in Tasmania, in the ACT and on regional networks.
The heaviest bombardments were in the weeks of 13 and 23 August. In those two weeks, AIM Data, the advertising tracking agency, reveals absolute saturation in the metropolitan markets, hitting 80 per cent of the over-18 television audience three or more times a week. That was approximately 100 TV spots per week in the third week of the campaign, in all capital cities. The overall cost of TV expenditure alone could well be upwards of $8 million over the 15 days. In comparison, for the whole of August, Toyota spent around $6.9 million; McDonald's, around $5.2 million; and Coca-Cola, around $1.4 million—a monthly total by the big commercial players of around $13.5 million, and a 15-day total of $6.75 million. The government was desperately outspending three of the major commercial advertisers in Australia and using taxpayers' money to buy votes.
In another critical comparison, in the lead-up to the 1996 election the Keating govern 
 ment reduced overall government advertising expenditure to less than $3 million in the two months before the election. So much for the weak excuse of the coalition government that it was only following precedent!
The television ads of people playing happy families under a new tax system were themselves bland and inaccurate, promising huge income tax cuts but failing to mention the central component of the government's proposed new tax system, the GST. These ads were backed by at least $3 million worth of newspaper advertisements and a badly organised information hotline costing at least $2 million and using public servants for party political purposes. And then, of course, there was the glossy mail-out to each household in the country. I do not think the public fully comprehends the impact of this re-election gambit by the Liberals. Nothing of this magnitude has ever before been perpetrated in Australian politics.
And, of course, we have loose ends dangling everywhere. The government reluctantly admitted that it allocated $19.4 million on the promotional exercise which was blandly titled the `community education and information program'. Remember that tax reform was not a government program. It was a Liberal Party election proposal. In fact, prior to the last federal election, the parliament had not even seen the legislation. It was introduced into the Senate only on the evening of the last day of sitting, on 10 December last year.
If the legislation passes the Senate, following the Senate inquiry that is under way, it may go through in an amended form—who knows? If that is the case, obviously the pre-election community information program will have been not only premature but also inaccurate. A further absurdity is that the government will not reveal its hand with business taxes until after 1 July, so there will probably be an information campaign for those changes as well.
Consider a similar campaign by the Canadian government in the early 1990s, desperately throwing taxpayers' dollars into their euphemistically called `information campaign on the shift to a GST regime'. In the end, throughout the introduction and implemen 
 tation of this regime, the Canadian government had spent $Can85 million on trying to persuade the public that their so-called reforms were a good thing. The Canadian public, I might say, were relentlessly dubious about this. There were direct mail packages to all citizens, an $11.6 million TV advertising campaign and a $6 million call centre; the costs spiralled upwards as the public became more and more dissatisfied. Of course, students of political history know the end result for the Conservatives in Canada: they were comprehensively booted out. It is also interesting to note that there was widespread support for Canadian Liberal Party senators to block the GST when it was due to go through their Senate.
I was extremely concerned to hear in the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit that the public information campaign is still continuing. Treasury officials acknowledged that there were further components under way. The spending has not stopped. It did not stop in Canada until $Can85 million was thrown at trying to make their then government look good. How much will this sales pitch actually cost the Australian taxpayer in the end?
The opposition was first informed in May 1998, by concerned departmental sources, of the GST advertising rort. After cross-examination in Senate estimates committees, officials revealed that it could cost up to $10 million. After its launch in conjunction with the GST hotline on 20 August, a spokesperson from Senator Minchin's office grudgingly admitted to the ABC that the campaign could cost up to $15 million. During the election campaign proper, the Treasurer, Mr Costello, issued supplementary spending estimates during his infamous mid-campaign press conference, adding more than $2 million to that $15 million. Treasury now estimates that the cost so far is $19.433 million, and this does not include Senator Newman's $800,000 mail-out to 1.7 million pensioners, not only touting for their votes but of course also using the Centrelink mailing system—a potential breach of Commonwealth law that was investigated by the Privacy Commissioner and found to be illegal.
On 3 October 1998, the government lost 19 seats to the opposition. Labor did not lose a seat, and achieved the support of a majority of voters. The Senate vote was an overwhelming 61 per cent to parties which opposed the GST plan. There is no doubt that the entire aim of these bland, friendly ads was to help the government scrape over the line over the seven-week election campaign. At the end of the day, the coalition only just hung onto government with Labor polling a clear majority—51.4 per cent of the two-party preferred vote.
As a result of his investigation into the advertising campaign, prompted by the opposition, the Auditor-General, Mr Barrett, called for a parliamentary inquiry to clarify guidelines for taxpayer funded advertising campaigns. The government has now responded to opposition calls for action by referring the Auditor-General's recommendations to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit. The committee is currently undertaking public hearings into the matter.
The Auditor-General was less coded than usual in his report when he quoted the principles implemented by the New Zealand Audit Office which leave no room for ambiguity:
A government should not disseminate material that . . . is designed to secure, or has the effect of attempting to secure, popular support for the party-political persuasions of the members of the government.
There can be no doubt at all that the $20 million GST ad campaign fails this clear test. The entire campaign was consciously designed to elicit popular support for a party political policy in an election campaign. This is not just the view of the Labor Party. The government continued with the blitz campaign in the face of overwhelming condemnation from the nation's media, including a great deal of negative editorial comments.
The Auditor-General has recently admitted to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit that, to his knowledge, his inquiry into the GST ad campaign attracted an unprecedented level of public correspondence, all of it highly critical. The Australian media and people saw through the government's subterfuge. They knew Prime Minister Howard and 
 Treasurer Costello were misusing public moneys. They were not happy with it then and that has not changed.
In addition, the opposition has expressed further concern about the ultimate use of the market research undertaken under this program. Hundreds of thousands of dollars were spent on researching this promotional campaign: which lines work best on the community, which lines work best on voters, how the promotion was tracking, and evaluating the effect once completed. We also know, from evidence in Senate estimates, that these research results were handed to members of the ministerial committee on government communications. The government has never denied that these politicians followed their political interests and handed them straight to the Liberal Party and their advertising company for immediate use in the imminent election campaign. This would be a further outright abuse of public money and Commonwealth copyright.
Public money was used in an unconscionable way immediately prior to the election campaign, and Mr Howard really has no choice but to instruct the Federal Director of the Liberal Party, Mr Crosby, to write a cheque for $20 million addressed to the Collector of Public Moneys, Department of Finance and Administration, Canberra, and repay the taxpayer. If not, the opposition will continue to expose the extent and the cynicism of this rort, using all avenues that are available to us.
The report of the Auditor-General also considered the use of the Advance to the Minister for Finance and Administration to fund the CEIP. The advance has been around in one form or another basically since Federation. It is provided annually by the parliament in such a way to ensure that the requirements of section 83 of the Constitution are complied with, namely:
	 No money shall be drawn from the Treasury of the Commonwealth except under appropriation made by law.
It is basically a contingency device to enable the executive to meet urgent and unforeseen expenditure. The appropriation acts set out the purpose of the advance. The amounts spent 
 from the advance are advised to the parliament by the Minister for Finance and Administration on a monthly basis and are given an explicit appropriation by the parliament at the first opportunity. It is that appropriation in relation to the CEIP that I am moving that the Senate declare to be an improper use of public money.
The Labor Party supports the existence and use of the advance. It has in the past provided a mechanism to make funds available for drought and other disaster relief, unforeseen legal costs and variations in the cost of our international obligations that are the result of movements in the exchange rate. Those are just a couple of examples. However, we do not support the use of the advance as a device to obscure government expenditure from the scrutiny of the parliament, and that is what has happened on this occasion.
The crux of this issue really is why the expenditure on the CEIP was not included in the appropriation bills presented by the Treasurer to the parliament in May last year. An appropriation of $10 million was provided in the 1997-98 appropriation acts for the CEIP, but was not spent. Treasury claim that at the latest time the budget papers could have been changed it was not known that this money would need to be rolled over into 1998-99.
The Auditor-General's report indicates that at this time, in early May, planning was under way to launch the campaign in mid-June. On the basis of this start date, it is clear that payments would not have been made in the 1997-98 fiscal year and should have been provided for in the appropriation bills presented to parliament in May last year. I commend to the Senate the comments of the Auditor-General on this matter.
Of course, the Treasury does not have any response to these sorts of issues. Their only response is to say that they had no discussions with OGIA about the billing cycle. Putting aside the question of why Treasury did not ask about the billing arrangements of a $10 million plus campaign, it surely would have been apparent to the nation's principal economic advisers that, if you start running a campaign in mid-June, you will not hand the 
 cash over until at least July. Any reasonable person would have formed the view prior to the cut-off date for the budget bills that this expenditure would have been incurred by the Commonwealth in 1998-99. In other words, the advance was not used in accordance with the requirements set out by the parliament in the appropriation act.
There are a number of substantive grounds for concern about the Howard government's actions on the GST ad campaign. This government has abused public trust by using Commonwealth revenue to further the political interests of the coalition parties and use the contingency mechanism, the AMFA, to prevent parliamentary scrutiny until it is too late. For these abuses of public trust, the Howard government deserves the Senate's and the Australian people's condemnation. I urge the Senate to support the amendment which I have moved.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No. 2) 1998-99</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-03-31,"—In response to Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1998-99  and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1998-99 , I will be speaking on a number of issues to do with government policies or economic policies in general and in relation to budgets and budget reporting. First of all, honourable senators and the community may have noticed what AAP has reported today:
Treasurer Peter Costello today renewed his warning of a tight budget in May in a government bid to keep the budget in surplus.
His warning follows Australia's worst-ever trade deficit figure issued yesterday—the deficit blew out to $1.5 billion in February.
""What I have said is we need to run a budget in surplus. This is a very big thing; we don't want to get blase about surpluses,"" Mr Costello told ABC Radio.
""Surpluses are hard to produce and they take disciplined economic work.""
Asked if more cuts in the budget could be expected, he said: ""I think we have got to run a tight ship and we have got to make sure we have got a surplus.
""And getting a surplus and starting to pay back some of that $90,000 million of debt is very important for our credibility. To run a surplus we have to keep strong policy."" 

What Mr Costello is referring to is what is often considered by economists to be a very blunt instrument. He is talking about the twin deficit theory. Trade deficit figures of $1.5 billion yesterday would indicate to most people that we have a structural problem in relation to our exports and imports, but not to the Treasurer. This is another example that the coalition's attitudes and claims are based on the flawed concept of the twin deficit theory, which is based on a link between budget deficits and surpluses and the current account or trade deficit or surplus. The idea of the twin deficit theory has never been borne out in practice. Indeed, it is clear that the twin deficit theory is a fallacy when you consider that, firstly, across all countries the current account deficit must sum to zero and, secondly, in contrast, government deficits across all countries can take on a large range of values.
The twin deficit fallacy is overwhelmingly illustrated by the latest current account figures. Despite moves towards a budget surplus over the last two years, our current account deficit has continued to increase. So where is the connection? And yesterday we saw our trade deficit increase again. Could that be because the current account deficit and trade deficit are not related to the budget surplus or deficit, except by very tenuous means?
The government has had its head in the clouds. The current account deficit is a crucial economic indicator of wellbeing. It is not the be-all and end-all, but it is crucial. It reflects the state of the national economy and deserves serious attention. To think that it will be A-okay, irrespective of the current account deficit, as long as the domestic export fundamentals are kept under control is naivety in the extreme. People in the community can sense this. They know what is happening with local industries. They know how much they can buy that is made elsewhere. They also know what they cannot buy that is made in Australia.
So it is not surprising, if we do have stronger periods of growth or some buoyancy within consumers in Australia, that they are not going to be able to spend it generally on goods made in Australia. They can see food 
 commodities in the marketplace and it is obvious to everyone, except the government and perhaps the opposition, that the issues are structural. We have to start talking about those structural issues. Roughly 10 per cent of the Australian economy is export based. We have become so blinkered to the way we structure the rest of the economy that we have forgotten that we have some structural issues to deal with. The goods and services which people require in their normal life—basic food, clothing and shelter—one would think, in a country like Australia, could largely be produced from the vast resources within regions of Australia. This is a very green principle—that we should not be wasting precious energy by wastefully bringing goods that could be produced locally right across the world, but that is what we are doing. There is some bland idea that there is a level playing field and that somehow this cheap energy will continue forever. Clearly, that is not going to happen. Also, clearly, we are building ourselves into a structural dependence on other countries and it is not doing our trade deficit any good.
 We know what is happening with exporters—it is a very competitive world—and we know what is happening with the rest of the world. In reality we seem to be running faster and faster. In the past I would have said, `Running faster and faster and staying on the same spot' but, clearly from the trade deficit figures of yesterday, here we are running faster and faster but in fact going backwards. Both Australia's imports and exports rose. As I say, there we were running faster on exports but with no idea of whether or not we were able to meet the needs of the Australian market from resources within the regions of Australia. I know there are people who will come up with the bland comment, `Well, Australia's market isn't important enough for us to concentrate on.' That is nonsense. If 90 per cent of our economy is based on the Australian market, it is a nonsense to suggest that we should leave it to other regions and other countries and waste all that energy obtaining those goods from other countries each time.
 We know that we are trading more and that is about it. But is that good in itself? I 
 am not sure that it is if it is not actually bringing the benefits to the Australian economy. There is an assumption that trading will mean positive outcomes for everyone. I think that was the assumption pushing the Uruguay Round of GATT. It is certainly the assumption that keeps the World Trade Organisation going. But, in reality, if everyone in the world is trading more and more and we are not necessarily getting commensurate benefits within the countries, except draining resources out and perhaps producing goods and services that not everybody needs, maybe we have to reassess those strategies.
 I would like to move on to an issue which is important to me and which I have brought up on a number of previous occasions, and that is how we present the state of our own economy. An issue of concern to me is what we have done on the state of the environment accounting and on integrating the accounts on environmental issues into our budget accounting.
In 1993 a draft revised UN report entitled United Nations system of national accounts provided for the descriptions of natural resource accounting, environmental satellite accounts and balance sheets. Environmental satellite accounts are accounts compatible with the main national accounts so as to allow adjustment of gross domestic product for the use of natural resources and changes in the environment as a result of economic activity. A supplement to the United Nations report called the System of integrated economic and environmental accounting, or SIEEA, was also released and has been used as the basis of preparing satellite environmental accounts.
In May 1995 the then Minister for the Environment, Senator Faulkner, and the then Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Paul Elliott, announced the allocation of $3.5 million to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, or ABS, for the development of environmental and resource statistics linked to the national accounts. This system was to be in accordance with United Nations guidelines. The ABS would progressively produce a number of component environmental accounts as well as a discussion paper entitled the System of environmental accounts for Austral 
 ia. It was expected that the report would be produced in 1999. We are in 1999, and I guess I wait for it with bated breath.
In June 1996 the ABS released a report entitled Australians and the environment, which gives the first valuation of natural assets for the national accounts. It was an experimental analysis of the 1991-92 national accounts. The 1996 coalition policy document entitled Saving our natural heritage indicated that the development of green accounts would have priority in the ABS forward work program. In an answer to a question on notice, the present Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Hill, stated:
Work on environmental accounts being undertaken by the ABS is extremely complex and will involve wide consultation with stakeholders to ensure the appropriate use of the most suitable data and the compilation of those components which are of the greatest use. Based on overseas experience the project will take many—
he did not say `several'; he said `many'—
years. A progress review of achievements is scheduled for the latter part of the 1998/99 financial year. For these reasons ""green accounting"" practices will not be employed in the 1996/97 budget.
I just wonder whether those wide consultations are continuing; I would like to think they are. I know the ABS is still working on a wide range of information. We have a great wealth of information being collected. I am really interested to see whether the government is still committed to that wide consultation process or whether `many years' means we will sit on our hands and hope we will forget that it exists.
It should be noted that Canada integrated its economic and environmental data into a new environmental information system that estimates the environment's contribution to Canada's national wealth. The publication is called Econnections: linking the environment and the economy—indicators and detailed statistics, 1997. The resource estimates of the econnections indicators will be included in the official estimate of the national wealth in the national balance sheet accounts beginning in the 1997 year, set for release in 1998. I guess this is an old note.
The ABS has released three documents related to the satellite accounts which have been prepared and released so far. They are Energy account 4604 (1993-94) that was released in November 1996; Minerals account 4608(1996), released in March 1998; and Fish account 4607 (1997), released in March 1999. The water account is due out later this year. The energy account needs to be redone and is being revised at present because it is not able to be plugged into various models. That  revision is likely to be out later this year as well.
Two other reports—forest account and wastes account—are also under preparation, and data is available at present, we believe. However, there is a review of priorities being undertaken by the ABS at present to see if the projects should run concurrently as at present or if most of the effort should go to getting out the water and energy accounts of this year. Reports on land use and biodiversity are much less advanced since there is a need for adequate data. Their production will probably wait until the results of the land and water audit are finalised. Once these reports are prepared, other reports such as the carbon account—using data from energy, forests and land use—will be able to be constructed. The proposed report System of environmental accounts for Australia will not be prepared in 1999. When or if it will be prepared is unclear. I guess that is something the government will have to clarify.
An international meeting on satellite accounting is to be held in Canberra in November this year. This will be a meeting of the leaders in the field—I think they are called the London group. The United Nations Handbook on Satellite Accounts is being considered for revision at this meeting. I think the government are going to have to do a lot of work if they have not put their minds, since this project was instigated by Senator Faulkner, to how they are going to integrate and include these kinds of accounts in their mainstream accounts. I would like to think that the Australian government would consider being able to report to this international meeting in Canberra this November to be an important priority. I am not holding my 
 breath, but the community should continue to put pressure on the government to make sure that we are one of the countries leading the way on this issue. It is not happening at the moment, but we have the basis for that and it should not be wasted.
Along with the consideration of environmental accounting there should be a consideration of general progress indicators. We have had a lot of discussion in relation to the proposed tax package—the ANTS package—about what the impact will be on equity in Australia. We are beginning to hear evidence in the review of the national competition policy and there is a great deal of concern that the so-called `free market' has the impact of increasing the gaps between rich and poor and between regional and urban Australia.
If we were to have, in our accounting of these processes, equity indexes or progress indicators, we might have an idea of whether we are going forward or whether we are moving towards the structure of a less developed economy, that is, with growing gaps between the rich and poor—a marginalised working poor and a growing number of people angry at being cut out of the decision making process. These are important progress indicators; they should not be separated out as if the only things that are important are profit and loss statements, least cost quotes or the lowest cost tendering or as if government should be operating simply as a business—there to make profit and loss, to slash and burn and to charge for services that otherwise would not be provided.
So there are two elements. We have to look at environmental accounting to see whether we are really making steps forward or whether we are eating into our natural capital in order to provide a short-term profit for some people. We also have to look at whether the way in which we are going forward is bringing the rest of the community with us or whether we are continuing to marginalise a growing number of people within the Australian community.
The last issue I would like to deal with today in relation to these appropriation bills is what Australia could and should be doing to take positive steps in relation to curbing 
 speculative investment. On 23 March it was recorded that the Canadian government voted overwhelmingly in favour of the so-called Tobin tax, which is a tax on financial transactions. I have a couple of press releases that have been sent to me from people who contact us from Canada and who made the historic vote possible. One of the press releases says:
Vote for the Tobin tax paves way for Canadian leadership to regulate the global money casino.
Ottawa—NGOs applaud the Canadian government for voting yes to promoting measures to control currency speculation. Private member's motion 239 calls for Canada to promote a tax on financial transactions in concert with the international community. Canadian NGOs have been pushing for this tax, commonly known as the Tobin tax, after Nobel prize-winning economist James Tobin, as an important measure to make the global economy more stable, democratic and equitable. The motion passed in the House of Commons, 162 to 83. We would like to salute Lorne Nystrom for his initiative in putting forward this motion.
There has been some discussion in Australia in relation to the Tobin tax. I know there has been discussion within the Labor Party in relation to the Tobin tax. We know that, as far as banking is concerned in Australia, one of the reasons the banks do not particularly care whether they annoy their customers or put on extra charges is that by far their greatest amount of business is international speculative money transactions.
The reality is that we have very powerful dealers in the international speculative money market who buy and sell currencies simply to make money. It has nothing to do with reality; a lot of it is to do with hedging bets or, in a way, pushing governments to make their policies in a certain direction. We know what happens when governments decide to spend more money, we know what happens when there are changes to social policy in countries like Australia: there are changes in our dollar. International money speculators are, in effect, dictating policy. It could be environmental, social or economic policy, but here we have totally unelected people whose only motivation is to make speculative short-term profits telling Australia, Canada and every country in the world whose money is being traded in the international competitive economy what to do. 
 Australia's currency is one of the most speculative currencies.
I would like to think that it is possible, and I would like to make it an aim, that before I leave at the end of June this Senate will be prepared to support a similar motion to move towards a Tobin tax and towards promoting this in the international arena.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No. 2) 1998-99</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,1999-03-31,"—In addressing Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 1998-99  and the associated bills, I want to focus my remarks on the goods and services tax and some of the implications of that tax for the country and for our budget. The coalition has made many statements over the past few months about the benefits of a goods and services tax in Australia. The current government has made many claims about the unfairness of the current tax system, particularly in relation to tax avoidance and compliance costs.
The facts of life are that, in the vast majority of submissions that have been received by the Senate select committee on the goods and services tax, people have drawn attention to the unfairness of a goods and services tax, particularly as it applies to those on low incomes. We have seen as late as yesterday a press release headed `Unprecedented church, community alliance calls for tax changes.' It says, in part:
An historically broad alliance of church, charitable, community and consumer organisations today released a joint statement rejecting the Government's Tax Package and calling for major changes to improve its fairness and protect those on low incomes.
Speaking at the release of the joint statement, ACOSS President, Michael Raper, said:
Never before has such a large number of Australia's major church, charity, welfare, community and consumer representatives come together to declare the Government's GST unacceptable in its current form.
We all believe that substantial and continuing tax reform is essential. In fact, I would have thought that tax reform was a continuum. If you look back at the Hansard  reports of this parliament over the past 100 years, you will see it littered with debates about changes to the tax system. The nature of the tax system 
 has always been under review by the parliament and has been subject to change over the history of our federation. But the Labor Party does not believe that tax reform equals a GST. The difference between Labor and the Liberal-National coalition is that Labor believes tax reform must be fair and must benefit all Australians. It must not be reform that disadvantages those who can least afford it or that costs jobs by disadvantaging business.
The cornerstone of the coalition tax reform package is a GST, and one of the substantial reasons for the tax reform package, according to the Prime Minister, John Howard, is to fight tax evasion to stop those people who are not paying their fair share. I am questioning the degree of the black economy. At Senate estimates we have had estimates made of what it is, ranging from $3 billion up to $18 billion. The reality is that Treasury does not know, nor does this government, the extent or the size of the black economy in Australia.
The coalition have repeatedly claimed that a GST will fight tax evasion and that it is a simpler and less cumbersome tax alternative than the current arrangements. The GST will not deliver the sort of tax reform that Australia is asking for or the tax reforms that the coalition is promising. All of the facts about a GST in relation to tax evasion and compliance costs show us that a GST is detrimental. In fact, in many of the countries that have recently introduced a GST, tax evasion has become significantly worse. I can give a number of examples, starting with the example of Canada.
In Canada, the arguments for the introduction of GST were very similar to those now being espoused by the Prime Minister, Treasurer and other coalition members. For example, the Canadian Finance Department argued that a GST would significantly reduce tax evasion and, at the time, all the rational economic models supported this proposition by showing that a GST would not lead to an increase in tax evasion. The GST was later introduced at a low rate of seven per cent to replace a hidden sales tax. Does this sound familiar? What have been the results of this 
 tax evasion in Canada, and can we learn from their mistakes?
A renowned conservative think tank in Canada, the Fraser Institute, has recently completed a study titled The underground economy: global evidence of its size and impact. In its report, the Fraser Institute shows that the GST is the primary catalyst for growth in the underground economy in Canada. The report makes several clear points to support this fact by comprehensively analysing the state of the economy in Canada after the introduction of its GST in 1991. Firstly, there was a growth in tax evasion of around two per cent of GDP from early 1991 to the end of 1993. This equated to around $14 billion of unreported GDP, which meant lost taxation revenue of some $6 billion to all levels of government in Canada. As in Australia today, many predictions were made by the government in Canada about the revenue that would be received from a GST and that it would enable the replacement of existing hidden taxes as well as income tax cuts.
The facts in Canada show that in 1993-94 there was a shortfall of revenue from the GST in the budget of $1 billion relative to the predicted income of the 1991-92 budget. The Fraser Institute report shows that most of this shortfall can be attributed to evasion of the GST. In Canada, the problems associated with this loss of revenue through a GST have had a significant impact on the capabilities of government. Decreased tax revenue obviously means that the government is forced to either spend less or borrow more. If borrowing is increased, a larger proportion of taxes people pay today goes to servicing debt incurred in the past to pay for services consumed in the past. Tax rate increases are inevitable as the only solution to this problem.
In Australia, I think it is fair to say, we can expect a similar result to Canada, where the GST is not all it is supposed to be and inevitably the rate of GST continually rises to combat falling government revenue. If tax is increased by government without adequate benefits to offset it, the public perception is that the tax is unfair and will further encourage tax evasion. In other countries, such as the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, 
 they have found similar results to those of Canada.
In a publication called VAT Experiences of Some European Countries, R. Hemming and J.A. Kay from the Institute for Fiscal Studies point out:
It would not be at all surprising to find that a tax as complex as VAT was fairly easy to evade. However, it has been suggested that the invoice method of operating the tax provides a built-in policing mechanism. This built-in policing is illusory even on transactions between registered traders . . . A comprehensive system to check compliance would require tracing all the VAT invoices issued by traders . . . and matching the totals of these to that traders declared output, a task which is clearly impossible.
In the Netherlands, as far back as 1976, Sijbren Cnossen, from Erasmus University in Rotterdam, completed a review of a comprehensive government report on tax evasion. The Cnossen review points out:
A recent government report on tax throws light on the extent of tax evasion. For the report some 77,000 field audits that were made in 1976 (20% of the number of taxpayers at that time) were reviewed. The audits resulted in the imposition of 45,000 additional assessments (6 out of 10 audits) and the recovery of $0.31 Billion revenue, or almost 2% of total receipts for that year. Furthermore it was discovered that one fourth of all cases consisted of petty fraud involving $1000 tax or less.
This demonstrates clearly a shifting of the tax burden from government to private enterprise. The compliance costs under a GST will significantly increase as the burden of tax collection is shifted from government to private enterprise, and particularly to small and medium enterprises. The Centre for Independent Studies in 1996-97, in its publication Policy , explains tax compliance succinctly under an article entitled `The Hidden Costs of a GST—An International Experience'. The centre states:
There are in broad terms, three main types of costs associated with tax compliance. Firstly, the costs of running the Australian Taxation Office and other revenue authorities termed administrative costs. Second, there are the costs of taxpayers in complying with tax rules, and third the wider economic costs associated with the ways taxes can distort business and consumer behaviour. The increased 
 compliance costs faced by an average business according to the Centre are as follows:
. . .              . . .             . . .
No doubt the highest compliance costs will be suffered by those who previously did not participate in the sales tax system but who would be required to participate in the GST system because of its breadth.""
Many people, in small businesses in particular, are wondering what exactly the compliance costs of a GST are, and what they will have to do to comply. The government has not been publicising the things that the average business would have to do to comply with a GST. I believe that this is because no small business would support a GST if it fully understood the work that will be involved in collecting this tax for the government. Some of the typical compliance costs that the Centre for Independent Studies has exposed are:
There will be an added compliance cost in the form of completion of a periodic return and either a payment to the revenue or a claim for a refund. If there is a refund it will have to be checked and banked. At the point of recovery of GST on supplies made by the business there will be an extra invoicing function to reflect the GST, if Australia adopts an `add on' rather than `add in' system. There would be an extra initial cost of ensuring the business's stationery complies with requirements such as showing a registration number and proper current address. There would naturally be an initial compliance cost in registering the business in the first place. At the point of acquisition of supplies by business, on which it wishes to claim a credit for the GST paid, there will be an extra function of recording the GST that has been paid so that it can be offset against a GST recovered by the business . . . The compliance costs would increase where the nature of the business involved some refinement or other (depending on the model adopted) to the standard GST template, such as imputing a deemed GST on the cost of second hand goods as trading stock by second hand dealers, accounting for GST incurred as an agent for another business, dealings within group companies and so on. All these refinements would involve small but repetitive extra compliance activities not necessarily encompassed by existing accounting methods.
According to Sandford and Hasseldine, in the publication Compliance Costs of Business Taxes in New Zealand , the costs of all of this work have been estimated at $NZ453 million, or 7.3 per cent of GST net revenue in that 
 country. More importantly, Sandford also notes in his research:
If administrative costs are allowed for, there must be a high probability that the combined administrative and compliance costs would exceed revenue.
If Australia is to use its closest neighbour as a working example of a GST in practice, then every business in Australia will be faced with the enormously complicated, repetitive and expensive task of collecting a GST for the coalition government. Is it any wonder there is so much tax avoidance in those countries with a GST? Perhaps the high level of avoidance in those countries is because people cannot understand the complexity of the GST, let alone afford to comply with it.
The approach that has been taken by the government in this tax debate has been one of secrecy and unfounded propositions. Many of the assertions that have been made by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister cannot be supported by fact. One clear example of that is the continued reference to the compensation package and the continued claim that the compensation package contained in the tax proposition will more than adequately compensate low income Australians for the impact of a GST. We have seen that myth exploded in the past couple of weeks by Mr Geoff Carmody, one of the architects of Fightback back in 1993 and certainly not an avid supporter of this side of the parliament. Mr Carmody clearly warns that the compensation package that has been put in place by this coalition government would be eroded within a matter of two to three years and that pensioners and low income earners will be substantially worse off at the end of that period if a GST is introduced.
This tax reform package that is being heralded by the current government as a saviour for all of our ills in this country is in fact nothing more than a representation of the ideological bent of the people who are promoting it. It will do nothing to create jobs in this country. It will do nothing to resolve the problems of unemployment in regional and rural Australia. That has been clearly demonstrated by the modelling done by the Prime Minister's preferred modeller, Chris Murphy, and by Professor Dixon of Monash. There is 
 no substantial employment gain as a result of this tax reform, and none can be demonstrated. But it is ideologically driven and it has been clearly demonstrated that it will substantially benefit the top 20 per cent of income earners in this country, to the detriment of the vast majority of taxpayers.
It will not substantially improve the position of our industries. It will not make them substantially more competitive than they are now because, as Professor Dixon pointed out, it will in fact create a bias in the structure of our economy towards the mining sector—something that we have been trying to redress since the mid-1980s. Through a variety of reforms and policy decisions, the previous Labor government tried to shift the balance in our economy away from a reliance on the mining and rural sectors to a much more diversified, mixed economy with manufacturing as a key focus—particularly elaborately transformed manufacturers—as part of our drive to increase our exports. That work of 10 years, the sacrifice that many workers in this country made over that period in terms of wages forgone in order to allow the investment to take place in that area, will be reversed as a result of the introduction of the GST. Those sacrifices, in the end, will be for nothing because the end gain will not be there.
This package demonstrates the absolute arrogance of this Prime Minister and this government and their absolute belief that they can govern for a very small segment of the Australian community. They have not demonstrated in the period they have been in office—from March 1996—that they are a government for all of us. They have had a very distinct bias in the policies they have presented, even to the extent where their industrial relations minister, Peter Reith, has openly claimed that they are there to represent the interests of business. At the end of the day, that is what they are about. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No. 2) 1998-99</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-03-31,"—I wish to commence with some remarks with regard to the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 1998-99 . I wish to make remarks about the 
 financial independence of parliament—views the Australian Democrats have which are not shared by the executive-minded major parties. Parliament is funded by the government of the day—in other words, it is the executive which decides how it is funded. This is despite parliament's theoretical and constitutional position as the supreme arm of our system of representative government. It is not the executive which should be supreme in our society; it is the parliament, which represents the people and in which is reflected the sovereignty of the people. The excessive concern in our society and in all elections with the executive reflects a distortion in our democratic values.
The Western Australian royal commission of 1992 warned that the financial tie between the executives and parliaments blunts the capacity of parliament to properly perform its watchdog role over the government. Those of you who are students of history will recall that the origin of parliamentary privilege was to protect parliament from the executive which, at that stage, was outside of parliament—the executive was the Crown. But those cunning Brits introduced the Westminster system, sneaked the executive into the parliament, and ever since we have suffered from the oppression of the attitudes of the executive to parliamentary independence.
Parliament must be properly equipped to fulfil its accountability responsibilities in a manner consistent with its constitutional independence. Parliamentary financial independence is important to campaign for because a genuine separation of powers demands that one arm of government not be financially subordinate to another, and that is especially important in the case of parliament. Where parliaments are financially hamstrung in any way, it will affect their ability to adequately scrutinise the actions of the executive, and where the executive has acted inappropriately, it can use its financial control to hamper parliament from exposing that activity through limiting funds available for the proper pursuit of its duties.
Sometimes I am dismayed by the way in which the media run the executive agenda of bashing the parliament and, in particular, the 
 Senate, which is elected, broadly speaking, on a proportional representation basis. It is the parliament which protects the people, not the executive, and we should be mindful of the need to keep parliament independent and supreme. The Australian Democrats believe that a strong, well resourced, properly funded and fully effective parliament is possible only with financial independence from the executive. While the parliament does have its own separate appropriation bill such as that before us, the executive maintains a tight rein over the amounts included within it.
The Australian Democrats believe that, in contrast to the existing system, where the presiding officers—who, incidentally, ultimately are appointed by the government of the day through their parliamentary party control—have a great deal to say on the budget, there should be a joint standing committee of both houses of the federal parliament that is responsible for planning the budget of the parliament. That is not an extreme proposition. After all, the joint house committee that oversees the Auditor-General fulfils exactly that role. We do not believe that the government should be able to hold a majority on that committee, because that would constrain the independence of parliament.
We believe that the government should be obliged to accept the recommendations of the committee with respect to funding unless there are pressing reasons in the national interest for them to be rejected. In that case, the government must publish full reasons as to why the recommendations should not be accepted. That would place political constraints on the government without removing from them their ultimate powers over spending. In other words, they should have the right to veto because they are responsible for funding, but they should not have the right to set the budget. Where the recommendations are accepted, the government should obviously not be politically answerable for the amounts appropriated; parliament needs to be responsible to itself. But that does not mean to say that we should let parliament run riot without being properly accountable. Parliament does need to be fully audited and fully 
 subject to the Auditor-General's normal accountability measures. When we consider this Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 1998-99 , all of us must remember that ultimately we, as the representatives of the people, are in fact subject to the executive and that it is the executive who reign supreme in our system and not the parliament, as is the intention of democracy and of our Constitution.
I want to move on from those remarks to Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) and focus on the primary issue which has been raised by the opposition. Before I do so, I want to refer to some remarks made by Senator Cook last night which are recorded in Hansard. I wish to correct the record, because Senator Cook has made some remarks which are not quite accurate. He is obviously not intentionally misleading the parliament or anything of that sort, but he does say the following:
The decision to hold an inquiry into the government's GST legislation was a decision arrived at in this chamber, but it had its genesis in an agreement between the government and the Australian Democrats with some input, I understand, from Senator Harradine. Only after the die was cast between those players were the Labor Party brought into the story.
That is utterly and completely untrue. At the time the committee structure was being discussed, the government were adamant that they would not even countenance such an inquiry because they had a mandate, they had debated it in the House of Representatives and the rest of us could go hang. So the Democrats went, first, to the Labor Party and campaigned for the form of the committees that we desired. We and the Labor Party had some deep and intense discussions on that form. It was only when the government realised that on this issue they had to either face an alliance of the Labor Party, the Democrats, the Greens and Senator Harradine or create an alliance themselves with the Democrats and Senator Harradine that they agreed to the committee structure which in fact went through. Let me make it clear that the Labor Party were intimately involved in discussions on this matter right from the very beginning. 
I move on now to the focus of many of the remarks by the opposition on these appropriation bills. The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate has moved a second reading amendment which says:
. . . but the Senate is of the view that the $19.433 million spent on the community education and information program on the tax system is an improper use of public money.
I say at the outset that the Democrats will support that motion. We agree with the opposition.
The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate also drew attention to the Auditor-General's report No. 12 1998-99 entitled Taxation reform: community education and information program. That audit report was as a result of some good and thorough work done particularly by Senators Faulkner and Ray in the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee and in other fora on this matter, which resulted in a reference to the ANAO. The ANAO and the Auditor-General always express themselves extremely carefully. Their brief was to look at the issue of the propriety of using public funds to promote a policy initiative of a government just prior to an election. They looked at whether the funds approval met the legislative conditions. But at the heart of this discussion is not what you can or cannot do by the letter of the law but what you should be doing in terms of the spirit of the law, in terms of the morality which attaches to the use of public funds by the government of the day for political advertising.
The Bills Digest draws the attention of the Senate to a quote from Mr Howard in 1995. It also draws attention to the fact that the coalition, in opposition, had criticised this activity on several occasions, for example in response to the Hawke government's tax advertising in 1986. It says:
In 1995, Mr Howard stated that: Today's Shadow Cabinet meeting in Gladstone decided that, in Government, we will ask the Auditor General to draw up new guidelines on what is an appropriate use of taxpayers' money in this area.
Then the Digest  says:
However, no such request appears to have been made by the Howard Government to date. 

The Digest  is dated January 1999, so the Howard government has had a long time to fix a problem which it identified previously. What is really emerging here is the consistent problem that the people of Australia have with the parliament: the principles and the views and attitudes on morality that are held by a political party in opposition are not practised in government. That is why they do not trust us, they do not believe in us and lots of them do not like us very much.
Appendix 1 of the Attorney-General's report outlines suggested principles and guidelines for the use of government advertising, derived from guidelines adopted in New Zealand and the United Kingdom and suggested as a result of reviews of government advertising in Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, Western Australia and British Columbia. For those who are not familiar with the excellent series of `Commission on government' papers that arose in Western Australia, I would urge you to have a look at their discussion of this issue of government advertising.
It is a problem which remains unsolved, and frankly I am going to put the blame right at Labor's door. You had the opportunity to fix the law in this regard. On 30 June 1998, in the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill 1998 debate, I moved an amendment on behalf of the Australian Democrats to fix government advertising. It essentially dealt with the period of six months preceding the day on which the House of Representatives is due to expire and authorised:
. . . publication of any advertisement about Commonwealth government programs or policies, including matters which affect the rights, benefits and obligations of people;
except in accordance with this section.
The amendment said:
. . . The publication of an advertisement is permitted under this section if the advertisement is paid for, or is to be paid for, with public money and any of the following apply:
(a) the advertisement is otherwise required or permitted by this Act to be published;
(b) the advertisement is necessary to inform the public of changes to statutes or delegated legislation;  

(c) the advertisement is necessary for the carrying on of commercial services provided by government agencies;
(d) the advertisement is for the purposes of recruitment of staff or officeholders;
(e) the advertisement calls for tenders;
(f) the advertisement relates to a public inquiry;
(g) the advertisement contains a notice that is required by statute to be published;
(h) the advertisement relates to a community service and the non-publication of the advertisement would be to the public detriment—
and various definitions followed. The fact is that amendment would have proscribed the kind of advertising which the government followed in its pre-election practices—the blatantly political use of public funds for its tax advertising.
In the debate I indicated that the amendment arose out of recent events and that its fate was entirely in the hands of the major parties. We knew at that time that at least $10 million worth of taxpayers' funds were going to be used to push out a particular view that the government had come to. Senators Faulkner and Ray criticised the amendment. Some of their criticisms were valid, and I did not object on behalf of the Australian Democrats to them having rejected the amendment when they had valid reasons.
Their first reason was that this amendment might not have caught the forthcoming election, but mostly Senator Faulkner expounded technical reasons. In fact I quote him:
It is for those technical reasons, I have to say, Senator Murray, that the opposition will not support the amendment you have moved.
When you talk about technical reasons, you are saying, `We support the spirit and intention but you have made some errors in the drafting.' If that were so, if Labor were serious about fixing this problem, they would have come back and fixed the technical problems. If they felt they did not have enough time, they would have come to the last time in which the Electoral Act could be amended, which was as recently as February-March 1999. Is that so, Senator Brown? When did you deal with it?
Senator Brown interjecting—
—It was a few weeks ago, wasn't it?
—Yes.
—And they would have fixed the problem with their own way of getting around those technical issues. I know that when the Labor Party are serious about matters they bring amendments to the floor—and they haven't. That is the reason we are going to continue to have this government advertising problem. Until such time as the Labor Party accept that they have to amend the law, they will not stop it. Why won't they stop it? Because when they are in government they want to do the same thing. That is the very thing that John Howard and the coalition were going on about in their entire time in opposition when Labor were in power.
I would agree that, on the record, the Labor Party never extended their use of public funds improperly to the extent that this government has. I think the way in which government funds were used prior to the election was quite shocking. That practice has been universally condemned around the world by every independent inquiry into this matter. Senator Faulkner, in his remarks on that electoral bill in 1998, said:
Through the Senate estimates committee process, we have been able to expose at least $40 million worth of advertising that can only be described as politically partisan election advertising that is motivated only because of the proximity of a federal election campaign.
Let me acknowledge that Senator Faulkner and Senator Ray have done a very good job in exposing that sort of thing. But let us stop exposing it, because it does not stop the expenditure and it does not stop the immorality; let us fix it with amendments that will get rid of the problem. I urge the Labor Party to accompany their rhetoric on this matter with legislative action.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No. 2) 1998-99</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-03-31,"—We are dealing with the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 1998-99 , Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1998-99  and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1998-99 . These are bills that allow the government to take taxpayers' money, basically, for the service of the nation. I want to home in on 
 the entirely confused and directionless way in which the government is failing, as we go into the new century, to take Australia into the lead as the sun power nation. Australia has a terrific opportunity to become the solar power nation leading the world with the export of the technologies it already has and putting research and development funds into clean green energy.
There is a burgeoning market to our north, particularly in countries such as Indonesia and the Philippines, where the traditional Western modes of big power stations are fraught with difficulties. If you are going to have the production of energy equally across those nations—simply because they are made up of so many islands—how much better it would be if we were able to export to them technologies which will allow the local production of energy. This would allow access for villages, local people and farmers to electricity and modes of heating water and so on. This is an enormous market which is going to grow in the next century.
At the end of 1997 we had the Prime Minister's statement `Safeguarding the future: Australia's response to climate change'. I do not think it was an initiative in the full sense of that word; it was a response to international criticism about Australia's delinquent position in not joining the rest of the world in trying to curb the production of greenhouse gases. The Prime Minister said:
Targets will be set for the inclusion of renewable energy in electricity generation by the year 2010. Electricity retailers and other large electricity buyers will be legally required to source an additional 2% of their electricity from renewable or specified waste products energy sources by 2010 (including through direct investment in alternative renewable energy sources such as solar water heaters). This will accelerate the uptake of renewable energy in grid-based power applications, and provide an ongoing base for commercially competitive renewable energy. The programme will also contribute to development of internationally competitive industries which would participate effectively in the burgeoning Asian energy market.
What the Prime Minister is saying there is basically what I have just said, and that is that Australia should be in a position to capture the burgeoning Asian market in clean green energy. But the government's actions are 
 totally at odds with that. What the Prime Minister was announcing at that stage was that an extra two per cent of the electricity market in the future would be coming from clean green energy.
I put to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Hill, through a series of questions, that clean green energy should be solar power, as Australians understand it—in particular photovoltaic; that is, solar panels which produce electricity for lighting. If you are in the outback of Australia solar power can be used for almost all household purposes—cooking, refrigeration, television, lighting and so on.
There is also the issue of wind power. Australia's southern coastline—I know this, being a Tasmanian—lies in the path of the roaring forties. We have some of the best wind configurations, the best potential wind power situations, anywhere in the world. If this two per cent of new energy sources was to be allocated to those specific industries, it would be an enormous boost to them. They are tiny, but that two per cent allocation would ensure that their growth would allow us to capture those Asian export markets in the future. It would mean a big injection of funds into research and development so that the technology already available in Australian universities for solar power and wind power could be converted for manufacturing and domestic use.
I asked Senator Hill whether his definition of renewable energies is in fact solar power and wind power, but back came a confused answer that, if you translate it, means this government is entertaining the idea that that two per cent of so-called renewable energy could include such things as coal gas and existing solar hot water systems, not solar panels. If that is the case, we are again going to see the coal industry capturing this so-called renewable clean green energy market—the reverse of what the government is saying should happen will be happening.
I point out to the Senate that there is far more to the government's favouring of the dirty coal industry as a producer of energy—in particular, electricity in this country—and its flouting of the move towards a clean green 
 future where global warming recedes rather than grows as a threat through the GST package. What the government is doing in that package is putting some $3 billion a year into tax rebates for the use of diesel and other fossil fuels. One particular impact of that will be a $52 million gift to diesel fuel producers in outback areas, but in particular in states like Western Australia and Queensland. Some $10 million of that will go to diesel fuel production in the Northern Territory.
It sounds all right on the face of it, but that is going to stymie the production of solar and wind based energy. It is a gift of tens of millions of dollars to the old greenhouse gas producing energies just at the time when clean solar and wind power were being able to match the price of electricity production. Just as the solar and wind power energy options are getting on their feet in this country the government comes along and gives a windfall to the old dirty power production and pulls the rug from under the competitiveness of the new energies, the sunrise energies. More than that, the GST is going to tax the production of solar cells and the components for the production of wind power. These were previously untaxed; they are now going to be taxed while the government is giving a rebate, reducing the tax, on the dirty industries. What an extraordinary situation—that this government is actually moving to destroy clean green energy production in this country, or to set it back decades at least.
The year before last, when I introduced into the Senate the sun fund bill, which would have allowed people in the bush, in particular, instead of getting the diesel fuel rebate, to have the capital to install clean green renewable energies such as solar power on their homesteads and wherever else it could replace fossil fuel produced energy, the bill foundered due to opposition from both the government and the opposition of the day, even though it was a cost neutral option. But it goes further than that. At a time when the Howard government, backed by the minister who calls himself the minister for the environment, Robert Hill, is giving over $100 million for research and development of the coal and gas industries—the fossil industries—it has 
 abolished the Energy Research and Development Corporation, the only entity in government dedicated to funding clean green energy renewal.
This is an extraordinary situation this country has got into. This is not just blinkered thinking; this is a studied destruction of this country's enormous potential to promote business and job creation through the excellent achievements of particularly our universities but also of the private sector. Instead of giving them a boost so that they become manufacturing industries providing Australia with clean green energy and exporting that to the rest of the world, the government on a broad scale is throwing every obstruction in the way of that happening, taking hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money and putting it across to the dirty old industries.
The impact of that is going to be one of setting Australia back for decades, instead of taking the example of Denmark. In 1980 Denmark determined that it was going to become the leader of wind power production in the world. This is a little nation of five million people where the government got involved and gave capital support to the development of wind power. That country has now raised its target from having 10 per cent of electricity produced through wind power to 30 to 40 per cent of its electricity produced from wind power within the next few decades. It is exporting that wind technology to the rest of the world and has created thousands of jobs. Instead of Australia saying, `Well, we can do that with solar power,' we have a government that is destroying the solar power industry in this country, we have a government that is destroying our opportunity to join Denmark in being a leader in wind power production.
What a derelict policy. What a failure by the minister for the environment, who should be fighting to see that our clean green energy options come to the forefront. What a failure of imagination yet again from Prime Minister Howard. What a failure in cabinet to understand this option for this country and to meet with leaders in business—BP Solar and the other corporations which are involved in trying to not only produce the technology but 
 also convert that into manufacturing. What a failure to get behind the hundreds of small producers of clean green alternatives in this country, particularly in the bush, to make sure that they are not only competitive but lead the way as we go into the next century. And what a failure to take the opportunity to create tens of thousands of jobs in clean green industries in Australia. Instead, this government is propping up the job shedding coal industry and its interests which no doubt have much more influence over what happens in the Prime Minister's office.
Some may say, `Here is another of the Greens on his feet, promoting the impossible. We have to accept circumstances as they are. We have to accept that Australia is going to continue to be seen as a polluting country and a country that will not pull its weight. We have special circumstances, as Senator Hill and Prime Minister Howard say, and we can't change that.' But we have only to look at Britain to see that it can be changed.
In the 1980s, Britain was seen as the `dirty neighbour' by the rest of Europe, particularly because of its polluting industries and the fallout from them, which was affecting the rest of Europe through the added impact it had on the killing of forests in Scandinavia and in Germany, through acid rain and particulates from industries, which we know add to the rate of cancer throughout populations. Let us look at what the British government is doing in 1999. Just last month, their Foreign Secretary—and remember that this is not even their Minister for the Environment—Robin Cook spoke to the Green Alliance at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in London. He gave a speech called `Britain and the global environment', which began:
For the past week I have been commuting to and from Rambouillet, the chateau just outside Paris where the Kosovo peace talks are going on. It is easy in foreign affairs to become preoccupied with the pressing issue of the day—
And how all of us must agree with that sentiment, as the horrible in events in Kosovo are unfolding at the moment. Mr Cook went on to say:
But while we deal with the conflicts of today, it is crucial that we keep thinking about the kind of world we want to live in tomorrow. 

This is foreign territory for the government of Australia. He went on to say:
If we want that world to have a healthy environment, then we have a major a challenge ahead of us. For anyone who still thinks that global warming can be treated as a side-issue here are four simple statistics. The six warmest years on record have all been since 1990. Last year was the warmest ever. Thousands of square kilometres in Britain are already at risk of flooding. A fifth of the world's population live within 30 km of the coast.
The facts are just as stark in other areas. Take biodiversity.
This is the Foreign Minister for Britain speaking. I would say, `Take heed, the environment minister for Australia.' He continued:
Some people still say that the extinction of plant and animal species is a natural process. So it is. But as the malign result of human activity it is now occurring at up to a thousand times the natural rate. Well over a tenth of the plant species known to man are at risk of extinction. And that isn't just a tragedy for those who enjoy nature. It should concern anyone who cares about our health. A quarter of all prescription drugs are derived from plants. Drugs derived from tropical forest plants are worth USD25 billion a year.
He went on, outlining the problems with water and other issues around the world:
Each one of these issues is a slow-moving menace with the momentum of a super-tanker bearing down on us. And I haven't even got onto the loss of soil and spreading deserts, the state of the world's fish stocks, the forests, the coral reefs or the ozone layer.
He went on to say about the Climate Change Challenge Fund:
By working with business, the environmental movement and developing countries—
heed this; this is the British government, the Foreign Secretary speaking. Where is Senator Hill? Could he ever utter such a line?—
we can break the myth of conflict between the green agenda and the growth agenda. I want British business to lead the way in showing that what is good for the environment can also alleviate poverty—it is not just a rich man's luxury.
He then announced a series of measures that Britain is taking:
The authorities in Peking, for example, tell us that they would welcome British expertise in encouraging the use of gas rather than coal for heating and cooking—
that is step 1—
And a consortium led by a British company, The Solar Century, is negotiating in China to build the world's largest factory to make solar panels.
So Britain is building, in conjunction with Chinese expertise, the world's biggest factory in the Asian region, while the Australian government is penalising our solar industry. What an extraordinary state of affairs. What a shocking situation. What perverse policy, that the Howard government should be taxing the solar industry as never before, while putting hundreds of millions into the dirty old fossil fuel industries as never before—while the British government is out there with business leaders and environmentalists, leading the world and taking our markets to the north, taking jobs from Australians.
Of course, in a global economy, that is their right. Thank goodness somebody has the enlightenment to do what Senator Hill and John Howard cannot do. I intend to hammer this matter, because they are failing Australia. They are failing the clean green future that this nation should have, and they are failing to produce thousands of jobs—and economic prosperity, to boot—while they fail on the environmental questions. Mr Cook ended with a quote from Kennedy:
Never before has man had such capacity to control his own environment . . . We have the power to make this the best generation of mankind in the history of the world—or to make it the last.
The Howard government seems to be hell-bent on the latter. We Greens are going to fight for the former.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No. 2) 1998-99</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-03-31,"—In speaking today to the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 1998-99  and related bills, I want to raise an issue concerning the taxation treatment of the charities and not-for-profit organisations in this country—in particular, the proposed treatment they would receive under the government's taxation package. It is an opportune time to raise this issue because yesterday the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiring into the impact of the GST and the taxation package reported to the Senate in what I think is a highly valuable report. I do not want to concentrate today on the narrower subject of the GST, but that report did provide a highly 
 valuable process exposing a range of issues about the taxation treatment of the charitable and not-for-profit sector in this country, and these are issues that I want to raise. It is important that we do have some public debate about these issues in the coming months.
Governments have long recognised the role of charitable and community organisations in promoting community welfare and delivering essential services that traditionally no other sector was willing to provide. In order to support the role of charitable and community organisations, governments in this country have, over time, exempted them from a range of taxes. More recently, the coalition government appears to be walking away from that responsibility and that positive encouragement of the not-for-profit sector and seems hell-bent on dragging that sector more and more into the taxation regime and subjecting it to a range of taxation measures.
Underlying the government's approach is the new philosophical thinking that is going on inside the conservative parties in this country. The argument is that somehow it is seen as being unfair to provide more favourable tax treatment for the not-for-profit sector than is provided for the for-profit sector. This seems to be the philosophical underpinning to the government's approach. It is well known that the Minister for Aged Care, Mrs Bishop, has stated many times to community groups and providers that she does not like the term `not-for-profit', because she believes that every organisation should be making a profit. Perhaps it is this philosophical approach that underpins the government's thinking in the taxation area.
Under the government's tax package, charitable and community organisations will be drawn further into the tax system. Despite many of their activities being GST free, they will have to collect the tax and then seek reimbursement. That is just one of the measures in the proposed tax package that will impact on them. While the non-commercial activities of charitable and community organisations will be GST free, all other activities conducted by charitable and community organisations will have GST applied to them.
It is important in this context to remember that these not-for-profit and charitable organisations use commercial activities to subside the non-profitable services that they provide to the disadvantaged. A charitable organisation might well be running a fairly profitable business enterprise, but the money from that enterprise often goes to supporting and helping the homeless and providing food to people living on the street—the social services that those charities and not-for-profit organisations provide in our community that alleviate the poverty and suffering of so many. It is important that we understand the cross-subsidisation nature of the activities of these groups. It is that cross-subsidisation activity that the government is not taking into account in its plans for the taxation treatment of this sector.
The other problem that arises is that these organisations that deliver both GST free and GST applied goods and services will be forced to spend a significant amount of their income on administering and complying with the proposed new taxation regime. Millions of dollars will be spent on the paperwork and the accountability mechanisms to ensure that they comply with these new laws. The fact that they are GST free means little, because the mere act of becoming GST free may well cost them a considerable amount of money. All the money that they spend on that activity is money that is not being directed at the poor, the disadvantaged and the needy in our community.
The compliance costs that these organisations bear will be directly drawn out of the services provided to those in need. The question the government has to answer is: why? What public purpose is served by that approach? What good is served by forcing these organisations to be involved in the taxation system in this way, only for most of those funds to be reimbursed? The costs of compliance, administration and paperwork being drawn into the taxation system in this way will mean fewer services for those in need in our community.
In addition to the costs involved in the GST issue, a major—and in some cases a more important—issue for some organisations is the 
 proposal to introduce a limit on the use of FBT concessions for charitable and community organisations. The government is proposing to limit the level of fringe benefits that are exempt from FBT to $17,000 per employee. The existing FBT exemption was introduced as a way of providing assistance to charitable and community organisations in attracting and retaining qualified staff. Because they could not afford to pay the salaries paid in the private sector, they were allowed the device of using their FBT exempt status to salary package so that their employees could have competitive salaries. Most of the people who work in these sectors have a smaller total salary package, but the FBT exemption allows them to at least arrange a package that provides some opportunity for these charitable and not-for-profit organisations to attract staff.
In 1995, there was a report by the Industry Commission into charitable organisations. In considering the removal of tax concessions to charities, it stated:
The above disadvantages of input tax exemptions and concessions suggest that they may not be a good way of providing assistance to the sector. Given the major benefits which CSWOs as a whole currently derive from input tax exemptions, however, the Commission considers that any proposal to remove these benefits should include alternative ways of providing the same aggregate level of government assistance to the sector.
So the Industry Commission in 1995 recommended that we phase out the FBT concessions to charitable organisations but that we recognise that their level of service would be severely reduced as a result of those changes and that we would need to make other arrangements to ensure that the government assistance to the sector was maintained.
Unfortunately, what has happened in the sector since that time is that the use of the FBT concession has grown quite considerably. It is often only anecdotal evidence, but I think it is true to say that the use of the FBT concession is now a much larger component in the sector than it ever was before. It is certainly true in the public benevolent institution areas, such as state government public hospitals, particularly in my home state of Western Australia and in Victoria, but I think 
 it is true also of the wider charitable and not-for-profit sector.
The Labor Party supports the proposed limit on FBT concessions. It accepts there is a need for greater regulation in this area and for transparency and accountability in the use of the exemption. There is no question of that. The Labor Party remains firm in that position. The current regime where organisations rely on informal unwritten advice from the Taxation Office about how to apply the concession is clearly not good public policy and not acceptable. We need a proper regime which provides transparency and accountability. In supporting the government's proposed limit, we recognise—particularly since the GST inquiry by the Senate Community Affairs References Committee—the very real needs of the sector which arise from these moves. There are issues that need to be addressed in terms of the impact on the sector.
The existence of uncapped concessions opens charitable and community organisations to accusations of abuse if a small minority do not abide by the limits the sector has itself set. Most have seen fit to apply the 30 per cent limit encouraged by the taxation department. I note that this morning the Treasurer once again stated that the vast majority of charitable and community organisations were not involved in the rorting of FBT concessions. I think generally that is the case. The Treasurer stated that the government's primary concern is in the state public health systems where there has been widespread use of the FBT exemptions to shift costs from the states to the Commonwealth. For once, the Treasurer and I are in complete agreement. He is dead right. There is a major problem in the use of FBT concessions in state public health systems. The Commonwealth really does need to take a serious look at that problem.
There is also the issue of making sure that we do not reduce hospital services. The concession, in my view, was never designed for the needs of the state public health system. It was designed to facilitate the needs of charitable and not-for-profit organisations.
The other problem with uncapped concessions is that they have allowed governments 
 to continually wind back the direct assistance they provide to the sector. State governments and the federal government have advised charitable and community organisations to move into salary packaging and use of the FBT exemption in order to stretch shrinking budgets. These organisations have been caught between their need to meet increasing demands on their services by the disadvantaged and government budgets that are either frozen or declining. The answer has been to expand the use of the FBT concessions—a perfectly natural response, but one that has led to a real growth in the use of that concession.
The government's proposal presents a serious problem. On the basis of its own figures, the changes to the FBT exemption will raise over $100 million a year from charitable and community organisations as a result of the proposed limit on FBT concessions. The impact will be to pull $100 million out of the sector. I note the Prime Minister the other day, in his speech about philanthropy, thought that even on his best estimates the use of philanthropy may provide $50 to $70 million a year in the longer term into the sector.
—Tax driven.
—Tax driven. But what is the point of doing that? Are we pulling out $100 million from the sector and hoping that philanthropy will fill the hole? That clearly is not the answer. We have to deal with the fact that the withdrawal of the FBT concessions will have very serious impacts on the industry, that on the government's own figures—and I am not sure of the veracity of those figures, but the industry certainly supports the argument of the severity of the impact—$100 million will be drawn out of the sector. That can have only one impact in the charitable and not-for-profit sector: they must reduce services. There are no other answers for that sector. The impact of taking that sort of money out of the sector is that they will reduce the services to the poor and to the needy.
This evidence was presented at great length before the Senate Community Affairs References Committee during their GST inquiry. 
 Groups such as the Spastic Centre of New South Wales, the Wesley Central Mission, the WA Deaf Society and a whole range of charitable and not-for-profit organisations have given evidence as to the impact of this measure on their activities. These organisations will service fewer deaf children, they will provide fewer meals, they will care for fewer poor people and they will provide fewer homes for the homeless. All the basic fundamental works that charities and the not-for-profit sector provide in this country will be diminished as a result of this measure.
We cannot accept that that impact will be applied to the sector. We have to do something about it. The Industry Commission provided some guidance, as I said earlier, in that they identified that the government, in closing the exemption, would have to fund assistance to the charitable sector to make up for the assistance removed. The problem has grown much bigger since then. Obviously, the size of compensation required has grown much larger, even if we only go down to the sort of limit proposed by the government. They are not going as far as the Industry Commission recommended in terms of removing the exemption altogether, but what we must do as a parliament is address the very real concerns raised by the charitable and not-for-profit sector on the impact or disadvantage in our society of this taxation measure.
The bills are not currently before the parliament. I understand they will be introduced some time later this year. What I think is important is that we begin to have the debate about how we ought to respond. I make it very clear that the Labor Party is still committed to the capping of the exemption and providing the accountability and transparency in this measure that has been lacking. It cannot be allowed to continue in the current state.
The real issue for us is the impact on the sector and on the sector's ability to deliver to the disadvantaged, the needy, the poor and the disabled in our community. Their very proper and important role in the community will be diminished by this measure unless we take steps to ensure that the efficiency of the 
 overall sector is not impaired by this taxation measure.
The Labor Party is willing to play its role in that. I note that the Democrats indicated in their minority report on the GST inquiry of the Senate Community Affairs References Committee the other day that they have concerns about the impact of the proposed change to the FBT limits. Labor Party senators—me included—in compiling the majority report raised the problem and highlighted the needs of the sector if this FBT limit were to be pursued. The government now has the opportunity to listen and respond to those concerns raised by the sector and highlighted in the Senate community affairs committee report.
We need to find the appropriate balance between the joint public policy outcomes of a proper, transparent and accountable system in terms of the FBT exemption and the needs of the charities and community service organisations to deliver to the disadvantaged in our society. All of us, Labor and Liberal state governments included, are culpable for allowing the situation to get to this point. All governments have encouraged organisations to take advantage of the FBT concession in order to stretch their budgets to provide very necessary and essential services.
What we need now is a solution to the problem of the impact on the sector. The Labor Party is prepared to play its role in providing leadership. But what is desperately required is for the government to analyse properly the needs of the sector, listen to their concerns about the impact of limiting of the concession, and work with the sector to find ways of meeting their funding needs to continue to provide the vital services that they provide in our community.
 As I say, a range of issues were raised in the community affairs committee GST report that need the attention of the government and of parliament. There is the wider issue of the charitable sector and its taxation treatment generally. There is the FBT exemption limit proposal, which I have discussed at some length today. There is also the broader debate about the role the not-for-profit sector ought to play in our community and whether the 
 government is continuing to encourage the constructive and necessary role that that sector provides in our community. This obviously relates to the government's intentions in relation to philanthropy in the community and the role of business in contributing to the charitable and not-for-profit sector.
So there is a wide range of debates that we need to have. I hope I have highlighted some of those issues today. I do not pretend to have all the answers. In terms of the FBT issue, I want to signal that, while the Labor Party remains committed to supporting the proposed exemption, the government has to address the very real problem of the impact on the charitable sector. We have to do something about ensuring that the sector can continue to provide the services to the needy and disadvantaged in our community. We cannot go on blindly supporting the tax policy changes without assessing the real impact on that sector and, more importantly, on the people that they serve.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No. 2) 1998-99</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-03-31,"—We are discussing the appropriation bills which are the legal mechanism for approving government expenditure. I want to make some comments in my contribution to this debate on that theme: the issue of the tax base that provides the revenue for government expenditure and the allegations that have been constantly made about the eroding, broken, indirect tax base—in particular the wholesale sales tax. If we look at the Liberal government's document Tax reform: not a new tax, a new tax system , commonly known as the ANTS package, we see on page 8:
The current tax system is ineffective. It provides a crumbling base from which to derive the necessary revenue to fund the essential government services . . .
It goes on:
The indirect tax base would continue to decline, rates would need to be increased again, and this debilitating cycle would continue.
This is part of the continual campaign by the Liberal government which claims that the current indirect tax system, and particularly the wholesale sales tax system, is broken. That is a claim that is repeated over and over again. 
 In my contribution to this debate I wish to contend that that claim by the Liberal government is fundamentally false. We continue to have claims from the Treasurer, Mr Costello, from the head of Treasury, Mr Evans, and from a range of others that the tax system is broken. As a member of the Senate Select Committee on A New Tax System examining the new tax system and particularly the goods and services tax, we have had a range of submissions from business organisations which repeat the claim that the current indirect tax system is broken. The Business Coalition for Tax Reform, which is prominent in its support of the Liberal government's tax reforms, said on page 6 of its submission:
Over time the present indirect tax base will continue to erode calling into question the longer-term ability of our tax system to provide sufficient revenue to fund the public expenditure through which we finance the health, education and welfare services which are at the heart of the fairness of our community.
It went on:
Leaving the present indirect tax system in place will subject the indirect tax base to ongoing erosion in a relative sense.
Invariably business organisations make this claim and invariably it is not backed up by any substantial research. A long list of assertions is usually given with no hard data to back up the claim. One of the interesting asides in the quote that I have just read to the Senate is that there is an irony in the claims made by both business and this government that we need to bolster the tax base in order to fund health, education and welfare services. The irony is that this government and, indeed, most business groups continue to call for a reduction in expenditure in these areas.
I would like to go to the definition of what is meant by the words `broke' or `broken'. The Shorter Oxford Dictionary refers to `broke' as `without money, penniless, ruined, bankrupt'. The definition of `broken' is `separated forcibly into parts, in fragments, fractured, shattered, burst, split, not intact, financially ruined, bankrupt'. The community view of the definition of `broke' or `broken' would not be substantially different from the definition I have read to the Senate. What is the evidence to back up the propaganda 
 campaign—and it is little more than propaganda—and the claim by this government that the current indirect tax system, particularly the wholesale sales tax, is broken?
Firstly, I refer to the first report of the Senate Select Committee on a New Tax System. We commissioned Professor Dixon to, amongst other things, examine the current and projected revenue from the current indirect tax system. I read from page 199 of that report. He says:
ANTS . . . implies that a major change in indirect taxation is necessary because, without increases in tax rates, the present array of indirect taxes will raise insufficient revenue in relation to Australia's future public sector requirements. However ANTS includes no explicit revenue forecasts.
I will come to that issue a little later. The report continues:
We find no evidence to support the ANTS proposition. As shown in Chart 10.1, in our basecase forecasts, indirect taxes collected by the whole of the public sector grow slightly faster than GDP. These forecasts were made with no changes in ad valorem tax rates.
The bulk of indirect taxes are collected on consumption and intermediate usage of goods and services. In our basecase forecasts collection of consumption taxes is projected to grow at about the same rate as GDP. Amongst the main contributors to these taxes are some fast-growing consumption items (e.g. Electronic equipment, Scientific equipment, Cars, and Entertainment) and some slow-growing items (e.g. Tobacco, Beer and Other Alcoholic drinks).
What Professor Dixon does here is identify an issue that is often missed in the criticisms of the wholesale sales tax. The claim is made that the wholesale sales tax is outmoded, it is tied to manufacturing and it is declining and that is one of the reasons we should have a goods and services tax. But Professor Dixon touches on the fundamental fact that the current wholesale sales tax—albeit indirectly—is linked to an expanding services economy. By attaching a wholesale sales tax to areas such as electronic equipment, scientific equipment, cars and entertainment, it is in effect linked to the expanding services economy. That is one reason Professor Dixon correctly identifies the fact that the current indirect taxation regime will not decline in terms of its collection of revenue.
I would like to refer to further evidence that the current wholesale sales tax is robust in nature. One of the critical documents that has recently been released is a press release of 4 February from the Minister for Finance and Administration entitled `Commonwealth government statement of financial transactions, December 1998'. He attached to that press release a table analysing revenue from sales tax which showed that, for the six months to 31 December 1998, sales tax revenue increased from $7.158 billion to $7.799 billion—an increase of nine per cent. That is almost twice the rate of growth of the economy at the present time. The claim is made that the current wholesale sales tax system is broken, that it is declining, but in the last six-month period for which we have up-to-date figures it is actually going gang busters—a nine per cent increase in the wholesale sales tax. Minister Fahey rightly and proudly boasted:
Tax revenue collections for the six months to December 1998 were 10.3 per cent above collections in the same period last year . . . 
On that very same day, the Treasurer, Mr Costello, said, `There is nobody in Australia that believes the Australian taxation system is working.' He said that on the very same day. He went on to say that anyone who thought the tax system was working must come from another planet. He obviously forgot to check with his own minister for finance on the day he was making these claims because, clearly, the minister for finance thinks the tax system is working very well indeed.
We can go to further evidence about the effective nature of the revenue raising ability of the current indirect tax system. We need look no further than the government's own ANTS document, on page 33. The revenue measures table lists the loss of government revenue as a result of the abolition of the wholesale sales tax and its replacement by a goods and services tax. In 2000-01 the loss of revenue from the WST is a negative $15.3 billion, in 2001-02 it is minus $17.7 billion and in 2002-03 it is minus $18.75 billion. In the relatively limited amount of forward forecasts that we have, from the government's own ANTS document it is apparent that there is going to be an increase in revenue from the 
 wholesale sales tax—rising from $15.3 billion to $18.75 billion ending 2002-03. There is absolutely no hard data or analysis that the current wholesale sales tax, let alone the current indirect tax system, is in crisis or broke or broken.
Access Economics responded to the claims made by Professor Dixon in his report commissioned by the Senate GST committee. Access Economics carried out some analysis of the current wholesale sales tax system—I think this was done, in part, in response to Professor Dixon's claims—and they claimed, in effect, that there would be a decline in the collection of revenue from the current indirect tax system. But if you look at their research carefully—it is titled `Is the Existing Tax System Broken?'—Access destroys the foundation of the claim that the system is broken.
As I said earlier, the Treasurer has always claimed that the sales tax is the weak link in the Commonwealth indirect tax base. The Access research shows that in fact it is the most robust source of Commonwealth indirect revenue into the future. Access claimed that it was eroding by 0.018 per cent of gross domestic product per year, or around $100 million in current money terms. I do not accept Access's claims, but when you look for solid and substantial research that the wholesale sales tax system is in decline, Access says that at worst it is declining by $100 million a year. As a figure standing alone, that sounds like a lot of money, but in the context of the Commonwealth government's current revenue base of $150 billion a year, it is only 0.07 per cent—less than one-tenth of one per cent of current government revenue. It is a minuscule amount, even if we accept the Access Economics figures.
The erosion attributed to the wholesale sales tax is only 20 per cent of that claimed to occur in the Commonwealth indirect tax base. Therefore, by only replacing the wholesale sales tax, the ANTS package cannot credibly fix the problem which the Treasurer claims—and I say claims falsely—exists. If he were really trying to address a loss of long-term indirect tax revenue, the last Commonwealth indirect tax he would look at scrapping would be the wholesale sales tax, because its erosion 
 is less than all other indirect taxes, on the basis of the Access Economics report.
Interestingly, the case for retaining the existing state indirect tax base is made strongly in the report. It claims the erosion of the complete state indirect tax base is also negligible—totalling around 0.026 per cent of gross domestic product, or $150 million in current terms. The report makes another interesting observation, and that is the erosion of revenue from tariffs as a consequence of cuts in the rates of tariffs where there is significant erosion of the indirect tax base. But the Access report is hardly evidence that the tax system is collapsing.
The Labor senators on the Senate select committee—Senators Cook, Conroy and I—have on occasions attempted to find out more about Treasury's long-term forecasts in this area. At the recent Senate estimates hearings, Senator Conroy and I were pursuing this issue about the long-term projections for the current indirect tax system. When we referred to the strength of the current wholesale sales tax, Mr Tilley from the Treasury admitted that `it is a high figure'. This was in reference to the increase in the wholesale sales tax.
We went on to question Treasury about what the long-term revenue estimates were from the wholesale sales tax. Initially, Mr Tilley was somewhat reluctant to acknowledge that any forward research had been done on this issue. It was only when I read out the names of two files from the budget revenue section of the Treasury index file list for the period to June 1998 and gave the title numbers of these files that Mr Tilley admitted that there was some research that had been done, up to the years 2003-04. You would think that, given this is such a central point in the current debate about the tax system, a Treasury official—and Mr Evans, the head of Treasury, was sitting in on this examination—would know what is in these index files about the future revenue projections for the indirect tax system. But no, they did not know. Even when we returned after lunch and I asked them whether they had checked these figures, they still were not willing or able to disclose the revenue projections. Clearly they are afraid of disclosing the revenue projections 
 because they would undermine the continual and false claim made by the Treasurer that the current tax system is broken.
As recently as last week the Tax Commissioner, Mr Carmody, appeared before the Senate committee inquiring into the tax system and was very willing to give information about the compliance costs of exempting food from a goods and services tax. That is his right. But when we proceeded to question Mr Carmody about the compliance costs associated with a goods and services tax and attempted to obtain some detail about the likely compliance costs—in particular the onerous burden on small business and the compliance costs of the current wholesale sales tax system—Mr Carmody could not answer. Here again we have an example of officials—in this case in the tax area and, as I mentioned earlier, in the Treasury—obfuscating, hiding, ducking or weaving with respect to critical information that is necessary in the context of the false claims being made about the current indirect tax system being broke or broken.
This is a claim that is made continually, but it is a false claim. The current wholesale sales tax system is strong, it is robust and it is certainly not broke or broken—as evidenced by Professor Dixon, by Minister Fahey's own press release and by the figures in the government's own ANTS package. It simply is not correct to claim that it is broke or broken and that as a consequence we need a goods and services tax. This is one of those very false arguments that unfortunately has some currency in the general community, but it is a false argument nonetheless and it is no justification for the introduction of an unfair goods and services tax.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No. 2) 1998-99</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1999-03-31,"—I would like to draw to the attention of the Senate a matter of grave concern to some 350 of my constituents who were needlessly and senselessly locked out of their employment by an employer who is intent upon pursuing Mr Reith's industrial relations agenda in the meat industry. On 15 March some 350 employees of the firm G&K O'Connor Pty Ltd of Pakenham in Victoria received the following notice which said:
Dear Employee,
Please find enclosed a Notice of Protected Action in accordance with section 170MO of the Workplace Relations Act 1996  which advises that G&K O'Connor Pty Ltd, being your employer, will be taking protected action in the form of a lockout of all employees, including you, commencing Friday 19 March 1999. The lockout will continue indefinitely.
The letter goes on to say:
This lockout means that you will not be permitted or required to attend at or perform any work for G&K O'Connor Pty Ltd and will not be paid for the period of the lockout.
These 350 workers at O'Connors in Victoria are the latest group of workers who are at risk of losing their livelihood as a direct result of this government's industrial relations policies. It is an issue of extreme importance to the working people of this country that this government's intention is to pursue its extremely damaging and partisan industrial relations agenda—an agenda which is quite simply aimed at crushing workers and depriving them of their capacity to organise through unions, and as a consequence driving down wages and conditions for working people in this country.
It is not just workers themselves that are directly savaged by this gross attack upon the living conditions of Australians; there is a broader agenda being pursued which has enormously damaging consequences for the economy as a whole. In a newspaper article on 24 March 1999, Mr O'Connor acknowledged:
G&K O'Connor is Victoria's second-largest beef processor and the biggest supplier of premium chilled beef to Japan. It has acknowledged that his action will cause a loss of revenue, potential damage to its brand overseas and sour its relationships with cattle suppliers across southern Australia.
But Mr Reith and Mr O'Connor are quite happy to dismiss these profound consequences on a much wider range of workers than just the 350 workers who were employed at O'Connors. They are pursuing a much deeper agenda, which has been expressed on many occasions by Mr Reith, that is aimed at a program to reduce the wages and conditions of working people in this country. This government is quite clearly intent on repre 
 senting the interests of employers to the exclusion of the legitimate rights and concerns of working people. 
In the past, Mr Reith has indicated that his assault upon the trade union movement will concentrate on four industries: the coalmining, building and construction, meat processing, and maritime industries. Despite his defeat against the MUA, Mr Reith has turned his attention to meatworkers and their families. This latest strategy is being enacted, through the actions of Mr O'Connor and his firm down in Pakenham, upon the 350 workers who are now being forced onto the dole queue.
On Tuesday, 23 March, many of these workers gathered in my office. We are seeking to secure for them their legitimate entitlements through the social security system because this action has been undertaken by an employer using fully the powers of the Industrial Relations Act in a most ruthless manner. Under the present social security arrangements, workers are still entitled to social security protection when they have been locked out by their employer through no fault of their own. These are workers that have not engaged in industrial action. They have been subject to the ruthless abuse of this act by an employer who is currently faced with a downturn in the meat industry, and it suits his purpose to subdue the workers and to force them, on the basis of a strategy of starvation, to acquiesce to the claims of the company for reductions in wages and conditions.
It is well known that the legal representatives of this firm, which have recently been identified as those that have been closely associated with Mr Reith, have sought through the Federal Court and the various arguments they have put to advance the case for the prerogative of employers to dispense with workers when and where they see fit and to use workers like they would any other commodity in the production chain. What we have witnessed here is a planned and unjustifiable action by an employer to use the present downturn in the meat industry to strike at the conditions of the meat industry workers in general. It has been an attempt to put private profit before the livelihood of 
 workers and the welfare of many families in Victoria. If he is successful, this will have broader implications for workers right across Australia.
As I have indicated, we have seen this sort of strategy being pursued in a range of industries. We saw recently in Victoria the use of the lockout in the textile industry at the Australian Die Co. We have seen other employers trying to use the draconian legislation that Mr Reith has championed for no reason other than to reduce the capacity of workers to protect themselves in the economy.
We have seen a radical agenda being pursued, which has now been taken up by this particular company in the meat industry. It is unfortunate because O'Connors in Victoria have had a reputation in the past, up until recent times, of conducting themselves in a reasonable manner. As we all know, the meat industry is a particularly difficult area of industrial relations and one where I think questions are pursued with some vigour. But O'Connors have been known in the past to settle agreements on the basis of reasonable consultation. We saw that in the case of the 1995 agreement, which allowed for significant productivity gains to be made by the company and also for significant improvements for workers.
However, with the advent of these actions through this federal government we have seen a complete change in the attitude of employers. In recent discussions we saw a modest claim by the workers employed by O'Connors for a three per cent wage rise over three years, with the productivity improvements of course to counterbalance that, being responded to by O'Connors in a most aggressive and brutal manner, demanding wage cuts of up to 17½ per cent. For some workers that means cuts of $170 per week. In the same article in the Age of 24 March, Mr O'Connor acknowledged this. He said:
The company's proposals would translate into wage reductions for most employees, with more severe wage cuts for small segments of its workforce.
You would have thought that with all the assistance O'Connors is getting from Mr Reith the spin doctors would have been thrown in as well to ensure that, in the lines 
 put out to the public, the employer would adopt, as we have seen in most disputes, the claim of benefits for workers. In this case he is quite clearly acknowledging the substantial reduction in wages and conditions the company is attempting to impose upon workers of this particular meatworks in Victoria.
The demands being made by the employer go to the reduction of overtime payments and public holiday entitlements, and, of course, the extension of working hours. The company is seeking greater productivity increases and is not interested in seeking any trade-offs in return for that. I think it is quite incomprehensible that these huge reductions in wages and entitlements are being sought by an employer who is seeking to use actions which will in themselves damage his own company and which will quite clearly damage the reputation of the Victorian meat industry, especially with international customers.
As I say, I think what we have here is a case where this sort of callous and strategic attack upon the workers is aimed at a much broader agenda. The interests of individual workers and individual firms will be lost in this particular war. It will in fact be counterproductive and will produce quite a serious disadvantage for the meat industry in this country. This government believes that rewards for long-standing, long-serving workers in relatively low paid industries are to be put to one side. This government is actually pursing a policy of the casualisation of the work force. It believes that if it were the case that individual workers were not on a permanent enterprise arrangement they could be dismissed at will and then, of course, employers would receive maximum benefit—this is what they mean by flexibility in industrial relations!
The lock-out has a particular advantage for bosses in this industry because it means that, if any seasonal downturn occurs in the meat industry, you can see workers off the plant without having to pay out their entitlements—their long service leave, holiday pay and other benefits that would have accumulated, which for many workers means very large sums of money. For employers, of course, that means substantial savings. The expectation is that 
 workers will come back, begging to accept reduced wages and conditions that are being presented to them as a fait accompli.
Nothing could be further from the truth—workers will defend their rights and living standards. They are entitled to do so as a result of a long history in this industry which has demonstrated again and again that it is the only way in which to maintain reasonable standards of living. This is a campaign that was outlined by Mr Reith in a speech to an employers conference last year. He indicated that the government was supporting attempts by employers to strip awards that meatworkers had enjoyed. For instance, he sought support from various companies, including the large American firm operating out of Queensland, ConAgra, or AMH, and he was seeking to use provisions of the federal industrial law to allow for the reduction of wages to the lowest common denominator in this country.
This is important not just for the individual workers in Victoria who have been locked out at the moment but, as I say, for the industry as a whole. What is occurring here is that the fundamental question that arises again and again in this industry concerning the issue of competitiveness, which is alleged to be at the core of this dispute, is lost in the real issue—that is, the availability of stock. What has occurred is that a large firm, an international firm, has set up operations in Queensland which have seen the closure, as I understand it, of 10 sheds in that state already, and it is now reaching out through its uncompetitive practices to the destruction of the meat industry right throughout the eastern seaboard of Australia.
The consequence of the various technological changes that have occurred in the transport industry is that the reach of this large American firm is extending right through from Queensland to Victoria. They are operating on the most minimum of wages and conditions and they are forcing changes in work practices in a way which will severely disadvantage meatworks throughout the country. As I say, there is a very simple fact that comes to the fore in the meat industry—that the conditions, prices and competitiveness of the Australian industry depend on the availab 
 ility of stock. If one employer can secure a stranglehold over the supply of stock, they are able to secure a massive advantage over the rest of the industry. That is of course occurring on this particular occasion.
We are being told that attempts to reduce the wages and conditions of workers by up to $170 a week are justified on the basis that there has to be greater competition with this large American firm operating out of Queensland. Various advices coming to this parliament through the Productivity Commission and others have been used to try to justify this sort of position. The truth of the matter is that the situation is a great deal more complex than the government or various individual employers will allow us to hear. As I say, Mr O'Connor could probably do with a bit of advice in terms of his publicity machine because he has let the cat out of the bag concerning his interests in this matter. What we have seen is that this government has tried to use the 20 allowable matters under the federal legislation to reduce the capacity of workers to effectively bargain and defend their conditions in this industry.
It is abundantly clear that in the meat processing industry wages remain one of the smallest components of the total production cost. In the meat processing industry, only about 12 per cent to 15 per cent of the cost of production of meat to the consumer can be attributed to wages. If we examine a whole range of other factors, including transport and other overheads, if we examine the question of marketing, if we examine the question of training and if we examine other issues such as even the exchange rate, we see that there are a great many other factors that go into the price of meat in this country. But what we are being told is that, because meatworkers are the only ones who are vulnerable to this sort of attack, they are the ones who have to suffer the most in terms of attempts by the industry to restructure, to the benefit of the very large employers operating out of Queensland. For instance, 60 per cent of the production cost actually goes into the purchase of stock; 13 per cent goes on transport; and 27 per cent goes on processing of the meat, including a range of charges such as meat 
 inspection, management fees and various other government charges, including workers compensation and payroll tax, and training and recruitment costs.
The direct return to workers, that is, from wages, is estimated to be about 12 per cent of the total cost of production. On this basis, if we were to accept everything that employers may say about the capacity of meatworkers to effect the massive reductions that are being asked of them, the level of the cost reduction for individual consumers would amount to a few cents per kilo off the cost of meat. This government is using employers like O'Connors, and the Productivity Commission reports that we have discussed in this parliament on previous occasions, in an attempt to reduce the conditions of workers, because they are the only ones that are subject to those sorts of vulnerabilities and the only ones subject to the draconian measures of the Industrial Relations Act.
It seems to me that the various reports we have been able to call upon are often presented in a most unrepresentative way. What has to be understood is that for individual workers the scientific studies are often lost in the argument about having to cope with a reduction in wages of $170 a week. The great modelling arguments that we hear among economists often do not take this basic fact into account. There are some 209 to 315 firms producing meat in this country, but for individual workers in each one of those plants the cost of reduction of wages of $170 a week to their families is substantial, while the advantage to consumers of employers getting away with their campaign is minimal. I repeat that the effect on the living standards of workers and their families is substantial.
What needs to be understood is that in Australia the meat industry is extremely important. For many country towns, and particularly in many regional centres, employment in the meat industry remains very important. For individual workers, the capacity to actually be employed is highly significant. These attacks on workers themselves need to be understood in the context of the effect they are having on individuals in the industry. 
We have seen that the maintenance of quality, the cost controls associated with hygiene and the importance of industrial safety are often neglected when we are discussing these questions. We are told, of course, that there is a minority of dishonest and greedy employers who are endangering Australia's international reputation by embarking upon campaigns such as the one we see at O'Connors in Victoria. The studies that have been undertaken and that are often presented to this parliament to defend these sorts of positions, such as the Productivity Commission ones, quite simply do not take account of the consequences of the actions by government on workers and their families.
I say to the Senate that a couple of weeks ago, when I saw my office full of meatworkers who are coming to terms with the cost of these sorts of policies to their individual lives, it brought home to me just how damaging these policies are. Workers are told that their only option is to take the dole for an indefinite period of time, if they are lucky, and I have got no doubt this government will try to prevent them from securing those entitlements. They are expected to live on a couple of hundred dollars a week and to sustain a family on that sort of money. One understands just how dreadful the social consequences are of pursuing the policies that this government is seeking to secure.
We have got to appreciate in this parliament at all times the consequences on people of the policies that we are being asked to pursue. While the government may well get a majority in this parliament to allow these sorts of actions to be taken to turn individual workers into commodities and chattels of employers, when we have circumstances where the powers of the Industrial Relations Commission have been so savagely reduced, one at all times must bear in mind that it is the job of this parliament to express its concern and to take up the fight on behalf of workers whose wages and conditions are being so savagely undermined by the ruthless action of this government, in collusion with a number of employers seeking to take commercial advantage at the expense of so many Australians.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No. 2) 1998-99</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-03-31,"—Having listened to Senator Carr, I can only endorse his remarks at the end about the ruthless, callous nature of some of the actions and decisions of this government. Yesterday we saw a stark demonstration of the contempt that this coalition government has particularly for the hundreds of thousands of people living in the Sutherland Shire and nearby regions. Yesterday Minister Hill, the minister for the environment, announced that the government had decided to go ahead with the construction of a new nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights.
The government likes to describe this as a replacement reactor for the Lucas Heights reactor, because there is one there currently. In fact, there are two there: one of them is shut down, and the HIFAR reactor is due to close in the year 2004. But let us not be under any illusions: this is a decision for a new nuclear reactor, and the people of that region will be subjected to all of the problems attendant on such a disgraceful decision. It will involve as a minimum some $286 million on construction costs. That inevitably will blow out over time. On top of that, if this decision is ultimately implemented—and I predict a huge public outcry as people become aware of the implications of this decision—it means ongoing expenditure of hundreds of millions of dollars over the next 50 to 100 years.
The existing reactor was built in the mid-1950s. After 40 years, it is due to shut down. This new reactor will have a life of some 40 years, so you have all the ongoing maintenance costs and recurrent costs associated with operating this facility. On top of that you have the many millions of dollars associated with the decommissioning of the existing reactor and also, at the end of the next 40 years, the further problem of decommissioning this new reactor. So this is a decision which commits the federal government—this government and, no doubt, future governments if they are saddled with this decision—to hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars of public expenditure on the narrow area of nuclear research. Clearly, that is an area being recognised by other countries around 
 the world as one which is now being replaced in many areas by other forms of technology.
This decision has also been made without allowing time for the Senate committee to bring down its report, which has been scheduled for the end of April—next month. But evidence already produced to the Senate inquiry demonstrates that this government has ignored the very important recommendations of the McKinnon review which handed down its report in 1993. That review said a number of things and I will quote from its conclusions. It stated:
If, at the end of a further period of about five years,
.	 a high level waste site has been firmly identified and work started on proving its suitability
.	 there is no evidence that spallation technology can economically offer as much as or more than a new reactor
. . .              . . .             . . .
it would be appropriate to make a positive decision on a new reactor.
But unfortunately that work has not been done. There has not been a proper examination of alternative technologies to nuclear research. There has not been any proper consideration of alternative sites around Australia other than Lucas Heights.
The simple decision has been made that, because there is already a reactor there, that is the most appropriate place to put a new reactor. But of course in 1958, when the existing reactor was first commissioned, Lucas Heights was considered to be a remote site from Sydney. There are now 100,000-plus people living within a short distance of that facility. That recommendation—to look at alternative sites—has been ignored. The Senate committee has sought information. The government has said, `Yes, we looked at some other sites but we're not going to tell you where we looked or what we looked at.' I do not believe they seriously looked at any alternatives.
In his statement yesterday the minister attempts to rely upon emotional blackmail to justify this decision. He states that the new reactor will be used to produce `lifesaving radiopharmaceuticals'. I do not deny that the Lucas Heights facility produces medical 
 isotopes and pharmaceuticals which are used for very good purposes and to good ends in assisting people suffering from serious illness. But it is a gross overstatement to suggest that because of that factor we need a new nuclear reactor and we need it at Lucas Heights.
Evidence produced to the Senate committee demonstrated, for instance, that many medical isotopes can be produced by other means, such as cyclotrons. Secondly, many countries around the world do not have a nuclear reactor producing medical isotopes; they import them. Thirdly, if it is the case—as ANSTO and the minister argue—that you need this reactor at Lucas Heights to save lives, why is it not the case that every other major city in Australia or in the world does not have a reactor on their doorstep for this purpose? That is a gross overstatement and it distorts the real picture, but it is put to try and play upon people's concerns in this area of health.
The trend is for nuclear research reactors around the world to be closed, not for new ones to be built. People in other countries are looking at new technologies such as spallation technology. This decision involves the expenditure of hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars that could well be used much more effectively by the medical and scientific communities of this country as we enter the new millennium and look at doing major research in health and science. Unfortunately, this government has not considered any of those other options before it has raced into this decision.
I note that the time is approaching when we have to move quickly to another matter. I will have much more to say about this issue and I have no doubt that the community will have much more to say about it, just as they had when this government tried to put a new airport into this area—at Holsworthy—but was forced to back down. I seek leave to continue my remarks later on this most important matter.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,1999-03-31,"—I rise to make some remarks about a matter of importance for a great number of Australians, some 50,000 or so every year, whose marriages end in separation and divorce. Significant steps were taken yesterday in the important policy areas of matrimonial property reform and in superannuation and family law. The Attorney-General, Daryl Williams, has released a discussion paper titled `Property and family law—options for change.' It identifies two options for reforming allocation of matrimonial property law. In a joint announcement with the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women, Senator Jocelyn Newman, the Attorney has announced that the government will reform superannuation and family law to give separated couples greater choice and certainty in settling their financial affairs. I want to deal with each of these issues in turn. 
Firstly, the need for reform of the way in which matrimonial property is distributed when couples divorce has been identified in a number of reviews carried out in the 1980s and 1990s. Some of the recurring criticisms are that the system provides unpredictable results, making it very difficult to advise parties as to the outcome of their applications to the court; that decisions based on discretion—that is, a judge's idea of what is fair and equitable—produce uneven, arbitrary outcomes; that there are in-built biases that favour one or other party; and that the current separate property regime that means until a court decides or parties otherwise agree each party retains the property that he or she had prior to the marriage, and any property acquired in separate names during the marriage, produces unfair results.
Although the court has had a broad discretion to reallocate property interests—based on a range of factors such as length of marriage, age of children and what resources each party has to meet their needs and fulfil their obligations—the separate property regime is thought not to reflect changes that have taken place in society that suggest that more appropriate and responsive ways of dividing up family property are warranted. Undoubtedly, since the inception of the Family Law Act in 1976 the family unit and social mores have changed significantly. The discussion paper identifies a growing recognition and acceptance that both parties to a marriage make an equal contribution to the family, whether as an income earner, a homemaker, a child carer or a combination of all these roles.
Secondly, an increasing tendency to cohabit prior to marriage and to have children at a later age has also had a marked effect, and obviously impacts when it comes to dividing up property when children are very young. Perhaps the most significant change is the increased participation of women in the work force, which has led to women making significant financial contributions as well as making their traditional contribution in the home and looking after children.
Although not identified in the report, I can add from my own now distant experience as a family law practitioner that the increasing 
 incidence of blended families has changed the whole dynamics of family relationships, including a fair regime for the treatment of contributions made to the marriage and property brought into the marriage, and the complications of property settlement for first spouses and first families whilst allowing a provider some ability to establish a new family.
Two options for reform have been put forward for discussion. The first is a separate property regime, very similar to the one we currently have. The major difference between this option and the current law is that the starting point for the distribution of the property would be the principle of equal sharing. That is based on the assumption that each party had contributed equally to the property. The court would however retain its discretion, and rightly so, to depart from the equal sharing principle when it would produce an unfair result—for example, if one party owned a home prior to marriage and perhaps the marriage had only survived for a very short time.
The second option, which is very interesting and much more radical, is the community of property regime under which communal assets are divided. They are defined to be assets acquired during a period of living together or marriage by each of the parties, whether they acquired them separately or jointly, and the net increase in value over the period the parties lived together of all the property that has been acquired. On marriage breakdown, each party would get 50 per cent of the communal assets. There would be no need for the usual protracted case that we have at the moment where we look at what each party has contributed. However, there would be an ability for the court to depart from the fifty-fifty sharing in certain circumstances.
This is the regime that applies in some states in America, perhaps most infamously in California. However, most of the states retain separate property regimes. The Californian community property system is based on the idea of marriage as a partnership. The starting point for determining whether property is community or separate is the general rule that property acquired by either spouse during the 
 marriage is community property. There are obviously some exceptions such as property acquired by way of a gift or inheritance by one party only; property acquired by using the separate property of one or other of the parties; and property acquired after the parties have split up or the parties make it separate property by agreement—prenuptial agreements and otherwise.
One consequence of defining communal property as being property acquired during the time parties lived together is that property built up in an earlier marriage would be excluded. Property that often comes into contention is that which has been in the family for generations. For example, as frequently happens, a family farm or business would be excluded. This would provide immediate but not absolute protection for prior owned property of that kind. It is an interesting option to consider and one that the government has invited consultation on and submissions about.
The proposed reforms to superannuation and family law are also long overdue. The problems were flagged over 10 years ago, and yet nothing was done by the previous government to address the unfairness that many divorced parties suffered by the Family Court being unable to deal directly with superannuation. Under the proposed reforms couples will be able to make binding superannuation arrangements which will apply if the relationship fails. Where partners cannot agree—with or without mediation or counselling, which is also part of the regime—the Family Court will have jurisdiction to decide how accumulated superannuation entitlements can be apportioned fairly and equitably and also to direct superannuation trustees to divide superannuation in the name of one or the other spouses between them. Superannuation trustees will either create a new account or arrange a rollover of the new interest in the superannuation fund, otherwise the superannuation interest will be preserved as if it had never been divided.
The reform proposals outlined in the paper are limited to superannuation in the so-called accumulation phase—that is, the period before the member spouse has become eligible to 
 receive a benefit. The superannuation proposals therefore have two core components. The key reform is the establishment of a regime to enable superannuation interests to be divided. This is not an option that is currently available to separating parties nor to the Family Court if the parties seek a decision from the court. That is why it is necessary to make legislative changes to make it possible.
To date, the Family Court has been able to deal with superannuation only by trading it off or offsetting it against other property entitlements—that is, looking at the entire property that might be available to one or other of the parties and setting it off against some other asset. Of course, that can lead to great injustice and unfairness because superannuation could be the biggest asset the parties have and you often find that the spouse with the superannuation entitlement is left with very little to live on.
There is great difficulty for and unfairness to the non-superannuated party in assessing the full value of an interest. That happens particularly, for example, in a defined benefit superannuation account. The objective of this reform is twofold. Firstly, the reform will increase the financial options available for couples in the event of marriage breakdown and provide parties with greater flexibility to meet their current and future needs. Secondly, by taking into account the full value of the superannuation interests of both spouses, the reform increases the ability of the court to make more equitable property settlements.
To facilitate this process for the court, this legislation would establish a presumption that the superannuation interests of the parties built up during the time they have lived together would be divided equally between them. In defined circumstances the court would be able to depart from the presumption of a fifty-fifty split of superannuation. This would be, for example, where the interest was too small; where there were multiple superannuation interests—both spouses may have more than one; where there were concerns perhaps in relation to housing for children and others; or where an income producing asset such as a business might be required to be sold. In these types of cases the fifty-fifty 
 split of superannuation would be achieved by allowing former spouses to trade off other matrimonial property of equal value from their entitlement to a future share of superannuation, much as is the case at present.
The central reform of the proposal—to enable the division of superannuation between former spouses in the event of matrimonial breakdown—has received widespread support from the superannuation industry. I recall making a contribution in this place over a year ago on this very topic. Since that time, the proposals have been out with the superannuation industry and others for comment, and the response has been overwhelmingly in favour.
A key aspect of the proposals is the ability to arrive at a proper valuation of the superannuation interest. In the case of accumulation schemes it is pretty straightforward, as the valuation is determined by contributions made plus the interest earned less the administrative charges. But as I mentioned a little earlier, in the case of defined benefits schemes, the legislation will prescribe a set of valuation factors to enable parties to arrive at a value which reflects the true worth of the superannuation interest. Indeed, trying to calculate the payout of a future entitlement when the scheme has been a defined benefits one has been a serious problem in the past. It is proposed that parties who divide their superannuation interests on marriage breakdown will be  taxed at the point at which they become entitled to a payout, as if each had accumulated the superannuation in their own names. No tax would be payable at the point of division—at a time when the parties usually most desperately need some financial assistance.
It is proposed that non-contributing spouses would be required to preserve their interest—that is, to hold the interest until they retire or satisfy some other condition of release. The usual provisions governing release of benefits on severe hardship grounds would apply to the superannuation interests transferred to non-contributing spouses.
I have already said that these reform proposals are well overdue. The options for reform of matrimonial property division are now out 
 for discussion. The superannuation proposals have been extensively canvassed. Together, these two initiatives will go a considerable distance towards addressing inequities in family law that are of concern to so many Australians and towards bringing about greater fairness and certainty for the many thousands of Australian couples and their children who suffer the emotional heartbreak, the social dislocation and the financial hardship of separation and divorce.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Matrimonial Property Reform</title>,Matters of Public Interest,6,1,speech
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1999-03-31,"—I rise today to respond to an outrageous claim by the Prime Minister over the weekend. In a speech to the Victorian State Council of the Liberal Party on Saturday, Mr Howard said: 
I defy anyone to name a government in Australian political history that actually took a detailed reform plan to the Australian economy in a fundamental area such as taxation, to the Australian people, laid it all out in detail and said vote for us or against us, on the basis of this plan.
Leaving to one side the fact that the majority of Australians did not actually vote for the coalition—they voted against them—this false claim forms one more link in a mantra from the Prime Minister and his Treasurer which is demonstrably untrue. Was the taxation reform plan laid out in detail before the election? Absolutely not. No, no, a thousand times no. Was the Senate justified in pursuing a comprehensive inquiry into the tax package? Yes, yes, a thousand times yes.
I want to look today at the changes which the government has made to its own tax package, which is fast becoming a moveable feast, which belie the Prime Minister's claim that all the detail was taken to the people during the election.
There was no legislation released before polling day at all, just the ANTS outline. It was an outline which then formed the core pitch of a $17 million misleading taxpayer contribution to the Liberal Party's re-election campaign, highlighting tables showing how much better off people were supposed to be—tables which have since been debunked by six university professors and the Bureau of Statistics, appearing before the Senate inquiry, who all agree that Treasury used the wrong figures.
Putting that aside, what has happened since the election? Sixteen bills were introduced into the parliament in December last year with a demand that this chamber pass them forthwith, yet even the government acknowledge that they had made changes between the ANTS outline and the legislation, in the areas of charities and cars.
They also began the mantra that these bills were the true representation of what the people voted for, anyway, and therefore they should not be changed by the parliament. A 17th bill was snuck in shortly after, to form a package of 17 bills. Then last week, a further 12 new bills were added to the package, representing significant changes to Peter's perfect package in a number of areas. The wine industry is one of those areas which was most surprised by what was contained in them.
Today, a further two bills are to be introduced into the House of Representatives. So it has ballooned out from 16 to 31 bills—and we are still counting. This week the Senate, in our usual spirit of cooperation, agreed to debate two of the original 16 bills with early start-up dates, ahead of the 19 April report by the Senate references committee, which was the original agreement. We not only debated them; we passed them. However, these bills passed with 15 amendments which were sponsored by the government—again, representing significant changes.
Did the government take the tax package to the election `laid all out in detail' as John Howard claims? No, of course not. Not even the original package of bills had it `laid all out in detail'. And the evidence which bells the cat on this one is not Democrat sponsored. It is provided by the actions of the government itself.
They have so far added 13 bills to the original package of 16 which was rammed through a compliant House of Representatives without any scrutiny by the executive. They have foreshadowed a further two bills to be introduced today, which signals the start of what will no doubt be a deluge of government changes to their own package.
It is also important to stress that, within just the first two of the original bills passed by the Senate, the government itself sponsored 15 amendments. If we look at the bills that we are dealing with, we are probably looking at at least 232 amendments by the government—and that is before any non-government amendments are discussed, or any more bills are introduced.
Yet this government has the cheek to say that the package was set out in all its detail before the election. Clearly, the ANTS outline was flawed and their original package of bills was poorly drafted. Yet the Prime Minister had the gall to say on the weekend that he took this package in all its detail to the last election. He went on to say, in the same speech:
In the weeks ahead the Australian Senate will have a decision to make in relation to that plan. And I want to say to you with all of the conviction that I can muster, that the government has absolutely no intention of retreating from the responsibility to implement that plan that was given to us by the Australian people in October last year.
As I have already shown, in the massive changes undertaken by the government, they have already retreated on the ANTS outline. It is passing strange that the government should believe that they have a licence to make changes to their tax package but no other parliamentarian does. This is absurd. It only makes sense if you truly believe, as I am sure many in the ministry believe, that the executive should be left alone and not subjected to any parliamentary scrutiny at all, that they should simply run the country. I am very happy to be on the side of the parliament.
I said in a speech earlier this year that it was sometimes uncomfortable to stand between the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and absolute power, by dint of our position in this chamber. There are also days when it suits me very well. Last week was one of them. A cooperative Senate voted through one of the original tax bills with 15 government amendments. More importantly, it also contained a single non-government amendment, accepted by the government. It is, I believe, the first of many amendments to come.",SENATE,"<title>TEXTOR, MR MARK</title>",<title>Tax Reform: Legislative Package</title>,Miscellaneous,7,1,speech
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-03-31,"—My question is to Senator Hill in his capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Trade. Can the minister 
 inform the Senate precisely what contribution the following government measures have made to Australia's disastrous second successive record monthly trade deficit: the government's $359 million budget cuts to our trade programs; the government's 30 per cent cut to the Austrade budget over the last three years compared with the previous three years; and the government's 25 per cent cut to the Export Market Development Grants Scheme?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Economy: Trade Figures</title>,Questions Without Notice,9,1,question
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-03-31,"—Of course, the structural strength of the economy is due to the reforms 
 made during the Labor government, and the problem with the current account deficit is that we are not exporting enough. Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. Minister, won't you acknowledge that the government's ill-conceived and short-sighted cuts to these trade programs have at the very least contributed to making a difficult trade situation worse? Won't you acknowledge that fact? Can you guarantee that the government will rectify those cuts to our export incentive programs in the coming budget?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Economy: Trade Figures</title>,Questions Without Notice,9,1,question
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1999-03-31,"—The trade figures reflect the fact that we have such a strong domestic economy with the background of basically a weak external situation. To some extent, therefore, our trade figures are not as good as we might like, because of the fact that we have done so well as a government and have put in place the conditions under which the Australian economy is booming in the way it is now. It was interesting last night to hear the deputy editor of the Economist  referring to the miracle economy of Australia and saying how extraordinary it is with the background of the very weak circumstances existing in Asia at the moment.
Of course, it is not a miracle at all; it has occurred through sound economic management, taking hard but difficult decisions that have enabled expenditure to be significantly cut, interest rates to be reduced to their lowest level in 30 years, inflation to be at a record low level, and jobs to be increased in this country. That is the circumstance that has led to a very powerful domestic economy with growth of over four per cent; and that is tending to suck in exports, not surprisingly, whilst at the same time our export markets are weak because of the weakness of our partner economies. That is particularly reflected in relation to figures for commodities at the moment. They are the facts of the matter.
What is comforting is that, because of its strong domestic economy, Australia can withstand difficult external accounts much better than it was able to under Labor. I guess that is just another reason why this government should be applauded for taking those hard decisions, most of which were opposed by the Labor Party.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Economy: Trade Figures</title>,Questions Without Notice,9,1,answer
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1999-03-31,"—I will not concede that; but what I do say is that the answer for the future is to strengthen the domestic economy even further—and the way to do that is with further reform and, in particular, taxation reform. We have been able to reform our expenditure and industrial relations, but what we badly need is to complement that with taxation reform, to introduce an efficient, contemporary taxation system that encourages exports. And what system will encourage exports more than one which has a GST but has no GST on exports? If you are seriously interested in the external accounts, Senator Cook, you should support the government—
Senator Cook interjecting—
—Order, Senator Hill. Senator Cook, it is your question and your supplementary question, and you have been interjecting persistently throughout. There is an appropriate time to debate this matter and it is after question time.

—Wrong!
—Order! Senators should appreciate that Senator Herron needs to hear the question.
—Isn't it also a fact that these items attract only a 12 per cent sales tax applied to the wholesale price, as opposed to the government's GST, which will see a 10 per cent tax applied to the retail price, thus making these items more expensive under the 
 GST than they would be under the existing tax system?
—The supplementary question is based on totally false premises, and I would ask Senator Conroy: when have you been to an Aboriginal community?

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-03-31,"—My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, Senator Ian Macdonald. Is the minister aware that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority is now restructuring the positions of flying operations inspectors, who are responsible for regulating standards for Australian licensed pilots, to auditing positions? Is he aware that there will be no requirement for the flying operations inspectors to actually fly to assess pilot skills and operating standards but that they will simply audit from the ground an increasingly self-regulated and self-administered industry? When will the government step in to prevent any further erosion of the current levels of pilot and operating standards?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Civil Aviation Safety Authority: Flying Operations Inspectors</title>,Questions Without Notice,13,1,question
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-03-31,"—I take it from that answer that the minister is saying that the government would not step in to prevent any further erosion of current levels of pilot and operating standards. If you do not know the answer to this next question, you might take it on notice. Are you aware that the International Civil Aviation Organisation is due to conduct an assessment of civil aviation safety management in Australia in August this year? Does the minister believe that ICAO will endorse the practice of flying operations inspectors being land based auditors?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Civil Aviation Safety Authority: Flying Operations Inspectors</title>,Questions Without Notice,13,1,question
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,1999-03-31,"—I appreciate a question on aviation safety because it does enable me to indicate yet again the confidence the government has in the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation. There were four parts to Senator O'Brien's question. Three of them asked whether I was aware of certain particular incidents. As it is not directly my portfolio, I cannot confess to being absolutely aware of the three matters, although I have read various newspaper reports. I can assure Senator O'Brien, though, that the Minister for Trans 
 port and Regional Services, Mr Anderson, would be aware of those three issues that he raised.
The fourth thing he asked was when the government was going to do something about it. Time and time again I suggest that the worst thing that could happen to air safety in Australia is if the likes of Senator O'Brien or me were to start directing air safety. That is a very technical job. It is a job for technical people to handle. Of course, CASA does have professional people, as does BASI.

I am not allowed to answer that under Senate standing orders even were I minded to. But can I come back to the first part of Senator O'Brien's so-called supplementary question and repeat yet again that the government properly leaves matters of air safety to the professionals. The day we let Senator O'Brien and others start determining what professional air safety matters should be—
—Dick Smith?
—Dick Smith was a lot more professional than you, Senator. He knew a lot more about it. You come from the Transport Workers Union. I do not think you even had a truck licence, yet you were in the Transport Workers Union. Mr Dick Smith at least can fly, and he is a very able, very professional Australian. They are the sort of

That the Senate—
(a) notes that:
	 (i)	 the base for calculation of the superannuation guarantee and the Liberals' new superannuation tax or `surcharge' are substantially different, the latter including most forms of income such as overtime whereas the former excludes many forms of income such as overtime,
	 (ii)	 the superannuation guarantee still allows some employees to use a base for calculating the superannuation guarantee that is less than the definition of ordinary time earnings,
	 (iii)	 as a consequence, some employees are receiving superannuation guarantee payments based on incomes less than $73,000 a year (the starting point for the operation of the superannuation tax or `surcharge') but are being assessed for the superannuation tax or `surcharge', and 

	 (iv)	 this unfairness is highlighted by employees at the Pasminco, Roseberry mine operation where the earnings base for superannuation guarantee contributions by the employer is $24,900 per annum but earnings range from $68,000 to $80,000 a year, requiring the payment of the Liberals' superannuation tax or `surcharge' by a significant proportion of the workforce; and
—That was also possible under your arrangements.
—Senator Watson, we did not introduce the superannuation tax. You introduced it.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-03-31,"—Pursuant to contingent notice, I move:
That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Brown moving a 
 motion relating to the conduct of business of the Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to general business notice of motion No. 173.
Once again we are in the situation where the opposition has moved to prevent a vote on an extremely important matter of public interest in Australia and overseas. The Labor Party's situation in this is dictated by the government. If the government assents to the motion, the Labor Party allows it to go through; if the government does not, the Labor Party refuses to have a vote on it. It is an extraordinary situation where Her Majesty's opposition in the Senate is having the business of foreign affairs in so far as these motions are concerned dictated by the government's position on any given occasion. I hope that the ALP will have a look again at that situation.
I know the arguments that Senator Faulkner may put forward on this but they fall short of the mark when we consider the importance of such matters as the recent dastardly treatment of San Suu Kyi in Burma with the death of her husband. It was a situation where she obviously could not leave the country because the military dictatorship would have prevented her coming back. Though she is the legitimately elected head of government in that country, she is denied her rightful place as leader of the Burmese people because of the military junta's refusal to accept the democratic vote of the Burmese people. She was in the situation where her husband was dying of cancer in Britain, but he was refused entry to Burma to see her before he died. The situation is so horrible that she cannot even leave the country to go to his funeral.
 At a personal level, this brings home what a wretched lot of people the ruling dictatorship in Burma are. On a much wider level, however, the extraordinary deprivation of human rights and the horrible circumstances in which many Burmese people live are not so well known amongst Australians. In Burma tens of thousands of people are drafted into work camps, are living in subhuman conditions, are forced to work as slaves on such so-called developmental projects as roads, quarries, dam building and so on, and are suffering enormously out of the view of the rest of the world. I should add that were this motion 
 in either the US Senate or the US Congress it would pass with no trouble. Part of the motion reads:
. . . calls on the Australian Government to suspend trade and investment in Burma until a tripartite dialogue within Burma leads to meaningful democratic reforms and an end to human rights violations.
This is what the United States government has done. It is not what the Australian government has done because, again, trade gets in the way of humanitarian ideals—no matter how grossly human rights are being violated by dictatorships elsewhere in the world.
 I might also remind the Senate of the powerful condemnation of the Burmese military by the United Nations in successive votes for the dreadful way in which it is treating the people of Burma, not least such minority groups as the Karen. This is a matter that ought to be debated in this Senate. This is a matter which seems to have gone off the public record as far as Australian government affairs are concerned. When circumstances arise such as the democratically elected head of state in Burma being denied her rightful position and then even being denied ordinary civilities when the death of her partner occurs, it is time for us to be debating such matters in the Senate.
The Greens are concerned about that human rights situation and want the matter dealt with. The Greens believe this is an urgent matter and that it is the right time to be joining the rest of the world in condemning the military junta in Burma. The Senate has a right to debate and to vote on such matters.",SENATE,<title>BURMA</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,23,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,1999-03-31,"—I do not wish to detain the Senate for any great length of time but, given what we have heard, as a government we should be putting our point of view across as to why we are opposed to the suspension of standing orders. As I understand it, a very similar motion to this was carried yesterday by the Senate, and we supported that as a government.
—Madam Deputy President, I raise a point of order. I would make it clear that the motion moved yesterday was very 
 different from the motion we are considering now.
—There is no point of order.
—I think that intervention by Senator Brown shows the lack of sincerity in which this matter is being approached by him. A very similar motion was considered by this Senate yesterday and, as I understand it, had the unanimous support of this chamber. We are now getting a revamped version with Senator Brown's motion, and he is then asking for the suspension of standing orders when we have basically dealt with the matter yesterday.
—That is not true, and you know it is not true.
—Order! Senator Brown, you were heard in silence. Please allow Senator Abetz to be heard in silence.
—The government has no difficulties with the first two sections of Senator Brown's motion that deal with the profound regret and sympathy in the wake of the recent personal tragedy of the leader of the opposition on the death of her husband. We also note the reports of the ongoing nationwide tragedy of the people in Burma.
However, Senator Brown's motion goes on to suggest that we should call on the Australian government to suspend trade and investment in Burma, which is something that we as a government do not believe should necessarily occur at this stage. What often happens when one does that is that it is the people who suffer while, unfortunately, the junta and the government continue. We are not sure that the suggestion being made by Senator Brown is of real benefit to those that I am sure all of us in this chamber are wanting to support and to whom we would all wish to send our very best wishes and best hopes for the future.
It is a tragic situation that confronts the Burmese people. It is a matter of deep regret that even though the leader of the opposition would have been allowed out of the country to visit her ailing husband, the reality is she would never have been allowed back in. I think that is why she made a very tough 
 decision not to visit her husband before his death. Those sorts of circumstances are not supported by anybody in this chamber. We have expressed our views on that yesterday. We as a government believe the Senate would be better placed spending its time moving on to an issue beside the one we have already dealt with yesterday.",SENATE,<title>BURMA</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,23,1,speech
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-03-31,"—The Labor Party's position on formality in foreign policy issues has been spelt out a number of times. I again refer the Senate, and Senator Brown in particular, to the Hansard  of 27 May 1998, page 3245, where Senator Faulkner says:
In cases where there is not unanimous agreement on such motions, the opposition will not be agreeing to formality. We take the view that foreign policy motions should not be decided without debate.
It is clear from what Senator Abetz says that there is not unanimous agreement on this motion; therefore, for all the reasons outlined in the Hansard  on that day, the opposition has not agreed to formality on this occasion. That will continue to be our policy.",SENATE,<title>BURMA</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,23,1,speech
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,1999-03-31,"—As Senator Abetz said, there was a motion similar to part (a) of this motion moved and passed by the Senate yesterday. It was passed without dissent and I thank the Senate for that. It was very strong on the tragedy of the death of Dr Michael Aris and gave the Senate's condolences to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and her two sons, Alexander and Kim.
I agree with the other two parts to Senator Brown's motion—I have agreed with them for years and years. I have tried to put them up as recommendations of committees and goodness knows what. I am not sure that now is exactly the time, considering the disallowances, to debate this, but I think and always will that the debate on human rights probably comes before everything else. I would vote for speaking on this before we speak on the Australia-West Indies cricket test and why it was not on free to air, which the opposition has put up, to come on later today. This is probably more important, but it was not put 
 up as a matter of public importance this morning and the other one was.
I do think it is a very important motion and I do think that it was very important that the Senate send our condolences to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, which we did, and that the Senate condemn in no uncertain terms, which we did, the treatment of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi by the State Peace and Development Council, formerly known as the SLORC, of Burma—the military junta.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-03-31,"—This is a different motion, as has been pointed out, in a couple of respects, and they have been mentioned in relation to the noting of the depth of problems associated with the decision by the government and in relation to the urgent need for the Australian government to realise that the so-called `constructive engagement policy' is not actually working to any great extent.
I take umbrage at the statement by Senator Abetz that the people of Burma might be upset that we would pass this motion. During the discussions about apartheid in South Africa, I heard from a number of people that it was actually the people of South Africa who were asking countries like Australia to not trade and not participate in sporting events and so on. I have also spoken to a number of people in Australia who have been and still are highly traumatised from unfair imprisonment and torture in Burma and they want to see Australia participating and taking a responsible and useful role. If it means that we do not trade, that is what they are asking for. That is what they themselves are asking Australia to do—that we do not reward Burma, for instance, by continuing to encourage their membership of South-East Asian associations and so on. The SLORC government has used the nod and wink acceptance of their membership into those organisations to indicate that they are legitimate and their actions are legitimised. Unfortunately that has been the case on more than one occasion.
The issues are urgent. It is not a matter of this issue of trade being a new issue; it has been on the cards for a long time. The Greens 
 have certainly mentioned it on more than one occasion that I can recall—writing a dissenting report in relation to constructive engagement. I do believe that we can no longer shove these things under the carpet. I am indicating that I support the motion to debate this issue further.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-03-31,"—Today the Labor Party is raising a matter of public importance—an issue of great significance to the millions of sports fans throughout Australia. It is the dismal lack of coverage of the current Australian cricket tour of the West Indies. It is a matter of great concern to Australian cricket fans that, in the absence of a subscription to Foxtel, the only coverage available is a sporadic and inadequate ABC radio commentary.
I invite senators to consider the facts. There is not one minute's live coverage of either test or one-day cricket on this tour on free-to-air television. There is no highlights package on free-to-air television. What is left is an ABC 
 broadcast which runs through the night but ceases at six o'clock on most mornings as the regular breakfast shows go to air. This can mean up to 3½ hours of commentary is lost.
Senators do not need to be reminded of the great significance to Australian sports fans of any cricket test series. Historically, the rivalry between Australia and the West Indies is great, and I think this latest series has served to remind us why that is the case. Both sides of this chamber acknowledge that the availability of test cricket coverage is a matter of public importance.
It was a little over four years ago when the then ALP government was the target of significant criticism from the coalition on the matter of television coverage of the 1995 Australian cricket tour of the West Indies. In March of that year, the Senate was subjected to a full-frontal assault by Liberal Party senators, who expressed their great concern at the prospect that coverage of the tour would be limited to a small pay television provider and would thereby be lost to the average cricket fan. Senators Alston, Ferguson, Crane and Tierney, among others, stood in this chamber and—with all the sincerity that they could collectively muster—pleaded with the government to guarantee that the Australian viewing public would not be denied their right to watch our team in action in the Caribbean.
Senator Tierney went as far as putting to this chamber a motion that condemned the government for its failure to act to ensure free-to-air coverage. It accused the responsible minister of buck-passing, insisted that the minister—not the television networks—take responsibility for ensuring free-to-air coverage and, last but not least, demanded that the government act to protect the rights of millions of low income viewers who relied on free-to-air television to see the West Indies cricket telecast.
At about the same time, Senator Tierney breathlessly invoked Australian cricketing achievement. He highlighted this in a media statement dated 28 February 1995. In that statement he posed the question: `What is the closest ever winning result in the history of test cricket?' He answers, `On the last West 
 Indies tour of Australia, the Windies won in Adelaide by one run—the closest ever winning result in over 100 years of test cricket.' Then he delivers the punchline: `It could so easily happen again. But if it does, will we get to see it?' Well, it did happen. It happened this morning when the West Indies won a very close test cricket match. The television ratings for the Adelaide test that Senator Alston referred to were 42 per cent. This morning the ratings were zilch; zero; nothing at all; nought.
In 1995 it seemed that Senator Alston really cared about the cricket fans of Australia and was horrified at the prospect that they may be denied access to coverage of cricket. When we revisit the 1995 debates we discover that, while Senator Alston opened the bowling for the Liberal Party, there was no shortage of trundlers on that side of the chamber—the opposition benches—to follow him.
On 2 March 1995, Senator Tierney put a motion to the chamber which condemned the government's inaction on the matter of free-to-air telecasts of the West Indies cricket tour. In his speech, he insisted that the minister keep his promise that viewers would not be forced to pay to watch major sporting events. At the time, his conviction seemed sincere; where does it stand now? Has he approached the minister and railed against the evils of pay television and supported the rights of low income earners? Very unlikely. Has he delivered on behalf of Australia's cricketing public? No, of course he has not. His contribution in 1995 was clearly no more sincere than that of Senator Alston; his performance no less guilty of overacting.
Of course he is not alone in that. Senator Ferguson, on the same day, berated the then government for failing to intervene. The market, he told the Senate, had failed and it was the minister's responsibility to act quickly to ensure free-to-air coverage. Misty eyed, he pleaded across the chamber to us: `What about the low income earners in Australia?' Well, what about the low income earners in Australia? The same low income earners, because of the direct intervention of the then Labor government in 1995, were able to watch full, live and uninterrupted telecasts 
 from the Caribbean. I invite Senator Ferguson to rise in the chamber today and explain to Australia's cricket fans why he no longer defends their right to free-to-air telecasts, as he so passionately did then. What exactly has changed? Why hasn't he been knocking on the door of the minister—demanding intervention, pleading the case for ordinary Australians on this issue? Are we simply to assume that, like Senators Tierney and Alston, Senator Ferguson was engaged in nothing more than political puffery of the most opportunistic kind?
Senator Crane described the issue as `an absolute tragedy for the education processes of young people in this country and their ability to see the very best'. I agree with Senator Crane. Of course it is crucial for the development of future sporting talent in the country that there is wide exposure of Australian sporting endeavour. It was partly in recognition of this that the Labor government did act in 1995 to deliver free-to-air coverage. So I ask Senator Crane: if it was important for the education of Australia's young just four years ago, what could possibly have changed in the meantime? Why hasn't he stood up in the Liberal Party room and made the point? Why hasn't he written to the minister? Can this senator point to one single act on his part to protect those young Australians he spoke of? Senator Crane joins his colleagues in a shameful line-up of inaction from the Liberal Party. The clamouring protesters of 1995 have been reduced to absolute silence in 1999.
The Liberal Party's criticism of the Labor government and Mr Lee in 1995 was over the antisiphoning list Labor had introduced to try to ensure free-to-air coverage of major sporting events. It was a sincere effort by the Labor government to respond to the policy challenges that were presented by the advent of pay television in this country. It was by no means a perfect formula, and we were aware at the time that changes may well need to be made. But let us look at the results. Despite the teething problems that were associated with the antisiphoning list, when the crunch came, Labor delivered. As a result of the proactive intervention of the then Labor 
 minister, Mr Lee, every cricket fan in Australia had access to full, live and uninterrupted coverage of the 1995 test series.
Let us bring the clock forward four years from that time. Let us impose the same scrutiny on the current minister for communications in the Howard government. Today, under Senator Alston's stewardship, the Australian cricket follower has been almost totally shut out from the current tour of the West Indies unless they subscribe to Foxtel. Has the minister negotiated simulcast arrangements with free-to-air broadcasters, as was the case in 1995? No. Has the minister been able to ensure that an adequate highlights package is available to free-to-air broadcasters? No such luck.
We have some questions for Senator Alston. In the years since the minister so eloquently invoked our nation's love of cricket in the name of free-to-air coverage, what on earth has happened? Where has all the love gone from Senator Alston? Don't Australian cricket fans matter to Senator Alston anymore? When did Senator Alston stop caring about Australian cricket fans? If Senator Alston recalls any of his legal training, he must surely appreciate the notion of precedent. His words in 1995:
If Australian cricket fans are denied a free and direct telecast, the blame will rest squarely on Mr Lee's shoulders.
Mr Lee did not need to be told that. That is why it was Labor's minister for communications who successfully negotiated an arrangement whereby there was free-to-air coverage of the 1995 tour. Today, under the coalition government, Australian cricket fans are denied a free and direct telecast, and the blame rests squarely on the shoulders of the current communications minister, Senator Richard Alston.
Senator Alston's performance over the 1995 tour has been exposed for what it was: a cynical mix of feigned outrage and crocodile tears. His eyes were focused directly on the political main chance. He shamelessly tapped into a rich vein of affection for cricket in our community—the same affection that we have in this country for sport generally. This was not really about the rights of cricket fans, it was not really about the principle of free-to- 
air coverage of a national sporting event, and it certainly was not about his so-called concerns for low income earners who could not afford pay television. It was about scoring political points in the only sport that Senator Alston has ever cared about—political one-upmanship.
Senator Alston is the minister who told Mr Lee in 1995 that the buck stopped with Mr Lee. He said, `Stand up to the media heavyweights. Stand up for the little guy who loves his cricket and can't possibly afford to watch it.' As Senator Alston has shown so often in the past, his words speak so much louder than his actions. His fiery rhetoric in opposition is replaced by timid inaction in government, and the minister deserves no less than to be judged by his own standard. There is no free and direct telecast. He is the minister, it is his responsibility and he has failed that responsibility. The reason he has failed is that he is not really in charge of his portfolio at all. Every senator knows that the real minister for communications is the Prime Minister, Mr Howard.
We sympathise with Senator Alston because we know that his portfolio is often susceptible to prime ministerial interference, but I can remember no time when a minister has so placidly rolled over and accepted his role as a doormat with so little protest. Senator Alston might be the front man, he might have his face on the letterhead and on the departmental home page, but I have to say that that is about it. The Prime Minister knew that in Senator Alston he had the classic Clayton's minister—that there was no danger that the minister's intellectual rigour, work ethic and policy grasp would represent a threat in any way to the Prime Minister's total and complete domination over Senator Alston's portfolio.
It is not a matter of a minister being rolled. We all know that in any government ministers get rolled on policy matters from time to time. But we also know that in order to get rolled you have to be in there battling for something—taking a position, arguing a point. Senator Alston never does that. He picks up his ministerial salary cheque, no doubt enjoys his subsidised cabinet room banqueting and 
 revels in his globetrotting. But he is an incompetent minister who has no control over the agenda in his department. He has treated Australian cricket followers with absolute contempt, and his Senate colleagues stand arm-in-arm with him as he presides over one of the shabbiest arrangements we have ever had for cricket coverage in modern cricket history. We say that this is insincerity in the extreme on the part of Senator Alston. It is total hypocrisy on a matter of vital importance to sport loving Australians.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-03-31,"—It is, I guess, fantastic in one respect to have for the history books of Australia a record at the end of March 1999 that shows where the Australian Labor Party in the federal parliament stood on the great national issues.
—This is a motion you moved four years ago, you goose.
—It will show the record of this very noisy but discredited opposition at the end of March 1999, only a few months before the turn of the millennium, when Australia was situated in a region with economic instability, where we had to move Australia to a new era in terms of our economy to get rid of the dead hand of the failed Labor policies.
—Is the minister coming in or not?
—Of course the minister is coming here, but he will come here when it suits him, not when it suits Senator Ray or Senator Murphy. I must apologise on behalf of the minister to all honourable senators that he is not able to leave consideration of telecommunications and broadcasting issues to race down to the chamber today to debate with Senator Ray, a distinguished former minister, on whether or not we can get a free-to-air telecast of the cricket.
The fundamental proposition put by this motion is in fact that we should have the broadcasting decisions of the four, as it is, 
 major free-to-air networks in Australia determined from the ministerial office in this building. That is what we have determined. After 15 minutes of his typical sledging, diatribe and name calling which he gets away with day in and day out here, the one thing that Senator Faulkner said that was accurate—and I do not know whether he said this, but he implied it—was that the antisiphoning laws that govern this country were put in place by the former government. That is the law that determines whether or not free-to-air television receives cricket. When you have a test such as the one played early this morning Australian time, the antisiphoning laws require the network that has the rights to those broadcasts to offer them to all four of the free-to-air networks—to offer them, firstly, the full coverage and, secondly, I understand, a highlights package. Not one of our free-to-air networks picked it up. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation—
—They have no money.
—That great institution that is so solidly supported by Senator Bourne and particularly by members opposite, who take a great interest in all of the board appointments, of course, did not take up the offer, nor did the Ten, Seven or Nine networks. That process took place under Labor's legislation. The problem with the proposition Senator Faulkner puts, which is that we should follow former Minister Lee's proposal and run programming policy out of the minister's office, is that we have to ensure that the minister should decide what goes on free-to-air. In fact, this is the proposal for nationalisation of broadcasting. I think it is important because Minister Lee did it as soon pay TV came in.
Mr Acting Deputy President, I think I should go back through the Labor Party's policy problems with pay TV—they were the root cause of this. The antisiphoning laws and the introduction of pay TV into Australia were of course one of Labor's major policy disasters. In the minutes left to me in this debate I will look at a couple of those matters. The reason that Minister Lee had to come in and put pressure on the free-to-air networks was the disastrous communications 
 policy of the previous government. At the time it was introduced I think former Senator Bob Collins was in charge of it. We had the infamous cascading bids fiasco, you will remember, and then the antisiphoning fiasco. I do not think anyone could possibly have presumed that, for the foreseeable future in Australian broadcasting, the minister would be telling the national broadcasters and the other free-to-air broadcasters what they should be showing on TV every night. If Labor wanted to propose that as a policy then, of course, the minister would intervene and ensure that the free-to-air networks showed a whole range of different programs. But I do not think they honestly believe this. I think this is a cheap publicity stunt and it shows the policy agenda of Labor. That leads us to the disastrous broadcasting policy that was overseen particularly by Minister Collins.
But what do we see as the third way from Labor? We are not sure what the first or second ways from Labor are, they have not worked that out, but they have certainly indicated a third way. I think that over recent weeks in communications policy and native title policy, and even in constitutional reform policy, Labor have shown their credentials. I think they have discovered a third way. It is not a particularly clear-cut vision. It is not a clear-cut philosophy or even a strategy, but certainly in communications policy we see that the new half of the glimmer twins, Mr Stephen Smith, the member for Perth, who is their shadow spokesman in this area, has said that, on communications, their policy is, `We will have a review.' So, in relation to telecommunications policy, his policy is, `Let's have a review.'
In relation to native title, a crucial national issue that affects your state and my state in particular, Mr Acting Deputy President Chapman, during a heated debate Labor could not come up with any alternative policy on native title. The Western Australian Labor Party are still having enormous internal ructions trying to decide what their policy is. But what is Mr Beazley's policy? It is a bit like Mr Smith's. It is, `Let's have a round table, let's have a discussion, let's have a talk.' So on two crucial areas of national policy the Labor 
 Party's policy is, `Let us just have a committee or a discussion.' Just last week, when the preamble was presented to the Australian people by the Australian Prime Minister, what was Mr Kim Beazley's solution to that? What is the Labor policy on the preamble? It is, `Let's go and refer it to a committee.'
That is Labor's new third way: it is not to have a decision, not to have a policy, let's all go and have a powwow and a cup of tea and sit around a table. This takes me back to where I began. Here on the last day of March in 1999, and as we enter the new millennium, what do Labor talk about? Not any major national issues. They do not have any policies. Their only policy is to have a committee, a review or a round table. And they want to talk about cricket.

"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,1999-03-31,"—This debate raises some very important issues. The important issues that it raises are ownership and diversity of Australian broadcast media. That is what is behind this. Antihoarding and antisiphoning have long been the subject of extreme debate in this chamber. But let us face it: the antihoarding lists are not easy. They never have been. They are meant to be about the broadcast of important events but they contain only sport. For some, the adage `too much sport is barely enough' might be true—thanks to Rampaging Roy Slaven and HG Nelson—but for others of us too much sport is simply too much sport. And I am a cricket fan. So I am not going to spend too much time talking about cricket, because the issue is really wider than that.
This debate is really a debate about vertical integration inside broadcasting in Australia. It is really a debate about the concentration of media ownership in this country which allows the one commercial free-to-air operator, because of its economic strength, to buy up almost anything it wants. Of course, this is the result of the free market that is so valued by so many economists and their acolytes. The free market determines the cost of programs and therefore determines the ability of broadcasters to purchase those programs. The end result is that one broadcaster is able to purchase most of the valued sports programs 
 across all the codes: rugby, football, league, cricket and tennis. The list goes on.
The strength of the market share of one network creates an almost insurmountable barrier to others gaining access to that product, in this case to the Australia-West Indies test cricket series. The absence of other purchasers means that one commercial network is able to hoard a product until they decide it is not in their interests to broadcast the series. Under negotiation with other broadcast service providers, the right to broadcast the product is sold elsewhere. In this case it was sold to the pay TV operator Foxtel, who I might add were offered the rights to the series by the West Indian Cricket Board after the free-to-air broadcasters turned them down. So approximately two and a half million people have been watching the series, in their homes and in clubs. Of course, that is better than none.
Pay TV does have the capacity to deliver a product to an audience in instances where the commercial free-to-air operator no longer believes it to be in their commercial interests to do so. But we also need to ask whether this motion would have been raised had the results not been as close and as exciting as they were. Senator Woodley told me just today that he stopped eating his toast this morning in order not to miss one second of the final moments of the cricket test. He heard it on the radio. The problem was that he was not able to see it on free-to-air television. That is a problem, and it has been a problem for millions of Australians who do not have pay TV, who only have free-to-air television. What the Australian broadcasting sector needs is genuine diversity of voice and the proper cross-media rules to achieve that diversity. We need to ensure that as many media voices as possible are heard, that media outlets are owned by different people across different markets and that those different markets are able to deliver diverse content.
That brings me to the minister's real and enduring failure. Senator Ian Campbell mentioned the ABC. We are talking about diversity of content and diversity of ownership at a time when the minister is doing everything he can to nobble, to cripple, to decimate and to 
 destroy the ABC. The ABC is Australia's real provider of broadcasting diversity. The ABC broadcasts content free from commercial pressure and in so doing is able to deliver content which appeals to a wide cross-section of the community, including sports fans and, interestingly, sports fans who are interested in women's sport and in different codes. The minister's failure is in carrying out an ideologically driven vendetta against the ABC. Starving the ABC of its funds means that the ABC cannot afford to purchase the rights to a whole spectrum of content, including sport, and especially cannot afford to produce its own content. This is a voice for Australians within Australia, no matter where they reside, no matter what their level of income, no matter what their program interests, their ethnic or their cultural background.
In rural communities it is the ABC which provides diversity, it is the ABC which provides local content, it is the ABC which provides a broadcasting service that the metropolitan commercial free-to-air broadcasters continue to believe is not commercially viable. I might add that it was ABC Radio that provided commentary for that test match this morning. Ironically, it is also the pay TV industry which is making inroads into rural communities to provide the content and programming diversity missing in these communities. The level of Australian content remains a sticking point, but at least there is some level of service provided to our country cousins.
If the ABC were properly funded, it would be able to purchase these programs hoarded by its commercial counterparts and even those programs that the commercial counterparts do not want to buy, such as the Australia-West Indies cricket. But the government steadfastly refuses to provide the ABC with adequate recurrent funding, let alone the funding it is going to require to convert to digital technology. I have no doubt that in the short term the ABC must suffer because of this and every one of us will suffer because of this. We see in today's newspaper an article in relation to the ABC's television production capacity being relocated to Melbourne. This has everything to do with the government forcing 
 the ABC to sell its real estate holdings, despite advice from independent auditors Arthur Andersen that it is against the public broadcaster's interest to sell real estate to fund its digital conversion. We should be clear on this: the sale of real estate will not be able to be used for production purposes. The minister's short-sightedness and arrogant refusal to take any of the ABC's or Arthur Andersen's advice on the dire consequences of selling real estate will force the ABC to be nothing more in the end than a news service. But I do not think this minister would be any the happier even with that outcome.
At this most crucial time in the history of this region, the minister continues to refuse to reopen the Cox Peninsula for Radio Australia news broadcasts. Several community groups have pleaded with the minister to reopen the Cox Peninsula transmission facility because independent news broadcasts delivered in shortwave are so important to them. The East Timorese, Malaysian, Burmese and Vietnamese communities all want the ABC's Radio Australia shortwave broadcasts restored, but the minister still refuses to listen.
In Europe, the crisis in Kosovo is being filmed and reported by Australians employed by the ABC. I cannot help but notice the difference in broadcasts from other networks who do not have people on the ground there. Relying on overseas broadcasts is simply not good enough; it is just not the same. Despite globalisation, we still require news and current affairs reports to be broadcast into our lounge rooms by our own voices—voices who know and understand how these important issues affect our own communities within Australia. I am sure that the Productivity Commission will take these issues into consideration in its current review and I look forward to the results of that.
In Australia, we need a broadcasting sector which offers a diversity of views delivered by as many different voices as possible. As enjoyable as sport may be, cricket is not an issue of national importance. We are more interested in the crisis in Kosovo, despite what some people think, but only the ABC has proven that it is able to deliver what the community really wants, our own voice—and 
 of course it was ABC Radio who brought us the cricket.
In closing, I would just like to call on the minister to: (a) fund the ABC correctly—I do not think that will happen; (b) fund the ABC to convert to digital television—I do not think that will happen either; and (c) reopen the Cox Peninsula facilities. Maybe that might happen—I live in hope of that.
—And (d) resign.
—And (d) resign. That is charming. Thank you, Senator. I also wish to remind him that the broadcasting sector will only remain viable as long as diversity of ownership and plurality of content remain the key policy outcomes. At the moment, they are nowhere near it.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>West Indies Cricket Test Series: Televising</title>,Matters of Public Importance,24,1,speech
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,1999-03-31,"—When this matter was in this chamber four years ago, Senator Ian Campbell did not complain then that it had been raised, and all 30 votes from the coalition that were used to carry that motion four years ago are still here in the coalition benches. But under the metamorphosis that we have seen they have all become mute. Political amnesia has settled on that side opposite. Who was the big mouth of 1995? It was not Senator Tierney—he may have been sincere about it—it was Senator Alston, and where is he today? He has sent the nightwatchman into bat for him. Now he has the bunny waiting to come into the order while he hides in the pavilion of the ministerial office. He does not want any Labor speakers to follow him and criticise him, because only yesterday, at question time, he said people do not front up. Where is he today? Surely he has not become the modern day jib of the Senate. Senator Alston made a lot of big statements back in 1995.
The absolute indolence of this minister is just breathtaking to me. His pompous assertions will come back to haunt him. In 1995 he demanded that the Labor minister for communications intervene, no excuses accepted. It did not matter what the law said or what any of the proprietors said; it was Michael Lee's responsibility—and Michael Lee intervened and we all got to see the cricket. We all got to see it live; we got to see it absolutely direct. But the fact is that Senator Alston 
 carries no weight with the networks, media proprietors or the ABC. If they want action, they go directly to the Prime Minister in the full knowledge that Senator Alston will roll over on any demands they put to the Prime Minister. It is a pity that Senator Alston cannot use his well-known skills of abuse, sarcasm and hyperbole for the good of cricket fans rather than just to bolster his fragile ego in this particular chamber. Surely the skills he learned as the bovver boy of the magistrates court could be put into trying to convince the networks to bring cricket into this country.
Senator Bourne said this is not an important issue. The ABC and all these things are there for everyone, not just for the buffs of this and that. I remind you, Senator Bourne, the highest rating television show between 6.00 and 6.30 was the Adelaide Test—Channel 9 cancelled the news that night—with 42½ per cent ratings. The ABC would just dream about those sorts of ratings. They are the same sorts of ratings an AFL grand final gets. So it is an important issue.
Senator Bourne mentioned the ABC. The ABC has consistently given preference to its breakfast programs rather than the cricket—3½ hours were lost one day, and I am listening to some drivel about fishing or something else. I accept that those breakfast shows, for their long-term rating viability, may not need to be interrupted, so why don't we take it to the parliamentary network and put it on there, like they do with the AFL football? Then we could all listen to it. But to listen to the Canberra breakfast show saying, `Australia is three for 80' a day ago—when the West Indies were batting—drives one to absolute distraction.
Why won't the coalition come out on this thing? Why won't coalition backbenchers put pressure on in the party room or on the minister? Why are they so docile on these issues? It all goes back to the coalition's patronage system. They are terrified. They are too terrified to say anything. I have never seen a better form of democratic centralism than that which exists in the coalition, where decisions are made at the top and all the control goes down. This is the Ceaucescu syndrome! In the coalition party room, when 
 the Prime Minister is applauded don't be the first person to stop clapping. Never do that! Just keep the rounds of applause going, otherwise you will never get promoted. So we have a whole bunch of wimps opposite—cricket fanatics all, genuine cricket fanatics on that side; I have spoken to many of them but I will not name them; they love their cricket—but they do not have the internal fortitude, the courage, to get up and demand what they demanded four years ago.
We have often been accused of playing the politics of envy, but I will tell you who is envious at the moment, and that is those people who are not getting the direct coverage. The Prime Minister of Australia was asked the shortest question ever in question time in the House of Representatives today. He was asked: `Prime Minister, is Foxtel connected to Kirribilli House?' The Prime Minister answered, `Yes.' Then he sat down and said, `So what?' I will tell you so what, Mr Howard. Next Saturday morning when you get up and put on your slippers, and you have your honey and crumpets and your cup of tea, and you are watching the direct telecast from Antigua, most of the battlers that you purport to represent out in Penrith, Bayswater and Ipswich will be struggling to try to find a radio broadcast because they have gone over to some crackpot fishing show or some handyman program, and there is no cricket at all.
Mr Howard will be sitting in the comfort of Kirribilli House thinking—not about the peasants and the piccaninnies out there—`Gee, this coverage is terrific.' But he will be doing nothing to help his fellow Australians to watch it. That is the real politics of envy. That is using your position of wealth and power to get a more privileged position in society than the rest of the Australian community, and that is to be condemned. It is one of the reasons why I fought so often in cabinet about what I saw as the future iniquities of pay television—that in fact it would create two classes of viewers in this country. I regret some of the decisions made then, but I note that this government has brought forward no legislation to change any of the rules that were established then.
We have a situation where there is no free-to-air coverage, not even a highlights package. We have an ABC coverage that sometimes cuts out 3½ hours before play ends.
—It cuts out at 1.18 a.m.
—And the transmission, as Senator Faulkner says, when we are listening at 1.18 a.m. suddenly cuts out for half an hour or so. This is absolutely pathetic. If this had just occurred in a vacuum, we still would have been critical of the government but it occurs against a background where senators Tierney, Ferguson, Crane and Alston made such a fuss about it in 1995 and demanded that we do something about it. Well, they did demand, and we did deliver. We now demand: you deliver. Otherwise, I think we should all move to Kirribilli next weekend. Where is the invitation, Mr Howard? Get the crumpets and the tea ready. We would like to watch the cricket. This is not a personal or a selfish point of view. We would like all Australians to have the opportunity to watch the cricket from Antigua next week, but this government will not do so. Senator Alston could not deliver a pizza. That is the reality of it.
Let me end on a positive note. One good thing has come out of the coverage of the West Indies tour, and it has occurred in this test match alone. For the first time, I have heard a female doing the cricket broadcast, and that is Donna Simmons. I have rarely heard a better commentator of cricket than Donna. She is lucid, entertaining and accurate. Most people know that the great art in listening to cricket is to be able to visualise the game in your head. She has been absolutely superb. I think that is something that should be encouraged into the future.
Congratulations are due to the West Indian broadcasters that have used her and the fact that the ABC has picked up the broadcast. Donna Simmons has given much to cricket lovers in this country. What a pity we cannot listen to the radio and watch television at the same time. We cannot do it because this government has failed miserably to deliver. So enjoy your weekend, John Howard. Enjoy watching the test cricket from Antigua. We all know that you really could not care less about 
 all of the poor battlers out there who will have no opportunity to join in and enjoy what will be one of the greatest cricket telecasts in history.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>West Indies Cricket Test Series: Televising</title>,Matters of Public Importance,24,1,speech
"Tierney, Sen John",LP,1999-03-31,"—I see the opposition is continuing its time-honoured tradition over the last three years of staying totally off the main game.
—You spoke in the same debate, you goose.
—I know I did. Of course I spoke in the same debate, and I'm going to quote from that, Senator Ray, to point out exactly where you are wrong. We had Michael Lee, the Rip Van Winkle of communications policy, totally mucking up the West Indies test coverage at that stage.
—Where is your gutless wonder?
—Where is who?
—Where is your gutless wonder?
—Where is Alston?
—Your gutless wonder. He is on the list.
—Senator Alston is the minister and, as is usual practice, the minister will take up the final statements on this matter and put into place the nonsense that you have come up with.
—What a wimp!
—Order! Senator Faulkner.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I think the interjection of `gutless wonder' is unparliamentary.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on the point of order: Senator Herron, where were you yesterday when Senator Alston tried to dish it out to some of us, saying that we never turned up et cetera? We are here; where is he?
—Senator Ray, I think the interjection was inappropriate— 
—It was made by me.
—It was made by both of us.
—Okay, both of you.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on the point of order: if that was a point of order, it is almost unprecedented that a minister would be such a wimp that he could not come into the chamber to defend himself. I do not think `gutless' or `wonder' or `gutless wonder' is unparliamentary. I make the point that Senator Alston is on the speakers list to speak for 10 minutes in this debate and he has wimped it.
—Senator Faulkner, there is no point of order. But I would ask senators to conduct this debate in a sensible manner and not in the untoward manner that we have seen thus far with excessive interjections. There is a place for interjections, but I believe that we have had excessive interjections in this debate.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I thought you invited me to withdraw. If you have ruled that way, I do so.
—Thank you, Senator Ray.
—I do not understand why you are getting so excited about this issue, particularly when you are totally wrong on the issue. I will point out where you are wrong in a minute. When I walked in on this debate initially, Senator Bourne was on her feet talking about various things in the ABC, so I asked the whip, `Have I walked into the wrong debate?' We were into a whole range of things about the ABC. I did not hear anything about antisiphoning. I did not hear anything about the cricket during that time. If I recall, Senator Bourne said she was not particularly interested in the issue, so I wonder why she got involved in the debate in the first place.
But let us go back in history to what Senator Ray was referring to in 1995 and the antisiphoning debate at that time. We had Michael Lee as the minister for communications, the Rip Van Winkle of communications 
 policy, who actually put us behind several years in communications—
—I think that Rip Van Winkle probably in the real definition is also withdrawable, seeing we are having such a decorous debate today. I would not object to it normally, and certainly if it were applied to me I would not object at all.
—Senator Tierney, would you withdraw the reference to the former minister in those terms?
—I withdraw and substitute that he was asleep at the wheel on communications policy, which put us behind years. It came out very well—
—He got us the cricket.
—No, he did not, Senator.
—He got us the cricket.
—Let me quote from the Hansard . Your history is not very good.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—We get the truth now, so obviously you do not want to hear it. Let me tell you the circumstances where it came in at the time of the antisiphoning laws which he was supposed to be overseeing but he was asleep at the wheel. I will quote from the Hansard  of 2 March 1995. When we had this new dynamic market operating with pay TV and, because our minister at the time, Michael Lee, had not set up the antisiphoning regulations on time—Senator Faulkner and Senator Ray, you are not paying attention to what happened—Galaxy shot off with no regulatory regime in place.
Senator Faulkner interjecting—
—What happened, Senator Faulkner, was that Galaxy bought up the rights before Michael Lee put in the antisiphoning rules.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! Opposition senators were heard in relative silence. I would ask that they extend the same courtesy to government senators. Senator Tierney.
—Now that the rabble opposite have ceased, I will go through the story again. We had a regulatory regime on antisiphoning that was supposed to be put in place, but of course Michael Lee was too slow off the mark as usual and Galaxy had gone out and actually bought the rights to the pay TV for the West Indies test before the minister had the antisiphoning rules in place. That is why, Senator Faulkner, it did not go on to free to air: because your minister mucked it up at the time. I see that the rabble have now left—and rightly so—and they have missed the main point—
—I raise a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President. I put it to you that that language is totally unparliamentary and Senator Tierney should be asked to withdraw it.
—Any person listening to the broadcast would understand that that was a rabble.
—Senator Tierney, I ask you to withdraw.
—Let me return to the point that is so embarrassing the opposition at this time with respect to what they mucked up in 1995. The antisiphoning laws were not in place; therefore it was able to be put on Galaxy; therefore it did not go through to free to air. But finally Michael Lee got his act together. He got his legislation in place, and that is the legislation we are acting under at the moment. So the opposition have a hide to criticise us on that when they were the ones who brought in this legislation.
And what does the legislation require people to do? First of all, it has to be offered to free to air. Under your legislation, the rules are that it has to be offered to free to air first and, if they do not want it, it then goes to places like the pay TV operators—Foxtel and the others. That is what happened with this test: because free to air did not take it up, pay TV took it up.
That is the problem with your motion today. You do not realise why this situation has come about. You are saying the minister should intervene, but there is no role for the minister to intervene in this because of the 
 way you set it up under your legislation. What are you suggesting the minister should do? Should the minister intervene every time something goes wrong on television and start redirecting particular programs? Are you seriously suggesting that the minister take that sort of role in a private enterprise system? What are you therefore implying? That we should be nationalising broadcasting? Perhaps you would like to see more of Lost in Space, Who's the Boss?, Get Smart, Twilight Zone perhaps, Mission Impossible, Back to the Future. That is the attitude of this opposition. I am absolutely amazed, when there are so many important issues in federal politics, that they bring up something like this when they are totally off the track. It is your original legislation. You did not put it in place properly. It is now operating. The minister is acting according to that legislation. The minister will take up more of these issues when he is speaking towards the end of the debate. I hope he was listening to the earlier comments. I do not quite know what Senator Faulkner and Senator Ray had for lunch, but to carry on in the way they did here earlier today is a total disgrace on an issue like this about which they really do not have a leg to stand on.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>West Indies Cricket Test Series: Televising</title>,Matters of Public Importance,24,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1999-03-31,"—The only reason I have come into the chamber is to highlight the total ignorance of the Leader of the Opposition on this issue. Although I have not had a chance to hear what Senators Ray and Faulkner might have had to say, I doubt that they are much more enlightened than their current leader. For example, on the Neil Mitchell program recently on 3AW, Mr Beazley said:
When we put in place the anti-siphoning laws our anticipation was that for Tests like this you would get a sufficient ability for the Minister to basically oblige its carriage of on free-to-air television.
When there was a discussion in the parliament in 1994 about what is called the anti-hoarding approach, Labor was bemoaning the fact that carriers could acquire rights and then not utilise them. Indeed, you may remember that Michael Lee went and threatened Channel 10 with an investigation under control laws unless they agreed to carry the West Indies 
 television: in other words, he blackmailed them—
—You are a doormat for anybody.
—Vermin like you do not have a right to comment—
—Order, Minister! I ask the minister to withdraw that comment.
—I will withdraw it.
—Thank you, Minister. Senator Bolkus, that does not help.
—The fact is that in 1994 what Mr Lee had to say was this:
No-one should be surprised by this list—
the antisiphoning list—
because as far back as 1991 the then Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Beazley, made the following statement: `Strict siphoning rules would ensure that important programs, including national and international sporting and cultural events, will continue to be available on free-to-air.'
In other words, the current anti-siphoning rules were put in place by none other than the Leader of the Opposition, who now has no idea what they were, because he said:
Now something seems to have slipped on the way to the Forum, and this is now the average Australian cricket lover has been basically, is being deprived . . .
In other words, Mr Beazley thinks at all times the minister had the power to direct, which is of course elevating him to being minister for propaganda.
It is an appalling proposition. In other words, it is forcing commercial networks to broadcast material which they judge not to be commercially affordable and which may indeed not be attracting any significant degree of support in the wider community, simply because the minister himself wants to see it or else because he gets a few private representations. That is the ultimate in intervention in the marketplace.
If the Labor Party seriously advances that proposition, we have a huge policy divide between us. You get up and complain whenever anyone says anything about the ABC; you say that it is illegal to intervene and how 
 preposterous it is that we might even comment on programming, let alone make suggestions about it. Then, in the same breath, you have the Leader of the Opposition saying that the anti-siphoning laws were designed to give the minister the ability to basically oblige programs to be broadcast on free-to-air television.
The ignorance of the Leader of the Opposition, the then minister who introduced this regime, is breathtaking. Does he believe that, or doesn't he? If he doesn't, he ought to apologise, recant and say that Labor policy is still as it was when these rules were introduced. Or, if he has made a fundamental policy change which you all support him on, then there is, as I say, a huge policy gulf between us. We are in favour of the current antisiphoning rules which require programs on the list to be firstly offered to the free-to-air networks. If they choose not to take up the offer, the material can then be made available to pay television and, indeed, can be delisted.
—What a pathetic performance. You are pathetic!
—Please continue, Minister.
—Oh! I thought you were appalled by Senator Bolkus's contribution—the usual sledging out of the side of the mouth. But nothing would surprise me about Senator Bolkus: they do not come any lower than him.
—I raise a point of order. I did not say anything out of the side of my mouth. I said to Senator Alston that this is a most pathetic performance from a pathetic minister. There is no heart and no defence for himself at all. I resent the fact that he says that I slipped it out of the side of my mouth. It was full frontal.
—There is no point of order.
—It is rather tragic that the case that has been made here is that the Leader of the Opposition simply does not know what laws he put in place back in 1991, or else he has made a fundamental policy change. Senator Bolkus does not even seem to want to address that issue, because there is 
 no answer to it. Either the Leader of the Opposition says that he fundamentally misunderstands the current legislation or he is foreshadowing that the Labor Party, when in government, would give themselves the power to direct the commercial networks to run programs that the minister thought they should run. That is what he says. He says, `We thought that you would basically get a sufficient ability for the minister to oblige carriage on free-to-air television.' That is a huge call. I would be very surprised if Senator Bishop thought that that was the way to go, and I would be very surprised if the shadow minister thinks that is the way to go. There is a big opportunity here for them to spell out whether they now support this fundamental change of policy or whether the reality is that poor old Mr Beazley did not know what he was talking about.
The fact is—and I do not know whether others have covered this ground—that all free-to-air broadcasters were given a reasonable opportunity to acquire live rights to televise the current test cricket series between Australia and the West Indies. In other words, we did precisely what your legislation required. The rights were offered to the broadcasters at the cost incurred by News Limited in acquiring those rights. The broadcasters declined the offer and the offer of a highlights package.
We are of course disappointed—and I am particularly, as a cricket lover—but the fact is that there are something like 700,000 subscribers to Foxtel and Austar who can receive live coverage as a result of the decision that we took to delist the event. In other words, we did not condone what Labor used to condone—the hoarding and non-utilisation of the rights. There have been a number of instances when it has become clear that the free-to-air networks were not going to carry it. They were offered it and they refused. We have then moved very quickly and in sufficient time ahead of the event to delist it and enable pay television to run it without it being simultaneously covered on free-to-air.
That is the sort of outcome you envisaged with your legislation. It was never suggested back in 1991 that there should be a ministerial power of intervention. If that is 
 your current position, if you have fundamentally changed your policy, simply clarify it for us and we will know where the battle lines are drawn.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>West Indies Cricket Test Series: Televising</title>,Matters of Public Importance,24,1,speech

"O'Chee, Sen Bill",NP,1999-03-31,"—There are many matters that concern the public about accountability, and quite rightly so. One of the matters which vexes the minds of people is of course whether public companies should be privatised. One of the issues that arises out of that is when people say, `If you privatise them, you lose the accountability to the parliament and you lose 
 the accountability to the people.' Various people in this chamber take different views about that. But what is very clear is that, when a corporation is in majority public ownership or wholly in public ownership, it is the taxpayers' money that is being used to run that organisation. When that organisation wastes the money, it is the taxpayers' money which is being wasted.
What concerns me greatly is a series of reports recently that suggest that the Commonwealth Bank, when it was in majority public ownership, wrote off or made provision for some $4½ million which was owed by a company connected with the former Prime Minister, the Prime Minister at that time. This is of concern because there are many people in this country who have been bankrupted by the Commonwealth Bank for substantially less than $4½ million. They did not have their loans written off, they did not have the benefit of any favourable treatment at all; they were bankrupted. Yet the Commonwealth Bank, it is suggested, wrote off an amount of $4½ million, or made provision for that loss, against loans made to companies associated with the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating.
If that is correct, it means that those companies have in fact benefited to the tune of $4½ million out of the taxpayers' purse. That is unacceptable and should be investigated not as a matter of a vendetta against the former Prime Minister but as a matter of accountability for $4½ million that came out of an institution which was in majority ownership by the public. I would suspect that every single person who has been bankrupted by the Commonwealth Bank in the last few years would take exactly the same view. Every reasonable person would say that that is appropriate for investigation, particularly when people are frequently tried for offences of appropriating public money of substantially less amounts.
Senator Brown would know that many people are sued by the Commonwealth, tried in courts, because it is alleged they have defrauded the Commonwealth of social security amounts that are substantially less. Yet here is an allegation that some $4½ 
 million or more was written off. On top of that, there was an allegation made in the Sydney Morning Herald on Saturday that, in addition to this, Mr Keating or companies associated with him received the benefit of an interest-free loan for a period of six years in the amount of some $4.7 million. That too is frightening. The annual interest bill on that would be the price of a family home in my state, yet this interest could be written off by an entity which was at that time in majority public ownership. This is wrong. It is wrong that it should happen and that there is no investigation.
The reason I raise these matters today is that I am informed that, as of last week, there were staffing changes in the credit, policy and recovery sections of the Commonwealth Bank. It is my understanding that senior people in those sections of the bank have been replaced, moved sideways, relieved of their posts or whatever it is. It seems passing strange that this should happen at the same time as these allegations are raised. Let me put on the record that if there is to be an investigation—and I believe there should be one because it is the public's money that is at stake—I would hope that these changes in the staffing arrangements are not merely to find some convenient scapegoats down the track or to remove people who might be able to give information on exactly what happened.
I do not know what the line delegations are in the Commonwealth Bank in terms of write-off. But I would suggest that writing off an amount of $4½ million or more would require the approval of more than just somebody in the credit, policy or recovery sections of the Commonwealth Bank. It is my belief that to write off an amount of that much money it would be necessary for the matter to have been reviewed by the bank's credit committee, if not by the board of the bank itself.
So I want to put on the record tonight that, if there is to be an investigation, I would hope that this would not be something that was done to stymie the investigation of why those decisions were made. Similarly, it is very peculiar, almost unheard of, for banks to give people interest-free loans for a period of six years. Again, we ought to ask who in this 
 publicly controlled bank made those decisions. Did it go to the board, did it go to the credit committee of the bank or was it merely dealt with internally? These are matters that do need to be answered. They need to be answered because the taxpayers need to be assured that their money was not wasted. They need to be answered because there are many people out there who have lost everything—have had litigation over a period of years, have lost their houses, their businesses, their cars and their personal possessions because they owed a lot less.
It is entirely inappropriate for people in the other place to say that this is all just some horrible vendetta against the former Prime Minister—it is not. If this were some vendetta against the former Prime Minister, I think it would have taken a completely different complexion. This is a serious issue of public accountability, and no amount of huffing, puffing and arguments by the previous Prime Minister that Kerry Packer did not like him because he did not agree to the takeover of Fairfax will hide the fact that there are serious questions which need to be answered. None of that huffing and puffing will hide the fact that many of the things the former Prime Minister said to this parliament about his business dealings proved to be wildly and grossly inaccurate, to say the very least.
I do not wish to prejudge the matter. But I do wish to place it strongly on the record on behalf of the thousands and thousands of people who have had dealings with the Commonwealth Bank substantially less amiable than these that they want the matter investigated because that is the only fair thing to do and that is the only fair thing to do on behalf of the Australian taxpayers as well.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Commonwealth Bank: Debt Write-Offs</title>,Adjournment,38,1,speech
